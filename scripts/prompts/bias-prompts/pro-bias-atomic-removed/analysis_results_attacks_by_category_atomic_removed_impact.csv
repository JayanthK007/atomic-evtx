Modify VSS Service Permissions,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, here's a detailed analysis of potentially suspicious or malicious activities observed:

### Security Log
1. **Event ID 4634**: Logoff event for user `admin_test` with LogonType 3, indicating a network connection. This could be typical but needs context to evaluate further if normal.
   
2. **Event ID 4672**: Multiple Special privileges were given to `admin_test`, such as `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`. These privileges can be indicative of malicious activity if they weren't authorized or expected. This event seems unusual, as elevated privileges like these are not typically granted to standard administrative activities.

3. **Event ID 4624**: A successful logon event for `admin_test` from workstation `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P` using NTLM authentication might be legitimate but should be scrutinized for periodic patterns indicating potential credential dumps or brute force attacks.

### Sysmon Log
1. **Event ID 1 (Process Creation)**:
   - Execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by `admin_test` isn't typically suspicious on its own; however, repeated invocation during the same timeframe suggests the potential for manipulation or tampering with event logs.
   - Execution of `whoami.exe`, indicative of a user or script checking the currently logged-in account details. While legitimate in certain contexts, repeated or unexplained executions might indicate suspicious activity.
   - The use of `cmd.exe` by `admin_test` to execute commands targeting services (`sc sdset VSS...`) can be indicative of privilege escalation attempts or persistence mechanisms if not properly explained.

2. **Command Executions using `cmd.exe`**:
   - The command altering permissions for `VSS` service (`sc sdset VSS...`) requires attention. Modifying service permissions is a known tactic for privilege escalation.

3. **Event ID 1 and 5 for Microsoft Edge Updates**:
   - Multiple executions and process creations related to Microsoft Edge Update don't appear inherently malicious. This could be a routine browser update process running as `NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM`.

### System Log
- **Event ID 1 & 24**: The system time was adjusted backwards and then forward in a short period. This might be linked to normal time sync operations but is worthy of attention if found within the context of other suspicious activities.

### Application Log
- Observations of EdgeUpdate services being stopped might be aligned with the update process observed in the Sysmon logs.

### Assessment
Based on the logs, the most notable concerns relate to the modification of service permissions, and the granting of high-level user privileges which are often associated with persistence and lateral movement tactics seen in attacker methodologies. Time changes align with time routine synchronization but need revisiting if seen combined with other suspicious artifacts.

### Resolution
**SUSPICIOUS** - The logs display activities such as unauthorized privilege assignments and command usage for potential service manipulation requiring further investigation for confirmation of legitimacy. 

### Guidance
1. Investigate recent user activities associated with `admin_test`, particularly focusing on tasks executed during the timeframes in the logs.
2. Review network connections from `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P` to ensure they align with expected behavior and user patterns.
3. Validate if the `sc sdset VSS` command and resulting behavior were intended or authorized by IT operations or software routines.
4. Conduct a system-wide review for any additional unauthorized privilege assignments or file modifications.

It is crucial to integrate these findings with user behavior analytics and investigate any additional alerts triggered around the given timeframe on the CEO's machine or associated hosts."
Disable System Restore Through Registry,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, several elements standout which require careful attention:

1. **Registry Modification via Command Line**:
   - The Sysmon logs indicate that `cmd.exe` was used to execute lengthy `reg add` commands. The commands were aimed at disabling system restore features:
     ```
     ""cmd.exe"" /c reg add ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows NT\SystemRestore"" /v ""DisableConfig"" /t ""REG_DWORD"" /d ""1"" /f & reg add ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows NT\SystemRestore"" /v ""DisableSR"" /t ""REG_DWORD"" /d ""1"" /f & reg add ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\SystemRestore"" /v ""DisableConfig"" /t ""REG_DWORD"" /d ""1"" /f & reg add ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\SystemRestore"" /v ""DisableSR"" /t ""REG_DWORD"" /d ""1"" /f
     ```
   - These actions are suspicious as they aim at disabling system recovery options. Such actions are often observed in malicious scenarios where an attacker tries to prevent a system from recovering to a previous state where it wasn't compromised.

2. **Process Execution**:
   - Multiple executions of legitimate Windows binaries like `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `reg.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` are noted. While these processes are legal, their collective presence within a close timeframe, paired with registry changes, could indicate an attempt of unauthorized administrative activity or even payload execution using living-off-the-land binaries (LoLBins).

3. **Microsoft Edge Update Execution**:
   - Multiple `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes were executed. While not inherently malicious as this could be part of the software update mechanism, the timing and repeated executions warrant further scrutiny, especially since some entries involve paths within temporary directories which could be suspicious if not aligned with known update processes.

4. **Unusual Timing and Lack of Context**:
   - Logs of service stops shown with `edgeupdate` may also raise concerns, though they likely correspond to service management operations.

### Assessment

Given the analysis, the combination of registry modifications, execution of administrative commands, and the presence of legitimate binaries used in close succession:

- The behavior does not unequivocally indicate a known malicious signature but leans heavily towards suspicious due to registry key modifications aimed at disabling security features.

### Resolution

**SUSPICIOUS** - The analyzed logs show significant suspicious activity due to the timing of commands and registry changes without clear justification. It’s necessary to conduct a deeper investigation:
  
- **Steps Forward**:
  - Review system and security logs for any authentication anomalies or login attempts.
  - Perform an integrity check of the affected host to look out for unauthorized changes.
  - Validate with IT if the registry changes were part of an administrative task or scheduled update.
  - Check with network monitoring for any unusual data exfiltration attempts around the time of these logs.
  - Isolate the host if no legitimate context explains the actions to prevent possible further compromise.

Given environments differ, evaluating and correlating this data with known systems behavior or endpoint management activities is crucial."
Windows - Delete Volume Shadow Copies via WMI,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs focusing on Sysmon and Application logs, the following significant points were identified:

1. **Usage of Volume Shadow Copy Service (`vssadmin.exe`):**
   - The command `vssadmin.exe list shadows` was executed by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. The `vssadmin` tool is used to manage volume shadow copies and is often seen in both legitimate administrative tasks and ransomware attacks where shadow copies are deleted to prevent recovery.
   - Further analysis noted subsequent execution of `cmd.exe` with `wmic.exe shadowcopy delete`, which deletes shadow copies. This is a common tactic used by adversaries to hinder recovery efforts after malicious activities such as infections.

2. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity:**
   - Multiple entries concerning `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` indicate typical update operations by the Microsoft Edge browser. The consistent pattern aligns with regular software update checks and installations. There is no immediate indication that this process was used maliciously in this context.

3. **Command Execution Context:**
   - The use of `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `conhost.exe` were observed in the logs. These are generally benign and consistent with legitimate environment checks or system operations.

4. **Integrity Level and Process Ownership:**
   - The process executions were performed under a high integrity level by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. The `IntegrityLevel` of 'High' suggests that the operations were performed with elevated privileges.

### Assessment:

- The `vssadmin.exe` and `wmic shadowcopy delete` usage are red flags. They indicate an attempt (or preparation) to delete volume shadow copies, which is a known precursor in ransomware activity to prevent recovery of data.
- Although the `EdgeUpdate` processes are common for regular update tasks, considering the context of these logs and the focus on suspicious behavior, they still need a closer look within this time frame for any unusual patterns due to their frequent occurrence.

### Threat/Risk:
- The attempt to list and potentially delete volume shadow copies suggests possible malicious intent related to data destruction or ransomware activity. While this action alone does not confirm an attack, it strongly indicates potentially malicious preparation activities.

### Guidance:
- **Immediate Actions:**
  - Investigate the intent behind the usage of `vssadmin.exe` and `wmic.exe shadowcopy delete`.
  - Review the account activity for `SERVER002\\admin_test` to determine if this was part of a scheduled task or a legitimate administrative action. Confirm timing and authentication events in security logs.
  - Check for additional indicators of compromise such as files encrypted, unusual traffic patterns, or alerts from other security tools.

- **Further Investigation:**
  - Engage with the user or administrator involved if possible to gain context.
  - Enforce enhanced monitoring and review other endpoints for similar patterns, particularly involving shadow copy operations.

### Conclusion:
Based on the above findings, the overall resolution for this case can be classified as **MALICIOUS** due to the shadow copy deletion commands likely indicating preparation for data destruction. This warrants immediate attention and mitigation steps."
Windows - Disable the SR scheduled task,"## Log Analysis

### System Log:
- **Windows Update**: The log entry indicates an update for Microsoft Defender Antivirus. This is typical behavior for a system and is benign.
  
- **Kernel-General Events (EventID 24 & 1)**: These logs show time change events which were handled by `svchost.exe`. Time adjustments can occur naturally due to synchronization with time servers. SubjectUserSid = `LOCAL SERVICE` also indicates standard operations.

- **Time Service Event**: It confirms that the time source `time.windows.com` was used. This is a standard time synchronization event.

### Application Log:

- **EdgeUpdate Events**: Multiple instances of edgeupdate service stopping which could point to typical software update behavior but might need further correlation with other suspicious events.

### Sysmon Log:
- **Execution of wevtutil.exe and conhost.exe**: These processes are typically associated with event logging and console operations. The repetitive sequence might indicate scripting or automation, but running from the admin account could be standard if an admin was managing logs or services.

- **Execution of hostname.exe and whoami.exe**: These indicate system information retrieval actions occurring frequently which could be considered suspicious if not in the context of typical administrative tasks.
  
- **Execution of cmd.exe, schtasks.exe**: The command used is altering system restore task scheduling, which might indicate malicious intent to manipulate system recovery options. This is particularly concerning without clear administrative purpose.

- **Microsoft Edge Update Execution**: Several EdgeUpdate processes are running with NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM, suggesting an automated system update routine. This is generally benign unless other malicious indicators are present alongside.

### Security Log:
- **Time Change Events (EventID 4616)**: Mirror entries in the System log; standard for time synchronization activities.

### Windows PowerShell Log:
- No logs provided for analysis.

## Assessment:
- **Suspicious Behavior**:
  - The frequent use of `hostname`, `whoami`, and the command disabling the system restore task (`schtasks.exe`) are unusual operations that might suggest reconnaissance or persistence activities of malicious intent.
  - The administrative account `SERVER002\admin_test` is executing these operations, which could be investigated further for legitimacy.

- **Indicators of Malicious Activity**:
  - The command to disable a scheduled task related to system restore is a typical indicator of an attempt to hinder system recovery, which is a common tactic for malware.

## Conclusion:
The overall pattern, particularly the disabling of system restore tasks and multiple system queries executed under a specific user, shifts the situation towards a potential compromise. While many logs exhibit standard behavior (e.g., time sync, software update), some specific actions related to task scheduling and identity queries are concerning.

### Resolution: 
**SUSPICIOUS** - The logs contain activity that doesn't look right and warrants further investigation, specifically around the `schtasks.exe` execution and the administrative activities potentially linked to unauthorized access or configuration changes. Follow-up actions should include:
- Verifying the administrative tasks executed by `SERVER002\admin_test`.
- Checking for any unauthorized access or elevated privileges related to the said account.
- Ensuring system restore and other critical recovery options are correctly set up and not tampered with.
- Reviewing additional context from any possible correlating logs not provided, such as detailed PowerShell logs, to understand broader activities during this timeframe."
ESXi - Avoslocker enumerates VMs and forcefully kills VMs,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations and findings have been made:

1. **Process Execution:** There are several process creation events logged in the Sysmon data. Two key elements stand out:
   - Multiple executions of `C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe` with command-line arguments suggesting execution of a file through `plink.exe`. The command includes SSH access to a server at `file.local`, using `root` credentials and a password with a specific command script `esx_avoslocker_kill_vm.txt`.
   - This is highly unusual and serves as a potential indicator of malicious intent given that it incorporates the use of `plink.exe`, often associated with automated command and control operations when logged like this, and the manipulation of VMs (likely indicated by the script name).

2. **Privilege and Execution Context:**
   - The executions are performed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` with a high integrity level, indicating elevated privileges. This may pose a significant risk if the operations performed are malicious.
   - The sequences involving `PowerShell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `conhost.exe` indicate potentially suspicious use of utilities that can manipulate or exfiltrate data via scripting or log manipulation.

3. **PowerShell Usage:**
   - The appearance of `C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe` without detailed command-line arguments logged typically calls for further investigation to ensure no malicious scripts or payloads are being executed.

4. **Network and External Connections:**
   - The clear presence of `plink.exe` to engage in SSH activities combined with the naming of targeted scripts (e.g., `esx_avoslocker_kill_vm.txt`) is suggestive of targeted attacks or unauthorized administrative operations, specifically potentially targeting computing resources (like virtual machines in ESXi environments).

5. **Edge Updates:**
   - Events related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and associated files do not appear inherently suspicious, as these typically represent routine software updates. However, given their simultaneous appearance with suspicious activities, it is important to confirm their legitimacy.

**Assessment:**
- The activity observed is indicative of potentially serious malicious behavior. The critical element here is the usage of `plink.exe` for unexpected SSH activity aimed at a local file host with potentially sensitive actions being executed (indicated by script hints in `esx_avoslocker_kill_vm.txt`).

**Resolution:** **MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- **Immediate Isolation**: The affected machine should be isolated from the network to prevent further spread or damage.
- **User Access Review**: Review the access rights and recent activities of the `SERVER002\admin_test` account.
- **Comprehensive Threat Hunt**: Conduct a detailed threat hunt across systems to identify if any other hosts exhibit similar indicators of compromise.
- **Digital Forensics Analysis**: Engage in deeper forensic analysis to retrieve further details about executed commands and possible exfiltration of data.
- **Incident Response and Recovery Plan**: Initiate incident response protocols to investigate, contain, and eliminate the threat while preparing your recovery plan to restore operations securely.
- **Review Security Posture**: Post-incident, review security settings, particularly involving remote command tools such as `plink.exe`, to prevent unauthorized usage."
Replace Desktop Wallpaper,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several key points of interest need to be highlighted relating to the CEO's machine:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:
1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - There are multiple instances of PowerShell commands attempting to change the desktop wallpaper by downloading an image from the URL: `https://file.com/wp-content/uploads/file-file-Logo.png`.
   - The commands create a new file in the `$env:TEMP` directory and store the original wallpaper's location.
   - The PowerShell scripts involve the use of `SystemParametersInfo` from user32.dll to change the wallpaper, which could be seen as a benign action in some controlled environments like IT administrations but can be suspicious in the absence of user knowledge or consent.

2. **Process Creation Patterns**:
   - Several Sysmon events log processes related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, and other associated processes frequently executing within a short time frame. While this could indicate legitimate software updates, the frequency and context need to be further checked.

3. **Use of Compilers**:  
   - Executions involving `csc.exe` (C# compiler) and `cvtres.exe` are noticed. These processes are linked to compiling code within PowerShell, which could mean the scripts are transforming or generating new potentially malicious code on the fly.

### Potential Indicators of Malicious Activity:
- **Unusual PowerShell Execution**:
  - The script handled files and registry keys, which could indicate malicious scripts operating under the guise of seemingly benign activity (e.g., changing wallpapers).
  
- **Frequent Edge Update Processes**:
  - The logs show Edge Update-related processes executing consecutively, which is usually expected during an update scenario but could be used to mask malicious activity.

### Assessment and Recommendations:
- The activities recorded in the logs, especially the PowerShell script, indicate attempts at modifying system settings potentially without user consent. This could be part of a more subtle and strategic social engineering attack to maintain lower but more persistent access with minimal impact to avoid immediate detection.
- Frequent compiling tool activities intertwined with PowerShell execution suggest potential dynamic script execution, a possible hallmark of fileless malware attacks.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance:
- Conduct a thorough review of the PowerShell command history on the CEO's machine to determine if the executed script was intentional or known within the organizational IT operations scope.
- Verify if the URL used in the PowerShell script is reputable and authorized; if not, block the domain and check for any similar access across the network.
- Monitor for similar PowerShell activities organization-wide, recognizing patterns for similar behavior as a precaution against targeted attacks.
- Review security settings regarding trusted applications and execution policies of PowerShell scripts on the user’s machine and network-wide.
- If deemed unintentional or unauthorized, consider user training on recognizing social engineering and tailored security threats."
Remove Account From Domain Admin Group,"### Analysis of the Logs:

#### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:
1. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - A PowerShell script is executed with the intent to remove a user from the 'Domain Admins' group. The command used:
     ```powershell
     $PWord = ConvertTo-SecureString -String password -AsPlainText -Force
     $Credential = New-Object -TypeName System.Management.Automation.PSCredential -ArgumentList domain\super_user, $PWord
     if((Get-ADUser remove_user -Properties memberof).memberof -like ""CN=Domain Admins*""){
         Remove-ADGroupMember -Identity ""Domain Admins"" -Members remove_user -Credential $Credential -Confirm:$False
     } else {
         write-host ""Error - Make sure remove_user is in the domain admins group"" -foregroundcolor Red
     }
     ```
   - The use of **ConvertTo-SecureString** with `-AsPlainText -Force` is highly suspicious. This might indicate the use of a hardcoded or obfuscated password.

2. **High Integrity Level:**
   - The IntegrityLevel being 'High' indicates these processes are running with elevated privileges, which is necessary for removing a user from a critical group like 'Domain Admins'.

3. **wevtutil.exe Execution:**
   - The frequent use of `wevtutil.exe` could indicate attempts to clear or manipulate event logs, commonly used by attackers to cover their tracks.

4. **EdgeUpdate Executions:**
   - Multiple executions of Microsoft Edge Update processes under the NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM account appear normal due to automated updates but should be monitored for abuse. However, no direct malicious action is noted in these executions.

#### Potential Malicious Activity:
- The execution of a PowerShell script attempting to remove a user from the 'Domain Admins' group is suspicious. While it may be legitimate if conducted by an admin, it often indicates an insider threat or a compromised account.
  
#### Threats or Risks Identified:
- **Insider Threat:** An admin is attempting to modify the domain admins group, which can have significant security implications.
- **Account Compromise:** If the `admin_test` account is compromised, an attacker could escalate privileges or remove obstacles such as other admin accounts.
- **Tampering with Event Logs:** Clearing logs to hide actions, if confirmed, could indicate malicious intent.

### Assessment and Guidance:
- **Resolution - MALICIOUS:**
   - The intentional PowerShell script aiming to alter Active Directory groups, coupled with potential log tampering, suggests malicious behavior.
- **Immediate Actions:**
  - **Account Review:** Immediately review the activity and privileges associated with the `admin_test` account.
  - **PowerShell Logging:** Increase logging for PowerShell activity and implement script block logging if not done already.
  - **Event Log Monitoring:** Check for log tampering or anomalies indicating erasure or manipulation attempts, especially by `wevtutil.exe`.

  - **Security Tooling:** Use endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools to monitor similar suspicious behavior in real-time.

Further analysis and potential containment steps should be taken. Engage the incident response team to manage the situation carefully."
Delete User - Windows,"The Windows event logs provided contain various entries from the System, Application, Security, Sysmon, and Windows PowerShell logs. Based on the analysis of these logs, the following observations and conclusions can be drawn:

### Observations:

1. **System Log:**
   - Time-related changes have occurred (Event ID: 24 and 1), indicating the local time has been set backwards, and this adjustment was made by the `svchost.exe` process running as the LOCAL SERVICE. This might cause suspicion in certain contexts; however, it is common for this service to manage system time settings without indicating compromise.
   
2. **Security Log:**
   - Multiple account logons (Event ID: 4624) and administrative privilege usages (Event ID: 4672) by the user ""admin_test"".
   - Account creation and deletion for a user, `fileUser`, is logged (Event IDs: 4720, 4726), which indicates that an account was created and deleted within a short period.
   - Specific high-privilege rights were assigned to ""admin_test"". There are certain privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege` that should be scrutinized as they can be used for malicious purposes.
   
3. **Sysmon Log:**
   - Commands related to user account modification operations were executed through command-line operations (e.g., using `net` and `cmd.exe` processes). The command line `/c net user fileUser User2DeletePW! /add & net.exe user fileUser /delete` shows suspicious activity as it adds and then deletes a user account shortly afterward.
   - Several process monitoring events showing the execution of system utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe` under the ""admin_test"" account context.

4. **Windows PowerShell log:**
   - No entries are present, suggesting that no PowerShell commands were executed or logged during this period.

### Analysis and Conclusion:

The logs showcase some behavior that warrants further investigation:

- The `admin_test` account exhibits suspicious activity by creating and then deleting a user account quickly. This could suggest an attempt to perform actions with this account, which then covers tracks by deletion.
- The execution of SYSMON monitored commands like using `cmd.exe` to manage user accounts is typically a legitimate operation but, in this context, carried out in a short time frame raises suspicion.
- The privileges assigned to the ""admin_test,"" including `SeDebugPrivilege`, requires targeted scrutiny, considering it may facilitate malicious activities.

### Final Assessment:

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
  - Although there is no directly conclusive evidence pointing to definite malicious activity, the rapid account creation/deletion and privilege usage by ""admin_test"", coupled with typical system processes, suggest anomalous behavior that requires further detailed investigation. Steps should include verifying the intent and context of account actions, scanning for related network activity or unauthorized access attempts, and validating other recent changes or indicators of compromise on the endpoint.

### Actionable Steps:

1. **Investigate the Intent and Context:**
   - Validate the purpose behind the rapid account modifications by verifying with the user or administrators involved.
   
2. **Review Network Activity:**
   - Analyze network logs around this timeframe to identify any data exfiltration attempts or unauthorized remote access.
   
3. **System Scanning and Monitoring:**
   - Conduct a full system scan using security tools for any malware or unauthorized software.
   - Enhance monitoring to capture any further account or system changes immediately.
   
4. **User and Privilege Management:**

Determining the root cause and ensuring no further unauthorized actions take place is crucial at this juncture."
Overwrite deleted data on C drive,"Upon examining the provided Windows event logs, several observations indicate potential malicious or suspicious activity:

1. **Event IDs & Pattern Analysis**:
   - Multiple Event ID 4624 (Logon) and Event ID 4672 (Special Privilege Assigned) indicate a pattern of logins involving high privileges. While SYSTEM logons using SeDebugPrivilege and other sensitive privileges can be common in certain scheduled tasks and legitimate administrative actions, the frequency is notable. For instance, multiple logons with the SYSTEM and admin_test accounts within a short time frame should be examined further.
   - Event ID 4624 with LogonType 3, typically suggests network logon attempts which if not commonly expected, might denote an unauthorized access attempt. The logons are associated with the admin_test account which is suspicious due to high privilege activities observed with this account.

2. **Process Analysis**:
   - In the Sysmon logs, Process Creation events (Event ID 1) show executions of `cmd.exe` with command-line arguments involving `cipher.exe /w:C:`. This command is used to wipe free space on a drive and could indicate an attempt to cover tracks or delete evidence.
   - Execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the SERVER002\admin_test user is captured, though it is important to understand why this administrative-like activity is being executed, especially from possibly unlikely paths and contexts.
   - `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` executions would be less concerning if carried out by a user verifying their session details, but the context suggests these are being executed with high integrity level privileges, potentially indicating privilege escalation verification.

3. **Anomalous Network Activity**:
   - The network logon events from DESKTOP-3HL5B2P using NTLM authentication might indicate lateral movement, especially with the privileged admin_test user account from an external machine.

4. **Time Synchronization Events**:
   - Multiple Security and System events relate to time adjustments and time service synchronization. While these can be legitimate, they can also be abused for obfuscation of activity timestamps.

5. **Software Updates and Installations**:
   - [Sysmon] The logs show Microsoft Edge updates occurring (EdgeUpdate and setup.exe). While these can be normal activities, the timing and context should be verified, considering the surrounding suspicious activities.

6. **Lack of PowerShell Logging**:
   - The absence of PowerShell logs could indicate log-clearing attempts or the disabling of logging, especially if PowerShell-based attacks are a vector of concern.

Based on the outlined reasons, the investigation finds:

- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
1. **Conduct a Deep Dive Investigation**:
   - Examine the specific history of the `admin_test` account and its typical usage context.
   - Verify with the IT team if the observed admin-level activities were expected and legitimate, especially focused on command usage and login patterns for the timestamp in question.
2. **Monitor Network Connections**:
   - Review network logs for any connections between DESKTOP-3HL5B2P and the inspected Server002. Validate if such connections are typical and authorized.
3. **Review and Enhance Audit Logs**:
   - Ensure all necessary audit logs are enabled, especially for PowerShell.

Data Encrypted with GPG4Win,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

**1. Overview of Events:**
The logs detail various processes and activities across the system, primarily focusing on the `Server002` machine. The key events include the execution of PowerShell scripts, command-line processes using `cmd.exe`, and several instances of system utilities such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, and `whoami.exe` being executed. Additionally, there's notable interaction with the `GnuPG` software via both PowerShell and the command line.

**2. Potentially Suspicious Activities:**

- **Command-line Execution and GPG:**
  - A significant activity involves executing PowerShell which calls `cmd.exe`, which in turn runs `gpg.exe` with a command: `""powershell.exe"" & {cmd /c 'C:\\Program Files (x86)\\GnuPG\\bin\\gpg.exe' -c '$env:temp\\test.txt'}`. 
  - This suggests the encryption of a file in the `Temp` directory. While encryption isn’t inherently malicious, the chain of command execution may be indicative of a script or automated task potentially hiding activities. The use of GPG could imply an attempt to secure data before exfiltration.

- **Frequent Usage of System Tools:**
  - The frequent and rapid use of system utilities like `wevtutil.exe` for event log management and `conhost.exe` tied to terminal operations are executed by `admin_test`. This activity pattern might imply attempts to clear logs or conduct system investigations via automated means, potentially to cover tracks.
  
- **Processes Launched by Service Accounts:**
  - The execution of `CompatTelRunner.exe`, `svchost.exe`, and `WMI utilities` with elevated privileges are usual but should be scrutinized for command-line arguments or known vulnerabilities.

**3. Indicators of Potential Malicious Activity:**

- **Process Execution Patterns:**
  - The sequence of process creation and utility execution under the `admin_test` account using high privileges should be scrutinized further. The pattern, especially with PowerShell scripts and cmd executions, aligns with typical attack behaviors during lateral movement or data staging for exfiltration.

- **Security Log Anomalies:**
  - The security event logs (4798 and 4799) show user enumeration from a process (`CompatTelRunner.exe`) with elevated rights, which is unexpected for such activities and may indicate reconnaissance efforts.
  
**Assessment and Recommendation:**

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS:**
  - The logs predominantly feature high-privilege usage of scripting and command-line tools in a sequence that might align with intrusion tactics but not definitively malicious due to lack of direct evidence like outbound connections or payload downloads.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

1. **Conduct a Thorough System Audit:**
   - Escalate the review for any unauthorized admin account usage.
   - Verify the legitimacy of the PowerShell scripts and cmd activities logged, focusing on `admin_test` actions.

2. **Monitor Network Traffic:**
   - Check for any unusual outbound connections following these logs' timestamps, especially focusing on data exfiltration signs.

3. **Triage and Remediation:**
   - If unauthorized activity is confirmed, proceed with isolating affected systems, resetting credentials, and examining other systems for similar patterns.
   - Conduct endpoint security updates and tighten PowerShell execution policies.

By following the above steps, you can ensure a thorough investigation that either dispels concerns or quickly mitigates any potential threats stemming from these observed actions."
ESXi - Terminates VMs using pkill,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

### Observed Suspicious/Anomalous Behavior

1. **Command Execution Using `cmd.exe` and `plink.exe`:**
   - There is an event showing the execution of `cmd.exe` with the command: `\""cmd.exe\"" /c echo \""\"" | \""C:\\Users\\ADMIN~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\plink.exe\"" \""file.local\"" -ssh -l \""root\"" -pw \""pass\"" -m \""C:\\Users\\ADMIN~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data\\src\\esx_pkill.txt\""`.
   - The use of `plink.exe`, which is a command-line network connection tool from the PuTTY suite, with a `root` login and a directive to use a password (`-pw`) is unusual and often associated with remote command execution, particularly because it involves a potentially insecure password authentication method.

2. **Restricted User Context:**
   - The user context is `SERVER002\\admin_test`, suggesting administrative privileges. However, the use of `plink.exe` with SSH and a plaintext password implies potential misuse of administrative capabilities, possibly for unauthorized access or data exfiltration.

3. **Miscellaneous Process Executions:**
   - The frequent invocation of legitimate tools (`hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `powershell.exe`) might be benign under specific circumstances. However, the context and succession of such commands in a short period could suggest a reconnaissance phase of an attack where the adversary gathers information about the host environment.

4. **Repeated Execution of System Utilities:**
   - The execution of `wevtutil.exe`, a command-line utility for managing Windows Event logs, denotes actions that might indicate attempts to clear logs or cover tracks, typically seen in adversarial techniques post-exploitation to avoid detection.

### Evaluation of Malicious Indicators

- **Unauthorized Network Utility Usage:**
  - The use of `plink.exe` with a preset authenticated SSH session raises substantial suspicion. Such unmonitored network connections could facilitate lateral movement or data exfiltration without direct user oversight.
  
- **Privileged Access Utilization:**
  - Execution contexts operating at high integrity levels containing potentially unauthorized activities point to risk scenarios involving data theft or unauthorized network access.

### Assessment and Conclusion

Given the events detailed and the suspicious use of known network utilities alongside potentially sensitive operations (like log evasion tools), there is significant risk suggesting the potential compromise of administrative accounts or misuse of administrative privileges.

Windows - Delete Volume Shadow Copies via WMI with PowerShell,"### Analysis of the Logs:

#### 1. Windows PowerShell Log:
- **Suspicious Command Line Execution**: The PowerShell command observed is:  
  `powershell.exe & {Get-WmiObject Win32_Shadowcopy | ForEach-Object {$_.Delete();}}`
  - This command deletes all shadow copies on the system, which can be indicative of anti-forensic tactics by an attacker to remove backup versions of files, potentially to hide malicious activity such as ransomware.
  
#### 2. Security Log:
- **Event ID 4672 - Special Privileges Assigned**: The user `admin_test` is granted multiple sensitive privileges:
  - Privileges include `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, `SeRestorePrivilege`, which could be leveraged for lateral movement or privilege escalation attacks. This is noteworthy especially if this is outside the normal behavior for the `admin_test` user or if this account was not expected to perform such operations.
  
- **Multiple Logon Sessions (Event ID 4624)**: Logon events for the user `admin_test` with NTLM authentication were observed. These entries might indicate an attempt to access resources with elevated privileges.

#### 3. Sysmon Log:
- **Process Creation**: 
  - Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` are observed. This utility can be used to fetch or clear event logs, which might point to attempts to cover tracks.
  - Execution of `whoami.exe` multiple times: While not inherently malicious, repeated calls could be used in conjunction with other activities for reconnaissance.
- **Process of `wsmprovhost.exe` and `conhost.exe`**: These appear as parent processes for `whoami.exe` and can be leveraged in automated or scripted enumeration activities.

#### 4. Time Synchronization Anomaly:
- **Event ID 4616 - System Time Change**:
  - The logs indicate a time change in the system. This is sometimes used to bypass certain audit logging or to foil timeline analysis if logs are altered.

### Conclusion:

The analysis of the logs presents a series of activities that raise significant concerns regarding potential malicious activity:

- The PowerShell command targeting shadow copies deletion is highly indicative of an attempt to erase secures states or backups, potentially in preparation for data alteration or ransomware activity.
- The assignment of special privileges to `admin_test` and the sequence of logon events suggest possible misuse or compromise of an administrative account.
- The observed executions of `wevtutil.exe` and alterations in system time may point toward attempts to manipulate or erase logs, which is a tactic used in malicious activity to obfuscate actions and events.

### Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

Given the combination of suspicious command execution, unusual privilege assignments, attempts to obfuscate logs, and anomalies indicating potential time manipulation, the findings strongly suggest malicious activity. Immediate action is recommended, including:

- Isolating the affected system for further forensic investigation.
- Reviewing user `admin_test`'s recent activities, access, and possible exposure of credentials.
- Taking appropriate measures to preserve and analyze shadow copies (if any exist), backups, and logs.
- Implementing additional monitoring for signs of lateral movement or secondary compromises within the network."
Windows - Stop service by killing process,"To analyze the provided Windows event logs from the CEO's machine, I will examine key areas such as process execution events, command-line arguments, and any indicators of privilege escalation or suspicious behavior.

1. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
   - Multiple executions of common utilities like `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `taskkill.exe`.
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with the command line `/c taskkill.exe /f /im spoolsv.exe`. This kills the `spoolsv.exe` process, which is the Print Spooler service, a critical component for managing print jobs on Windows. This activity can be suspicious as it disrupts normal service.
   - Numerous entries for processes related to Microsoft Edge Update with benign-looking command lines such as update and COM registration.

2. **Application Log:**
   - Repeated logging of ""Service stopped"" from the `edgeupdate` provider. While `edgeupdate` is a legitimate service for updating Microsoft Edge, the simultaneous stopping events could hint at a service disruption or an issue with the update service.

3. **System Log:**
   - The Print Spooler service failure and restart directive (`EventID 7031`). This indicates the spooler was unexpectedly terminated, which aligns with the `taskkill` command from the Sysmon log. This behavior could be a deliberate act to manipulate or mitigate a vulnerability associated with `spoolsv.exe`.

4. **Security Log:**
   - Common system activity: Logon Event (ID 4624) for `SYSTEM`, which is a standard service account. There is an event for privilege assignment (ID 4672) indicating high privileges held by the `SYSTEM` account, typical for system operations and not immediately malicious without other indicators.

### Assessment:
- The shutdown of system services like `spoolsv.exe` via command line utility (`taskkill`) specified in Sysmon logs is unusual and could indicate an attempt to disable/modify the service exploitation. While `spoolsv.exe` vulnerabilities have been historically targeted, this action could be part of a legitimate maintenance script but warrants further investigation.
- The frequent execution of Microsoft Edge Update processes and related COM registration executables, while extensive, do not immediately indicate malicious activity as these could be part of normal update procedures.

### Conclusion:
Based on the above observations, particularly the forced termination of `spoolsv.exe`, the resolution for this case is **SUSPICIOUS**. While there are benign activities, the specific action related to `taskkill.exe` requires further investigation to conclude if it constitutes a threat or was a part of an authorized maintenance task. I recommend monitoring for further suspicious behavior, checking for unscheduled script executions, and verifying any administrative tasks performed during this period to validate the authenticity of these actions."
Windows - Stop service using Service Controller,"Upon analyzing the provided event logs from the Windows host, several observations can be made:

### Security and Anomalous Event Observations:

1. **Time Change Events (EventIDs 4616 and Kernel-General 1 & 24)**:
   - There are events indicating time changes managed by `svchost.exe` running under `LOCAL SERVICE` and `Kernel-General`. Time changes can sometimes be indicative of an attempt to obscure malicious activities. However, these events are not inherently malicious and often occur during legitimate time synchronization with time servers.

2. **Use of System Utilities**:
   - **`wevtutil.exe`** and **`conhost.exe`** usage: These are legitimate Windows utilities. `wevtutil.exe` is used for managing event logs, and `conhost.exe` provides a command line interface. Regular usage of these tools, especially around the same timestamps, may suggest routine administrative tasks or script execution by a user `SERVER002\\admin_test`.

3. **Command Line Execution**:
   - The execution of **`whoami.exe`** and **`cmd.exe`** commands appears normal for an administrative account, but the combination of calling `cmd.exe` with `sc.exe stop spooler` is somewhat unusual. The command `sc.exe stop spooler` is used to stop the printer spooler service. This can be indicative of an attempt to disrupt services or as part of exploitation technique on systems vulnerable to Print Spooler service vulnerabilities. However, it also could be part of a legitimate debugging or maintenance procedure.

4. **Edge Update Activity**:
   - Multiple events concerning `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` indicate that several updates and registration tasks related to Microsoft Edge are being performed. The high frequency of these events, along with activities such as updating through directories like `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft\Temp\`, can sometimes indicate unwanted software behavior, but generally, these actions are part of normal update routines for Microsoft Edge.

5. **Integrity Level and User Context**:
   - Many processes are executed under `High` integrity level by the `SERVER002\\admin_test` user, which suggests they have administrative privileges.

### Assessment and Resolution:

The logs mainly suggest typical administrative or system maintenance activities. While the stopping of the Print Spooler service could potentially be an issue if unexpected, there's no clear indication of malicious activities such as privilege escalation or abnormal connections that are hallmarks of a compromise.

However, given these observations and considering the potential implications of stopping critical services like the Print Spooler without clear cause, it's advisable to categorize the activity as **SUSPICIOUS**. Further investigation might be necessary, specifically around the purpose of stopping the spooler service and verifying the context of these actions with the responsible administrative personnel to ensure they align with expected operations or maintenance tasks.

### Guidance:
- Verify with the system administrator if the stopping of the Print Spooler service was intended and part of routine maintenance.
- Monitor for any recurrence of time modifications or repeated stopping of critical services to ensure they are warranted.
- Cross-reference these logs with network activity logs to check for any unusual outbound connections that may correlate with unexpected service stops.
- Ensure the system is up-to-date with security patches to protect against any known vulnerabilities related to the Print Spooler service."
Windows - Delete Backup Files,"After a thorough analysis of the provided logs, several observations can be made regarding both normal and potentially suspicious activity:

1. **Command Execution**:
   - The most notable entry is the execution of a command using `cmd.exe` to delete several types of backup files (`*.VHD`, `*.bac`, `*.bak`, etc.) with the `/s /f /q` options in the root directory of the C: drive (Sysmon EventID 1, ProcessId 6388). This command purges backup files silently and forcefully, which is commonly associated with data destruction or anti-forensic activity.

2. **Process Execution**:
   - Numerous system processes were executed, such as `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` updates, `svchost.exe` processes, and others, which are generally expected on Windows systems during normal operations, updates, and services.
   
3. **Logon Events**:
   - Multiple successful logon events (EventID 4624) followed by the assignment of special privileges (EventID 4672) to the SYSTEM user, which is standard for many Windows services.

4. **Permissions and Privileges**:
    - There are instances of privilege assignment including `SeBackupPrivilege`, `SeRestorePrivilege`, and others to `SYSTEM`, which are common for administrative actions and Windows Update processes.

5. **Log Entries Related to SYSTEM**:
   - Log entries show SYSTEM performing various operations with elevated privileges, and there is a repeated pattern of these logs, aligning with expected system maintenance or update activities.

6. **Remote Logins**:
   - There were successful logins from a remote workstation (`DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`) using NTLM authentication to the `admin_test` account. While not inherently suspicious, this should be validated against authorized remote access policies for the systems involved.

**Assessment**:
The most concerning activity is regarding the suspicious deletion command executed by `cmd.exe`. This command is known to be used in malicious activities, often to cover tracks or disrupt recovery capabilities. It may indicate a potential compromise or malicious insider activity, especially since it was operating under a high integrity level by a user `admin_test`. It’s crucial to understand whether this action was expected or allowed under current policy.

**Resolution**: 
Considering the nature of the file deletion command and its potential implications, the overall resolution is **MALICIOUS**. Further investigation is recommended to confirm whether this activity was authorized, and if unauthorized, to determine how the unauthorized access was achieved, mitigate any potential persistent threat, and ensure system integrity.

**Guidance**:
- Investigate the user's activity, `admin_test`, to establish the legitimacy of their action with this script.
- Review access and authentication logs to locate any other unauthorized remote accesses.
- Consider restoring any deleted files from backups, if available, and ensure critical files are secured with robust permissions and regular audits.
- Implement immediate monitoring and auditing of privileged user activities and sensitive command executions.
- Conduct a full security audit of the system to detect any further unauthorized or suspicious activities."

Windows - wbadmin Delete systemstatebackup,"**Analysis of the Windows Event Logs:**

1. **Time Change Observations:**
   - The system logs have several entries indicating time changes on the system (Event IDs 4616 and 1 in multiple entries across different logs). Events showcasing altered system times can be suspicious, particularly if they occur frequently and without legitimate administrative activities, as attackers often modify system time to bypass logging and detection mechanisms.

2. **Use of `wbadmin` Command:**
   - Anomalies are observed in the execution of `wbadmin` via the command line `""cmd.exe"" /c wbadmin delete systemstatebackup -keepVersions:0""`. 
   - `wbadmin` is a legitimate tool for managing backup operations on Windows. However, the deletion of all system state backups could potentially lead to exploitation scenarios, such as evading forensic investigations and eliminating recovery paths in the event of a system breach.

3. **Multiple `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` Executions:**
   - There are multiple instances of processes like `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` being executed by `SERVER002\admin_test`. 
   - `wevtutil.exe` is a utility tool used to manage event logs and could be manipulated for unauthorized tasks, such as clearing event logs. Repeated occurrences in a short time frame alongside `conhost.exe` might indicate script-based operations or could be a batch operation.
   - Further investigation is warranted to determine if these were part of a standard maintenance script or potentially indicative of malicious activity.

4. **Process Executions & Privilege Use:**
   - The use of `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `HOSTNAME.EXE` by a user with high integrity level (admin equivalent privileges) within a compressed timeline suggests administrative actions.
   - Security event ID 4672 indicates a successful assignment of special privileges to the `admin_test` user, which further emphasizes elevated activity.

5. **Legitimate Windows Process Executions:**
   - Processes like `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` repeatedly appear in the logs. While these are part of the typical operation involving Microsoft Edge updates, their execution by NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM implies scheduled or automated tasks, likely benign unless known vulnerabilities are being exploited.

6. **Network Connections:**
   - The security log includes a network-based login from `fe80::e3b5:5371:12a8:9c77`. While IPv6 addresses are common, the legitimacy of this access needs verification to ensure it aligns with expected remote administrative activities.

**Assessment:**
- The time alterations, usage of `wbadmin` for deleting backups, and frequent executions of system utilities in a short timeframe are unusual.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
- The artifacts suggest activities that are within the realm of system administration but also align closely with tactics used for lateral movements and cover tracks.
- **Recommended Actions**: 
  - Verify the legitimacy of user `admin_test` activities.
  - Investigate the rationale for deleting system state backups.
  - Review any system alterations occurred post the logs' timestamps.
  - Ensure system time settings are monitored and legitimate.
  - Cross-verify network login sources and validate against known addresses/assets.
- Further investigation and potentially alerting responsible administrative personnel to verify recent intended system changes are advised."
Change User Password - Windows,"**Analysis of Logs Provided:**

After a thorough analysis of the provided log data across several channels (Application, System, Security, Windows PowerShell, and Sysmon), the following findings are noted:

**1. Application Log:**
- Multiple entries for edgeupdate service stopping are observed. This can be part of routine updates or patching; no immediate signs of malicious activity are present here.

**2. System Log:**
- There are several Kernel-General events related to time synchronization adjustments. These are normal behaviors associated with system time updates from a time server.

**3. Security Log:**
- Notable events include:
  - A number of user account operations involving the account `fileAdministrator` and user `admin_test`.
  - Event ID 4720 indicates a new user account `fileAdministrator` was created.  
  - Event ID 4724 shows a password reset attempt for the same account.
  - Event IDs 4616 show that there were time adjustments, which are commonly associated with normal system operations.
  - The actions by the user `admin_test` are somewhat suspicious due to the creation and modification of a potentially authoritative account (`fileAdministrator`).

**4. Sysmon Log:**
- Numerous entries indicate unusual command execution patterns that include tools like `cmd.exe`, `net.exe`, and `whoami.exe`.
- Sysmon data highlights `cmd.exe` running commands such as creating user accounts and changing passwords.
- There are patterns of executing these commands with high integrity levels, possible indication of elevated rights.
- Use of `cmd.exe` with `net user` commands to create and modify user accounts without a clear justification can be deemed suspicious, especially executed under the directory `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\`, a typical temporary folder used by attackers to execute unauthorized scripts.

**Conclusion:**
The logs present behavior involving user administration tools (`net.exe`), account management events (like new user creation and password changes), and the creation of a new privileged account (`fileAdministrator`). These are indicative of potential unauthorized or malicious activities, especially when occurring without corresponding documented change requests or justifications.

**Resolution:**

- **SUSPICIOUS**: 

The pattern of activities around account management, involving the `admin_test` account, deserves further investigation. While the entries are suspicious, they don't provide conclusive evidence of definite malicious activity but certainly warrant deeper scrutiny to determine intent and context.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Verify if the `admin_test` account and the actions recorded (creation/modification of `fileAdministrator`) align with legitimate administrative duties or requests.
   - Conduct a review of the admin_test user's activities over the timeframe of the log entries.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Compare the suspicious account activities with authorized change logs or administration records.
   - Examine other security logs and alerts for any correlating events that might provide additional context or indications of compromise.

Windows - Overwrite file with SysInternals SDelete,"After analyzing the provided logs, several indicators suggest potentially malicious activity, especially around the use of PowerShell and Sysinternals tools which are often used in various stages of attacks including reconnaissance, execution, persistence, and data exfiltration.

### Analysis:

1. **Security Log Analysis:**
   - A series of event logs with Event ID `4798` reveal queries for group membership targeting several user accounts including `Administrator`, `admin_test`, `DefaultAccount`, `Guest`, and `lplui`. While the querying process `taskhostw.exe` is a legitimate Windows process, repeated and rapid querying of user group memberships can be indicative of reconnaissance behavior by an attacker attempting to map out available privileges.
   
   - Event ID `4624` indicates successful logons with a logon type of `5`, which denotes service logon that isn't typical for direct user activity but not inherently malicious.

   - Event ID `4672` indicates special privileges assigned to a `SYSTEM` process. While this log entry may be normal for some server startup activities, if cross-referenced with other logs, it can suggest malicious privilege escalation attempts.

2. **PowerShell Log Analysis:**
   - PowerShell logs reveal the execution of a command which involves creating a file and then immediately running `sdelete.exe` from Sysinternals. The `sdelete.exe` tool is used for secure file deletion, which could indicate an attempt to erase forensic evidence after some form of unauthorized activity or data theft.

3. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
   - Sysmon logs with Event IDs `1` and `5` show unusual spawning of multiple processes by the `admin_test` user account, including the use of PowerShell, and the `sdelete.exe` tool. Such activities performed by a lower-privilege user attempting system-level scanning and cleanup could indicate malicious behavior.
   - Consistent with the PowerShell logs, Sysmon confirms the execution of `sdelete.exe`, implying secure deletion activities which are suspicious in contexts where such actions aren't routine business operations.

4. **Application Log:**
   - Application logs do not directly indicate suspicious activity; they mainly contain normal operations of security product updates and state changes.

### Assessment:

The logs suggest activities typical of lateral movement and clean-up executed by an attacker. These include reconnaissance through the querying of group memberships, use of PowerShell to execute commands potentially created by an external actor, and the deployment of Sysinternals `sdelete.exe` to possibly destroy evidence.

**Resolution:** **MALICIOUS**

### Recommendations:

- **Immediate Investigation:** Conduct a detailed forensic investigation of the system to ascertain what processes preceded the execution of suspicious commands and understand the full scope of compromise.
  
- **Network Monitoring:** Closely monitor network traffic for unusual patterns or attempts to communicate with known malicious endpoints.

- **Access Review:** Review and limit user permissions, especially for accounts found involved in suspicious activities (`admin_test`).

- **Isolation:** Consider isolating the affected host(s) to prevent further damage while the investigation is underway.

- **Security Enhancements:** Implement strict PowerShell logging and monitor for specific commands that can indicate malicious intent. Deploy endpoint protection solutions capable of detecting and blocking known threat behaviors.

By addressing these points, the organization can mitigate the current threat and bolster its defenses against future incidents."
Windows - Delete Volume Shadow Copies,"After a thorough analysis of the given Windows event logs, some noteworthy activities stand out, potentially indicative of malicious behaviors:

1. **Execution of Vssadmin for Deleting Shadow Copies**:
   - **Log Entry**: `C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe` was used to execute `vssadmin.exe delete shadows /all /quiet`. This combination is a known tactic often used by ransomware to delete volume shadow copies, making file recovery more difficult.
   - **Associated Entries**: 
     - The `vssadmin.exe` tool was also executed earlier with the `list shadows` command to check for existing shadow copies before deletion, as indicated by the combination of `vssadmin.exe` and `findstr.exe` in earlier logs.
     - The command was executed by a user with high integrity level (`SERVER002\\admin_test`), indicating potential privilege misuse.

2. **Execution Context**:
   - These commands were executed under the `SERVER002\\admin_test` user profile with high integrity, suggesting that an account with elevated privileges was used to carry out these actions.

3. **Wevtutil and Conhost Execution**:
   - The logs also show multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` executed in the context of the `admin_test` user. While `wevtutil.exe` can be used for legitimate administrative tasks like managing event logs, it can also be employed to delete or tamper with logs to cover malicious activities.

4. **Other Process Executions**:
   - Common and benign processes like `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` were executed. These could potentially be part of reconnaissance phases to gather system information.

5. **Summary**:
   - The combination of the commands used and the elevated privilege level strongly suggests potential malicious activity. In particular, the `vssadmin delete shadows /all /quiet` command is a known red flag for ransomware operations.

**Threat Assessment**:
Given the clear and distinct pattern of behavior associated with the deletion of volume shadow copies (a tactic used by threat actors to prevent data recovery), the activity recorded in the logs indicates a significant risk of data integrity compromise and potential ransomware activity.

**Recommendations**:
- **Immediate Incident Response**: Given the malicious indicators, initiate immediate incident response procedures. Isolate the affected system from the network to prevent any potential spread of ransomware.
- **Backup and Restore Strategy**: Ensure that all critical data is backed up and regularly updated.

1. **Application Log:**
   - The `edgeupdate` service stopped at `2024-10-26 22:08:36.0437747`.
   - The `Microsoft-Windows-Security-SPP` service recorded an entry at `2024-10-26 22:08:42.3500418`.

2. **Sysmon Log:**
   - Numerous executions of built-in Windows executable processes such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `shutdown.exe`.
   - A high frequency of Microsoft Edge Update processes `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` reflects various commands executed by the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` account.

### Anomalous and Suspicious Behavior:

1. **Frequent Execution of Utilities:**
   - Continuous execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` might indicate investigation or manipulative attempts with event logs. `wevtutil.exe` is often used to manage event logs.
   - Use of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` can be normal for user and system identification but can also be suspicious if performed unexpectedly or frequently.

2. **Unauthorized Shutdown Commands:**
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with the `/c shutdown /l` command by the `SERVER002\admin_test` user is suspicious. This action logs the user off, which might be intended to disrupt or cover tracks.

3. **Microsoft Edge Update Executions:**
   - The logs show numerous launches of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes with varying parameters (`/update`, `/regsvc`, `/regserver`, `/svc`, `/c`, and `/ua`) under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` account.
   - It's reasonable to log legitimate Microsoft Edge auto-update processes, but the high frequency and varying parameters could suggest misuse or obfuscation attempts.

### Assessment of Situation:

- **Privilege Levels:**
  - Activities are executed under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` account or with high integrity, raising the risk factor as the actions could impact system-wide settings.
  
- **Execution Patterns:**
  - Rapid sequence of many internal utilities (`whoami.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `cmd.exe`, `shutdown.exe`) suggests a script or an automated tool might be at play without direct user invocation typically seen in interactive sessions.

- **Potentially Malicious Activity:**
  - The shutdown command and rapid-fire service executions imply potentially malicious intent aimed at either service disruption or post-compromise cleanup.

### Final Resolution:

**SUSPICIOUS**

While there's potential for legitimate system maintenance actions (such as legitimate software updates or remote troubleshooting activities), the high level of execution frequency, variety of sensitive utilities executed, potential tool usage, and unauthorized actions like shutdowns warrant further investigation to conclusively determine if the activities are malicious.

Azure AD - Delete user via Azure AD PowerShell,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, several points and events require careful investigation:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior
1. **EventID 4624 (Logon Success) & 4672 (Special Privileges Assigned)**:
   - There are multiple logon events with Logon Type 5, which is a service logon. This can be normal behavior depending on the number of services running but should be checked for unauthorized services.
   - Special privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege` are assigned, which are powerful and could be exploited if granted to unauthorized services. The SYSTEM account is typically expected to have these, but reviewing which processes these privileges are invoked for is essential.

2. **Process Execution**:
   - There are multiple instances of `powershell.exe` launched by the `SERVER002\admin_test` account (e.g., Sysmon EventID 5 and Windows PowerShell logs), with a command involving `Connect-AzureAD` and `Remove-AzureADUser`. This is highly irregular, especially if not initiated via a legitimate administrative operation.
   - The use of PowerShell, particularly when executing sensitive administrative commands, warrants a deeper look into whether such an operation aligns with expected administrative activities.
   - `wevtutil.exe` instance log in Sysmon log indicates potential manipulation or querying of event logs, which can be benign but commonly feature in malicious activity aimed at covering tracks.

3. **Credential Access**:
   - Multiple EventID 5379 (Credential Read Events) show attempts to read credentials related to Microsoft accounts without success, as indicated by the return code `3221226021`. While failures, the frequency and target warrant investigation for potential credential-harvesting attempts or misconfigurations.

4. **Microsoft Edge Update Processes**:
   - The number and frequency of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes are noticeable but may relate to routine background update checks. However, the large volume suggests a need for confirming this is tied to legitimate update operations and not potential hijacking.

### Potential Compromise Indicators
- **Execution of Administrative PowerShell Commands**: Given the PowerShell commands involved, especially the `Remove-AzureADUser`, it demonstrates potential unauthorized or malicious administrative action.
- **Multiple Credential Read Attempts**: Frequent failed attempts at reading credentials require verification to rule out malicious attempts at account compromise.
- **Suspicious Logon Events with Special Privileges**: Events related to acquiring special and high-privilege tokens should trigger detailed analysis of system integrity and process legitimacy.

### Assessment and Resolution
Based on the logs reviewed:
- **Resolution**: ***SUSPICIOUS*** - The presence of administrative-level PowerShell activities and credential access attempts, along with other frequent service logs, suggest potential unauthorized or improper system usage that could indicate preliminary stages or existence of malicious activity.
  
### Guidance
- **Investigation & Remediation**:
  - Review scheduled tasks and services for unexpected or unauthorized entries.
  - Investigate the specific source and intent of the `powershell.exe` commands to ensure they are expected and authorized.
  - Conduct a security review of privileged accounts and special access rights granted.
  - Verify with administrative teams about any legitimate need or execution of PowerShell commands or configuration adjustments.
  - Consider deploying deeper endpoint protections or threat-hunting processes to confirm the nature of activities observed.
- **Assurance**: Engage in regular security audits and privilege use reviews to ensure adherence to least privilege principle and identify misconfigurations or unauthorized use promptly.

This investigation suggests further detailed analysis and monitoring should be conducted to rule out or confirm the presence of active threats."
Windows - Stop service using net.exe,"Based on the analysis of the provided logs, here are the findings:

1. **Time Change Events (System & Security Logs):**
   - Multiple instances of Event ID 1 and 24 from the Kernel-General logs indicate that the system time was adjusted. This can be normal system behavior, typically associated with time synchronization or daylight saving adjustments. However, if done unexpectedly or not correlated with external time servers, it may warrant further examination.
   - Security Audit events (EventID 4616) show the old and new time, which confirms the time changes. This is normal when the system adjusts time but should be verified against known scheduled tasks.

2. **Command Execution Related Activity (Sysmon Log):**
   - There are logs showing `cmd.exe` with a command line `\""cmd.exe\"" /c net.exe stop spooler`. This command stops the Print Spooler service, and while this could be part of regular maintenance, unexpected stopping of system services, particularly the spooler, can indicate malicious activity such as attempts to disable security or facilitate lateral movement.
   - This activity should be reviewed to ensure it was an authorized and expected administrative action. 

3. **Service Interaction (Sysmon Log):**
   - Usage of `wevtutil.exe` and subsequent interactions with `conhost.exe`, which may indicate event log manipulation or queries. While this is a legitimate system tool, its usage should be confirmed as part of routine administration.
   - If no security policy or IT process justifies this action, this could be considered suspicious, especially on a high-profile asset like a CEO's machine.

4. **Account and Privilege Use (Security Log):**
   - A log shows a privileged account `admin_test` (EventID 4672) executed commands with several high-level privileges (such as SeDebugPrivilege, SeLoadDriverPrivilege), which may suggest an attempt to escalate or use elevated privileges.
   - Ensure that `admin_test` was expected to perform such actions and validate any operational processes that explain elevated access.

5. **Standard System Updates and Process Starts:**
   - The presence of Microsoft Edge Update logs is expected, as updates routinely occur. These logs (Sysmon EventID 1) show typical execution paths and processes related to software updates.
   - No irregularities detected here, indicating this is likely benign.

**Assessment & Recommendations:**

- **Assessment:** 
  The command-line execution to stop the spooler service and the use of high-level privileges by `admin_test` are the most anomalous and potentially concerning indicators within these logs.
  
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS** 
  While there's no definitive evidence of malicious activity, given the sensitivity of the asset (a CEO's machine) and the presence of potentially unauthorized actions, further investigation is necessary.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

1. **Verify Time Adjustments:** Cross-reference the time change events with scheduled synchronization tasks and external time servers. Confirm with IT if these were expected changes.

2. **Review Admin Activities:** Check the organizational change management records to verify if `admin_test` executed these actions as part of approved maintenance or troubleshooting efforts.

3. **Investigate Command Execution:** Follow up on the `cmd.exe` execution to determine the intent and legitimacy. If this was not an authorized action, examine further for potential signs of intrusion.

4. **Perform Threat Hunt on Unusual Privileges and Process Actions:** Conduct a full threat hunt on `admin_test` account activities and surrounding logs to trace any unauthorized or anomalous behaviors that might not be apparent in these logs alone.

5. **Strengthen Security Monitoring:** Obtain and analyze additional EDR telemetry and system logs from the affected host to build a comprehensive picture of recent activities and apply enhanced monitoring for future activities, especially on high-profile accounts and systems."
