Directory Name,AI Response
Modify VSS Service Permissions,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several key points of interest stand out regarding potential malicious or suspicious activities:

1. **Log File Clearing Events:**
   - **Event ID 1102 (Security Log Cleared)** and **Event ID 104 (System and PowerShell Logs Cleared)** are present. The action of clearing logs can be indicative of an attempt to hide malicious activity. These events were executed by a user named `admin_test`.

2. **Time Manipulation:**
   - **Event ID 4616 (System Time Changed)** indicates a backward time adjustment from 2024-10-26 20:27:33.956 to 2024-10-26 20:27:29.248. While time adjustments can happen naturally, they can also be used to disrupt log timelines, potentially hiding specific sequences of events.

3. **Privilege Escalation:**
   - **Event ID 4672 (Special Privileges Assigned)** was noted for the `admin_test` user, which grants high-level privileges including SeDebugPrivilege, SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege, etc. Such privileges can be abused for malicious purposes.

4. **Command Execution and Process Activity:**
   - **Sysmon Logs** indicate the execution of various processes using elevated privileges:
     - `wevtutil.exe` is used multiple times (`cl Application`, `cl System`, `cl Security`, `cl Windows PowerShell`) to clear event logs, consistent with attempts to cover tracks.
     - The `cmd.exe` execution with suspicious Service Control (`sc.exe`) command modifying security descriptors for VSS (Volume Shadow Service) is unusual and could indicate a configuration change with potential malicious intent.

5. **Network and Credential Activity:**
   - **Event ID 4624 (An account was successfully logged on)** shows NTLM logons from a workstation named `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P` with elevated tokens, corresponding with high-level privilege activities under the `admin_test` account. Such patterns can suggest lateral movement or unauthorized access attempts.

Given this information, the activity documented in the logs is highly indicative of an attempt to compromise the machine by granting and using high-level privileges to clear logs and potentially perform further malicious activities. The evidence of log clearing, time changes, privilege escalation, and suspicious command execution collectively point to behavior consistent with malicious activity.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on Further Actions:**
- Immediately isolate the affected host from the network to prevent further compromise.
- Conduct a deeper forensic analysis to identify the exact source and vector of the compromise.
- Verify user accounts, especially `admin_test`, and credential usage across the network.
- Review and harden security configurations, especially concerning critical services like VSS.
- Restore the system to a known secure state from backups, ensuring that the backup does not contain malicious modifications.
- Implement stricter monitoring and logging practices to prevent and detect future incidents."
Disable System Restore Through Registry,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, here is a breakdown of the activities observed:

### Sysmon Logs

1. **Command Execution:**
   - **Process:** `wevtutil.exe` executed multiple times with the `cl` (clear) option to clear logs from channels such as Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon, Application, System, and Security. This behavior is often associated with attempts to cover up tracks after unwanted or unauthorized changes.
   - **User:** All commands were executed by `SERVER002\admin_test`.

2. **Registry Modifications:**
   - **Process:** `cmd.exe` executed with several `reg add` commands that disable System Restore functions in the registry. These modifications can be an indicator of malicious intent as they can prevent system rollback in case of compromise.
   - **User:** `SERVER002\admin_test`.

3. **System Utility Executions:**
   - **Processes:** `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `conhost.exe` were executed by the `admin_test` user, which could be part of routine checks or scripts but may also be tools used by an attacker to gather information about the system.

### System and Security Logs

1. **Log Clearance:**
   - **EventID 104 and 1102:** These events indicate that the `admin_test` user cleared the logs for the System, Windows PowerShell, and Security channels. Clearing these logs is a common tactic used by attackers to hide traces of their activities.

### Observations and Conclusion
1. The consistent use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs on various channels suggests an attempt to hide activities that could be malicious.
2. The disabling of system restore points through registry modifications is a concerning activity as it increases the risk of persistence and complicates recovery efforts.
3. The combination of clearing event logs and disabling recovery features is indicative of potentially malicious behavior.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Recommendations
- **Immediate Actions:**
  - Isolate `Server002` from the network to prevent potential lateral movement.
  - Perform a full forensic analysis of the system to identify any other malicious activity or unauthorized changes.
  - Review user account activities and permissions for `admin_test`.
  - Restore the registry settings to re-enable system restore points.

- **Long-Term Actions:**
  - Enhance logging and monitoring to detect similar activities in the future.
  - Implement stricter access controls and audit policies to monitor log clearance and registry changes.
  - Educate users on security best practices and the importance of maintaining system recovery features."
Windows - Delete Volume Shadow Copies via WMI,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs from the Windows host, several indicators suggest suspicious or potentially malicious activities:

1. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - Event log entries from both the System and Security logs indicate that logs have been cleared. Specifically, Event ID 104 in the System log and Event ID 1102 in the Security log show that the logs were cleared by the user `admin_test`. While log clearing can sometimes occur during routine maintenance, it often signifies attempts to cover tracks following unauthorized or malicious activities.

2. **Usage of `vssadmin.exe`**:
   - The execution of `vssadmin.exe` with the command `list shadows` by the user `admin_test` in the Sysmon logs. This utility can be used benignly but is frequently abused by attackers to manipulate shadow copies for data exfiltration or ransomware activities.

3. **Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) Command**:
   - Another Sysmon entry shows `cmd.exe` executing a command to delete shadow copies using `wmic.exe shadowcopy delete`. This activity is highly suspect and often associated with ransomware or other malicious operations to hinder recovery efforts by removing backup copies.

4. **Frequent Execution of `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - The `wevtutil.exe` command is used multiple times to clear event logs across different channels (`Sysmon`, `System`, and `Security`). This indicates an attempt to delete forensic evidence, which is a known tactic by threat actors to cover their tracks after malicious activities.

5. **Command Line with Process Execution**:
   - The logs show the execution of several command-line processes (`cmd.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `wmic.exe`) with potential suspicious patterns. The combination of these processes being triggered with commands for shadow copy and event log manipulation is indicative of potentially harmful intentions.

6. **Integrity Level and High Privilege Use**:
   - Many processes run at a high integrity level under the `admin_test` account, suggesting an elevation of privileges to perform potentially unauthorized changes.

Considering these observations, the logs suggest coordinated actions to manipulate system state, clear evidence of actions taken, and potentially disable system recovery mechanisms such as shadow copies.

Based on the analysis, I classify this activity as **MALICIOUS**. There seems to be a clear attempt to obfuscate potentially harmful modifications made to the system.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Containment and Investigation**:
   - Isolate the affected system from the network to prevent further malicious activities or lateral movement.
   - Conduct a deeper forensic analysis on the host to identify potential malware or other threat actor footprints.

2. **Restore and Backup Analysis**:
   - Investigate recent backup or shadow copy policies to assess any data loss due to the shadow copy deletions.
   - Consider restoring the system from a clean backup, ensuring it predates the suspicious activities.

3. **Review and Audit Security Controls**:
   - Audit user accounts and privilege assignments, especially focusing on the `admin_test` account.
   - Implement stricter logging and monitoring to detect similar activities in the future, including real-time alerts for log clearing attempts.

4. **User Awareness and Training**:
   - Provide security training focused on recognizing and reporting suspicious behavior, especially regarding the use of administrative privileges.

Taking these steps will aid in mitigating the immediate threat and help strengthen overall security posture moving forward."
Windows - Disable the SR scheduled task,"After analyzing the provided event logs from the Windows machine, several patterns of activity suggest potential malicious behavior. Here's a detailed breakdown of the logs:

1. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - Several instances of the `wevtutil` utility being used to clear Windows event logs (""cl"" command is used to clear events from the specified log). Look at the following instances:
     - Logs show ""wevtutil"" being used to clear the ""Application"", ""System"", and ""Security"" logs by ""admin_test"" user, which is unconventional unless there is a specific administrative procedure in place.
   - **Events**:
     - Event ID 104: System logs cleared.
     - Event ID 1102: Security log was cleared.

   Clearing event logs is a common step attackers take to erase traces of their activities to prevent detection by security investigators.

2. **Suspicious Command Execution**:
   - The use of `cmd.exe` to disable a scheduled task, specifically the System Restore task which could hinder system recovery processes after malicious actions.
   - **Sysmon Event ID 1**: 
     - Command executed: ```schtasks.exe /Change /TN ""\Microsoft\Windows\SystemRestore\SR"" /disable```
   - This activity is particularly suspicious as it disables a Windows feature crucial for recovery and remediation.

3. **Changes in System Time**:
   - There are log entries indicating changes in system time (Event ID 4616 in the Security logs and Event ID 1 in the Kernel-General logs).
   - This could be normal behavior due to NTP synchronization or time zone adjustments, but when combined with other suspicious activities, it warrants further investigation.

4. **Multiple Execution of Legitimate Tasks in a Short Period**:
   - Multiple instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` executing shortly after each other. Although it's legitimate software, the frequency and timing might suggest misuse for suspicious purposes or an attempt to blend in with legitimate activities.

5. **Use of Administrative Credentials**:
   - The operations and manipulations were carried out using the `admin_test` account, indicating either misuse or potential compromise of administrative credentials.

**Resolution**: Based on the detailed analysis of the logs, the predominant evidence points to activities that are highly indicative of malicious actions. These activities include the clearing of event logs, disabling of system recovery features, and irregular behavior associated with critical commands and scripts.

Final resolution: **MALICIOUS**

**Recommendations**:
- Conduct a full forensic investigation on the system to identify how access was obtained and any other actions that were taken.
- Audit and secure access controls, especially admin accounts like `admin_test`.
- Review and restrict the use of utilities like `wevtutil`, `cmd.exe`, and `schtasks.exe` through policy adjustments and application whitelisting.
- Restore and verify the integrity of key system functions like Event Logs and System Restore.
- Monitor other hosts in the network for similar activities."
ESXi - Avoslocker enumerates VMs and forcefully kills VMs,"### Detailed Analysis

- **Suspicious Process Execution**: 
  - The `cmd.exe` process was executed with a command line initiating `plink.exe`, an SSH client, in a somewhat suspicious manner. The command included connecting to `atomic.local` using the root account with a password (`pass`) provided in plaintext, and executing a file located at `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\T1529\\src\\esx_avoslocker_kill_vm.txt`. This suggests potential unauthorized remote access or lateral movement, which is a common behavior of malicious actors.

- **Log Clearing**: 
  - Security and System logs were cleared at `2024-10-27 12:04:10`, initiated by the `admin_test` user. Clearing logs is not common in routine operations and often indicates an attempt to cover tracks of malicious activity. This event is a highly suspicious action especially considering no legitimate administration task would be performed without leaving a trace.

- **High Integrity Level**: 
  - Several processes were running with a high integrity level, including critical system utilities like `wevtutil.exe`. While not in itself malicious, combined with the other events, it suggests actions with potentially escalated privileges. The execution of programs with high integrity levels should be scrutinized for legitimacy.

- **Wevtutil and PowerShell Usage**: 
  - `wevtutil.exe` was executed multiple times, clearing different event logs (`Operational`, `Application`, `System`, and `Security`). It's often used for legitimate purposes, but when logs are cleared around the time suspicious commands are executed, it raises red flags.

- **Network Activity with Potential Payload**: 
  - The `plink.exe` operation is possibly a confirmed attempt at remote communication, potentially indicating an attempt to execute a payload on a remote machine.

### Assessment and Conclusion:

Given these findings, the activity within the logs, especially the execution of `cmd.exe` and `plink.exe`, and the clearing of the logs are strong indicators of malicious behavior. The evidence suggests an attempt at unauthorized remote access and possibly lateral movement within the network, with actions taken to cover these tracks by clearing logs.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

Given the nature of these events, it's evident that the activity captured in the logs is indicative of malicious actions. Immediate steps should be taken to isolate the system, conduct a thorough forensic analysis, and evaluate the extent of the unauthorized access to determine and mitigate further risk to the environment. Further investigation will include identifying other potentially affected systems and reviewing network traffic logs around the time of suspect activities for additional malicious indicators."
Replace Desktop Wallpaper,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, there are several observations and areas of focus:

### Key Observations:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - Multiple entries across different logs indicate that log files were cleared:
     - System log (Event ID: 104): Cleared by user ""admin_test"" for channels ""System"" and ""Windows PowerShell"".
     - Security log (Event ID: 1102): Indicates the security log was cleared by the same user.
   - The frequent log clearance suggests an attempt to hide activities, which is a common tactic used by malicious actors.

2. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - Unusual PowerShell scripts were executed, changing the desktop wallpaper by downloading an image from an external URL: ""https://redcanary.com/wp-content/uploads/Atomic-Red-Team-Logo.png"".
   - The log entries showcase command-line execution and code injection via PowerShell using `add-type` to define a class to change system settings. Such behavior can indicate a script or attack used to obfuscate or disguise activity on the system.

3. **Process Execution:**
   - The `wevtutil.exe` utility was used to clear event logs (as shown in Sysmon logs), fitting the pattern of an attempt to cover tracks.
   - High integrity level processes like `wevtutil.exe` and `wsmprovhost.exe` are involved, executed by the user ""SERVER002\admin_test"".

4. **Edge Update Processes:**
   - Several entries show processes related to Microsoft Edge updating (e.g., `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`). However, there seems to be no immediate indication that these are involved in unusual or malicious activity on their own.

### Assessment:
The combination of log clearing activities, notable PowerShell script execution, and the use of `wevtutil.exe` strongly suggest malicious behavior. The patterns observed are typical of post-exploitation tactics where an attacker attempts to remain undetected after gaining a foothold on the system.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS** - The activities noted are indicative of malicious actions. The event log clearing, PowerShell script execution designed to alter system behavior, and the process execution hierarchy provide sufficient evidence to classify the activities as malicious.

### Guidance & Next Steps:
- **Immediate Actions:**
  - Isolate the affected host from the network to prevent further potential malicious actions.
  - Conduct a forensic analysis of the host to identify malware or unauthorized access.
  - Check for network connections made by the machine around the event times for further indicators of compromise.
  - Review and tighten security and monitoring on all other devices in the network to spot any similar activities.

- **Long-term Actions:**

  - Ensure endpoint protection solutions are updated and capable of detecting similar PowerShell and log-clearing activities."
Remove Account From Domain Admin Group,"Upon thorough analysis of the provided log entries, several indicators suggest potential malicious activity and possible system compromise:

1. **Event Log Clearing (System logs and Security logs)**:
   - There are multiple entries in both the System log (EventID 104) and Security log (EventID 1102) indicating that logs were cleared by the user ""admin_test"". This action is performed without backing up the logs, which is often an attempt to cover malicious activities.

2. **Wevtutil Executions (Sysmon logs)**:
   - Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` were observed, specifically clearing the logs for different channels such as System, Security, and Windows PowerShell. This is further supported by the command lines observed in the process execution logs. The execution of `wevtutil.exe` with intent to clear logs aligns with suspicious and potentially malicious behavior traditionally used to cover tracks.

3. **Suspicious PowerShell Script Execution (PowerShell logs and Sysmon logs)**:
   - A PowerShell script was executed with a command that manipulates Active Directory group memberships. Specifically, it attempts to remove a user from the ""Domain Admins"" group using credentials constructed within the script. Such behavior is highly suspicious as it involves privilege manipulation and the use of PowerShell with potentially escalated privileges.
   - The script includes plain text password handling and credential objects, adding to its suspicious nature.

4. **Other Observed Behavior**:
   - Execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` can be part of an attacker’s reconnaissance phase to gather environment information.
   - While updates to Microsoft Edge are observed in the logs, the presence of Edge updates does not directly imply malicious activity as it could be routine software maintenance. However, the execution context and timing with other suspicious activities mean they should be reviewed within the wider investigation.

Based on the above findings, the logs contain strong indicators of malicious activities, including attempts to clear logs and a suspicious PowerShell command for domain group manipulation. Therefore, the risk assessed from these logs is high with this activity aligned with stealthy, unauthorized access attempts and privilege escalation.

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS

**Guidance**:
- Immediate investigation and containment actions should be undertaken. Verify the credentials and roles of ""admin_test"" and assess whether they have been compromised.
- Review all PowerShell activity thoroughly on this host and potentially across the environment.
- Check for any unauthorized changes made to group memberships in Active Directory.
- Ensure that you have captured the system for forensic analysis before further actions might clear evidence.
- Reassess security measures, including monitoring and logging configurations, to prevent or quickly identify similar future activities."
Delete User - Windows,"### Detailed Analysis and Evaluation

After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several observations of potentially suspicious or malicious activity can be made:

#### 1. Log Clearing Activity
- **Event ID 104 (System Log) & Event ID 1102 (Security Log):** There are multiple instances of log clearing activity performed by user `admin_test`. Specifically, the logs for the System, Security, and Windows PowerShell channels were cleared. Clearing logs is a common tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks.

#### 2. Time Change Events
- **Event ID 4616 (Security Log):** There are time change events logged, which might not be inherently malicious but, in combination with other suspicious activities, could suggest attempts to manipulate forensic investigation timelines.

#### 3. Suspicious Account Activity
- **Event ID 4720 & 4722:** Account `AtomicUser` was created and then enabled.
- **Event ID 4726:** The same account `AtomicUser` was deleted shortly after its creation. Frequent and rapid creation/deletion of accounts can be indicative of malicious setup activities to gain temporary access.
  
#### 4. Privilege Escalation
- **Event ID 4672 (Security Log):** Indicates that the user `admin_test` was assigned special privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, which can be dangerously leveraged for malicious purposes such as code injection or process manipulation.

#### 5. Command Execution
- **Sysmon Event (Process Creation):** There was suspicious use of `cmd.exe` to add and then delete the `AtomicUser` account using `net user` commands. Additionally, the persistence of the `net.exe` and `net1.exe` processes indicates potential misuse to manage user accounts ('AtomicUser') which was then deleted.

#### 6. Use of System Tools
- **Event ID 1 in the Sysmon logs** shows several executions of system tools like `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `HOSTNAME.EXE`. While these can be used legitimately, they are also frequently leveraged by attackers in reconnaissance and information gathering within a compromised system.

### Threat Assessment

Based on the occurrence of log clearing, suspicious creation and deletion of user accounts, privilege escalation via assignment of special privileges, and the execution of potentially harmful command-line actions, the logs indeed show signs of potentially **malicious** behavior.

### Resolution
The finding is concluded as **MALICIOUS** based on the number of alarmingly suspicious activities, particularly the log clearing events, temporary account creation/deletion, and privilege escalation actions. These actions are classic indicators of compromise and warrant immediate investigation.

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Immediate Containment:** Isolate Server002 to prevent further unauthorized access or damage.
2. **Forensic Analysis:** Conduct a thorough forensic investigation to get to the root cause and origin of the events.
3. **Audit and Monitor:** Increase audit and logging levels on all similar systems to catch anomalies early. Ensure that log management solutions store logs externally and not locally on the systems themselves.
4. **Review Access Policies:** Conduct a review of all admin accounts and privilege allocations, ensuring no unauthorized assignments or accounts persist.
5. **Security Education:** Reeducate users and especially administrative users on secure practices including log handling and the ramifications of unauthorized privilege escalation."
Overwrite deleted data on C drive,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, there are multiple indicators that suggest suspicious and potentially malicious activity. Below are the details and observations drawn from the logs:

1. **Event Log Clearing (Security Events 1102, System Events 104):**
   - The logs indicate that the security logs were cleared by the user ""admin_test"". This action is typically suspicious as malicious actors often clear logs to cover their tracks (for example, EventID 1102 in the Security log; EventIDs 104 in the System log for ""Security"", ""System"", and ""Windows PowerShell"" channels).

2. **Execution of Potentially Dangerous Commands (Sysmon EventID 1):**
   - The ""wevtutil.exe"" utility was used multiple times to clear logs. This is especially concerning given it was followed closely by the execution of ""cmd.exe"" with the command ""cipher.exe /w:C:"". The ""cipher.exe"" with the ""/w"" option is used to overwrite deleted data to prevent recovery, which might be used to conceal activity.
   - These activities were performed by the user ""admin_test"", again raising a red flag towards this account being compromised or used by a malicious insider.

3. **Privilege Escalation:**
   - There's a 4672 event indicating the assignment of special privileges. This includes privileges like SeDebugPrivilege, SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege, SeLoadDriverPrivilege, etc., which are often targeted by attackers for privilege escalation.
   - The user ""admin_test"" was assigned multiple high-level privileges, which further aligns with potential unlawful elevation of permissions.

4. **Anomalous Process Executions:**
   - Frequent executions of system utilities under a user context (“admin_test” for instance) that shouldn't typically run such utilities, especially in the sequence seen (e.g., log clearing followed by cipher usage).

5. **Event Log Time Modifications (EventID 4616):**
   - Events show modifications to the system time, which could be used to manipulate timestamps within event logs to disrupt chronological investigations or to align with attack windows.

Based on these observations, there is a high likelihood of malicious activity, whether external or due to an internal actor abusing elevated permissions. The pattern of log clearing, the subsequent execution of potentially destructive file operations, and attempts to hide tracks are classic indicators of compromise.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**  
The evidence points towards a breach where the actor attempts to cover tracks by clearing logs and takes actions aligning with data presence or file destruction tactics. Immediate actions including disabling the compromised accounts, conducting a broader forensic analysis, and monitoring the system for further anomalous activity are recommended. Furthermore, it's advisable to review access policies and user privileges to check for other potential abuses."
Data Encrypted with GPG4Win,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed assessment of the situation:

### Summary of Logs:

  - Event logs were cleared from the System and Windows PowerShell log channels by the user `admin_test` on `Server002`.
  - This activity happened almost simultaneously.
- **Sysmon Log**:
  - There are multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` being executed to clear logs, each time with high integrity level permissions under the user `admin_test`.
  - A PowerShell command executed reminiscent of post-exploitation activities was observed: PowerShell executing cmd to run Gpg.exe, potentially encrypting a file.
- **Security Log**:
  - Event logs were cleared, and this corresponds directly to actions taken by the `admin_test` account.
  - Multiple logs on user account enumeration from `CompatTelRunner.exe`.
- **Windows PowerShell Log**:
  - PowerShell activities also show the execution of command lines closely aligned with encryption operations, using Gpg.exe.

### Indicators of Suspicious/Malicious Activity:
1. **Log Clearing**: 
   - Clearing logs is a suspicious activity, often associated with an attempt to cover tracks after potentially malicious actions.

2. **Usage of `wevtutil.exe`**:

Windows - Disable Windows Recovery Console Repair,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified several points of interest that may indicate suspicious or malicious activity:

1. **Security Log (EventID 1102: Log File Cleared)**:
   - The presence of a Security log with EventID 1102 indicates that the security event logs have been cleared by the user `admin_test`. Clearing logs is typically a malicious action to cover tracks, and it’s highly suspicious in a security context. 

2. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - Sysmon logs show the execution of multiple processes with administrative privileges by the user `admin_test`. Of particular interest is the execution of `cmd.exe` with a command line involving `bcdedit.exe` to modify boot and recovery policies. The command executed is:
     ```
     ""cmd.exe"" /c bcdedit.exe /set {default} bootstatuspolicy ignoreallfailures & bcdedit.exe /set {default} recoveryenabled no
     ```
   - This action disables error recovery and ignores all failures during boot, which is not typical for legitimate administrative actions unless trying to suppress failure notifications or prevent recovery options from appearing during boot—both of which can be part of a malicious actor’s attempt to ensure a compromised state persists or goes unnoticed.

3. **System and Application Logs**:
   - Logs also indicate the clearing of system logs (EventID 104) by `admin_test`, which aligns with the behavior of log clearing in the Security log and further indicates attempts to cover tracks by the same user.

### Assessment
The combination of log clearance actions and execution of commands to alter critical Windows boot configuration settings under high integrity levels strongly indicates potentially malicious behavior. Given the context and the nature of changes being made to the system configuration, log tampering, and covering tracks, this scenario aligns closely with common tactics used in system compromise scenarios.

### Resolution
- **Resolution**: MALICIOUS
- **Assessment**: The actions recorded in these logs are consistent with malicious activity, including tampering with system configuration to suppress errors and interference in log management to hide evidence of activity.

### Guidance on How to Proceed
1. **Immediate Response**:
   - Disconnect the affected host (`Server002`) from the network to prevent any further potentially harmful actions or data exfiltration.

2. **Investigation**:
   - Conduct a thorough investigation into user `admin_test`'s activities, including reviewing any retained logs, network traffic, and file modifications during the time of interest.
   
3. **Containment and Eradication**:

These activities were conducted by ""admin_test"" and suggest privilege escalation or unauthorized account creation.

3. **Suspicious Command-Line Activity**:
   - The execution of several command-line utilities with elevated privileges, especially `wevtutil.exe` to clear event logs (captured in Sysmon logs with ProcessID of `2980`, `1444`, and others) indicates potential malicious behavior meant to hinder monitoring and investigation.

4. **Usage of Commands like `net.exe` and `net1.exe`**:
   - There are logs showing the execution of commands related to managing user accounts (`net user`) that add the user 'AtomicAdministrator' and change its password, implying potential unauthorized attempts to create backdoor access.

5. **Outdated or Unauthorized Software Updates**:
   - Series of activities around the Microsoft Edge Update, which could be benign, but if unauthorized, they can be used as disguised methods to run or inject malicious code.

### Assessment:
Given the activities observed in the logs, notably log clearing, unauthorized user account modifications, and usage of command-line tools to manipulate user accounts, it strongly suggests malicious activity aimed at gaining and maintaining unauthorized access.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS** - The patterns of user and log manipulation are typical indicators of an attempt to compromise a system. Immediate actions should be taken to investigate the extent of access gained, revoke unauthorized user access, and assess additional risks posed to the network and systems.

### Guidance:
1. **Lock Down ""admin_test"" Account**: Immediately disable or closely monitor any suspicious accounts involved in log activities, especially ""admin_test"".
2. **Audit Active Directory and User Accounts**: Review all recent changes to detect any unauthorized accounts or privilege escalation attempts.
3. **Enhance Monitoring**: Enable enhanced logging and monitoring to detect any continued attempts at unauthorized access.
4. **Conduct a Full Security Audit**: Assess the system for any malicious software or further indicators of compromise.
5. **Forensic Investigation**: Consider engaging a digital forensic team to analyze the extent of the breach and ensure the integrity of critical systems."
PureLocker Ransom Note,"Upon analyzing the event logs from the Windows host named ""Server002,"" there are several points of interest indicative of suspicious or potentially malicious activity:

### Key Findings:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - Events with ID `104` in the System log indicate the System and Windows PowerShell event logs were cleared by a user named `admin_test`. Such activities can be indicative of an attempt to cover tracks on the system after conducting potentially malicious activities.

2. **Command Use for Clearing Logs:**
   - The Sysmon logs show processes with `wevtutil.exe` being used by `admin_test` to clear logs (e.g., Event ID `17957` showing `CommandLine` as `""C:\Windows\system32\wevtutil.exe"" cl Application`). This tool is commonly misused by attackers to erase logs.

3. **Suspicious PowerShell and cmd Command Activity:**
   - System logs show the use of `cmd.exe` with a command that echos Purelocker Ransom Note (identified as tactic `T1486 - Purelocker Ransom Note`) into a text file on the Desktop (`Event ID 17981`). This is a strong indicator of ransomware activity or simulation.

4. **Time Change Events:**
   - Event ID `4616` in the Security log indicates time change activities by `LOCAL SERVICE`. This could either be benign or an attempt to manipulate timestamps on a system to obscure logging results.

### Detailed Assessment:

The logs indicate suspicious behavior with potential signs of system compromise:
- The clearing of logs is a significant red flag as it suggests an intention to hide actions on the system. This is coupled with evidence of misuse of system administrative tools such as `wevtutil.exe`.
- The cmd command directly related to creating a ransomware note is strongly indicative of possible malware activity, highlighting a transition from suspicious to potentially malicious intent.
- Log entries indicating the time change, while potentially benign, combined with the above indicators, can suggest the manipulation of system settings by unauthorized users.

### Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

Based on the evidence provided, the activities observed in these logs demonstrate clear malicious intent, with indicators of possible ransomware activity and deliberate clearing of logs to cover tracks. 

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Response:**
   - Discontinue the use of ""Server002"" from the network to prevent further potential spread of malicious software.
   - Begin incident response procedures to assess the full scope of the compromise.
   
2. **Forensic Investigation:**
   - Retrieve and preserve all available logs, including network traffic logs and backups, for further forensic analysis.
   - Investigate any data exfiltration or unauthorized access that may have occurred.

3. **Review and Mitigation:**
   - Perform a comprehensive review of user accounts, especially focusing on activity under the `admin_test` account.
   - Secure systems by applying patches, updating antivirus software, and monitoring for anomalous activities.

4. **Report the Incident:**
   - Formally report this incident to appropriate internal and external security teams and regulatory bodies as necessary.
   - Consider user education programs and reviews of policies to prevent future incidents.

Based on the logs reviewed, the observed activity is consistent with malicious behavior, requiring immediate attention and remediation."
Windows - Overwrite file with SysInternals SDelete,"Upon analyzing the provided logs from the Windows host, Server002, several suspicious activities have been identified:

1. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - **Security Log Clearing**: Event ID 1102 logged at ""2024-10-26 19:14:36"" indicates the security logs were cleared by the user ""admin_test"". This is a notable action suggesting an attempt to cover tracks of potential malicious activity.
   - **System Log Clearing**: Event ID 104 shows that system logs, including Windows PowerShell logs, were cleared by the same user. This behavior is highly suspicious since clearing logs is typically done to hide unauthorized actions.

2. **Use of PowerShell for Potentially Malicious Activity**:
   - The PowerShell logs indicate execution of a script that interacts with a tool named `sdelete.exe` on ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\ExternalPayloads\\T1485.txt"" (PowerShell Log Event IDs 1069-1075). This tool belongs to Sysinternals and is often used to securely delete files beyond recovery. The associated paths and file (`T1485.txt`) are linked to known malicious testing suite Atomic Red Team which suggests data deletion (a tactic in cybersecurity attacks).

3. **Reported Commands Executed**:
   - `wevtutil.exe cl` commands were executed multiple times (Sysmon Log Event IDs 17977, 17981, 17985, and 17989) which aligns with event log clearing actions.
   - The use of `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `whoami.exe` in quick succession (Event ID 17997 and 18001 respectively) can be part of reconnaissance to check system and user information in an unauthorized manner.

4. **Command Execution by SYSTEM**:
   - The scheduled tasks and command executions using `taskhostw.exe`, `Compattelrunner.exe`, and other system executables indicate SYSTEM account activity. While not inherently malicious, they should be correlated with scheduled tasks/jobs, especially since they occur around the same timeframe of suspicious activity.

Given these observations, the overall assessment of the logs indicates potential malicious activities including log deletion and unauthorized use of PowerShell, combined with secure delete operations. The identification of clearing logs and using known tools for file deletion strongly indicate attempts to hide activities indicative of compromise or preparation for malicious actions.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

**Guidance**:
- Immediately conduct a full forensic investigation on `SERVER002` to understand the scope and impact of the activity.
- Determine the source and intent of the PowerShell scripts and the sdelete.exe binary.
- Review and audit user accounts, particularly ""admin_test"", for unauthorized access or use.
- Implement or review existing security measures, such as enhanced monitoring and log retention policies, to prevent similar future occurrences."
Windows - Delete Volume Shadow Copies,"Based on the analysis of the provided logs, several indicators of potentially malicious activity have been identified:

1. **Use of `vssadmin.exe`:**
    - The use of `vssadmin.exe delete shadows /all /quiet` is suspicious. Threat actors often use this command to delete shadow copies to prevent the recovery of encrypted files, typically indicative of ransomware activity. The presence of `vssadmin.exe list shadows` command also suggests an attempt to check for existing shadow copies before potentially executing malicious commands to delete them.

2. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - The events indicating the clearing of system, security, and PowerShell event logs (with Event IDs 104 and 1102) are common tactics used by attackers to remove evidence of their activity and make forensic analysis more difficult.

3. **Command Line Usage by `admin_test`:**
   - The `admin_test` user executed `wevtutil` commands to clear logs. The execution context with high integrity level and the command history is consistent with actions meant to obfuscate user actions.

4. **Sequence and Timing of Actions:**
   - The sequence of executing `vssadmin` and `wevtutil` followed by clearing logs happens in quick succession, which is characteristic of automated scripts or malicious actions focusing on ransomware deployment.

**Threats and Risks Identified:**
- The actions detailed in the logs are consistent with malicious activity, specifically potential ransomware behavior, and attempts to cover tracks by cleaning logs.
- The actions taken could suggest an ongoing compromise or a recent ransomware attack.

**Guidance:**
- Immediate containment should be considered for the affected system (Server002) to prevent further spread or damage.
- A full forensic investigation should be conducted to understand the extent of the breach.
- Restore any backed-up versions of logs and any other critical data if needed.
- Review and enhance security measures, such as improved monitoring and logging, user behavior analytics, and endpoint security solutions.

**Resolution:**
- **MALICIOUS** - The logs contain clear indicators of malicious activity. Immediate remedial action is warranted."
Logoff System - Windows,"Upon analyzing the provided event logs from the Windows host, there are multiple indicators that suggest potential suspicious activity, primarily involving log manipulation and process execution. Here is a detailed analysis of the events:

1. **Log File Clearing**:
   - **System and Security Log Cleared**: The System log (EventID: 104) was cleared by a user with the username ""admin_test"". The Security log (EventID: 1102) was also cleared by the same user at nearly the same timestamp. Clearing logs can often indicate an attempt to cover tracks, which is a common behavior in post-compromise scenarios to hide evidence of malicious activities.

2. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - **Repeated Usage**: There are multiple entries of `wevtutil.exe` being executed with the command-line argument to clear (`cl`) various logs: Application, System, Security, and Windows PowerShell logs. This tool is typically used for managing event logs in Windows, and its command-line usage here is explicitly to clear logs, reinforcing the suspicion of covering tracks.

3. **Process Execution Analysis**:
   - Multiple processes such as `cmd.exe`, `shutdown.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `hostname.exe` were executed. Particularly, `cmd.exe` was executed with a shutdown command which indicates an attempt to log off or shutdown the system, possibly to disrupt further logging or detection efforts.
   - Processes were executed with a high integrity level, which might be indicative of elevated privileges being used.

4. **Edge Update Entries**:
   - The entries related to Microsoft Edge Update appear to be automatic update processes conducted under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` user. These appear normal and consistent with expected system update activities.

**Conclusion and Assessment**:
- The activity of clearing log files using `wevtutil.exe` by the user ""admin_test"" is highly suspicious and indicative of an attempt to hide potential malicious actions.
- The combination of actions (log clearing and system commands like shutdown) suggests an effort to obscure activities performed on the system.

**Resolution**: Given the combination of log clearing events and command-line executions aimed at system shutdown or log management, the behavior observed is strongly concerning and suggests potential malicious intent.

**Resolution Status**: **MALICIOUS**

**Recommendation**:
- Initiate a thorough forensic investigation on the host to identify any unauthorized access or malicious software.
- Review IAM policies and access logs to determine how the user ""admin_test"" obtained such privileges. 
- Ensure security monitoring tools are actively logging to detect further similar actions.
- Implement alerting for specific event IDs such as log clearing (1102, 104) and command-line execution that involves `wevtutil.exe`."
Azure AD - Delete user via Azure AD PowerShell,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

Upon careful investigation of the provided logs, the following analysis outlines key indicators of potentially malicious activities:

1. **Log Clearing Events:**
   - System and Security logs were cleared by the user ""admin_test"" (Event ID 104 in System logs and Event ID 1102 in Security logs). Clearing of logs, especially by a user with administrative privileges, can be a sign of an attempt to cover tracks post-compromise.

2. **Unusual Command-Line Execution:**
   - **Sysmon Events:**
     - Powershell executed with the command `""C:\Windows\system32\wevtutil.exe"" cl`, which is used to clear event logs, suggesting possible log tampering or track covering.
     - A PowerShell command to connect to AzureAD and remove a user, `Remove-AzureADUser -ObjectId $userprincipalname`, was executed by ""admin_test"". This command is suspicious as it indicates administrative control over Azure AD, which could lead to account misuse or service disruption.
   - **PowerShell Events:**
     - Reflects the execution of PowerShell commands related to AzureAD user management, which is suspicious if not authorized or expected.

3. **Event Log Correspondence:**
   - Timing between events such as log clearing and executing potentially harmful PowerShell scripts aligns tightly, indicating a coordinated and possibly automated process executed with malicious intent.

4. **Privilege Escalation and Elevated Tokens (Security Events):**
   - Event ID 4672 shows a user obtaining several high-level privileges, which could indicate an attempt to gain unauthorized access or escalate privileges.

### Assessment

The logs demonstrate several incidents that align with malicious behavior patterns:
- **Log clearing** suggests an attempt to erase evidence, a common tactic following unauthorized actions.
- **Execution of PowerShell scripts** involving AzureAD manipulation shows potential misuse of administrative privileges.
- **Privileged operations and escalation** indicate possible unauthorized access attempts.

### Conclusion and Resolution

Based on the provided logs:
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Immediate Containment:**
   - Ensure the user ""admin_test"" is investigated, and relevant accounts are secured.
   - Conduct a broader investigation to determine any further compromises.

2. **Log Analysis and Recovery:**
   - Restore cleared logs, if possible, from backups for a thorough review.
   - Enable stricter monitoring and alerting for log-clearing activities.

3. **Review of User Activities:**
   - Scrutinize recent activity from ""admin_test"" and other privileged users for any unauthorized or suspicious actions.

4. **Enhancing Security Measures:**
   - Enhance endpoint security, including deploying anti-malware tools and conducting regular auditing of administrative actions.
   - Consider implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA) and robust logging for AzureAD.

5. **Forensic Investigation:**
   - Engage a Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR) team to perform a detailed investigation and ensure no further threats are lurking within the network."
Windows - Stop service using net.exe,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, key indicators suggest potentially malicious activity. Here are the relevant findings:

1. **Log Clearance Detected**: There are multiple instances where event logs, specifically the System, Windows PowerShell, and Security logs, were cleared by the user `admin_test`:
   - System Log Cleared (`EventID: 104`)
   - Windows PowerShell Log Cleared
   - Security Log Cleared (`EventID: 1102`)
   
   Log clearing is typically suspicious, as it can be an indication of an attempt to cover tracks after potentially malicious activity.

2. **Command Execution**: A sequence of command executions was identified that involved stopping the Windows Print Spooler service:
   - PowerShell was used to execute a command that included `net.exe stop spooler`, which may denote an attempt to disable a service for malicious purposes, such as facilitating further unauthorized actions or potentially exploiting printer-related vulnerabilities.

3. **Privilege Usage**: There is a record of privilege usage by the user `admin_test`:
   - Event 4672 indicates the assignment of several high-level privileges (SeSecurityPrivilege, SeDebugPrivilege, etc.) to the user.
   
   The assignment or use of such privileges in conjunction with other suspicious activities further raises concerns about potential unauthorized actions.

4. **Time Change**: There are events indicating a system time change, which can be used to confuse event timelines and hinder forensic analysis (EventID: 24 and 4616).

5. **Executable Activities**: Execution of system utilities, such as `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`, appears sporadically around the time of suspicious log activities, which aligns with potential efforts to manipulate or query logs programmatically.

Given these activities and their combination, the logs showcase a high likelihood of compromise. The consistent theme of log clearing and process execution patterns strongly suggests an effort to conceal unauthorized activities.

### Assessment:
**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance:
- Immediately perform a thorough forensic analysis on `Server002` to identify any unauthorized changes or access.
- Review user account `admin_test` for unauthorized access or compromise.
- Revoke and re-validate credentials for any accounts involved.
- Investigate network logs for suspicious connections tied to user activity.
- Patch and secure any systems that were potentially exploited, such as services stopped or altered (e.g., Print Spooler).
- Enhance security monitoring and logging to prevent and quickly detect similar incidents in the future."
