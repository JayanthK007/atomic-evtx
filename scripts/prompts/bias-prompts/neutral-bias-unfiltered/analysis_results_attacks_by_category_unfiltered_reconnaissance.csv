Enumerate PlugNPlay Camera,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs:

Upon reviewing the logs, the following observations are made:

#### System Log Analysis:
1. **Log File Clearing:** The event with EventID 104 indicates that the ""admin_test"" user cleared logs for the System and Windows PowerShell channels.
   - **Concerns:** Log clearance can be an indicator of malicious activity if done to cover tracks. It is suspicious when legitimate users clear logs without a good reason.

2. **Time Adjustment Logs:** The Kernel-General EventIDs 1 and 24 indicate minor system time adjustments. This could be benign or related to sync issues with the time server.
   - **Concerns:** Though frequent time changes can be used in evasion techniques, in this context, there is no evident pattern or immediate concern.

#### Security Log Analysis:
1. **Audit Log Clearance Event:** The occurrence of EventID 1102, where ""admin_test"" cleared Security logs, is alarming because it suggests an attempt to erase evidence of certain activities.
   - **Concerns:** Direct correlation with malicious activity when accompanied by other indicators like unauthorized logon events and privilege escalation.

2. **Privilege Escalation:** EventID 4672 identifies that ""admin_test"" was granted special privileges, including SeDebugPrivilege, which can be concerning if not expected.
   - **Concerns:** Combined with log clearance, this is suspicious as such privileges can be abused for unauthorized access or activities.

#### Application Log:
- Logs involving typical service start and stop events, specifically related to edge updates, exhibit no direct signs of malicious intent. However, correlation with system and security log events could imply something suspicious regarding the timing.

#### Windows PowerShell Log:
1. **Suspicious Command Execution:** PowerShell event logs indicate ""Get-CimInstance"" queries. While this command is legitimate, it is often used within scripts or manual commands to gather system information.
   - **Concerns:** PowerShell usage should be correlated with other suspicious activities, especially after logs have been cleared by the same user.

#### Sysmon Log Analysis:
1. **Wevtutil Usage:** Multiple instances of ""wevtutil"" are noted â€” a command-line utility for managing Windows events. Frequent invocation during a short time frame, especially after clear logs events, is suspicious.
   - **Concerns:** This tool can be used to clear logs, indicating an attempt to manipulate system logging facilities.

2. **Execution of WHOAMI and HOSTNAME:** Instances of basic system information commands (whoami, hostname) were executed. While not inherently malicious, context matters, such as execution after privilege escalation and log clearances.

### Final Assessment:
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Conclusion:
There are clear indicators of possible compromise:
- The clearing of system, security, and PowerShell logs by ""admin_test.""
- Granting of privileges that can be potentially abused.
- Execution of tools commonly associated with clearing logs (`wevtutil`) and information gathering (`PowerShell` commands) in sequence.

### Recommended Guidance:
- Further investigate ""admin_test"" actions, audit recent account activity, and validate if such activities align with legitimate responsibilities.
- Check for unauthorized user access, potential insider threats, or system exploits that may have been leveraged.
- Review recent changes to user privileges and validate necessity.
- Strengthen logging and monitoring policies, ensuring logs are being sent to a secure external system to prevent local tampering.
- Initiate steps for incident response and containment, including isolating the compromised machine if needed and performing a full security assessment."
