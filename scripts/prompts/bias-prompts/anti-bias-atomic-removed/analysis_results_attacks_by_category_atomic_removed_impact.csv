Modify VSS Service Permissions,"**Detailed Analysis of the Logs:**

### Security Log Analysis:
1. **Event ID 4616**: Adjusting the system time by the `LOCAL SERVICE` account using `svchost.exe`. The existence of multiple closely-timed instances of time adjustment can be an indicator of stealthy activity. Although, adjusting time for time synchronization can be normal.
   
2. **Event ID 4634**: Logoff event for user `admin_test`. This is typical behavior when a user session ends.
   
3. **Event IDs 4624, 4672**: Logins and assigning special privileges to `admin_test`. The logon type 3 indicates a network logon, which is typical but coupled with elevated privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, could indicate a potential risk if not justified by the user's role.

### Sysmon Log Analysis:
1. **Sysmon Event ID 1 & 5**: Repeated execution of system utilities such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `cmd.exe` by `admin_test`. The command line for `cmd.exe` involving `sc sdset VSS ...` suggests modification of service permissions which could be malicious if unauthorized. The inclusion of high privileges indicates potential privilege escalation attempts.

2. **Normal Processes**: Execution of process management and update activities related to Microsoft Edge Update by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. These are common background tasks for system maintenance and updates and appear benign.

### System and Application Log Analysis:
1. **Event ID 24 and Event ID 1 (Kernel-General)**: Reflects time changes which correlate with Security event logs (Event ID 4616). This dual logging validates time adjustments.
   
2. **Application Logs**: The logs mention ""Service stopped"" for `edgeupdate`, likely indicating service routine stops, which can be normal under routine update cycles.

### Summary of Findings:
- **Suspicious Activity**:
  - The adjustment of time by `LOCAL SERVICE` and the frequent, high-privilege logons for the user `admin_test` can be considered suspicious, especially given the usage of high-privilege permissions.
  - The execution of a command to alter service settings (`sc sdset VSS ...`) could indicate malicious intent if not part of authorized administrative tasks.
  
- **Benign Activity**:
  - Microsoft Edge update processes appear to be standard operations from the logs and are manifested as system maintenance actions.

### Conclusion and Recommendation:
Based on the analysis, the logs primarily suggest **SUSPICIOUS** activity due to administrative actions involving privilege escalation, time adjustments, and modification of system-level permissions. 

### Guidance:
- **Immediate Actions**: 
  - Verify the legitimacy of the user `admin_test` and their roles/permissions. Investigate the necessity of the privileges assigned.
  - Check for any unauthorized use of the `cmd.exe` command and review change history logs for the VSS service.
  
- **Further Investigation**: 
  - Conduct more extensive auditing on the `admin_test` activities to identify the root cause and potential origins of the time adjustments and privilege escalations.
  - Capture more network logs, file integrity checks, or anomaly detection for aberrations correlating with this account and server activity.

Consider instituting stricter audit policies on privilege use and system time changes to prevent potential misuse."
Disable System Restore Through Registry,"After conducting a detailed analysis of the provided Windows event logs, some observations and findings are as follows:

### Benign Activities:
- Many of the log entries are related to the normal operations of Microsoft Edge Update (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`), including system updates and service operations. These processes are typically run under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` account with a system integrity level, which is standard for system services.
- Processes such as `sppsvc.exe` (Software Protection Platform Service) and routine commands like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` operations appear to be consistent with normal system administration tasks.

### Suspicious and Potentially Malicious Activity:
- Multiple entries exist where `cmd.exe` was used to execute commands that modify registry settings related to system restore options (`DisableConfig` and `DisableSR`). This can often indicate an attempt to disable system restore, a tactic used by malicious actors to limit recovery options after compromise. The commands were executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, which raises the question of whether this action was intentional and authorized by an actual administrator.
- The registry keys modified (`HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows NT\SystemRestore` and `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\SystemRestore`) are specifically related to preventing system restore—a common method for making it difficult to recover from potential system changes or infections.
  
### Assessment:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: While the majority of log entries appear to show normal operation, the specific registry modifications for disabling system restore functions are concerning. This could point to either a misconfigured or potential unauthorized action that needs further investigation. 

### Recommendation:
1. **Verify Intent**: Confirm with the system administrators (or user `admin_test`) whether these registry alterations were intentional and for a legitimate purpose.
2. **Review System Restore Policies**: Evaluate whether similar changes have been implemented across other systems to ensure it’s not an oversight.
3. **Monitoring and Alerts**: Implement monitoring rules or alerts for unusual registry changes, especially those affecting system restore capabilities.
4. **Review Integrity**: If no authorization was given, consider reviewing the integrity of this system to identify any unauthorized access or potentially compromised accounts.

In conclusion, given the suspicious behavior around registry modifications, further investigation is required, particularly into the actions performed by `cmd.exe` for possible malicious intent or unauthorized administrative actions. The logs warrant a SUSPICIOUS resolution."
Windows - Delete Volume Shadow Copies via WMI,"Upon careful review of the provided Windows event logs, there are several points of interest that stand out and deserve further analysis:

1. **Use of VSSADMIN and CMD.EXE:**
   - The logs show the execution of `vssadmin.exe` with the command `vssadmin.exe list shadows`. This is followed by an execution of `findstr.exe`.
   - There is another entry indicating the use of `cmd.exe` with the command `wmic.exe shadowcopy delete`, which is suspicious. The deletion of shadow copies is often associated with ransomware activity to prevent data recovery.

2. **Suspicious Command Execution:**
   - The command `vssadmin.exe list shadows` and subsequent `wmic.exe shadowcopy delete` can indicate a malicious activity aimed at manipulating or deleting Volume Shadow Copies. This could be part of ransomware preparations to ensure that backup copies are not available for recovery.

3. **Multiple Execution of EdgeUpdate:**
   - Across various logs, multiple executions of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` were observed. While these normally pertain to legitimate software updates, their frequency and the overlapping timing with suspicious activities should not be dismissed without further investigation.

4. **Process Execution Chain:**
   - The processes, such as `cmd.exe`, `vssadmin.exe`, and `wmic.exe`, are executed under the context of `SERVER002\\admin_test` with high integrity level. The origin and intention of these commands need confirmation from the user to verify if these were intended actions.

5. **Absence of Security and PowerShell Logs:**
   - It's noteworthy that the logs from Security and PowerShell are missing, which limits the ability to cross-check for additional suspicious activity or validate whether PowerShell scripts executed suspicious commands.

**Assessment:**
- The observed use of `vssadmin.exe` and `wmic.exe` in combination with the deletion of shadow copies is a significant indicator of potentially malicious activity.
- The presence of multiple EdgeUpdate executions in quick succession can be harmless; however, the strategic timing around the execution of suspicious commands raises concerns.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
- While the behavior observed is consistent with potential malicious activity, specifically relating to ransomware, it is not conclusive without further corroboration from other data sources such as missing Security logs, user confirmation, or endpoint detection systems.
  
**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Immediate Steps:**
   - Verify with the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` regarding the execution of these commands to ascertain if they were authorized or expected.
   - Conduct a review of recent updates or maintenance activities that required shadow copy manipulations.
   - Consult network or endpoint monitoring tools for any anomalous activities coinciding with these timestamped events.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Review additional logs (if available) like Security and PowerShell to seek clarity and context around these activities.
   - If ransomware is suspected, engage in a thorough examination of recent file changes on the system, ensuring backup data integrity and reviewing for any encryption activity.

3. **Prevention and Monitoring:**
   - Ensure processes like `vssadmin.exe` and `wmic.exe` actions are better monitored to catch potential overreaches.
   - Implement behavior-based detection mechanisms to alert on typical ransomware tactics.

Proceed with heightened diligence given the indicators, but more evidence is necessary to classify the activity as truly malicious."

ESXi - Avoslocker enumerates VMs and forcefully kills VMs,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, I've conducted a detailed analysis to identify any indicators of potentially malicious activity. Here is a breakdown of my findings:

### Analysis of Logs:

1. **Application Log:**
   - Entries related to ""Microsoft-Windows-Security-SPP"" and ""edgeupdate"" show typical system maintenance and service updates. The stopping of the ""edgeupdate"" service is common for when an update is in progress and doesn't indicate malicious activity.

2. **Sysmon Log:**
   - A series of process creations involving legitimate Windows utilities such as `powershell.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `whoami.exe` were observed under the user ""SERVER002\admin_test"" with high integrity levels. These may not inherently suggest malicious activity, but they demonstrate an administration-like behavior that may warrant further scrutiny based on account activity policies.
   - A highly suspicious entry is observed with the `cmd.exe` execution using command-line arguments involving `plink.exe`, which is a tool used for SSH tunneling, with hardcoded credentials (`-l ""root"" -pw ""pass""`). The script path ""esx_avoslocker_kill_vm.txt"" implies activity associated with potential control or exploitation of VMware ESXi environments, possibly relating to ransomware activities (e.g., AvosLocker).
   - Notably, the command-line argument execution path is using obfuscation techniques such as `\\??\\` or `..\\` path traversals, often associated with malicious activity to bypass standard directory path checks.

3. **Edge Update Processes:**
   - Multiple instances of the ""MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe"" process indicate regular software update operations by Microsoft Edge, which appear normal and procedural.

### Conclusion:

The logs primarily consist of legitimate activity related to updates and regular system processes. However, the execution of `plink.exe` with SSH credentials and the execution of a file potentially associated with ESXi environments is highly suspicious and indicative of malicious activity.

### Recommendation:

Based on the command execution observed, the logs should be classified as **MALICIOUS**. This incident should be escalated immediately to the incident response team for further investigation. The following actions are recommended:
- **Immediate isolation** of the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent potential spread or further access.
- **Review and contain** any VMware infrastructure that may be compromised.
- Change all credentials that were potentially exposed or affected by this breach.
- Conduct a thorough forensic investigation on the machine, focusing on logs and artifacts corresponding with the timestamps observed.
- Ensure enhanced monitoring and alerts for this type of behavior on other systems within the network."
Replace Desktop Wallpaper,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, here's a detailed observation:

### System Log:
- The System logs primarily deal with time adjustments: kernel general events related to time update and the Windows Time Service selecting an NTP server. This is standard behavior for maintaining system time accuracy.

### Windows PowerShell Log:
- A PowerShell script was executed that downloads an image from a URL (`https://file.com/wp-content/uploads/file-file-Logo.png`) and changes the desktop wallpaper. 
- The script makes use of `System.Runtime.InteropServices` to call Windows API functions. While changing wallpapers might seem benign, the process of downloading a file over the internet and changing system settings via a script could be indicative of mal-intended behavior, especially if run without user consent or understanding.
- The execution under the `admin_test` user account suggests this action was performed with elevated privileges.

### Application Log:
- The Application log entries indicate routine edge update events with service stopping and starting messages, which is typical for application updates and installations.

### Security Log:
- The Security log concerns a time change event, matching the System log adjustments to system time using `svchost.exe`. There's nothing out of the ordinary regarding potential security threats from the data provided.

### Sysmon Log:
- Sysmon logs show several process creation events related to system tools like `wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and PowerShell execution traced back to a PowerShell script altering the wallpaper as seen in the PowerShell logs.
- Several events pertain to Microsoft Edge Update processes, which is routine as per system application updates.

### Assessment & Conclusion:
- **Suspicious Activity**: The PowerShell script stands out due to its capability to run commands for downloading and executing file changes across the system, potentially indicative of a script being used for purposes beyond its intent, unless run by a trusted user for specific administrative actions.
- **Edge Update Processes**: Appear routine and service-related, aligning with expected application update procedures.

### Final Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: Presence of a PowerShell script that involves downloading content and interacting with system settings suggests this log collection needs further investigation. Engage the user/admin inquiring about the rationale behind the PowerShell script execution and verify that this action aligns with documented activities or administrative tasks. Ensure no unauthorized scripts or suspicious scheduled tasks are present on the evaluated host.

**Guidance**:
- Validate whether the modified wallpaper action is part of a legitimate administrative task.
- Conduct a thorough inspection of the downloaded file and ensure no backdoors or additional malware have been introduced.
- If malicious activity is suspected or confirmed, an incident response should be initiated, and appropriate remedial actions must be taken, such as user awareness training and enhanced monitoring of scripts and internet downloads."
Remove Account From Domain Admin Group,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I've identified several sequences and activities that warrant further investigation:

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - A PowerShell command was executed using the command line to potentially manipulate Active Directory by attempting to remove a user from the Domain Admins group. The command matched the following:
     ```
     ""powershell.exe"" & {$PWord = ConvertTo-SecureString -String password -AsPlainText -Force; $Credential = New-Object -TypeName System.Management.Automation.PSCredential -ArgumentList domain\super_user, $PWord; if((Get-ADUser remove_user -Properties memberof).memberof -like ""CN=Domain Admins*""){ Remove-ADGroupMember -Identity ""Domain Admins"" -Members remove_user -Credential $Credential -Confirm:$False } else{ write-host ""Error - Make sure remove_user is in the domain admins group"" -foregroundcolor Red }}
     ```
   - This command suggests privilege alteration attempts through PowerShell, which is a known vector for malware and insider threats.

2. **User and Process Context**:
   - PowerShell and other processes like `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` were executed under the context of the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"" with high integrity level, indicating elevated permissions usage.
   - The environment host was ""SERVER002"", and the user ID was consistently ""S-1-5-18"", showing this may have been executed through a system or administrative account.

3. **Edge Update Executions**:
   - Several instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related processes were logged. The use of the system account (NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM) is typical for services and updates, though is usually benign, this paired with other suspicious activity needs monitoring.

4. **Command Usage**:
   - The use of `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `WHOAMI.EXE`, when reviewed independently, is normal for system diagnostics but could be seen aligned with other suspicious activities for information gathering or system survey by unauthorized users.

### Threats and Risks Identified:

- **Privilege Escalation**: The PowerShell script indicates attempts to alter domain admin group memberships, which can signify a direct attempt at privilege escalation and unauthorized access or alteration of security settings.
  
- **Operational Security Concerns**: Execution of administrative tasks by ""admin_test"" using high integrity processes indicates potential misuse or unauthorized script execution that could lead to data breaches or credential compromise.
  
### Resolution:

The logs present indicators of what could be compromising behavior. The PowerShell command to alter Domain Admin group memberships in conjunction with the use of elevated privilege accounts presents a significant operational threat.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

### Recommended Actions:

1. **Immediate Investigation**:
   - Review administrative user activity from any recent sessions on ""SERVER002"".
   - Verify the intent and authorization of the PowerShell script executed by ""admin_test"".

2. **Audit and Monitoring**:
   - Conduct a complete audit trail for the account ""admin_test"" across the domain.
   - Enhance monitoring for PowerShell activity and other command executions under high privilege accounts.

3. **Containment and Future Prevention**:
   - Review and possibly revise group membership policies to require additional verification.

These steps should help clarify the nature of the suspicious activities and mitigate any potential threats."
Delete User - Windows,"Upon careful analysis of the provided logs, several activities stand out:

1. **Time Changes in System Logs:**
   - The system log shows a series of time adjustments. This could be expected if the system time is updated from an NTP server like `time.windows.com`. However, frequent or unexplained time changes may indicate potential tampering with system time to mask activities or manipulate logs.

2. **Security Logs:**
   - Multiple Event ID 4616 events indicate time change activities initiated by `svchost.exe`, which is not unusual for time synchronization. However, it's necessary to ensure it's legitimate.
   - Event ID 4624 indicates a successful login using the NTLM authentication package, which is typical in domains but could be checked for compliance with login policies, especially given the administrative privileges involved.
   - Event ID 4672 highlights that the `admin_test` user was granted special privileges. This can be suspicious if unexpected, as it includes privileges such as SeDebugPrivilege which can potentially be used to bypass system security.
   - Event IDs 4720, 4722, 4738, 4724, and 4726 refer to changes in user accounts (`fileUser`), where they are created, modified, and then deleted. The commands used to accomplish this account manipulation (`net user`) imply that an administrative account performed these actions.

3. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Execution of `cmd.exe` with commands for adding and removing a user account (`net user`) indicates potential malicious behavior. This is often seen in unauthorized privilege escalations or lateral movement attempts.
   - Use of other command-line tools such as `whoami.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `conhost.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` can be part of normal operations but their frequent invocation could suggest malicious script execution.
   - Multiple instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` suggest updates or installations. However, the use of temporary directories in the path could potentially indicate an attempt to execute or load something from a non-standard directory, raising suspicion.

**Assessment:**
- The logs contain activities typical of both regular administrative tasks and potentially malicious intent. The addition and removal of the `fileUser` account, along with the assignment of high privileges, are actions commonly exploited in malicious scenarios.
- Given the context, the creation and deletion of a user account with administrative privileges (through command-line), particularly in rapid succession, suggest suspicious activity that warrants further investigation.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Confirm if the `admin_test` account performing these actions was authorized. Check the origin of the login to ensure it aligns with expected behavior.
- Perform detailed behavioral analysis of the account activities and verify if time changes align with expected NTP synchronizations.
- Investigate the context and justification for the creation and subsequent deletion of the `fileUser` account.
- Examine whether there was any unauthorized access or lateral movement within the network.
- Review and cross-verify the sysmon events showing the execution paths and utilize file integrity monitoring to ensure the binaries have not been tampered with.
- Conduct a threat hunt for potential persistence mechanisms or malware associated with privilege escalation and account manipulation patterns."

Data Encrypted with GPG4Win,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, there are several areas to highlight based on potentially suspicious activity:

1. **PowerShell Utilization**: There are multiple events indicating PowerShell execution (Event ID 1 in Sysmon logs). The specific commands executed via PowerShell involve `cmd.exe` and `gpg.exe` to encrypt a file, as indicated by the command line: `""powershell.exe"" & {cmd /c 'C:\\Program Files (x86)\\GnuPG\\bin\\gpg.exe' -c '$env:temp\\test.txt'}`. This usage of PowerShell to run external binaries and perform encryption in the `Temp` directory is commonly associated with malicious activities such as data exfiltration and hiding tracks.

2. **Processes and Command Lines**: The processes involve transitions from `PowerShell.exe` to `cmd.exe`, and then to `gpg.exe`, with the latter being used to encrypt files. This chaining of process executions and the use of `GnuPG` for encryption within these logs may indicate potential data manipulation or exfiltration attempt by an unauthorized user.

3. **Security Events**: The security logs show several events (Event ID 4798) for enumeration of user accounts on the system, executed by `CompatTelRunner.exe`. While `CompatTelRunner.exe` is a legitimate Windows telemetry tool, its use to enumerate accounts (especially if unrelated to system diagnostics) might suggest reconnaissance activities.

4. **User Context**: The events are performed under the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` with high integrity levels, suggesting administrative-level privileges were used in these operations. Such high privilege levels being involved in potentially suspicious activities is concerning.

5. **Latent Malactivity Indicators**: Continuous spawning of new processes like `Cmd.exe`, `PowerShell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, as well as use of `whoami.exe` to potentially ascertain current user context, is a pattern that fits the behavior of many known malware or advanced persistent threat (APT) actors, trying to maintain persistence or reconnaissance within a compromised system.

**Conclusion**: The provided event logs demonstrate patterns that match potential malicious activity, especially given the orchestrated use of PowerShell, cmd, encryption tools, and user account reconnaissance.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**. The logs contain activities that warrant further investigation. It is advised to:
- Immediately audit the actions of the user `admin_test` to determine if these actions align with typical expected use.
- Examine the file `test.txt` in the environment variable directory for unauthorized or sensitive data.
- Verify the legitimacy of the `GnuPG` binaries and their intent for use on this system.
- Implement additional monitoring around PowerShell and command-line executions to capture real-time anomalies.
- Consider isolating the affected host and performing a comprehensive malware/virus scan."
ESXi - Terminates VMs using pkill,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, there are several points of interest:

1. **Frequent Process Executions Involving Conhost and Wevtutil**:
   - There are numerous instances where processes such as `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` are executed. The repeated execution of these command-line utilities, especially `wevtutil.exe`, could indicate log manipulation or querying operations, which might be unusual given their persistence across time stamps.

2. **Command Execution with Plink**:
   - The command executed by `cmd.exe` involving `plink.exe` for SSH access is particularly noteworthy:
     ```
     ""cmd.exe"" /c echo """" | ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\plink.exe"" ""file.local"" -ssh -l ""root"" -pw ""pass"" -m ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data\\src\\esx_pkill.txt""
     ```
   - Plink is a command-line SSH client from the PuTTY suite used typically for automating or scripting SSH connections. This command shows an attempt to connect via SSH using potentially hardcoded credentials (`-l ""root"" -pw ""pass""`), which is an insecure practice and constitutes a security risk.
   - The file path and usage of `@` character (`C:\Users\ADMIN_~1`) indicates the use of a shortened file path, which may be a sign of an attempt to obfuscate script components from detection.

3. **Edge Update Logging**:
   - Numerous logs indicate activities related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, showing operations like update checks, registrations, and other related processes. These entries show standard software update patterns and align with the system's normal operations.

**Assessment**:
- The repetitive execution of utilities like `wevtutil.exe` and the use of `conhost.exe` in coordination with it is unusual but cannot be conclusively deemed malicious without more context on the expected operations on this host.
- The use of `plink.exe` with hardcoded SSH credentials is very concerning and highly suspicious. Hardcoded credentials can be a target for exploitation and indicate potential malicious intent or poor security practices.

**Guidance**:
- **Investigate the use of Plink**: Immediately review logs and monitor systems for unexpected SSH connections, especially on `file.local`. This command line's presence suggests a potential unauthorized access attempt or automation process using sensitive credentials.
- **Audit User and System Activities**: Trace the actions of the user `SERVER002\admin_test` to understand the context of execution and ensure none of these actions are outside accepted policies.
- **Review System Security Controls**: Ensure that proper logging and alerting are in place to detect similar activities in the future. Implementing stricter access controls and removing hardcoded credentials where present is critical.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS** - The logs contain activities that appear anomalous and raise concerns about potential security risks, particularly around the unusual command execution involving SSH with `plink.exe`. Further investigation is needed to assess if there's an actual compromise or a significant misconfiguration."
Windows - vssadmin Resize Shadowstorage Volume,"After reviewing the provided Windows event logs, here is the detailed analysis:

**1. Application log:**
- The entry logs the Software Protection Platform Service start, which is normal system behavior. Nothing suspicious stands out here.

**2. Security log:**
- **Event ID 4624**: This logs a successful logon. The logon is type 5 (Service Logon), which is typical for a system service. The usage of SYSTEM and NT AUTHORITY is not unusual; however, the presence of `SeDebugPrivilege` and other high-privilege tokens in **Event ID 4672** indicates a process with elevated privileges, which is standard for SYSTEM operations but could be leveraged in a compromised setup. 
- **Event ID 4799**: The Audit Account Logon event, indicating queries or attempts on the Administrators group. Repeated queries from the `VSSVC.exe` process (Used in conjunction with Volume Shadow Services) on the system may warrant further scrutiny, but in isolation, they are not definitively malicious.

**3. Windows PowerShell log:**
- The PowerShell logs show the execution of `vssadmin resize shadowstorage /For=C: /On=C: /MaxSize=20%`. The VSS (Volume Shadow Copy Service) being manipulated can be a legitimate administrative task; however, it's often targeted by malicious actors to tamper with shadow copies and evade detection/recovery in ransomware cases.

**4. Sysmon log:**
- Various process creations are recorded, including typical system processes (`HOSTNAME.EXE`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`). The execution of `vssadmin.exe` related to changing Volume Shadow Copy settings suggests administrative-level action is being taken.
- The parent process for these commands is PowerShell, which executed the vssadmin command -- a practice common in intent to modify or disrupt Volume Shadow Copy operations.

**5. System log:**

Windows - Disable Windows Recovery Console Repair,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several key observations are made regarding potential indicators of malicious activity:

1. **Task Scheduling and Time Adjustment**:
   - The Security logs show Event ID 4616, which indicates the system time was altered by the `svchost.exe` process under the credentials of `LOCAL SERVICE` (NT AUTHORITY). Frequent and minor adjustments to system time can be normal, but they may also be indicative of attacker attempts to manipulate timestamps for logs to obscure activities. However, in this case, the time change is minor, which may suggest routine time synchronization.

2. **Execution of High-Integrity Processes**:
   - Several Sysmon logs show execution of processes like `winlogon.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe`, executed by `SERVER002\admin_test`. While these processes are legitimate Windows applications, their execution chain and context raise suspicion:
     - **`whoami.exe`** is used to verify logged-on user details. Its execution, especially in conjunction with other tools like `cmd.exe` in a high-integrity context, could suggest privilege verification or reconnaissance.
     - **`cmd.exe`** invoked `bcdedit.exe` to disable Windows boot recovery options, which is an uncommon administrative task and could be used to prevent certain recovery actions after malicious modifications.
     - High integrity level and execution in a Temp directory (`C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\`) suggests that there might be privilege escalation or exploitation happening.

3. **Execution of System Utilities**:
   - **`bcdedit.exe`**: The use of `bcdedit.exe` to set the boot status policy to ignore all failures and disable recovery could be used to cover tracks by preventing recovery options if the system was tampered with maliciously. This is an unusual administrative task indicative of potential malicious intent.
   - **`wevtutil.exe`**: Although not inherently malicious, its execution multiple times could suggest efforts to query or clear event logs, a common practice to obfuscate evidence of malicious activities.

### Assessment
- **Risk Identification**: 
  - The combination of time adjustments with system processes, disabling recovery options, and the execution of utilities like `whoami` and `cmd`/`conhost` together suggest potential misuse or unauthorized administrative control.
- **Indicators of Potential Compromise**: 
  - The execution pattern, particularly with command used in `cmd.exe`/`bcdedit.exe`, and the use of `whoami.exe`, is suggestive of nefarious actions, possibly conducted by someone with administrative rights or an intruder seeking persistence.

### Conclusion
- **Resolution**: **MALICIOUS** - The presence of potentially harmful command-line execution aimed at disabling recovery options in combination with high-integrity execution of administrative tools suggests a likely compromise.

### Recommended Actions
1. **Forensic Analysis**: Conduct a deeper forensic investigation on the host to determine the origin of these commands and examine any artifacts left by potential malicious activities.
2. **User and Access Limitation**: Verify credentials of `admin_test` and assess the need for access at the observed privilege level.
3. **Log Monitoring and Alarms**: Enhance log monitoring for unusual execution patterns and trigger alerts for critical system setting changes.
4. **System and Network Isolation**: Consider isolating the affected system from the network to contain potentially malicious spread until remediation is complete.

Windows - Stop service by killing process,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs, here is a detailed analysis:

1. **Sysmon Logs**: The logs indicate various instances of typical system processes such as `hostname.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` executing on the system. Additionally, there are numerous executions of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related processes, which appear to be legitimate software update tasks for Microsoft Edge.

2. **Suspicious Behavior**: 
    - The `cmd.exe` event executing the command `taskkill.exe /f /im spoolsv.exe` raises a red flag, as it indicates a forceful termination of the Print Spooler service. This behavior could be indicative of an attempt to disable a service which can, in some cases, be a step taken by malware to inhibit printing, hijack printers, or evade detection.
    - The sequence of events surrounding the Print Spooler's termination, such as the `Service Control Manager` event with EventID 7031 indicates that the service was terminated unexpectedly and was set to restart. The use of `taskkill.exe` against `spoolsv.exe` reiterates the suspicion.

3. **Application and System Logs**: 
    - The application and system logs mainly show benign entries. The edge update service being stopped might seem unusual but does not directly imply malicious activity. The Microsoft SPP service log entry is related to software licensing and appears normal for a system process.

4. **Security Logs**: 
    - Logs show a successful logon event (ID 4624) for the SYSTEM account, which is typical for service operations. Privileged operation (ID 4672) logs show SYSTEM account gaining high-level privileges. This would generally be expected in normal operations for system services.

5. **Potential Threats or Indicators**:
    - The aggressive termination of the `spoolsv.exe` could suggest malicious intent, particularly if not corroborated by authorized user action or a legitimate maintenance reason. This action should be further scrutinized as it deviates from standard update or maintenance activities.

By following these guidelines, the activity's context can be better understood, potentially mitigating any risk of compromise."
Windows - wbadmin Delete systemstatebackup,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, I've identified several points of interest and potential indicators of suspicious activity:

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Time Manipulation**:
   - There is a notable occurrence where time appears to have been adjusted:
     - Event `4616` in the Security log indicates a time change by `svchost.exe`.
     - Event `1` in the System log shows that time was set backward from ""2024-10-26 20:13:50.1441639"" to ""2024-10-26 20:13:44.5987030"".
   - Time manipulation is often associated with attempts to obscure activity or logs, suggesting potential malicious intent.

2. **Usage of `wbadmin` Command**:
   - The command `wbadmin delete systemstatebackup -keepVersions:0` was executed, as seen from the Sysmon logs.
   - This command deletes system state backups, which might be used by an attacker to prevent recovery or remove traces of activity.

3. **Multiple Entries of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`**:
   - Frequent invocation of `wevtutil.exe`, a utility used for managing Windows Event logs, especially by a non-default user (`SERVER002\admin_test`), could be a method to tamper with or clear logs.
   - The presence of `<unknown process>` in the logs may further indicate attempts to hide processes or actions.

4. **`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` Anomalies**:
   - Although `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` is a legitimate process used for updating Edge browser, frequent and clustered instances in `Temp` directories (e.g., `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft\Temp\...`) warrant further investigation to ensure it's not being abused for malicious purposes.

5. **Use of Administrative Privileges**:
   - An event (`4672`) shows multiple high-level privileges (e.g., `SeDebugPrivilege`) being assigned to `admin_test`.
   - Elevated privileges, especially `SeDebugPrivilege`, could allow an attacker to debug processes and potentially alter their behavior, facilitating malicious actions.

### Assessment:

Based on the analysis of these logs, the activities involving time manipulation, command-line usage for backup deletion, and potentially anomalous executions imply more than mere routine administrative tasks. 

### Final Resolution:

- **SUSPICIOUS**: The logs indicate suspicious activity that requires further investigation. Specifically, the time manipulation and backup deletion commands are concerning and should be scrutinized for potentially unauthorized or malicious behavior. It would be advisable to investigate the user `admin_test`, review additional logs around the same timeframe, and validate the integrity of system backups and security mechanisms."
Change User Password - Windows,"The collection of Windows event logs shows a series of activities that warrant further investigation. Below is an analysis of the logs:

### Suspicious Activities Identified:

1. **Account Creation and Modification**:
   - **Event ID 4720** and **Event ID 4728** in the Security log indicate the creation of a user account ""fileAdministrator"" and its addition to a group, respectively. 
   - The user ""admin_test"" initiated these actions, suggesting that an account with administrative privileges is manipulating user accounts, which could be an indication of malicious activity.

2. **Command Execution**:
   - **Sysmon Event ID 1** shows the execution of `cmd.exe` with command lines that modify user accounts directly via `net user` commands:
     - `cmd.exe /c net user fileAdministrator User2ChangePW! /add`
     - `net.exe user fileAdministrator HuHuHUHoHo283283@dJD`
   - This is highly anomalous and suggests unauthorized account creation or password modification attempts.

3. **Unusual Service Stop**:
   - In the **Application log**, there are two entries at almost the same time for the service ""edgeupdate"" being stopped, indicating a potential service disruption or tampering.

4. **Multiple Process Executions**:
   - Frequent execution of Windows processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and several `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate` related processes in quick succession could be indicative of either legitimate software updates or an attempt to cover malicious actions with legitimate software behavior.

5. **System Time Change**:
   - **Event ID 4616** indicates the system time was changed, which could be used by malicious actors to attempt to cover their tracks by disrupting log timelines.

### Assessment:
- The logs above, especially the modifying of user accounts and password via command line, constitute a highly suspicious activity. While there is no definitive malware signature linked to these logs, the act of creating new users and modifying passwords, combined with system time changes and repeated process executions, suggests malicious intent or unauthorized access.

### Resolution:
- Based on the mentioned indicators and anomalies, the resolution to this situation is **MALICIOUS**. This behavior is consistent with unauthorized access or insider threat actions and therefore demands immediate attention.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
- **Immediate Account Review**: Disable the ""fileAdministrator"" account immediately and review all actions performed by the ""admin_test"" account.
- **Password Changes**: Require password changes for all administrative accounts, focusing on accounts that exhibit unusual activities.
- **Security Audit**: Conduct a full security audit on Server002 to determine any other potential compromises or persistent threats.
- **Enhanced Monitoring**: Implement heightened monitoring of Windows event logs with specific focus on security logins, user account management, and privileged group modifications to catch any further suspicious activity quickly.
- **Incident Response**: Initiate an incident response procedure to review access logs and configurations, ensuring no persistent threats exist on the network."
PureLocker Ransom Note,"### Analysis:

Upon thorough analysis of the provided Windows event logs, here are some observations regarding potentially malicious activities:

1. **PowerShell Log**: The logs for PowerShell are absent, leave potential gap in visibility. PowerShell often serves as a tool for attackers due to its powerful scripting capabilities.

2. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - There is a **cmd.exe** process with the command line `""cmd.exe"" /c echo data - Purelocker Ransom Note > %USERPROFILE%\Desktop\YOUR_FILES.txt`. This indicates that Purelocker ransomware might have attempted or successfully executed on the system to create a ransom note on the desktop. The presence of `/c` to execute commands is highly suspicious.
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are observed started by the user `admin_test`. Typically, these system utilities are not frequently run manually, suggesting automated or scripted activity.
   - The execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` could be seen as environmental reconnaissance, possibly by an attacker navigating the system.
   - Edge Update processes (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) have been running multiple times. While this in itself is not necessarily suspicious, the frequency and variety of these processes without a clear pattern might suggest an anomaly or abuse.

3. **Security Log**:
   - Several 4616 events indicating changes in system time are present. Typically, such actions can be red flags indicative of attempts to manipulate logs or avoid detection by time-based alert systems.

4. **Application Log**:
   - The log entries here do not appear to show any unusual activity. The stopping of the `edgeupdate` service in quick succession might coincide with update failures or errors; not necessarily suspicious but worth correlating with other evidence.

### Assessment:

- The presence of `cmd.exe` creating a file named ""YOUR_FILES.txt"" with reference to Purelocker clearly suggests ransomware activity.
- Usage of command-line tools such as `whoami`, `hostname`, and `wevtutil` by `admin_test` without further context can be suspicious.
- The frequent starting and stopping of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, while often normal, appears anomalous given the rapid frequency and context.

### Resolution:

- **MALICIOUS**: The activity recorded in the logs, especially regarding the Purelocker Ransom Note and other scripting activity, gives a high level of confidence that there is a malicious presence on this host.

### Guidance:

- **Immediate Isolation**: Isolate the affected system from the network to prevent further spread or damage.
- **Incident Response**: Initiate a detailed incident response procedure to understand the breadth of the compromise.
- **Recover Data**: Prepare for potential data recovery efforts if the ransomware executed successfully.
- **Patch & Protect**: Ensure all systems are up-to-date with the latest security patches, especially for applications like Microsoft Edge which showed unusual activity.
- **Review Credentials**: Examine if `admin_test` credentials have been abused and revoke or change passwords if necessary.
- **Training**: Increase security training awareness regarding phishing and suspicious activities for users."
Windows - Overwrite file with SysInternals SDelete,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several points of interest arise that suggest potentially suspicious activities:

1. **Repetitive User Enumeration:**
   - The logs show multiple instances of event ID 4798, indicating attempts to enumerate users on the system (i.e., Administrator, admin_test, DefaultAccount, Guest, lplui). This behavior, while not inherently malicious, could indicate reconnaissance activities often associated with an attacker scouting user accounts.

2. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The Windows PowerShell log records indicate the use of PowerShell to execute a script which interacts with the file system, specifically mentioning `sdelete.exe`. The Secure Delete (sdelete) tool is used to securely delete files and is often leveraged to cover traces. This, coupled with the conditional file path checks, appears suspicious as it may be used to remove evidence of malicious activities.

3. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - The Sysmon logs reveal a number of 'wevtutil.exe' processes run by the user 'admin_test'. `wevtutil.exe` is used to manage event logs and it is unusual to see repeated invocations unless part of a legitimate administrative task or a script/action aimed at clearing logs to avoid detection.

4. **High Integrity Level Processes:**
   - The Sysmon logs detail processes executed under 'IntegrityLevel: High', specifically PowerShell scripts. This indicates execution with elevated privileges which can be suspicious if not part of regular operations.

5. **Potential Credential Access:**
   - Event ID 5379 indicates failed attempts to request Windows Live credential information. Although these attempts failed, repeated unsuccessful credential access attempts are an indicator of potentially malicious intent.

### Assessment:

Given the evidence, the logs exhibit several signs of activity that do not align with typical benign administrative patterns and merit further investigation:

- The frequency and nature of user enumeration coupled with PowerShell activity involving `sdelete.exe` suggest unknown processes possibly aiming to probe and sanitize evidence.
- The use of `wevtutil.exe` by a specific user heavily implies an attempt to manipulate or clear event logs to mask actions across the system.

### Resolution:

Based on the logs and the nature of observed activities, the overall assessment should be classified as **SUSPICIOUS**. The reasons include anomalous user enumeration, unexplained usage of a secure delete utility, and event log handling.

### Guidance:

- Investigate the origin and context of the PowerShell commands to determine if part of a sanctioned administrative task.
- Review user account activities, particularly `admin_test`, to verify legitimacy.
- Examine system security policies and the integrity of audit/log handling.
- Consider implementing additional monitoring/alerts around PowerShell executions and key events related to user enumeration and log manipulations."
Windows - Delete Volume Shadow Copies,"Upon meticulous examination of the provided Windows event logs, certain activities stand out, which may suggest malicious intent, specifically focusing on suspicious process executions involving critical system utilities. Here's a breakdown of the key findings from these logs:

1. **Volume Shadow Copy Service Usage**:  
   - The entries reveal the execution of `vssadmin.exe list shadows`, initiated by PowerShell commands. This is a legitimate use of the Volume Shadow Copy Service; however, it could also suggest an initial reconnaissance step to assess existing shadow copies, potentially preceding a malicious act like ransomware that often targets such copies to prevent recovery.
   
2. **Suspicious Command Execution**:  
   - An instance of `cmd.exe` running the command `""vssadmin.exe delete shadows /all /quiet""` is documented. This is highly suspicious as it indicates the deletion of all system restore points without user confirmation and is a common tactic employed by ransomware or other malware to prevent recovery.
  
3. **Console Host and Command Line Activities**:  
   - Multiple executions of system utilities like `vssadmin.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and their child processes (like `conhost.exe`) are recorded at a high integrity level. The command sequence is unusual and can indicate scripting intended to manipulate system operations, typically aligned with non-user initiated automated processes for unauthorized activities.

4. **User Context and Integrity Level**:  
   - All actions, such as deploying system utilities, occur under a user account ""SERVER002\admin_test"" with high integrity, suggesting admin-level permissions were exploited to execute these critical commands.

5. **No Direct Evidence of Remote Code Execution**:  
   - Although the activities are executed under an admin context, there aren't explicit indicators of remote code execution or outsider manipulation directly visible in the logs. However, the pattern is consistent with activities typically preceding or comprising part of a malware attack.

6. **Microsoft Edge Update**:  
   - Several processes related to Microsoft Edge Update occur; they appear routine and correspond to expected system maintenance. No irregularities or concerning activities are noticed within these entries.

**Assessment**:  
The explicit deletion of shadow copies combined with admin-level execution of critical system utilities points towards malicious activity. The specific command ""vssadmin.exe delete shadows /all /quiet"" is widely recognized as suspicious due to its frequent use by malware to bypass recovery measures secured by shadow copies.

**Resolution**:  
**MALICIOUS** - The log activities strongly suggest malicious actions, with evidence of potential ransomware behavior aimed at inhibiting system recovery options.

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:  
1. **Immediate Isolation**: Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent potential lateral spread.
2. **Forensic Analysis**: Conduct a thorough forensic investigation on Server002 to discover any additional indicators of compromise (IOCs) and assess the full extent of the compromise.
3. **Backup Verification**: Verify the integrity and availability of recent backups. In the absence of shadow copies, ensure that external backups are accessible and intact.
4. **Patch and Update**: Ensure all systems, especially those with administrative access, are fully patched and up to date with security updates.
5. **Strengthen Security Posture**: Review and enhance security protocols related to administrative privileges and monitoring, including implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA) and increasing logging detail for early detection of anomalies."
Logoff System - Windows,"After reviewing the provided Windows event logs, here is my detailed analysis:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Use of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` processes running under the `SERVER002\\admin_test` user account. `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate Windows utility used for managing event logs. However, the excessive sequential execution might be considered suspicious especially if not part of normal operations. `conhost.exe` serves as a link between the Console and the graphical Windows environment.
   - The frequent invocation within a short time span could indicate attempts to interact with event logs possibly for tampering or to clear traces.

2. **Processes Executed with High Integrity Level:**
   - `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe` executed with a High Integrity Level, which suggests they are run with administrative privileges. While legitimate tools, their use in a non-administrative script or by a non-admin user could be suspicious depending on context.
 
3. **Command Execution leading to Shutdown:**
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` using the command `/c shutdown /l` is noteworthy. This command logs off the user. If unexpected within the operation context, it could indicate an attempt to disrupt services or an indication of malicious activity.

4. **Numerous Instantiation of Edge Update Components:**
   - A series of processes related to Microsoft Edge Update running under `NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM` implies automated tasks. However, the sheer number of instances in quick succession could indicate unintended behavior or tampering with updater tasks if they don't align with known patching schedules.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity or Compromise:

- **Use of Built-in Windows Tools:**
  The pattern of usage for built-in Windows utilities might be indicative of Living off the Land (LotL) techniques, where attackers use legitimate tools to achieve their goals while minimizing detection.

- **Frequent Execution of Edge Update Executables:**
  The appearance of Edge updater binaries running frequently is unusual if outside scheduled updates, potentially indicative of a masquerading threat or looping process that failed over to multiple retries.

### Conclusion and Resolution:

Based on the logs provided:

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Validate Intent and Authorization:**
   - Confirm with system administrators if `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and the sequence of Edge update related executions were part of an authorized operation or maintenance task.  

2. **Check for External Scheduling:**
   - Investigate the source of the frequent Edge Update invocations and determine if this corresponds with authorized patching activity.

3. **Conduct a Threat Hunt:**
   - Engage in a detailed exploration of the host for any indicators of compromise or further correlating activities, especially around the time the unusual processes were executed. 

4. **Review and Reinforce Policies:**
   - Ensure that company policies regarding the use of administrative privileges and script execution are followed and assess if any unauthorized access occurred.

Windows - Stop service using net.exe,"After reviewing the provided event logs, here’s a detailed analysis of the events and behaviors observed:

### System Log:
1. **Time Change Events**: 
   - Multiple events indicate a time change on the system. Time adjustments can sometimes be indicative of attempt to manipulate logs or tamper evidence. However, in these logs, the change is minimal and could correspond to normal system synchronization or adjustment activities via `svchost.exe`.

### Sysmon Log:
1. **Execution of PowerShell and Common Utilities**:
   - Observed command executions include `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe` with `net.exe stop spooler commands`. The `net.exe stop spooler` command is unusual as stopping the print spooler service is a tactic sometimes used by attackers to exploit print spooler vulnerabilities or halt unnecessary services. 
   - The continuous execution of utilities like `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` could be pattern in normal administrative activities or baseline system monitoring. Given the regularity and user context (`SERVER002\admin_test`), these could simply be attributable to a script or an admin task.

### Application Log:
1. **Edge Update Stopped**:
   - The entry of the `edgeupdate` service stopping seems routine and aligns with typical update stop events.

### Security Log:
1. **Privileges and Logon Events**:
   - Privileged operations are evident with the user `admin_test`, such as SeDebugPrivilege and others. These privileges are aligned with administrative accounts but require scrutiny if associated with irregular system behavior.
   - A successful login event (ID 4624) utilizing NTLM indicates admin access and corresponds with `admin_test` activities observed across logs.

### Indicators and Analysis:

- **Main Concern**: The command `net.exe stop spooler` does stand out as potentially hazardous if executed without proper authorization or configuration management checks. However, no further aggressive activities are directly associated with this action in the logs.
- **Admin Functions**: Given that many actions were performed under `SERVER002\admin_test`, these activities may correspond to expected administrative functions or system policies unless otherwise flagged by external alerts or contextual analysis.
