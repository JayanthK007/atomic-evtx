Modify VSS Service Permissions,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, the following observations have been made:

1. **Time Discrepancy in System and Security Logs:**
   - There are two events in the security log with EventID `4616` showing a backward time change on the system (e.g., the `NewTime` is earlier than the `PreviousTime`). A similar discrepancy is noted in the system log. This could indicate that the system time was manually adjusted or tampered with, though this is sometimes benign if it's an unintended result of time synchronization issues.

2. **Privileges Granted (Security Log EventID `4672`):**
   - The user `admin_test` was granted a wide range of privileges including `SeSecurityPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, `SeRestorePrivilege`, `SeDebugPrivilege`, and others. While sometimes legitimate, such a comprehensive set of privileges can enable potentially dangerous actions, such as accessing or modifying sensitive data and system components.

3. **Network Logon with NTLM Authentication (Security Log EventID `4624`):**
   - The `admin_test` user logged on using NTLM authentication from a specific workstation (`DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`). While NTLM is commonly used, it is generally considered less secure than Kerberos due to its susceptibility to relay attacks.

4. **Command Line Activities (Sysmon Log Events):**
   - There is a suspicious command executed by `cmd.exe` involving the modification of security descriptors for the `VSS` service using `sc sdset`. This action can be used to overwrite default access permissions, potentially making the service more vulnerable to exploitation.

5. **High Level of Administrative and System Activities:**
   - There is substantial usage of built-in Windows tools like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and command-line tools like `cmd.exe` and `sc.exe`, executed under the `admin_test` user. In isolation, these activities aren't inherently suspicious but could be associated with automated tasks or scripts initiated by legitimate users or system processes.

6. **Microsoft Edge Update Activities:**
   - Many Sysmon events pertain to various processes associated with `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`. These actions appear routine in terms of software updates performed by the Microsoft Edge updater service executed by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`.

Based on these observations, the logs show activities that could be considered suspicious due to the time modifications, high privilege grants, and command line operations altering service permissions. However, there are no clear indications of definitively malicious activities like the execution of known malicious executables or specific malware indicators. The activities could be legitimate administrative tasks but warrant further investigation to verify their intent and legitimacy.

### Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**
- **Recommendations:**
  - Investigate the purpose and origin of the time change.
  - Verify the authenticity and intent behind high-level privileges granted to `admin_test`.
  - Review any scripts or scheduled tasks that run under `admin_test` to ensure they are benign and necessary.
  - Consider implementing tighter monitoring or logging for NTLM-based logons and privilege use, particularly from external or non-trusted IP addresses.
  - Review any security events related to the modification of the `VSS` service security descriptors.
"
Disable System Restore Through Registry,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations have been made:

1. **Application Log Observations:**
   - The log entries pertaining to `Microsoft-Windows-Security-SPP` and `edgeupdate` service stopping are not inherently suspicious. The `Software Protection Platform Service` is a typical system-related service and entries related to `edgeupdate` stopping do not indicate malicious behavior on their own.

2. **Sysmon Log Observations:**
   - **Whoami and Hostname Executions:** 
     - The execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` under the user `SERVER002\admin_test` is observed multiple times. While these commands are typically used for user and system verification, frequent usage could be part of reconnaissance activities.
   - **Event ID 1 (Process Creation) Related to `cmd.exe`:**
     - A command involving modifications in the registry, specifically `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows NT\SystemRestore`, to disable system restore configurations, is suspicious. This is a classic tactic of malware to prevent recovery from infections and indicates possible malicious intent.
   - **Edge Update-Related Activity:**
     - Numerous entries related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` executions under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` and operations involving `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe` are visible. These actions are consistent with a software update process for Microsoft Edge, and `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` executing these is typical for system-level processes.

3. **Windows PowerShell, Security, and System Logs:**
   - These logs are not populated, which limits further insights into other potential suspicious activities or security-related events.

### Conclusions and Recommendations

- **Suspicious Activities:**
  - The command executed via `cmd.exe` to modify the registry and disable system restore features is highly suspicious and indicative of deliberate actions to prevent system recovery, which is often associated with malicious activity.

- **Benign Activities:**
  - Regular updates related to Microsoft Edge are benign as they follow the expected pattern for software updates. There is no indication of misuse or compromise within these processes.

- **Recommendation:**
  - It is advisable to further investigate the source and trigger of the registry modification command (disabling system restore) to ascertain whether this was an authorized administrative activity or indicates a potential compromise.
  - Consider running a full malware scan on the system, especially focusing on any malware that might modify system restoration settings to prevent recovery.
  - Check if there are any associated alerts or unusual activities from endpoint protection tools or SIEM that provide context to the registry changes.

Final Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS** - The activity involving modification of system restore settings via `cmd.exe` needs deeper investigation."
Windows - Delete Volume Shadow Copies via WMI,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows logs, several activities stand out that warrant a closer examination:

1. **Use of `vssadmin.exe`:** The logs show multiple executions of `vssadmin.exe`, specifically the command `vssadmin.exe list shadows`. This command is often associated with malicious activities such as ransomware attacks where attackers check for existing shadow copies before deleting them. In the examined logs, the `vssadmin.exe` process was followed by a related command `findstr ""No items found that satisfy the query.""`, indicating a check on the list results.

2. **Command execution involving `cmd.exe` and `wmic.exe`:** There's an entry where `cmd.exe` is used to run `wmic.exe shadowcopy delete`. This command directly deletes volume shadow copies and is highly suspicious. Such actions are commonly an indicator of ransomware or other malicious attempts to erase data backups to prevent recovery.

3. **PowerShell Activities:**
   - PowerShell was used to wrap the `vssadmin.exe list shadows` command, suggesting automation or scripting, which might be indicative of an automated attack script or malicious PowerShell activity.

4. **High Integrity Level Execution:** 
   - Commands were executed with ""High"" integrity level, implying administrative privileges were used, heightening the risk associated with these actions.

5. **Multiple Edge Update Processes:** While Microsoft Edge update processes are present, they follow typical update behavior involving system integrity level and NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM as the user, which are generally benign unless coupled with other suspicious indicators. No direct anomalies were observed with these processes.

Considering these observations, the activities involving `vssadmin.exe`, `wmic.exe`, and the deletion of shadow copies strongly indicate malicious intent typically associated with efforts to disrupt data recovery mechanisms, strongly aligned with ransomware behaviors.

**Assessment and Resolution:**
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**  â€“ The combination of shadow copy listing and deletion typical for ransomware behavior, alongside administrative execution, firmly suggests a malicious activity.
  
**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- **Immediate Response:**
  - Isolate the affected system to prevent further spread or damage.
  - Conduct a thorough investigation into potential ransomware presence.
  - Check recent backups and ensure they are secure and disconnected from the network.

Windows - Disable the SR scheduled task,"**Detailed Analysis of the Windows Event Logs:**

**System Log Analysis:**
1. The update process for Microsoft Defender Antivirus (EventID: 19) appears typical and legitimate. These updates are routine for maintaining antivirus definitions.
2. The time update events (EventIDs: 24 and 1) by the `svchost.exe` service is a regular activity, particularly by the Windows Time Service to ensure system clock accuracy.

**Application Log Analysis:**
1. Windows Defender is active and operational, indicating a standard security posture.
2. The entries related to `edgeupdate`, where the service stops and starts, align with typical automatic update processes for Microsoft Edge. The presence of update services and processes running under system authority is typical for such update tasks.

**Sysmon Log Analysis:**
1. Process creations and activities related to `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `whoami.exe` executed by a user named `SERVER002\admin_test` generally do not raise immediate red flags. These utilities are system tools often used for legitimate purposes.
2. The execution of `schtasks.exe` to disable the SystemRestore task (`/Change /TN ""\Microsoft\Windows\SystemRestore\SR"" /disable`) is suspicious. Disabling system restore points can be an indication of malicious intent, potentially to hinder recovery efforts post-compromise.
3. There's a substantial presence of Edge update activities (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`), which is normal for updating processes but worth reviewing for any inconsistencies. However, the overall flow and parameters suggest regular update behavior.

**Security Log Analysis:**
1. The security logs documenting time changes by the `svchost.exe` process under `LOCAL SERVICE` account are typical and align with Windows Time service operations.

**Final Assessment:**
- **Anomalous Behavior:** The disabling of system restore points through `schtasks.exe`. This action is noteworthy as it may indicate a preparatory step for malicious activity, aiming to obstruct recovery mechanisms.
- **Potentially Malicious Activity:** While most logs align with expected system and update processes, the schtasks command is suspicious and warrants further investigation.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
Due to the disabling of System Restore points, further investigation is advised to determine if this action is part of a legitimate administrative process or an indication of potential compromise. Recommend reviewing user activity around the time of this command execution, confirming the intent behind this action, and enhancing monitoring to detect similar patterns in the future.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. Investigate the user's (admin_test) activities and verify if the command to disable system restore was intentional and authorized.
2. Review system policies and processes for any unauthorized changes or access.
3. Strengthen audit logs and alerting mechanisms for similar disabling commands.

ESXi - Avoslocker enumerates VMs and forcefully kills VMs,"Upon reviewing the logs provided, several observations can be made regarding potential signs of malicious activity. Here is a detailed breakdown based on the specific logs:

### Application Log Highlights:
- The primary entries in the application log relate to normal service operations, such as stopping the Edge Update service, which typically reflects standard system/application behavior unless context indicates a vulnerability being exploited.

### Sysmon Log Observations:
- **PowerShell Execution:** There is a process execution of `powershell.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. While the presence of PowerShell does not indicate malicious activity in itself, PowerShell is frequently used in attack chains due to its powerful capabilities and standard installation on Windows machines.
- **Process Tree Analysis:** There is evidence of `cmd.exe` being used with command-line arguments to execute `plink.exe`, a tool in the PuTTY suite that is used for command-line SSH connections. The command line involves SSH operations to a host ""file.local"" with a specified plaintext password and a script file `esx_avoslocker_kill_vm.txt`. The script filename and usage of plaintext password are significant red flags indicating potential unauthorized or nefarious activity, possibly related to ransomware or other compromise.
- **Host and Whoami Execution:** The use of utilities like `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` by the same user (`SERVER002\admin_test`) suggests recon activity, where the attacker is gathering information about the network or currently logged-in users.
- **Wevtutil Utilization:** The repeated execution of `wevtutil.exe` (Windows Event Utility Tool) by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` may suggest log manipulation or event log clearance attempts, a common tactic to cover tracks after illicit activity.
- **Process Persistence with Network Service and SYSTEM Use:** There are processes running as `NT AUTHORITY\NETWORK SERVICE` and `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, both highly privileged accounts which, while typical for some services, can suggest privilege escalation if tied to suspicious processes.
  
### In-Depth Analysis and Conclusion:
- The entries that involve the use of plink.exe, especially with a clear text password and a script named ""esx_avoslocker_kill_vm.txt,"" hint at a severe security incident. AvosLocker is known as a ransomware threat, and the pattern here fits a potentially malicious behavior.
- The observed behavior of `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, alongside the suspicious command being executed with `cmd.exe`, provides indicators of potential reconnaissance and lateral movement attempts typically associated with an attack.
- The lack of detail in the powershell.exe command-line string doesnâ€™t give enough context to definitively categorize it, but it, combined with other suspicious log entries, raises concerns that further investigation is warranted.

### Final Assessment: 
The activities detailed in the logs are highly indicative of malicious behavior and potential compromise, particularly due to the attempted usage of SSH with administrative credentials, reconnaissance-oriented commands, and suspicious use of potentially destructive or ransomware-associated scripts.

**Resolution:** MALICIOUS

### Guidance:
- Immediately investigate the source and intent of the script `esx_avoslocker_kill_vm.txt`.
- Validate the need for and execution context of `plink.exe` on this server.
- Conduct a thorough review and auditing of user `SERVER002\admin_test` account activities.
- Confirm and secure credentials for `root`, and check for unauthorized SSH keys or changes.
- Isolate the involved host (Server002) for a deeper forensic investigation to prevent further potential spread or impact.
- Engage with incident response procedures, including notifying relevant cybersecurity teams and managing any potential data exfiltration."
Replace Desktop Wallpaper,"Upon reviewing the provided logs from different Windows event channels, I've identified several points of interest and anomalies:

### System Log:
- The logs indicate time changes that are consistent across both Kernel-General and Security logs. These time changes are standard and result from interactions with the system time service, which suggests the synchronization of system time via an NTP server (time.windows.com).

### Windows PowerShell Log:
- A PowerShell script execution is seen, which downloads an image from an external URL and attempts to set it as the system's wallpaper. The script involves web requests, downloading files, and modifying settings. While the action of changing the wallpaper itself is benign, downloading files over the network and interacting with system settings using scripts can be suspicious, especially if observed in environments where such actions aren't regularly performed.
- The PowerShell execution context involves registry access related to the desktop wallpaper and some error handling, which might not be typical for standard operations.

### Application Log:
- Ordinary application events indicating service actions, with nothing raising immediate concerns.

### Security Log:
- These logs primarily confirm the synchronization changes in system time, reflecting the same changes seen in the System log.

### Sysmon Log:
- Multiple instances of standard Windows tools (e.g., `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`) executed by the user ""admin_test"". While their execution could be normal in some cases, these should be monitored for context, such as frequency and patterns indicative of enumeration or script-based execution.
- Execution of Microsoft Edge Update procedures. This could correspond to legitimate software updating behavior via Microsoft's EdgeUpdate mechanism. However, seeing multiple instances and temp file usage should entail verifying that these operations are authentic and haven't been tampered with.

### Assessment:
1. **Suspicious PowerShell Script**: The script's behavior (downloading an external file and modifying desktop settings) might be part of a user-driven change or a maintenance task. However, given the network interaction, it warrants additional verification to ensure it is sanctioned and benign.

2. **Edge Update Activity**: Repetitive Edge Update-related processes are seen. Given Microsoft Edge frequently updates itself, these entries generally seem legitimate but should be validated against any known update schedules or anomalies such as errors that might indicate tampering or unexpected behavior.

3. **Frequent System Tool Usage**: Use of tools like `whoami.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` by the same user suggests script-based system interaction, which could be part of scheduled or automated maintenance scripts but still requires context validation.

### Conclusion: SUSPICIOUS

The logs contain activities that aren't conclusively malicious but demonstrate potentially unusual behavior that requires further investigation. It is critical to:
- Verify whether this PowerShell script and the wallpaper modification are expected behavior.
- Check the legitimacy and schedule of the Edge Update operations.
- Investigate the rationale behind frequent execution of system utilities by the user ""admin_test"".

Subsequent steps should include engaging IT or systems operations to confirm the legitimacy and intent behind these scripts and update activities. Additionally, reviewing logs for similar patterns and contexts can help determine if this pattern is recurring or isolated."
Remove Account From Domain Admin Group,"Upon reviewing the logs provided from various sources, the following observations have been made:

1. **Sysmon Logs**: 
   - Multiple entries show the execution of processes such as `powershell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `conhost.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. These processes are often used for legitimate administrative tasks but can also be abused for malicious activities.
   - A critical Sysmon event shows a PowerShell script executing a command to remove a user from the domain admins group using stored credentials. This is highly suspicious, particularly the use of `ConvertTo-SecureString -String password -AsPlainText -Force` which is indicative of insecure password handling, and is unusual in well-configured administrative environments.

2. **Windows PowerShell Logs**: 
   - A PowerShell script executed with the command `powershell.exe & {$PWord = ConvertTo-SecureString -String password -AsPlainText -Force ...}` reflects a potentially insecure operation to handle credentials and performs a critical action by attempting to remove a user from the `Domain Admins` group in Active Directory.
   - This behavior indicates a possible privilege escalation or lateral movement attempt.

3. **Microsoft Edge Update**:
   - There are multiple log entries related to Microsoft Edge Update. These logs seem to indicate regular update operations and do not immediately reveal suspicious activity related to the security of the system.

4. **Application Logs**: 
   - The logs indicate that the `edgeupdate` service stopped at various points, which aligns with standard update operations for Microsoft Edge.

5. **Overall Assessment**:
   - The most significant concern highlighted in these logs is the execution of a PowerShell script to manipulate domain admin memberships, which could be part of unauthorized access or a larger compromise attempt. Specifically, the command structure and indication of user privilege manipulation warrant further investigation.

### Final Assessment: SUSPICIOUS
The activities logged indicate behavior typical of attempted privilege escalation or unauthorized access within the network environment. The command execution via PowerShell with high privilege context and the insecure handling of credentials is especially suspicious. Therefore, further investigation is recommended to confirm whether these actions were legitimate administrative tasks or part of unauthorized activity.

### Guidance:
- **Immediate Actions**: 
  - Verify the legitimacy of the account `admin_test` and the command executed to ensure it aligns with authorized administrative actions.
  - Conduct a thorough review of the user access logs and check for any other signs of malicious activity originating from this user account or from the logon session associated with the activity.
- **Long-term Actions**:
  - Implement stricter PowerShell logging to capture detailed command line arguments and outputs.
  - Review your current privilege settings and logging practices for potential vulnerabilities, particularly around the use of PowerShell scripts.
  - Conduct a broader network/host review to identify any other systems which might exhibit similar activity patterns."
Delete User - Windows,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, there are several indicators that suggest suspicious and potentially malicious activities:

1. **Time Change Events:**
   - The events from the System and Security logs indicate a backward time change from `2024-10-27 12:20:13.3894650` to `2024-10-27 12:20:07.8986638`. Time changes can be normal, but in conjunction with other suspicious activities, they can be indicative of attempts to bypass logging or trigger certain conditions in malware.

2. **Privileged Account Actions:**
   - The security logs include Event ID 4672, which indicates that a user with high privileges (""admin_test"") logged in and exercised privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, which are typically associated with tasks that require elevated rights. This could be legitimate but needs further context due to the other sensitive actions observed.

3. **User Account Management:**
   - Multiple events show the creation, modification, and deletion of the user account ""fileUser."" Of particular interest is Event ID 4720 and Event ID 4726, showing the creation and deletion of this account within a very short timespan. These rapid user account activities can suggest attempts to manipulate account entries, possibly as part of credential theft or test accounts creation for persistence.

4. **Unusual Command Execution:**
   - Sysmon logs reveal the execution of `cmd.exe` with commands that add and then immediately remove a user account, which is suspicious:
     - `""cmd.exe"" /c net user fileUser User2DeletePW! /add & net.exe user fileUser /delete`
   - Such activity suggests potential attempts to add an account temporarily for unauthorized access, potentially followed by cleanup to remove traces.

5. **Process Execution:**
   - There are logs indicating the use of `whoami.exe` and `cmd.exe` by the user ""admin_test,"" suggesting attempts to enumerate current permissions or execute commands.

**Assessment:**
The combination of privilege escalation, unauthorized account management, and time manipulation strongly suggests that the activities captured in the logs are not normal for typical system operations and contain elements that are often associated with malicious intents or security incidents.

**Resolution:**
- **MALICIOUS** - The logs include clear indicators of potentially malicious actions that point to unauthorized access attempts and suspicious activities. Immediate actions are required to investigate further, mitigate potential security breaches, and identify the root cause.

**Guidance:**
- Perform a full incident response process to verify compromises and contain any ongoing malicious activities.
- Examine other logs and system artifacts to determine the scope and impact.
- Conduct a security review focusing on user account activities and privilege management.

Overwrite deleted data on C drive,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several entries stand out and require further examination.

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Logon Events (Security Event 4624):**
   - Multiple logon events suggest administrative activity. The logon type ""3"" indicates a network logon, typical for accessing shared resources.
   - The user `admin_test` appears to log in from the workstation `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P` using NTLM authentication, which could be legitimate if the user is a network administrator. However, NTLM usage can sometimes indicate a less-secure configuration, so verification of legitimate use is necessary.
   - The presence of elevated tokens indicates these were administrative sessions.

2. **Privilege Escalation (Security Event 4672):**
   - This entry details special privileges being assigned to the account `admin_test`. The privileges include `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeBackupPrivilege`, which could be exploited if misused.
   - The same privileges are observed in use by `SYSTEM`, which is standard for system processes.

3. **Process Activity (Sysmon Event 1 and 5):**
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with the command `cipher.exe /w:C:` suggests data wiping activities. This operation securely deletes data on the specified drive, which could indicate an attempt to cover tracks.
   - Usage of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` may be benign but could also be used in scripts related to event log queries or manipulation.
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` run in close succession by `admin_test`. This can be unusual and warrants verification against expected activities.
   - `whoami.exe` was executed, often used to verify current user rights, which aligns with routine checks but could be paired with further attacks.

4. **Scheduled Updates and Installations:**
   - The sequence involving `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate` and Edge installations appears consistent with legitimate update activities and does not exhibit immediate signs of threat.
   
5. **Time Change Events (Kernel-General Event 1):**
   - Time adjustments via svchost.exe should usually be rare and only occur during legitimate maintenance. Frequent changes can obscure the audit trail.

### Assessment:

- **Suspicious Activities:** The use of `cipher.exe` without a clear purpose raises suspicion. Combined with privileged operations and NTLM logons, there could be potential misuse or preparation for malicious activity.
- **Legitimate Activity Indicators:** Standard system processes and updates occurring alongside these actions can still be benign but should be validated against primary user activities.

### Recommendation & Next Steps:

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS.** The logs contain activities that do not appear fully accounted for, particularly regarding data wiping and privilege usage. 
- **Immediate Steps:**
  - Validate `admin_test` session activities and ensure they correlate with authorized tasks.
  - Confirm legitimate requirements for using `cipher.exe` and NTLM authentication in your environment.
  - Conduct a risk assessment on when and why the wevtutil and other admin utilities were utilized.
- **Further Investigation:**
  - Cross-reference user account activities with other security measures (e.g., Endpoint Detection and Response Systems) to check for corroborative malicious intent.
  - Ensure an audit trail is maintained and consider increased surveillance on this host.

This approach should help in confirming or dispelling any malicious activities and help maintain security integrity within the organization."
Data Encrypted with GPG4Win,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

#### Anomalous Behavior Observed
Upon reviewing the Windows event logs provided, several entries are noteworthy for further investigation:

1. **Frequent Usage of PowerShell and Command Line Tools:**
   - Multiple executions of `powershell.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `gpg.exe` tools by the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"" are observed.
   - The PowerShell command executed involves using `cmd /c` to call GnuPG (`gpg.exe`) for encryption. While using encryption tools in scripting can be legitimate, it often warrants closer scrutiny due to potential misuse scenarios by attackers to obfuscate data.

2. **Manipulation and Usage of System Utilities:**
   - `wevtutil.exe` (Windows Event Utility) is executed multiple times in a short period. This tool is commonly used to manage event logs, and frequent invocation might suggest log tampering, although no direct evidence of malicious conduct is present.
   - `CompatTelRunner.exe` also appears multiple times in both the Sysmon and Security logs, gathering account information. While this file is a part of Windows Telemetry services, an excess number of group enumeration events (Event ID 4798), and the presence of this binary in correlation with sensitive account interactions, merits further investigation.

3. **High Integrity Level Execution:**
   - Several processes are executed at a ""High"" or ""System"" Integrity Level, indicating elevated privileges. This includes PowerShell sessions run by ""admin_test"", which could be normal if this account is expected to execute administrative tasks but could be risky if unexpected.

4. **Executable Hashes:**
   - All system binaries (e.g., `svchost.exe`, `cmd.exe`, etc.) mentioned have corresponding hashes. Although these are legitimate executables, confirming that these hashes align with known good values can rule out executables being tampered with or replaced.

5. **Syslog Events:**
   - Several entries involving `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`. While not overtly suspicious, the continual use of `conhost.exe` as a parent for several process invocations can be an attempt to masquerade activities under common Windows processes.

6. **Security Log Insights:**
   - The `4798` event ID, which indicates user account/group enumeration, occurs frequently with `CompatTelRunner.exe`. An expected operation for telemetry, but worth investigating due to its potential misuse for recon in an attack.

#### Malicious or Suspicious Activities

Taking into account the frequent usage of PowerShell for potentially encrypting or executing commands and multiple command-line utilities being invoked within such a short timeframe, these logs suggest potential suspicious behavior. There is enough questionable command behavior, particularly involving encryption and telemetry tools, which could suggest misuse if these actions are not part of scheduled and regular operations for the ""admin_test"" account on ""SERVER002"".

Furthermore, the repeated enumeration of system and user accounts could denote reconnaissance, which is often a preliminary stage of an attack if carried out by unauthorized personnel.

### Final Assessment and Resolution

Considering the above observations, this activity is rated as **SUSPICIOUS**. The behavior observed merits further investigation:

1. **Verification of User Activities:**
   - Confirm if the user ""admin_test"" should have such access and if these operations were expected as part of their role.

2. **Review of Execution Policies:**
   - Evaluate PowerShell execution policies and any scripts run during this period for potential modifications or unauthorized access.

3. **Audit Executable Integrity:**
   - Verify the integrity of the executables and their hashes against known good values to ensure they havenâ€™t been compromised.

4. **Network and Account Monitoring:**
   - Implement monitoring of this user account's future activities and check for unusual network traffic patterns indicative of data exfiltration attempts.
   
By following these investigative steps, potential risks can be mitigated, and clarity can be obtained if this activity is indeed innocuous or a part of malicious behavior."
ESXi - Terminates VMs using pkill,"Based on my review of the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed analysis:

### Observations:

1. **edgeupdate Service Stopped:**
   - There are entries indicating that the `edgeupdate` service was stopped several times. This alone is not necessarily suspicious, as it could be due to updates or scheduled tasks. However, frequent stopping and starting without updates might warrant further investigation.

2. **Suspicious Command Execution via cmd.exe:**
   - There is a notable entry indicating the execution of `cmd.exe` with a command line that includes running `plink.exe` for SSH with credentials, which is highly suspicious:
     ```
     CommandLine: ""cmd.exe"" /c echo """" | ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\plink.exe"" ""file.local"" -ssh  -l ""root"" -pw ""pass"" -m ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data\\src\\esx_pkill.txt""
     ```
   - The use of `plink.exe` to connect to a remote server (`file.local`) with root credentials and a plain-text password is indicative of potential malicious activity or compromise.

3. **Unusual Process Execution:**
   - Frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `pshost.exe` in conjunction with `powershell.exe` within short timespans, which is unusual. The lack of detailed command-line arguments makes it challenging to determine intent, but the context of these tools could be concerning.

4. **Multiple Instances of TrustedInstaller and TiWorker:**
   - Instances of these processes (`TiWorker.exe` and `TrustedInstaller.exe`) are noted, probably related to Windows updates. On the surface, this is typically benign unless correlated with suspicious activity.

5. **Sysmon Logs with EdgeUpdate Activity:**
   - Extensive logging around Microsoft Edge Update activities is observed. While this usually aligns with legitimate update operations, the persistence and frequency should be verified against expected update schedules. 

6. **High Integrity Level Execution:**
   - Several processes are running with a high integrity level, which may indicate administrative execution permissions and could represent a higher risk if utilized by malicious software.

### Assessment:

- **Suspicious Behavior:**
  - The execution of `cmd.exe` involving `plink.exe` with embedded credentials strongly suggests suspicious behavior. This specific command could be used to establish unauthorized SSH connections, potentially leading to system compromise.
  
- **Service and Process Analysis:**
  - The stopping/starting of `edgeupdate` and the frequency of wevtutil execution without additional context cannot be simply interpreted as malicious but could warrant further investigation.

### Resolution:

**SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Password Changes:**
   - Change credentials, particularly for any accounts related to the `root` user seen in the suspicious command string.

2. **Network Traffic Analysis:**
   - Analyze network traffic, especially around the timeframes mentioned, to confirm any unexpected or unauthorized outbound connections.

3. **Investigate Organizational Accountability:**
   - Confirm if any approved scripts or administrative tasks might justify the observed behaviors. Validate any legitimate need for the SSH command string observed.

Windows - vssadmin Resize Shadowstorage Volume,"### Detailed Analysis of the Windows Event Logs

#### Application Log
- The Application log shows an entry from the Software Protection Platform (Event ID 16384). This is a routine event related to license validation and protection, with no immediate suspicious indicators.

#### Security Log
1. **Event ID 4624**: Logon of the SYSTEM account (Logon Type 5) using the Advapi process. Logon type 5 indicates a service-type logon, which is normal for the SYSTEM account.
2. **Event ID 4672**: Special privileges were assigned to the SYSTEM account. These privileges include sensitive permissions like SeDebugPrivilege, which are standard for the SYSTEM account.
3. **Event ID 4799**: Multiple events showing VSSVC.exe interacting with the Administrators group. This is consistent with Volume Shadow Copy Service activities and generally not indicative of a threat.
4. **Event ID 4616**: There are entries indicating the system time was changed. While adjusting system times can be a red flag, it's often consistent with legitimate service operations unless corroborated with other malicious indicators.

#### Windows PowerShell Log
- There is a set of entries indicating a PowerShell command execution: `vssadmin resize shadowstorage ...`. Adjusting shadow storage is not inherently malicious but can be suspicious if done without administrator knowledge. This operation by `powershell.exe` without clear context could potentially be considered suspicious.

#### Sysmon Log
1. **Event ID 1**: Instances of benign, albeit elevated, command-line executions (`whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`) by `admin_test`. The presence of high integrity levels suggests administrative access, albeit not malicious on its own.
2. **Event ID 1 and 5**: The series of events indicate legitimate system operations such as process creation and network service calls, with the `vssadmin` command present again, paralleling the PowerShell activity.

#### System Log
- Time changes and adjustments possibly linked with system synchronization tasks appear to indicate routine operations rather than malicious behavior.

### Assessment of the Situation

The logs contain several administrative operations such as VSS modifications and system information queries (using `whoami` and `hostname`), which, without accompanying malicious context, are typically part of normal system operations. However, the modification of shadow storage without explicit mention of administrative oversight and the presence of special privileges could hint at potential misuse or configuration changes outside normal policies.

### Threats or Risks Identified
- Adjustments to the Volume Shadow Copy System (`vssadmin resize shadowstorage`) through PowerShell might indicate tampering with system backups, alerting us to potential data persistence methods used by adversaries. Though not conclusively malicious, it does warrant further investigation.

### Guidance on How to Proceed
1. **Verification**: Confirm with the system administrator or relevant personnel if the `vssadmin` command was scheduled, part of maintenance, or unauthorized.
2. **Monitoring**: Increase monitoring of administrative operations on the host, specifically sudden changes to the system settings or backups.
3. **Audit Logs**: Maintain thorough auditing of PowerShell activities and privilege escalation attempts for any anomalous behavior.

### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS
The logs contain activity that is consistent with potentially benign administrative tasks but also contain elements (like unsanctioned `vssadmin` activity) that raise suspicion and require further investigation for validation."
Windows - Disable Windows Recovery Console Repair,"In carrying out the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, I focused on identifying any suspicious behavior, unusual process activities, and potential indicators of malware or unauthorized access.

### Observations:

1. **Time Manipulation Events:**
   - Multiple events with Event ID 4616 from the Security logs and Event ID 1 from the System logs indicate a change in system time. While minor time adjustments can occur legitimately (e.g., time synchronization with a time server), frequent or unusual time changes might indicate attempts to obfuscate the time of certain activities.

2. **Process Execution and Command Lines:**
   - The Sysmon logs reveal some process executions such as `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `bcdedit.exe`. The usage of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` can be part of legitimate activity; however, certain executions seen here can be concerning.
   - The command line `cmd.exe /c bcdedit.exe /set {default} bootstatuspolicy ignoreallfailures & bcdedit.exe /set {default} recoveryenabled no` is a particular point of interest. This command disables Windows error recovery options, which could be an attempt to disable recovery actions and boot error notifications, potentially masking malicious operations.

3. **Privilege Level:**
   - Several processes were executed with high integrity levels. While not unusual for administrative actions, it could be exploited in the context of unauthorized access or malicious moves to gain control over the system.

4. **Parent-Child Process Relationships:**
   - The process tree indicates that `cmd.exe` was executed by `wsmprovhost.exe` with the `-Embedding` argument, which could be associated with Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) actions. This WMI provider host is often used in remote management scenarios. Its involvement with the command that modifies the boot configuration (via `bcdedit.exe`) can be questionable if this wasn't part of planned maintenance or legitimate administrative tasks.

5. **PowerShell and Other Logs:**
   - No new information is available from the PowerShell log, and there is a normal operation under services like `sppsvc.exe` in Application and System logs.

### Assessment:

The activities identified, particularly the manipulation of boot settings through `bcdedit.exe`, suggest actions beyond regular administrative tasks if not part of scheduled maintenance. While changing boot configurations is not inherently malicious, it becomes concerning when combined with time manipulations and run from a potentially remotely managed host. 

### Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

Further investigation is required to determine the legitimacy of the `bcdedit.exe` usage and the motive behind disabling system recovery options. Key actions can include:
- Verifying with IT administration if these commands were expected or if someone performed maintenance during these timestamps.
- Cross-referencing with any authorized change requests or maintenance schedules.
- Monitoring and reviewing any further changes or irregularities in system operations, including potential unauthorized access attempts.

Depending on these findings, actions might need to extend to remediation steps or hardening configurations to prevent unauthorized manipulations."
Configure LegalNoticeCaption and LegalNoticeText registry keys to display ransom message,"### Detailed Analysis

**Indicators of Malicious Activity:**

1. **Unauthorized Configuration Changes:**
   - The Windows PowerShell logs show that a PowerShell script was executed which changes the systemâ€™s legal notice settings. The script modifies the `LegalNoticeCaption` and `LegalNoticeText` to alarming text indicating that devices have been encrypted and a ransom note to contact a malevolent actor via ""xxxx@onionmail.org"". This is a clear indicator of ransomware activity, specifically associated with the PYSA ransomware, also known as Mespinoza.

2. **Suspicious Processes and Privilege Usage:**
   - Security events indicate logon activity (EventID 4624) using NTLM authentication from an external workstation (DESKTOP-3HL5B2P) which correlates with high privileges (EventID 4672) using the account `admin_test`. The presence of high privilege granted includes `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, which are often abused by malicious actors to gain further access and control over the system.

3. **Abnormal System Behavior:**
   - Multiple processes such as `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` were repeatedly triggered in quick succession under the same user account, `SERVER002\admin_test`. While not directly harmful, ensuring these processes are expected is necessary since they are often seen in suspicious activity like log clearing or command prompt usage by unauthorized users.

4. **Use of Windows Services in Sysmon Logs:**
   - There is evidence of `powershell.exe` being utilized from `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\`, which is unconventional and aligns with malicious behavior intended to avoid easy detection.
  
5. **Time Synchronization Events:**
   - System time adjustments (seen in Sysmon logs) are suspicious if not part of expected system behavior and can be used to cover tracks in log files. However, in the provided logs, they are not immediately linked to malicious actions.

**Assessment of the Situation:**

The actions discovered in the logs primarily revolve around a PowerShell script that modifies system policies indicative of ransomware activity. The high privilege user activities and process executions signal a potential breach assisted by credential compromise or privilege escalation. The changes to legal notices explicitly declare possible ransomware infection.

**Threats or Risks Identified:**
- Confirmed indicators of ransomware, PYSA, altering system configuration to relay ransom instructions.
- Possible lateral movement or initial access through NTLM authenticated logins.
- Elevated user privileges being misused for potentially unauthorized changes.

### Resolution

**MALICIOUS**: The presented logs provide multiple indicators of ransomware activity, explicitly linked to the behavior of PYSA ransomware, known for its encryption and ransom notes. Immediate action is required to mitigate the potential compromise.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

1. **Immediate Incident Response Measures:**
   - Isolate affected systems from the network to prevent further propagation.
   - Use security tools to identify the full scope of the breach across the network.
   - Inspect and potentially restore systems from clean backups if integrity can be ensured.

2. **Forensic Analysis and Remediation:**
   - Conduct thorough forensic analysis to understand the breach vector and extent.
   - Reset credentials, focusing on accounts showing suspicious logon activity.
   - Review and harden security policies, especially around PowerShell execution and user privileges.
   - Implement advanced threat detection and monitoring to identify similar threats sooner in the future.

3. **Communication and Recovery Planning:**
   - Notify relevant stakeholders, including IT security teams and possibly law enforcement if necessary.
   - Consider informing users about the incident if there is potential data compromise and involve data protection officers to address the notification requirements.
   - Develop a recovery plan and update incident response protocols to handle potential ransomware threats more effectively."
Akira Ransomware drop Files with .akira Extension and Ransomnote,"Based on an analysis of the provided logs, the following findings have been made:

1. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - The Windows PowerShell event logs indicate that a script was executed, which involves writing messages and instructions to a file named ""akira_readme.txt"" on the user's desktop. The content of this message is highly indicative of a ransomware note. The script leverages PowerShell to generate files with a specific extension (e.g., .akira) and communicates instructions to use the TOR network, which is a common practice in ransomware campaigns.

2. **Intrusive Command Content:**
   - The content written by the PowerShell script suggests theft of corporate data and threats to leak this data unless a negotiation is agreed upon. This message aligns with known ransomware tactics where attackers encrypt data, steal sensitive information, and demand ransom payments.

3. **High Privilege Use:**
   - The security logs show the account ""admin_test"" with numerous high-level privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, etc., was used. While having an admin account with such privileges is not uncommon, correlation with ransomware actions suggests possible misuse or compromise.

4. **Svchost and Conhost Executions:**
   - Although the logs indicate executions related to typical Windows processes like `svchost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `conhost.exe`, these by themselves are not directly suspicious without specific malicious pointers. However, the context of associated activities flags it for extra scrutiny.

5. **Edge Update Events:**
   - Numerous logs relate to Microsoft Edge updates. While frequent Edge updates are not inherently suspicious, correlations with PowerShell activity and unusual behavior can be a potential indicator of masquerading or mimicry of legitimate processes by malicious actors.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Assessment and Recommendations:**
- The logs strongly indicate ongoing ransomware activity attributed to the execution of malicious PowerShell scripts aimed at data encryption and extortion.
- Immediate containment and eradication steps must be implemented:
  - Disconnect the affected system from the network to prevent further spread.
  - Conduct a forensic analysis to understand the full scope and entry point of the attack.
  - Initiate communication with legal and incident response teams.
  - Assess backup integrity and restoration capabilitiesâ€”avoid paying ransom as policy recommendations discourage it.
  - Evaluate the need for notifications to regulatory bodies depending on data breach laws applicable.

- Post-incident:
  - Update all security protocols, ensure all systems have the latest security patches.
  - Re-educate users on phishing and social engineering attacks.
  - Implement network and endpoint monitoring with alerting for unauthorized PowerShell use and unusual data access patterns."
Data Encrypt Using DiskCryptor,"### Detailed Analysis of the Windows Event Logs

#### Observations:
1. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - All processes are executed under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, which appears to have high integrity level rights.
   - **PowerShell Execution:**
     - `C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe` was executed by `admin_test`. However, there are no command-line arguments available. PowerShell execution without clear arguments can often indicate an attempt to run suspicious scripts.
   - **Wevtutil Activity:**
     - Multiple executions of `C:\Windows\System32\wevtutil.exe`, which was run multiple times presumably for querying or clearing event logs. This tool is commonly used by attackers to clear event logs to cover tracks. The quick succession of invocations across timestamps can indicate automation, which is often used during a compromise.
   - **Utilities Execution:**
     - The usage of `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `whoami.exe` are also noted. These utilities can be part of standard operations, but they are also used by intruders to gather system information post-compromise.
   - **CMD Execution:**
     - The cmd.exe execution with the command `\""%%PROGRAMFILES%%\\dcrypt\""\\dcrypt.exe` indicates a potential launching of a suspicious or unauthorized process. The `dcrypt.exe` executableâ€™s origin and purpose are not readily identifiable, requiring further scrutiny.

2. **Security Logs:**
   - Noteworthy is the security event `4799`, indicating a Special Group Membership operation. Intriguingly, the executable responsible here is installation-related to Microsoft Edge Update. Although Edge installer activities may be legitimate, associating such an activity with group memberships may seem peculiar and warrants review to ensure intended behavior.

3. **Normal Program Activities:**
   - Numerous logs are attributed to `Microsoft Edge Installer` processes, indicating either standard update operations or potentially normal browser maintenance activities.

4. **SearchIndexer and Related Executions:**
   - These reflect typical Windows operations managing file indexing for enhanced search functionalities, and these appear consistent with benign activities.

#### Assessment:
Based on the events analyzed:

- **Anomalies:**
  - The repeated usage of `wevtutil.exe` shortly after PowerShell invoked but without concrete evidence of command-line parameters or scripts will warrant further audit to ascertain intent.
  - The execution of `cmd.exe` to run `dcrypt.exe` with high integrity requires investigation to determine what this executable does and its origin as its behavior and intent here are unclear.

- **Legitimate Activities:**
  - Microsoft Edge-related installers and Windows Search processes are benign and expected based on their consistent operations within their usual directories and under the NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM context.

### Conclusion
**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Investigate `dcrypt.exe`:**
   - Analyze the binary file of `dcrypt.exe` for malware characteristics.
   - Check its hash against threat intelligence databases.

2. **PowerShell Activity Investigation:**
   - Check for any associated scripts or scheduled tasks that might have utilized PowerShell and review their content and origin.

3. **Wevtutil Usage:**
   - Verify if the `wevtutil` executions were scheduled tasks or user-initiated to establish the legitimacy of these invocations.

4. **Edge Installer Operation Validation:**
   - Confirm if the Edge updates were officially scheduled tasks or user-initiated to rule out potential policy violations or misuse of privileges.

By conducting these actions, we can better understand if the suspicious activities are potentially unwarranted, leading to effective mitigation or adjustment of user practices and policies."
Windows - wbadmin Delete Windows Backup Catalog,"Upon reviewing the provided log entries, certain activities suggest suspicious behavior that may warrant further investigation:

1. **Command Execution (Sysmon Events 17981, 17983, 17984):**
   - There is an execution of a command line that includes `wbadmin delete catalog -quiet`. This command is used to delete backup catalogs without confirmation, which could indicate an attempt to remove or alter backup information subtly.

2. **Privileged Processes:**
   - Multiple processes are executed with high privileges, including `wbengine.exe` and `vdsldr.exe`, both under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` account. While these services are typical for system operations, their execution should be periodically reviewed for signs of abnormal activity.

3. **Abnormal Logon and Privileges (Security Events 4624, 4672):**
   - The event logs reveal `SYSTEM` privileges being assigned shortly after a system logon event. While log type 5 (service startup) is standard during system operations, these activities are closely timed with the `wbadmin` process execution, which could indicate potential misuse or compromised activity.
   
4. **Time Synchronization:**
   - The repeated time synchronization activity, while generally normal (especially on server systems), timed nearly simultaneously with potentially malicious activity, should be verified for legitimate reasons. Event IDs 4616 indicate changes in system time, which might signal attempts to cover tracks if used maliciously.

5. **PowerShell and System Logs:**
   - The logs provided for PowerShell and System do not contain any information. It would be beneficial to ensure that logging is appropriately set up on the server, as they are valuable in thoroughly investigating Kernel and PowerShell-based activities.

6. **Edge Update Processes:**
   - Numerous Microsoft Edge Update processes are logging repetitive execution steps. Normal for update activities, this could represent innocuous software updates. However, if unexpected by the system's regular update schedule, it may warrant a closer look.

### Assessment
Based on analysis, the frequent execution of backup deletion commands without user prompt (such as `wbadmin delete catalog -quiet`) is an indicator of potential tampering with backup readiness. While no direct evidence of compromise is visible without additional context or preceding and succeeding logs, these activities remain suspicious.

### Resolution
**SUSPICIOUS** - The activity noted here does not unequivocally confirm malicious intent but suggests potential misuse that should be further explored. The deletion of backup catalogs and privilege elevation warrants closer scrutiny. It is recommended to:
- Review any associated logs for unauthorized access or changes to backup configurations and system time settings.
- Conduct a more comprehensive log review beyond the short timeframe provided.
- Check with the system administration team to verify if the observed commands and processes align with scheduled maintenance or updates.
- Implement more robust logging on PowerShell and critical kernel processes for better visibility.

By following these steps, one can either attribute these activities to legitimate administrative actions or identify and address any unauthorized actions effectively."
Windows - Delete Volume Shadow Copies via WMI with PowerShell,"After thoroughly analyzing the provided logs, several points stand out that may indicate suspicious or potential malicious activity. The analysis focuses on the Windows PowerShell, Security, and Sysmon logs.

### Analysis

1. **PowerShell Logs**: 
   - Multiple entries show the execution of a PowerShell process (`powershell.exe`) using the command `{Get-WmiObject Win32_Shadowcopy | ForEach-Object {$_.Delete();}}`. This command is designed to delete shadow copies, which are typically used for backup purposes. The deletion of shadow copies can be a significant indicator of malicious activity, as it is commonly associated with ransomware attacks aiming to prevent recovery by removing backup mechanisms.

2. **Security Logs**:
   - Event ID `4624` indicates successful logins. A particularly notable login is for the user `admin_test` using NTLM authentication from `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P` with a logon type of `3` (network), which could indicate remote access. Coupled with privileged token access (Event ID `4672`), this raises concerns about unauthorized remote administrative control.
   - Event ID `4799` indicates that the `VSSVC.exe` process is interacting with the `Administrators` group. Since this process is related to Volume Shadow Copy services, there might be an exploitation attempt, especially when paired with the PowerShell script removing shadow copies.

3. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - Execution of `wevtutil.exe` by `admin_test`. `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate tool for managing event logs, but its usage might indicate an attempt to cover tracks by clearing logs.
   - A consistent pattern of command-line executions (e.g., `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`) suggests scripts or automated tasks aimed at gathering system information.
   - The process `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` running from a temporary path could suggest a potential masquerading technique or abuse for payload delivery.

### Assessment

- **Suspicious Activity**: The combination of deleting shadow copies, unsanctioned remote logons, and processes potentially tampering with system logs or configuration suggests a potentially compromised system setup. 
- **High Privileges Misuse**: Multiple logon events linked to high privileges and kernel manipulation indicate potential privilege misuse or elevation.
  
### Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

This set of findings strongly points towards potentially malicious activity, but additional investigation is required to confirm the compromise. The priority areas to focus on would involve reviewing remote access logs, monitoring real-time PowerShell activity, and checking integrity and access patterns on critical files and backups.

### Guidance

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Block or closely monitor the user account `admin_test` and its associated connections, especially from `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`.
   - Restrict and log activities related to shadow copies and further examine all systems interacting with Volume Shadow Copy Service (`VSSVC.exe`).

2. **Further Investigation**:
   - Conduct a detailed review of all PowerShell scripts and command history, especially those affecting system state and backups.
   - Investigate potential persistence mechanisms possibly installed by the unauthorized user or process.
   - Check all endpoints for anomalous processes, especially focusing on those not aligning with usual operational baselines.

3. **Preventive Measures**:
   - Implement tighter control and monitoring on PowerShell activities through constrained language mode or script block logging.
   - Verify backup integrity and enhance regular audit controls on time-sensitive operations and high-privilege accesses."
Windows - Stop service by killing process,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, let's perform a detailed analysis:

### Application Log
1. **Edge Update Service Stopped**: The logs show two entries indicating the `edgeupdate` service stopped. While these entries indicate service stoppage, there is no evidence suggesting an abnormal or malicious stoppage without further context. Edge Update stopping multiple times in quick succession may merit further investigation, but on its own doesn't strongly indicate malicious activity.

2. **Software Protection Platform Service**: An entry from the 'Software Protection Platform Service' showing some routine data. No indications of suspicious activity.

### System Log
1. **Print Spooler Service**: Event ID 7031 indicates the 'Print Spooler' service terminated unexpectedly and was set to restart. This could be routine behavior, but due to the known vulnerabilities associated with the Print Spooler service, this should be marked for further inspection to rule out exploitation.

### Sysmon Log 
1. **Unexpected Termination of Spooler Service**: Sysmon logs indicate an initiation of a command to forcibly kill the `spoolsv.exe` service using `taskkill.exe`. This behavior is unusual and warrants further investigation to ensure no exploitation is occurring, especially when considered with the above system log.

2. **Sequence of Command Executions**: A number of command-line tools like `whoami`, `cmd`, and `taskkill` were executed by user SERVER002\admin_test within a short time frame. This usage pattern may suggest administrative scripting, but the context is important. If itâ€™s unexpected for this machine, it could be suspicious.

3. **Frequent Execution and Registration of MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe**: There are numerous records related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`. This high volume of Edge updates/service executions may reflect a benign software update process unless this is unexpected behavior for this system configuration.

### Security Log
1. **Logon and Privilege Use by SYSTEM Account**: Log entries show successful logon and elevated privilege use by the SYSTEM account. This activity isnâ€™t inherently suspicious as SYSTEM is a highly privileged account on any Windows system, and such logs are common during routine operations.

### Assessment
- **Suspicious Activity**: The forced termination of `spoolsv.exe` via `taskkill.exe` is irregular, especially if it's not part of a regular maintenance script or policy. This, combined with the unexpected termination noted in the event log, could indicate a compromised or misconfigured system.
- **Benign Activity**: Several instances of legitimate Microsoft Edge update-related activity indicate normal update procedures unless otherwise flagged by your internal controls.
- **Lack of Malicious Indicators**: Although frequent, the behavior related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and its derivatives does not alone indicate malware.

### Conclusion
Based on the available logs, the overall categorization falls into:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The `taskkill.exe` command to forcefully terminate the Print Spooler service alongside the Service Control Manager alert signifies suspicious behavior. Additional investigation on this service termination and related networked activities or changes should be conducted to ensure no malicious exploitation.

### Guidance
- **Further Investigation**: Inspect and verify the legitimacy of recent batch scripts, policies, or tasks associated with the `admin_test` account. Examine network activity around the spooler service termination.
- **Review Service Configurations**: Ensure that the Print Spooler service and Edge Update configurations align with security baselines and intended operational use.
- **Maintain Logging**: Continue capturing detailed logs like these to proactively detect and mitigate potential threats."
Windows - Stop service using Service Controller,"### Detailed Analysis

Upon reviewing the provided logs, the following observations can be made:

#### 1. **Change of System Time (Security Event ID 4616 & System Kernel General Event ID 1)**
- There are multiple instances where the system time has been changed. This is not inherently malicious but can sometimes indicate unauthorized adjustments, especially if not scheduled or expected. The changes are being made by the `svchost.exe` process under `LOCAL SERVICE`. It may be essential to verify if these changes were expected or part of a legitimate update or maintenance task. 

#### 2. **Process Executions (Sysmon Event ID 1 and 5)**
- The execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `svchost.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` is noted. While both executables are standard Windows processes, `wevtutil.exe` (used to manage event logs) execution patterns should be verified as it is not frequently run by standard users or processes without reason.
  
- The execution of `cmd.exe` with a command to stop the `spooler` service is suspicious for potential lateral movement, as stopping the `spooler` service (`sc.exe stop spooler`) is sometimes performed in ransomware attacks or during unauthorized control activities as part of exploration or preparation stages in an attack.

- The presence of `conhost.exe` is standard when command-line interfaces are being used but should typically follow expected usage patterns.

#### 3. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity (Sysmon Event and Application Log)**
- There are multiple entries related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`. The entries appear legitimate as part of an update process. The processes are executed by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, which is consistent with autoupdate execution privileges.

#### 4. **Use of `whoami` (Sysmon Event ID 1)**
- The use of `whoami.exe` by `SERVER002\admin_test` could be normal for validation of user context, but should verify the context under which it was executed. This can be a routine check by an admin, although, if repeated suspiciously or excessively, may need correlation with other events for possible credential exploitation detection.

### Conclusion and Resolution

- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

The logs contain multiple instances of potentially legitimate activities; however, the stopping of the `spooler` service and time adjustments by `svchost.exe` warrant further investigation. These actions, although common in legitimate scenarios, could also mask malicious intentions, such as preparation for a more sophisticated attack. 

### Guidance:

1. **Time Change Verification**: Investigate if the time changes were part of a legitimate scheduled task or Windows Update. Check with system administrators if they had authorized these changes.

2. **Investigate Spooler Service Stoppage**: Determine if the service stoppage was part of normal operations, user request, or related to suspicious activities (potential ransomware reconnaissance or lateral movement preparation).

3. **User Actions Review**: Review historical user actions for `SERVER002\admin_test` to determine if behavior aligns with legitimate administrative activity.

4. **Wevtutil.exe Activity**: Verify if the manipulation of the event logs using `wevtutil.exe` aligns with any audit, cleanup, or maintenance activity by the system administrators.

5. **Correlation with Threat Intelligence**: Consider cross-referencing any SHA256 hashes or pipelined processes against known threat indicators.

Further detailed forensic analysis should be conducted, especially focusing on any unauthorized network connections or data exfiltration activities related to these events."
Windows - Delete Backup Files,"Upon analyzing the logs, I have identified several key events and workflows. Let's break down the potentially suspicious or malicious activities:

### Suspicious Activity:
1. **Unusual Command Execution**: 
   - There is a `cmd.exe` process executed with the argument to delete specific backup file types:
     ```
     ""cmd.exe"" /c del /s /f /q c:\*.VHD c:\*.bac c:\*.bak c:\*.wbcat c:\*.bkf c:\Backup*.* c:\backup*.* c:\*.set c:\*.win c:\*.dsk
     ```
     - This type of command could be used in data destruction or to cover tracks by removing backups, which is unusual for routine operations and should raise concerns.

2. **Repeated Execution of System Utilities**:
   - Multiple executions of `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` have been observed. Although these are legitimate system utilities, excessive and sequential invocation could indicate reconnaissance or scripting activity by an attacker.

3. **Network Address Use**:
   - In Security Event IDs like 4624 and 4672 related to `admin_test`, there is remote access involving an IP address `192.168.0.102`, indicating a logon type 3 (network). This could be legitimate depending on administrative operations, but logon from unexpected locations merits further investigation.

4. **Repeated High Privilege Process Execution**:
   - Additionally, `Sc.exe` (Service Control Manager) executions indicate starting or modifying services, which might be innocuous but can be part of privilege escalation or persistence if unauthorized.

### Confirmed Malicious Activity:
- Based on the severity and nature of the `del` command aimed at deleting a wide array of backup files, this specific command can be isolated as malicious. It is designed to irreversibly delete data and thus matches patterns of malicious attacks intending to remove safety mechanisms and backups.

### Assessment:
Upon conclusion of these findings, the logs indeed contain indicators of a likely compromise. Given the specific command execution for deleting backups, this activity is considered malicious.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Isolation**: Disconnect and isolate the affected system to prevent further spread or data destruction.
2. **Data Recovery**: Attempt to recover any deleted backups from offline sources, and check if the deletion command succeeded.
3. **Detailed Investigation**: Launch a thorough investigation into the access and presence of remote logon sessions, especially those involving the identified IP address.
4. **Review System Policies**: Audit user permissions and ensure that unnecessary privileges are revoked, particularly focusing on the `admin_test` account.
5. **Incident Response**: Engage your Incident Response team to conduct a comprehensive review and implement corrective measures across your network.
6. **Alert and Monitor**: Enhance monitoring for similar command executions and unauthorized logons moving forward.

This assessment should trigger an action plan to secure your network and prevent future occurrences."
Azure AD - Delete user via Azure CLI,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several areas require attention due to potentially suspicious activity:

### Windows PowerShell Log
- The PowerShell logs reveal an execution of a script to authenticate to Azure (`az login`) and delete a user with the command `az ad user delete --id $userprincipalname`. This action is particularly concerning if it was not executed by an authorized administrator, as it indicates an attempt to remove a user account from an Azure Active Directory environment. Such commands should be monitored closely, and their intent needs verification from the administrator.

### Security Log
- There are logon events (Event ID 4624) and special privileges granted to the SYSTEM account (Event ID 4672). These events by themselves are not unusual, but when occurring in conjunction with potentially unauthorized PowerShell activity, they warrant further inspection.

### Sysmon Log
- The Sysmon logs display several invocations of processes such as `powershell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and others under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. Although process execution like `wevtutil.exe` (an event log management tool) is common, frequent use of PowerShell and `whoami.exe` by a user could signal an attempt to gain more information about the system or to clear logs.
- Specifically, the PowerShell command included in the Sysmon log corroborates with the command seen in the PowerShell logs, confirming that an execution to delete an Azure AD user occurred.

### Application Log
- Routine logs such as those for Edge update services and Software Protection Platform (SPP) are present, showing normal software update activities.

### Overall Assessment

Considering the context and the actions logged:
1. The PowerShell execution to delete an Azure AD user account without explicit administrator tasking is a high-risk action.
2. Utilization of system tools and the PowerShell environment under an administrative account in this manner may indicate inappropriate or malicious use, especially if such patterns are uncommon for the systems administrator team.

Based on these observations, the recommendation is to classify this as **SUSPICIOUS** due to:
- The critical nature of the PowerShell commands executed.
- Potential misuse of administrative privileges.
- The need for further investigation and verification from system administrators to ensure these activities were sanctioned.

### Guidance for Further Action
1. **Verify the Legitimacy**: Confirm with the network or system administrators if these actions were expected and authorized. Check change management logs or tickets for documented activities.
2. **Investigate the User Account**: Analyze who initiated these commands and determine the necessity and legitimacy of the user deletions.
3. **Check for Indicators of Compromise (IOC)**: Run additional scans on the affected machine for any indicators of compromise that could suggest malicious intent.
4. **Audit Azure Directory Logs**: Cross-reference with Azure logs for any anomalies or related suspicious activities across other accounts or services.
5. **Strengthen Security Posture**: Consider enhancing monitoring and alert systems for privileged account activities, and enforce more rigorous PowerShell logging and oversight.

By taking these steps, you can determine whether the suspicious activities represent a potential compromise or unauthorized activity, mitigating further risk to the organization."
Windows - wbadmin Delete systemstatebackup,"Based on the detailed analysis of provided Windows event logs, several observations can be made:

### Analysis:
1. **Time Manipulation:**
   - The logs show several instances of the system time being modified shortly before many of the suspicious activities occur. This is evident from the multiple EventID 4616 from Security logs and corresponding time change logs from the System logs. The time was set back to an earlier timestamp, suggesting an attempt to manipulate time logs which is often a tactic used to hide or obfuscate malicious activities.

2. **Unusual `cmd.exe` Execution:**
   - There is a cmd.exe execution with a command `wbadmin delete systemstatebackup -keepVersions:0`. This command can potentially delete all system state backups, which is suspicious because it removes the ability to restore the system to a previous state. This action is logged as having been executed by `SERVER002\\admin_test` using high privilege access.

3. **Additional Processes Triggered:**
   - Several process creation events (EventID 5) show `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related executables being run multiple times with different command line arguments and from different directories including temporary directories, which is not entirely typical for standard update procedures.
   - Processes like `wevtutil.exe` were executed by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`, which is a legitimate utility for managing event logs but could potentially be used to clear logs or change log configurations.

4. **Suspicious User Activity:**
   - User `admin_test` appears to have privileged rights enabled, with multiple privilege escalation attributes (SeSecurityPrivilege, SeBackupPrivilege, SeRestorePrivilege, etc.) as seen in EventID 4672 in the Security logs. This user's activity includes executing potentially destructive commands and managing log entries which is suspicious.

5. **Processes with High Integrity Levels:**
   - Several high integrity processes related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and system commands such as `whoami.exe` are manually triggered by the user `admin_test`, suggesting an elevated level of access and potentially an attempt to survey or modify the state of the system.

### Assessment:
The combination of time manipulation, potentially destructive commands, and the misuse of privileged access raise several red flags. The attempt to obfuscate logs by adjusting system time, execution of backup deletion commands, and managing event logs all indicate strong signs of malicious behavior.

### Conclusion:
- **Resolution:** MALICIOUS

### Recommendations:
- **Immediate Action:** Investigate the user account `admin_test` for unauthorized access or potential compromise.
- **Incident Response:** Begin incident response protocol to assess the extent of the compromise, especially focusing on data integrity and potential breaches.
- **Log Analysis:** Review and secure all system backup solutions and ensure logs are being transferred and backed up securely off-machine to prevent logging manipulation.
- **Security Hardening:** Implement stronger controls around time synchronization and log management to mitigate future tampering attempts."
Change User Password - Windows,"Upon careful examination of the provided Windows event logs, several key observations stand out, indicating potential security incidents:

### Analysis:
1. **Security Log (Event ID 4728, 4720, 4722, 4738, 4724, 4732)**:
   - **User Account Manipulations**: The logs show a user ""admin_test"" creating a new account ""fileAdministrator,"" enabling it, resetting its password, and modifying attributes. These actions within a short timeframe suggest potential unauthorized account creation or privilege escalation attempts.
   - **Command Execution**: The presence of command-line activity such as adding users and changing passwords (`net user` commands) is typically associated with administrative control and can be a security red flag if performed unexpectedly.

2. **Sysmon Log (Event ID 1, 5)**:
   - **Process Creation & Command Execution**: There is a series of commands executed using `cmd.exe` and `net.exe` initiated by the user ""admin_test"". These include adding and modifying user accounts, which are highly suspicious due to the nature of these commands.
   - **Integrity Level**: The processes run with high integrity levels, indicating elevated privileges, which further raises concern.

3. **System Log**: 
   - **Time Adjustments**: There are multiple instances of time change logs which might be a method to cover tracks in log files to avoid chronological forensic tracking.
   
4. **Application Log**:
   - **Edge Update Activity**: Regular processes associated with Microsoft Edge updates do occur, but if the other suspicious activities are unauthorized, these processes could be involved in obfuscating or exploiting the system.

### Assessment:
The combination of user account creation, password changes, and suspicious command-line execution strongly suggest that this is not routine administrative activity. The rapid succession of account-related events and potential time manipulation imply a security incident, possibly involving unauthorized access.

### Threats and Risks Identified:
- **Unauthorized User Creation**: New user creation and privilege changes indicate possible preparation for persistent access.
- **Account Compromise**: Manipulation of user accounts including password resets under unusual context could be indicative of malicious intent or compromise.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
- **Immediate Action**: Disable or scrutinize the newly created and modified accounts, especially ""fileAdministrator"". Check the legitimacy of the ""admin_test"" user and assess permissions and recent activities.
- **Investigate Source**: Determine the origin of these administrative actions. Review user access logs, network logs, and entry/exit points.
- **Log File Integrity**: Correlate time changes with log entries to check for tampering.
- **Reinforce Security**: Implement multi-factor authentication, audit processes, and increase monitoring to detect insider threats or compromised accounts.

### Resolution:
Based on the detailed examination and evidence of unauthorized user manipulations and suspicious command usage, the resolution is:

- **MALICIOUS** - The logs contain activity that strongly indicates a malicious attempt or breach of system security that warrants immediate action and further investigation."
PureLocker Ransom Note,"Upon analysis of the provided Windows event logs, the following observations have been made:

1. **PowerShell Log:**
   - No log entries were provided under the PowerShell log section. This is a common area to observe for unusual scripts or commands that might indicate malicious activity such as privilege escalation or persistence mechanisms.

2. **Application Log:**
   - The `edgeupdate` service stopped twice in quick succession. While service stopping and starting can be normal, doing so repeatedly in quick succession can sometimes indicate a service being manipulated. However, according to these logs, it doesn't inherently suggest malicious activity without further context.

3. **System Log:**
   - Several events involving time adjustment were noted. The time service appears to sync with `time.windows.com`, which is generally normal behavior. The timestamps and process details align with regular system maintenance and don't highlight any immediate threats.

4. **Security Log:**
   - All Security log events relate to time changes, managed by svchost.exe under the LOCAL SERVICE account. This activity is generally standard during system time synchronization processes and does not raise an immediate red flag for suspicious behavior.

5. **Sysmon Log:**
   - There are entries related to various processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, and `whoami.exe` executed by the `admin_test` account, culminating in a series of executions related to `cmd.exe` with a notable command `/c echo data - Purelocker Ransom Note > %USERPROFILE%\Desktop\YOUR_FILES.txt`. The command to potentially create a ransom note is highly indicative of malicious activity.
   - Several `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes run with different command-line arguments are logged. While frequent invocation of update processes can sometimes be normal, it depends on the context of updates. The logs donâ€™t immediately indicate misuse, but the timing and overlap with potential ransomware indicators could suggest these are being leveraged for obfuscative or misleading purposes.

6. **Other Observations:**
   - There is a series of processes related to Microsoft Edge Update, which appear as part of routine update checks or installations. However, given the potentially malicious entry about a ransomware note created via a command execution, this requires a more cautious approach.
   - svchost.exe is involved in time-change events but operates under expected parameters.

**Assessment and Resolution:**

- **Threats or Risks Identified:**
  - The execution of a command that appears to create a ransom note points to malicious behavior. Coupled with additional process activities related to known Microsoft Edge processes, this requires deeper investigation. 

- **Guidance and Next Steps:**
  - Immediately review the system and user associated with `admin_test` for unauthorized changes or suspect files, especially the Desktop for indicators of ransomware.
  - Analyze network traffic for any indications of data exfiltration or communications to known bad IPs/domains.
  - Ensure system-wide virus or malware scans are conducted to identify any infections.
  - Isolate the potentially affected systems from the network to prevent lateral movement of any malicious actors.
  - Conduct an investigation to understand if similar notes or actions occur on other systems within the environment.

Based on the available information and analysis, the resolution for this investigation is:
- **MALICIOUS** - The logs contain definitive indicators of potentially malicious activity, specifically pointing towards ransomware execution attempts."
Windows - Overwrite file with SysInternals SDelete,"**Analysis of the Logs:**

After carefully reviewing the events in the provided logs, I have identified several activities that warrant attention and further investigation:

1. **Suspicious PowerShell Activities:**
   - There are several PowerShell events with activity that seems aimed at file creation or manipulation: the command `powershell.exe & {if (-not (Test-Path ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\data.txt"")) { New-Item ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\data.txt"" -Force } & ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\script\\script.exe"" -accepteula ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\data.txt""}`.
   - This script appears to be executing another executable named `script.exe` from a non-standard directory which is a common method that malware uses to execute additional payloads.

2. **Unusual Account and Process Activity:**
   - Multiple instances of `taskhostw.exe` accessing user accounts such as `Administrator`, `admin_test`, `DefaultAccount`, `Guest`, and `lplui`. This is captured across events with EventID 4798, which is related to enumerating the accounts for reporting purposes. However, such rapid access could indicate reconnaissance behavior.
   - The creation and execution of processes like `C:\\Windows\\System32\\whoami.exe` and `sc.exe start wuauserv` without clear justification. While `whoami.exe` provides user context, its execution from unexpected locations or without known triggers can be indicative of malicious behavior.

3. **Potential SIEM or Evasion Techniques:**
   - Use of the tool `wevtutil.exe` which is often used to manipulate Windows event logs, could indicate log clearing or event log tampering, which is a common tactic to cover tracks in malicious campaigns.

4. **Unsanctioned Executable Deployments:**
   - Execution of `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\Temp\\EUB183.tmp\\MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` from temporary folders is often seen in evasive techniques or leveraging of third-party software repositories for unintended purposes.

5. **Usage of Sysinternals-like tools:**
   - The secure file deletion tool denoted by `Sysinternals script` in the logs (`script.exe -accepteula`). While not inherently malicious, such tools can be used to irrecoverably delete important files and hide activity.

6. **Excessive Privileges:**
   - Events indicating high-level privileges being requested or processes being started with elevated tokens which could suggest lateral movement or attempts at privilege escalation.

**Assessment and Resolution:**

Based on the above observations, the logs contain several activities that are highly unusual and deviate from normal operational procedures. Particularly the use of scripting, execution of non-standard executable paths, probable log manipulation, and several privilege escalations.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

This activity does not immediately confirm a breach but strongly suggests further investigation is required. A comprehensive review of executed scripts, specific user actions, and any correlating network activity could help in identifying any potential threats.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

- **Conduct a Forensic Investigation:** Collect artifacts like the scripts used in the PowerShell operations, and examine any systems that might have interacted with the identified processes.
- **Audit User Activity:** Focus on unusual account accesses especially those related to `admin_test` and other potentially service accounts.
- **Threat Hunt:** Investigate the processes interacting with `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp` directories and any downloaded files from temporary paths.
- **Employ SIEM Tools:** Use Security Information and Event Management tools to correlate these findings with network logs, file access patterns, and alert on suspicious behavior.
- **Improve System Monitoring:** Ensure logging and monitoring solutions are up-to-date and configured to alert on similar suspicious behavior in the future.

Moving forward, enhanced logging and detection should be implemented to mitigate potential threats identified in these logs."
Windows - Delete Volume Shadow Copies,"After a thorough analysis of the provided Windows event logs, here are the key observations and findings:

1. **Suspicious Command Execution**:
   - The Sysmon logs show the execution of `vssadmin.exe` to list and delete all shadow copies:
     - The command `vssadmin.exe list shadows` was executed with the parent process being PowerShell, indicating a script or command line interaction checking shadow copies.
     - Shortly after, the command `vssadmin.exe delete shadows /all /quiet` was executed through `cmd.exe`.
   - These actions are typical in ransomware attacks where shadow copies are deleted to prevent file recovery. The use of `/quiet` suppresses output, further pointing towards malicious intent.

2. **User and Context**:
   - All activities related to `vssadmin.exe` and other suspicious operations were executed under the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` with a high integrity level.
   - The frequent execution of various system utilities (e.g., `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`) in a short time frame suggests an attempt to gather system information, potentially for lateral movement or further exploitation.

3. **Additional Utilities**:
   - `wevtutil.exe` was executed multiple times, possibly indicating attempts to manipulate or clear event logs, which is a common tactic used to cover tracks.

4. **Edge Update Activity**:
   - The log records regular Microsoft Edge Update operations, which appear routine and consistent with normal software update processes. However, the command executed under this service was benign and unrelated to the suspicious activities.

Despite standard system activities like software updates and system utilities, the repeated use of `vssadmin.exe` to list and delete all shadow copies without any immediate legitimate need stands out as particularly concerning. This combined with execution context under high integrity, indicates a strong possibility of malicious activity.

### Final Assessment:

- **Resolution**: MALICIOUS

**Guidance**:
- Immediately investigate the user account `admin_test` for unauthorized access and any broader compromise.
- Check for other systems that share similar access patterns or users.
- Consider restoring shadow copies using another backup solution, if available.
- Review and strengthen endpoint security configurations to prevent similar occurrences."
Logoff System - Windows,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, I will first discuss the key points and then provide a detailed assessment and resolution.

### Key Observations:
1. **Sysmon Logs and Process Execution**:
   - Multiple instances of familiar Windows tools (`wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `shutdown.exe`, `sppsvc.exe`) were executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
   - There is an execution of `cmd.exe` with the command-line argument ""/c shutdown /l"" by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, suggesting an attempt to log off the user.
   - Several instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes are observed, executed with different command-line parameters (`/update`, `/regsvc`, `/regserver`, `/svc`, `/c`, `/ua`, `/ping`) under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`.

2. **Application Event Logs**:
   - Stopping of the `edgeupdate` service logged.
   - Event recorded by the `Microsoft-Windows-Security-SPP` (Software Protection Platform Service).

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:
- The use of `wevtutil.exe` might be considered suspicious if there are no known administrative activities, as this utility is used to export, archive, or clear event logs and could be used to cover tracks.
- Multiple executions of Microsoft Edge Update components are shown. While not inherently suspicious, Edge updates are typically scheduled operations. If these are unscheduled or with unusual timings, it might require further examination.

### Potential Malicious Activities:
- The simultaneous or rapid execution of administrative consoles and utilities (`wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `shutdown.exe`, `conhost.exe`) potentially implies a scripted or automated task, possibly for benign administration, but also potentially indicative of script-based attacks or remote management actions.
- The presence of a `cmd.exe` command for logging off (`shutdown /l`) under an account designed for administrative actions could potentially be used in scripts to disrupt operations.

### Assessment and Conclusion:
- **Edge Update Events**: Appear as regular update processes but should be confirmed if unexpected updates occurred outside standard schedules.
- **Admin-level Execution**: Given that activities are executed by an admin level user or SYSTEM, and include network-related services (like `sppsvc.exe`), these should be audited to verify authenticity and expected behavior.
- **Rapid Command Execution**: Suggests potential scripting or scheduled task, further monitoring or reviewing scripts and scheduled tasks on the system could be prudent.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance:
- **Further Investigation**: Perform a more detailed forensic analysis, especially focusing on scheduled tasks and scripts executed around the timeframe of these events.
- **Verify Credentials**: Ensure that the `SERVER002\admin_test` account usage and permissions align with expected administrative tasks, and verify if any scripts or tools using this account are authorized.
- **Audit Edge Updates**: Check for legitimate scheduling and execution of Microsoft Edge updates.
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Set up alerts or additional logging for the usage of powerful admin utilities (`wevtutil`, `cmd`, etc.) to catch unexpected usage patterns in the future."
Azure AD - Delete user via Azure AD PowerShell,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several aspects stand out regarding potential suspicious behavior:

1. **Security Log - Event ID 4624 (Logon) and Event ID 4672 (Special Privileges):**
   - There are multiple logon events for the `SYSTEM` account with Logon Type 5, which indicates a service logon. This is generally normal for server processes. The privileges listed include `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeImpersonatePrivilege`, and others that are typically held by high-privilege accounts, which could be of concern if used maliciously, but in context, they appear associated with standard system operations.

2. **Security Log - Event ID 5379 (Credential Manager Operations):**
   - Multiple credential manager events with a return code `3221226021` indicating access denied. This could suggest an application is attempting to access credentials it should not be accessing, but these are associated with `SERVER002$` account trying to query credentials of what appears to be a `MicrosoftAccount`. 

3. **Sysmon Log - EventID 1 and 5 (Process Creation and Termination):**
   - PowerShell execution by `admin_test`, with commands involving Azure AD, e.g., `Connect-AzureAD` and `Remove-AzureADUser`, which may be suspicious if unexpected or unauthorized, as PowerShell is frequently used in attack scenarios.
   - We also observe extensive activity by `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, which is consistent with update processes but should be verified to ensure it isn't used maliciously.

4. **PowerShell Events:**
   - There are PowerShell events indicating the use of `Connect-AzureAD` and an attempt to remove a user from Azure AD, which could indicate a potential attempt to tamper with Azure environments if not expected.

5. **Application Log - Edge Update:**
   - Repeated stopping of `edgeupdate` service typically indicates normal update behavior and matches the sysmon logs, which often show repeated update activity for software like web browsers.

**Summary Assessment and Resolution:**

- The logs show behavior that aligns with legitimate services and updates on a Windows Server (including tasks related to Microsoft Edge Updates and the Software Protection Platform).

- The notable exception is the PowerShell activity conducted by `admin_test` involving Azure AD. If this activity was unauthorized or unexpected, it suggests reconnaissance or account manipulation.

- Given the context, if the PowerShell activities were unexpected, this could categorize the actions as **SUSPICIOUS** due to potential for unauthorized credential and Azure environment manipulation.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Recommendations for Further Action:**
- Verify whether the PowerShell activity conducted under `admin_test` is legitimate and authorized, as unauthorized changes in Azure environments can lead to compromise.
- Check if the account `admin_test` is authorized to execute such commands and whether the executed commands align with normal operational procedures.
- Monitor and review logs for other signs of anomalous behavior related to privilege usage or unauthorized script execution to corroborate or negate these findings. 

- It is advisable to ensure that PowerShell logging and monitoring are enabled to capture detailed command-line activities for future investigations."
Windows - Stop service using net.exe,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs, here are my findings and analysis:

### System Logs
- **Time Synchronization Events**: There are several events related to time adjustments (Event ID 1 and 24) logged by `svchost.exe`, which handles the Windows Time service. The time adjustment seems to be syncing with `time.windows.com`. This behavior is expected from a system keeping its time accurately up to date; there isn't a significant timezone offset or anomaly.
  
### Sysmon Logs
- **Process Executions**:
  - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are noted, which donâ€™t immediately suggest anomalous behavior.
  - The execution of `cmd.exe` with the command `net.exe stop spooler` is indicative of stopping a service. Service control, particularly stopping the print spooler, can be used in attack vectors to disable security mechanisms or as part of lateral movement efforts. The context around `net.exe stop spooler` usage is worth investigating further to understand why this service was stopped and if it aligns with standard operational procedures.
  
### Application Logs
- The logs reflect standard service operations like stopping the `edgeupdate` service. No anomalies detected in this behavior as services can stop and start based on system needs or patch updates.

### Security Logs
- **Time Change Event ID 4616**: Reflects the system time change logged in the System logs. These entries align with the expected activities for time synchronization.
- **Logon Sessions (Event ID 4624 and 4672)**: Indicate successful logins of a user, `admin_test`, via an NTLM process from a remote system with elevated privileges. The use of NTLM over network logon and possession of extensive privileges like SeDebugPrivilege and SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege warrants a review of the necessity and legitimacy of such privileges for the user in question.

### Conclusion
- **SUSPICIOUS**: Although most activities, such as time synchronization and edge updates, appear benign, the stopping of the print spooler service raises a caution flag. Additionally, `admin_test` user activity (e.g., elevated privileges and remote network logons using NTLM) needs further verification. These could be normal administrative activities but warrant further investigation due to potential abuse in compromising scenarios.

### Recommended Actions
1. **Investigate User Activities**: Verify whether `admin_test` is authorized for the actions observed, especially the reason behind stopping the spooler service. Check if similar patterns have been previously noted in historical data.
2. **Check for Other Indicators of Compromise**: Run checks against known threat databases for additional activities linked to stopping services.
3. **Review Access Control**: Ensure that users have the appropriate level of access necessary for their roles without excessive privileges, particularly the admin_test user.
4. **Monitor Ongoing Activities**: Set up alerts to notify security teams of any unusual activities such as further unauthorized service stoppages or privilege escalations.

This assessment should assist in ascertaining whether the activities seen are permissible or indicative of a potential security breach."
